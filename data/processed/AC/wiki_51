The type specimen, recovered in 1971 from the Javelina Formation of Texas, United States, consists of several wing fragments and was described as Quetzalcoatlus northropi in 1975 by Douglas Lawson. The generic name refers to the Aztec serpent god of the sky, Quetzalc\u014d\u0101tl, while the specific name honors Jack Northrop, designer of a tailless fixed-wing aircraft. The remains of a second species were found between 1972 and 1974, also by Lawson, around from the \"Q. northropi\" locality. In 2021, these remains were assigned to the name Quetzalcoatlus lawsoni by Brian Andres and (posthumously) Wann Langston Jr., as part of a series of publications on the genus.\n\"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\" has gained fame as a candidate for the largest flying animal ever discovered, though estimating its size has been difficult due to the fragmentary nature of the only known specimen. While wingspan estimates over the years have ranged from , more recent estimates hover around . Previously, smaller azhdarchid specimens were referred to the species \"Q. lawsoni\", though other researchers have questioned the placement of this species within the genus.\nHistorical interpretations of the diet of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" have ranged from scavenging to skim-feeding like the modern skimmer bird. However, more recent research has found that it most likely hunted small prey on the ground, in a similar way to storks and ground hornbills. This has been dubbed the terrestrial stalking hypothesis and is thought to be a common feeding behavior among large azhdarchids. On the other hand, the disputed second species, 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", appears to have been associated with alkaline lakes, and a diet of small aquatic invertebrates has been suggested. Similarly, while \"Q. northropi\" is speculated to have been fairly solitary, 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" appears to have been highly gregarious (social). Azhdarchids like \"Quetzalcoatlus\" were highly terrestrial by pterosaur standards, though even the largest were nonetheless capable of flight. Based on the work of Mark P. Witton and Michael Habib in 2010, it now seems likely that pterosaurs, especially larger taxa such as \"Quetzalcoatlus\", launched quadrupedally (from a four-legged posture), using the powerful muscles of their forelimbs to propel themselves off the ground and into the air.\nResearch history and taxonomy.\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe genus \"Quetzalcoatlus\" is based on fossils discovered in rocks pertaining to the Late Cretaceous Javelina Formation in Big Bend National Park, Texas. Remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life had been found in the area since the beginning of the 20th century. The first \"Quetzalcoatlus\" fossils were discovered in 1971 by the graduate student Douglas A. Lawson while conducting field work for his Master's degree project on the paleoecology of the Javelina Formation. This field work was supervised by Wann Langston Jr., an experienced paleontologist who had been doing field work in the region since 1938 and since 1963 led expeditions through his position as curator at the Texas Science and Natural History Museum. The two had first visited the park together in March 1970, with Lawson discovering the first \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" fossil from Texas. Returning in 1971, Lawson discovered a bone while investigating an arroyo on the western edge of the park, and returned to Austin with a section of it. He and Langston then identified it as a pterosaur fossil based on its hollow internal structure with thin walls. Returning in November 1971 for further excavations, they were struck by the unprecedented size of the remains compared to known pterosaurs. The initial material consisted of a giant radius and ulna, two fused wristbones known as syncarpals, and the end of the wing finger. Altogether, the material comprised a partial left wing from an individual (specimen number TMM 41450-3) later estimated at over in wingspan. Lawson described the remains in his 1972 thesis as \"Pteranodon gigas\", and diagnosed it as being \"nearly twice as large as any previously described species of \"Pteranodon\"\". As a thesis is not recognized as a published work by the International Code for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), \"Pteranodon gigas\" is not a valid name. Further field work at the site was conducted in March 1973, when fragments were found alongside a long and delicate bone connected to an apparently larger element. This fossil was left in the ground until April 1974, when they fully excavated the larger element, a humerus. Due to the close association of discovered remains, Langston felt confident there were nothing more to be found at the site. Several later excavations of the site have indeed been unsuccessful.\nLawson announced his discovery in the journal \"Science\" in March 1975, with a depiction of the animal's size compared to a large aircraft and a \"Pteranodon\" gracing the cover of the issue. Lawson wrote that it was \"without doubt the largest flying animal presently known\". He illustrated and briefly described the remains known at the time, but did not offer a name and indicated that a more extensive description was in preparation that would diagnose the species. In May, he submitted a short response to his original paper to the journal, considering how such an enormous animal could have flown. Within the paper, he briefly established the name \"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\", but did still not provide a diagnosis or a more detailed description, which would later cause nomenclatural problems. Though not specified in the original publication, Lawson named the genus after the Aztec feathered serpent god Quetzalc\u014d\u0101tl, while the specific name honors John Knudsen Northrop, the founder of Northrop Corporation, who drove the development of large tailless Northrop YB-49 aircraft designs resembling \"Quetzalcoatlus\". The discovery of the giant pterosaur left a strong impression on both the scientific community and the general public, and was reported on throughout the world. It was featured in Time Magazine and appeared on the cover of Scientific American in 1981 alongside an article on pterosaurs by Langston. The species would become referenced by over 500 scientific publications, with \"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\" becoming the single most cited pterosaur species and \"Quetzalcoatlus\" the fourth most cited pterosaur genus after \"Pteranodon\", \"Rhamphorhynchus\", and \"Pterodactylus\", much older genera with many more species than \"Quetzalcoatlus\".\nPrior to the announcement of the discovery, Langston had returned to Big Bend with a group of fossil preparators in February 1973, primarily aiming to excavate bones of the dinosaur \"Alamosaurus\". One of the preparators, a young man named Bill Amaral who went on to be a respected field worker, had been skipping his lunches to conduct additional explorations of the area. He came across some additional fragments of pterosaur bone on a different portion of the ridge, around 50 kilometers away from the original site. Two more new sites quickly followed nearby, producing many fragments which the crew figured could be fit back together, in addition to a complete carpal and intact wing bone. Langston noted in his field notes that none of these bones suggested animals as large as Lawson's original specimen. Further remains came from Amaral's first site in April 1974, after Lawson's site had been exhausted; a long neck vertebra and a pair of jawbones appeared. Associated structures were initially hoped to represent filamentous pycnofibres, but were later confirmed to be conifer needles. Near the end of the 1974 season, Langston stumbled over a much more complete pterosaur skeleton; it consisted of a wing, multiple vertebrae, a femur and multiple other long bones. They lacked time to fully excavate it, leaving it in the ground until the next field season. This area, where many smaller specimens began to emerge, came to be known as Pterodactyl Ridge. Two of the smaller individuals were reported in the first 1975 paper by Lawson, presumed to belong to the same species, though Langston would begin to question the idea they belonged to \"Q. northropi\" by the early 1980s. Excavations continued in 1976, and eight new specimens emerged in 1977; in 1979, despite complications due to losing the field notes from 1977, Langston discovered another new site that would produce an additional ten specimens. Most importantly, a humerus of the smaller animal was finally found, which Langston considered of great importance to understanding \"Quetzalcoatlus\". Several further new localities followed in 1980, but 1981 proved less successful and Langston began to suspect the ridge may have been mostly depleted of pterosaur fossils. There was similarly little success in 1982, and visits during 1983 and 1985 proved to provide the last substantive discoveries of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" fossils. Langston returned in 1989, 1991, 1992, and 1996, but only found isolated bones and fragments. Eventually a handful of additional specimens were discovered by former student Thomas Lehman. A visit to Lawson's initial site during 1991 showed that all traces of excavation had by now eroded away. Langston would visit Big Bend for the last time in 1999, having concluded the pterosaur expeditions to focus on the excavation of two skulls of \"Deinosuchus\", another famous fossil of the area.\nLater research.\nThe expected further description implicated by Lawson never came. For the next 50 years, the material would remain under incomplete study, and few concrete anatomical details were documented within the literature. Much confusion surrounded the smaller individuals from Pterodactyl Ridge. In a 1981 article on pterosaurs, Langston expressed reservations whether they were truly the same species as the immense \"Q. northropi\". In the meantime, Langston focused on the animal's publicity. He worked on a life-sized gliding replica of \"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\" with aeronautical engineer Paul MacCready between 1981 and 1985, promoting it in a dedicated IMAX film. The model was created to understand the flight of the animal \u2014 prior to Lawson's discovery such a large flier wasn't thought possible, and the subject remained controversial at the time. Furthermore, the model was intended to allow people to experience the animal in a more dynamic manner than a mere static display or film. Around this time he also created a skeletal mount of the genus that was exhibited at the Texas Memorial Museum.\nThe next scientific effort of note was a 1996 paper by Langston and pterosaur specialist Alexander Kellner. By this time, Langston was confident the smaller animals were a separate species. A full publication establishing such a species was still in preparation at the time, but due to the importance of the skull material for the understanding of azhdarchid anatomy, the skull anatomy was published first. In this publication, the animal was referred to as \"Quetzalcoatlus\" sp., a placeholder designation for material not assigned to any particularly valid species. Once again, the planned further publication failed to materialize for decades, and \"Quetzalcoatlus\" sp. remained in limbo. A publication on the bioaeromechanics of the genus was also planned by Langston and James Cunningham, but this failed to materialize and the partially completed manuscript later became lost. Ultimately, a comprehensive publication on \"Quetzalcoatlus\" sp. would not appear before Langston's death in 2013. By this point he had produced many notes and individual descriptions, but had not begun writing any formal manuscript that could be published.\nIn 2021, a comprehensive description of the genus was finally published, the 19th entry in the Memoir series of special publications by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in the \"Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology\". It consisted of five studies published together. Kevin Padian was the primary organizer of the project. A paper on the history of discoveries in Big Bend National Park was authored by Matthew J. Brown, Chris Sagebiel, and Brian Andres. It focused on curating a comprehensive list of specimens belonging to each species to \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and the locality information of each within Big Bend. Thomas Lehman contributed a study on the paleonvironment that \"Quetzalcoatlus\" would have resided within, based upon work he had begun with Langston as early as 1993. Brian Andres published a study on the morphology and taxonomy of the genus, established species \"Quetzalcoatlus lawsoni\" for the smaller animal that had gone for decades without a name. The specific name honoured Lawson, who discovered \"Quetzalcoatlus\". Despite not contributing directly to the written manuscript, the authors of the memoir and Langston's family agreed that he posthumously be considered a co-author due the basis of the work in the decades of research he dedicates to the subject. Also authored by Andres was a phylogenetic study of \"Quetzacoatlus\" and its relationships within Pterosauria, with a focus on the persistence of many lineages into the Late Cretaceous contra classical interpretations of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" as the last of a dying lineage. Finally, a study on the functional morphology of the genus was authored by Padian, James Cunningham, and John Conway (who contributed scientific illustrations and cover art to the Memoir), with Langston once again considered a posthumous co-author due to his foundational work on the subject. Brown and Padian prefaced the Memoir, and once again emphasized their gratitude to Langston for his decades of work on the animal leading up to the publication.\nTaxonomy and material.\nThough the name \"Quetzalcoatlus\" was introduced in 1975, the lack of a formal description complicated its validity for several decades. The oldest name for the species is \"\"Pteranodon\" gigas\", from Lawson's 1973 thesis. However, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) does not consider a thesis to be a formal publication capable of establishing of a taxon, and the name has not been used since. Regarding the genus \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and species \"Q. northropi\", the name being established in a separate publication than the anatomical diagnosis also failed ICZN standards. As such, it was argued that the name was a \"nomen nudum\", an intended but invalid scientific name, though some authors argued the second publication referencing the initial description was sufficient. The species received a diagnosis in a 1991 paper by Lev Nessov, but no action was taken to formalize the name. Furthermore, a study by Mark Witton and colleagues in 2010 doubted whether \"Quetzalcoatlus\" could be validly diagnosed at all. They noted that the bones preserved in the holotype of \"Q. northropi\" were not typically considered to be taxonomically informative between close relatives, and that they appeared extremely similar to those of other giant azhdarchids such as the Romanian azhdarchid \"Hatzegopteryx\". Both of these issues were settled in the 2021 paper, whose rediagnosis affirmed \"Quetzalcoatlus\" as distinct. The authors agreed that the original paper did not constitute a valid establishment of the name. The authors noted their publication could serve as the a basis for the name, but did not wish to change the previously presumed authorship of the name. Thus, they submitted an application for the ICZN in 2017 to make an exception to the requirements, and had Lawson's second 1975 paper to be declared as the valid authority of the genus and species. The approval of this ICZN petition on August 30, 2019, conserved and formalized the binomen \"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\" as the type species.\nThe name-bearing type specimen of \"Q. northropi\" is TMM 41450-3, a partial wing. It includes a humerus, radius, ulna, wrist bones, finger bones, and many elements of the elongate wing finger, in addition to thousands of unidentifiable fragments. It is from the uppermost rocks of the Javelina Formation, making it one of the youngest pterosaur specimens known. Only a single other specimen can confidently be assigned to the same species, a left ulna designated TMM 44036-1 known from the Black Peaks Formation, around three quarters the size of the type specimen and sharing distinctive anatomy. Four other specimens share a similarly giant size, but cannot be definitively assigned to \"Q. northropi\" in lack of overlapping material or distinguishing anatomical regions. TMM 41047-1 and TMM 41398-3, are both partial femurs, the former twice the size of that seen in 'Q'. \"lawsoni\". Their anatomy indicates they belonged to the same species, and is distinct from that of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\". Part of a wing finger, TMM 41398-4, is also of the correct size to belong to \"Q. northropi\" but does not preserve the essential anatomy to confirm its identity. This specimen and the smaller femur were the first two specimens Lawson discovered, prior to uncovering the type specimen. Finally, one of the oldest pterosaur specimens in Big Bend is a giant cervical vertebra not matching that of smaller species from the formation. Whilst conventional pterosaur research would assign all of these to \"Q. northropi\", the 2021 redescription preferred to be cautious and merely assigned them to \"Q.\" cf. \"northropi\", indicating uncertainty.\nThe assignment of remains to \"Q. lawsoni\" has proved more simplistic; a large quantity of similar remains were found together in nearby sites, 50\u00a0km from the \"Q. northropi\" locality. In total, 305 different fossil elements from 214 specimens are known, all of which are considered consistent with assignment to the same species. This is the most amount of remains assigned to any singular species of pterosaur. The vast majority of the dozens of specimens are disarticulated individual bones. A few individual animals are, however, represented by associated remains; identification of these individuals was complicated by each bone being catalogued under a separate number, which was revised as part of the 2021 study. The most complete specimen is TMM 41961-1, which possesses the most complete skull as well as several neck vertebrae, much of both wings, femurs, tibiotarsi, two metatarsals, and one of the toe bones. It was one of the original specimens described by Langston in 1975, and in accordance with Langston's wishes and its completeness was designated as the type specimen. Two less complete specimens, TMM 42180-14 and TMM 42161-1, were also preserved in partial articulation, the former mostly composed of limb and neck bones whilst the latter consists of neck and skull bones. Beyond this, identification of individual specimens is difficult. Two other specimens are more loosely associated, and others may have belonged to a single individual but are too weathered to identify with confidence. In some cases two or three neck vertebrae were found in presumed association, and similar loose associations of one or two limbs bones are seen in several cases. Taken together, nearly the entirely skeleton is represented, with the exception of some of the back of the skull. Eight different specimens preserve various portions of the skull, together allowing for a rather complete picture (excepting a portion of the back of the skull), and similarly the entire mandible is represented when cross-referencing four specimens. All nine neck vertebrae are known, and most torso vertebrae are known through the preservation of the notarium and synsacrum, structures consisting of several fused vertebrae in ornithocheiroid pterosaurs; it is unknown how many unfused vertebrae may have existed between these structures. Every single bone in the arm is known from at least one complete specimen, and the hindlimbs and pelvis are also more or less all present, though the femur and pelvis suffer from poor preservation. In 2025, \"Quetzalcoatlus\" was suggested to be polyphyletic with 'Quetzalcoatlus' \"lawsoni\" not being sister to \"Quetzalcoatlus nothropi\".\nOther assigned and reclassified material.\nThough most pterosaur remains from Big Bend have been assigned to \"Quetzalcoatlus\", some other material exists. Most prominent amongst these is a specimen discovered around north of the Pterodactyl Ridge localities, designated as TMM 42489-2 and compromising a partial skull and jaws as well as five articulated neck vertebrae. It was immediately noted for its distinct shorted-jawed anatomy compared to what had come to be expected from 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" specimens. Despite this distinctiveness, it was assigned to as a separate \"Quetzalcoatlus sp.\" in a 1991 book by Langston. As early as 1996, however, this was revised with recognition it was certainly a new genus informally known as the \"short-faced pterosaur\". It was formally named in the 2021 paper alongside 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", as the genus \"Wellnhopterus\". In addition to this specimen, several indeterminate azhdarchid remains and some remains too fragmentary to assign beyond Pterosauria are known from Big Bend. Some of these represent smaller animals than the uniformly sized 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" remains. Whether any of these remains represented separate animals from \"Quetzalcoatlus\" cannot be determined.\nSeveral specimens from across Late Cretaceous North America were historically assigned to \"Quetzalcoatlus\". In 1982 a femur from the Campanian aged Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada was assigned to the genus by Philip J. Currie and Dale Russell. Currie later described further remains from Dinosaur Park in a 2005 book, noting their morphological similarity to \"Quetzalcoatlus\" but expressing caution against referral to the genus. In 2019, however, all azhdarchid remains from the formation were revised as distinct from \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and named as the new genus \"Cryodrakon\". A humerus from the Two Medicine Formation in Montana was also provisionally assigned to the genus; it was considered an indeterminate azhdarchid or a specimen of \"Montanazhdarcho\" by subsequent studies. A neck vertebra from the Hell Creek Formation, also from Montana but dating to the Maastrichtian, was discovered in 2002 and initially assigned in 2006 to \"Quetzalcoatlus\". The 2021 paper merely considered it an azhdarchiform specimen of uncertain affinities, but the 2025 study named it as the holotype of a distinct genus \"Infernodrakon\".\nAnother neck vertebra, discovered in the similarly aged Lance Formation in Wyoming and first described in 1964, was later assigned to \"Quetzalcoatlus\" by Brent H. Breithaupt in 1982; later studies assigned it to \"Azhdarcho\" or an indeterminate azhdarchid or azhdarchiform. The 2025 \"Infernodrakon\" study found it to be distinguishable from that taxon, but anatomically compatible with 'Q'. \"lawsoni\"; when tested in a phylogenetic analysis, they found it to form a polytomy with 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", \"Q. northropi\", and a Moroccan specimen. Therefore, they considered it plausible it belonged to a small 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" individual, but decided to merely make a tentative referral to \"Quetzalcoatlus\" at the genus level due to the incomplete nature of the specimen. The Moroccan specimen, from the Ouled Abdoun Basin (Maastrichtian), is designated as FSAC-OB 14 and was assigned to aff. \"Quetzalcoatlus\" by a 2018 study. This indicates it is considered unlikely to belong to the genus but bears extreme anatomical similarity to it.\nDescription.\n\"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\" was among the largest azhdarchids, though was rivalled in size by \"Arambourgiania\" and \"Hatzegopteryx\" (and possibly \"Cryodrakon\"). Azhdarchids were split into two primary categories: short-necked taxa with short, robust beaks (i.e. \"Hatzegopteryx\" and \"Wellnhopterus\"), and long-necked taxa with longer, slenderer beaks (i.e. \"Zhejiangopterus\"). \"Quetzalcoatlus\" falls squarely into the latter category. Based on the limb morphology of 'Q.' \"lawsoni\", related azhdarchids such as \"Zhejiangopterus\", and pterosaurs at large, in addition to azhdarchid tracks from South Korea, \"Quetzalcoatlus\" was likely quadrupedal. As a pterosaur, \"Quetzalcoatlus\" would have been covered in hair-like filaments called pycnofibres, and had extensive wing-membranes, which would have been distended by a long wing-finger. There have been various models of the morphology of pterodactyloid wings, though based on multiple well-preserved pterosaur specimens, it is likely that azhdarchids had broad wings, with a membrane called the brachiopatagium extending from the tip of the wing finger to the outer side of each ankle. The aspect ratio of azhdarchid wings is 8.1, similar to that of storks and birds of prey that engage in static soaring, meaning they are reliant on thermals, updrafts, and other air currents to gain altitude through lift and remain aloft.\nSize.\n\"Quetzalcoatlus\" is regarded as one of the largest pterosaurs, though its exact size has been difficult to determine. In 1975, Douglas Lawson compared the wing bones of \"Q. northropi\" to equivalent elements in \"Dsungaripterus\" and \"Pteranodon\" and suggested that it represented an individual with a wingspan of around , or, alternatively, or . Estimates put forward in subsequent years varied dramatically, ranging from , owing to differences in methodology. Among the supporters of the initial size estimates was Robert T. Bakker, who, in his 1988 book \"The Dinosaur Heresies\", contended that \"Quetzalcoatlus\" may indeed have reached the upper estimates, and that it may have remained flighted by altering its method of flapping. Other estimates contemporary to Bakker's, however, consistently supported a smaller size of . More recent estimates based on greater knowledge of azhdarchid proportions place its wingspan at . This would approach the maximum size possible for azhdarchids, estimated at ; while higher wingspans may technically be possible, they would require significant morphological changes, and the animal would struggle to become airborne due to increased strain on its joints and long bones. In one paper from the 2021 Memoir which redescribed \"Quetzalcoatlus\", 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" was estimated to have a wingspan of around . In 2002, Gregory S. Paul estimated a wingspan of for specimen TMM 41961-1, while in 2022, he suggested that 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" had a somewhat larger wingspan of around and a body length, measured from the beak tip to the end of the tail, of . Large azhdarchids such as \"Q. northropi\" have been estimated to have a shoulder height of about ; the head may have been held at a height of more than , similar to that of an extant giraffe.\nBody mass estimates for \"Quetzalcoatlus\" have, similarly, been historically variable. Mass estimates for giant azhdarchids are problematic because no existing species shares a similar size or body plan, and in consequence, published results vary widely. Crawford Greenewalt gave mass estimates of between for \"Q. northropi\", with the former figure assuming a small wingspan of , and the latter assuming a far larger wingspan of . In 2002, Gregory S. Paul noted that the lighter body masses are physically impossible, as the flight muscles alone in \"Q. northropi\" would weigh more than a human, and offered a larger estimate of . In 2010, Donald M. Henderson recovered the body mass of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" at , twice that of other contemporary estimates, citing it as evidence for secondary flightlessness in the genus. However, the vast majority of estimates published since the 2000s have hovered around , due largely to a greater understanding of how aberrant the anatomy of azhdarchids was in comparison to other pterosaur clades. In 2021, Kevin Padian and colleagues estimated that \"Q. northropi\" would have weighed around , and that 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" would have weighed ; Gregory S. Paul estimated higher body masses of kg for 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" specimen TMM 41691-1 in 2002, and twenty years later, gave a higher estimate of .\n'Quetzalcoatlus' \"lawsoni\".\nMuch of what has been said regarding \"Quetzalcoatlus nothropi\" was informed from the now-separate species 'Q'. \"lawsoni\". Henry Thomas and Skye N. McDavid, in 2025, performed a revision of Azhdarchomorpha which recovered \"Quetzalcoatlus\" as polyphyletic, with 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" not clading with the type species \"Q\". \"nothropi\".\nSkull.\nComplete skulls are not known from \"Quetzalcoatlus\". Reconstructions of its skull anatomy therefore typically draw from eight separate 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" specimens which preserve skull elements. Based on the length of the mandible (lower jaw), the skull of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" likely measured about in length. The distance between the condyloid (articular) processes of the mandible is around . The ratio between the length of the skull and the length of the average dorsal (back) vertebra is very high in 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", and is surpassed only by \"Pteranodon\" and \"Tupuxuara\".\nLike other azhdarchids, 'Quetzalcoatlus' \"lawsoni\" had a long, slender, toothless beak, with a gape of around 52 degrees. It was constructed from the premaxilla and maxilla on the upper jaw, and the dentary on the lower jaw. Beak tips are not preserved in any specimen, so it is not clear whether its tip was sharp or had some other morphology, such as a keel. Both the skull and the dentary had a slight sinusoidal curve, which may also be present in \"Hatzegopteryx\". The mandibular symphyses would have widened slightly as the jaw opened, slightly separating the mandibles, which has led to suggestions that some sort of gular pouch was present. While this has led to comparisons with pelicans, the degree of lateral (sideways) motion seen in 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" was far lower. At the base of the beak, formed from the premaxilla, was a crest, referred to by some authors as a sagittal crest. A premaxillary crest is also observed in \"Wellnhopterus\", though is smaller and more anterior. The exact form of the crest in 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" has yet to be determined, due to the poor preservation of the rear half of all specimen's skulls. Based on what is preserved, two distinct morphotypes have been suggested: one with a square sagittal crest and a tall nasoantorbital fenestra, and one with a more semicircular sagittal crest and a shorter nasoantorbital fenestra. Additionally, one morphotype is larger than the other, and has a proportionally shorter beak. Despite their differences, both share the diagnostic traits of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", and are considered the same species. The reason for there being two morphotypes is unclear, though it may correlate to individual variation, ontogeny, or sexual dimorphism.\nThe nasoantorbital fenestra, a massive opening found in many pterosaurs which combined the nasal cavity (which housed the external nostril) and antorbital fenestra, was very large in 'Q.'. \"lawsoni\", occupying about a third of the total length of the skull. In the largest specimen, TMM 41961-1.1, it measured in length and in height. 'Q'. \"lawsoni\"'s choanae (internal nostrils) were confluent and anteriorly expanded, meaning that they were essentially fused and expanded towards the front, and formed a fenestra; in TMM 41961-1.1, they are long enough to occupy around twenty percent of the total length of the skull. The orbit was small and obovate, resembling an inverted egg in shape. It was fairly low on the skull, similar to other azhdarchoids, like tapejarids. Like in other pterosaurs, the orbit was likely positioned in a way that would have allowed 'Q' \"lawsoni\" to see both forwards and directly to the sides, giving it a degree of stereoscopic vision. By turning its head and neck, it could achieve a 180-degree field of vision.\nA lacrimal bone is preserved in only one 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" specimen, though it is fragmentary. It formed part of the anterodorsal (front upper) margin of the orbit, and the posterodorsal (rear upper) margin of the nasoantorbital fenestra. The jugal bone was triradiate \u2014 meaning it branched in three directions \u2014 with a maxillary process that was rodlike and formed the lateral margin of the subtemporal fenestra, an opening on the palate. 'Quetzalcoatlus' \"lawsoni\" and other azhdarchids had unusually thick jugals among pterosaurs, which may have strengthened the skull in a way that enabled the beak's use in agonistic (fighting) behaviors; while this was most applicable to more robust-skulled genera such as \"Hatzegopteryx\", Darren Naish and Mark Witton suggested in 2013 that this may have been true of most, if not all azhdarchids. In all 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" specimens, the palate, consisting of the contact between the maxillae, palatines, and pterygoids, is badly crushed, to the point where it is mostly visible in lateral view. It has been suggested that openings in the palate were for a vomeronasal (Jacobson's) organ, though this may simply be an artefact of the confluence of those bones. The quadrate bone of TMM 42422-30 has three small, oval-shaped openings on its posterior surface, not seen in other pterosaurs; as these are not present in other specimens, these may be puncture wounds.\nSkeleton.\nLike other pterosaurs, \"Quetzalcoatlus\" had light, hollow bones, supported internally by struts called trabeculae. The neck of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", measured from the third cervical (neck) vertebra to the seventh, has been estimated at . It consisted of nine elongated vertebrae, which were procoelous, meaning that they were concave at the front. All of them were compressed dorsoventrally (top to bottom), and were better suited for dorsoventral motion than lateral (side-to-side) motion. However, the lateral range of motion was still extensive, and the neck and head could swing left and right in an arc of about 180 degrees. Like in other azhdarchoids, the cervical vertebrae were low, with neural arches that were essentially inside the centrum. In most azhdarchids, the neural spine of the seventh cervical vertebra was fairly long. This was not the case in 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", where the neural spine was shorter. Internally, the cervical vertebrae were supported by trabeculae that increased their buckling load substantially (about 90%). This may have been an adaptation for counteracting shear forces exerted on the neck while in flight, though may have also enabled agonistic neck-bashing behaviors like those seen in giraffes. While airborne, the neck of \"Q. northropi\" would have likely assumed a slight S-shaped curve, similar to swans.\nSimilar to other azhdarchids, the torso of 'Quetzalcoatlus' \"lawsoni\" was proportionally small, about half as long again as the humerus. The vertebrae at the base of the neck and the pectoral (shoulder) girdle are poorly known. The first four dorsal (back) vertebrae are fused into a notarium, like in some other pterosaurs and birds, and particularly ornithocheiroids. The notarium supported the shoulder girdle during flight, and prevented the ribcage from being compressed by the wing muscles during each stroke. The vertebral count of the notarium is unlike \"Zhejiangopterus\", which had six notarial vertebrae, but like \"Azhdarcho\". Most other dorsal vertebrae are absent, except for three which had been integrated into the sacrum. Around seven dorsal vertebrae were free of the notarium and sacrum. Four true sacral vertebrae are preserved, though there were likely seven in all. No caudal (tail) vertebrae are preserved in any \"Quetzalcoatlus\" specimens.\n'Quetzalcoatlus' \"lawsoni\"'s scapulocoracoid \u2014 a fusion of the scapula and coracoid bones \u2014 was U-shaped and broad. Throughout azhdarchid evolution, the scapula had been reducing in length, and this reached its pinnacle in 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", where the scapula was only slightly longer than the coracoid. The sternum, like that of other pterosaurs, was broad. It had a transverse ridge on its posterior (rear) portion, also observed in \"Pteranodon\", albeit it was further forward in that genus. Like other pterosaurs, the bone walls of the sternum were very thin, and in the case of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", they were as little as thick. 'Quetzalcoatlus' \"lawsoni\" (presumably \"Quetzalcoatlus nothropi\") and other azhdarchids have forelimb and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running ungulate mammals than to members of other pterosaur clades, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and robust, with considerable mobility. The two species had different humerus morphology, with \"Q. lawsoni\"'s humerus having a proportionally shorter deltopectoral crest, and \"Q. northropi\"'s being shaped more like a twisted hourglass. The ulna of \"Q. northropi\" was relatively shorter than that of \"Q. lawsoni\", measuring 1.36 times the length of the humerus, as opposed to 1.52 times the length of the humerus in \"Q. lawsoni\" and other azhdarchiforms. Like all pterosaurs, \"Quetzalcoatlus\" had a specialized carpal (wrist) bone, the pteroid, which attached to the sesamoid bone of the wrist. It faced inwards, pointing towards the deltopectoral crest, and supported the propatagium. Specialized muscles allowed it to move slightly. The first digit was the smallest, and the third was almost the biggest digit that routinely contacted the ground. As with all pterosaurs, the wing finger was considerably longer than the others. It did not contact the ground, as evidenced by footprints. Whilst on land, it may have been held between the elbow and the torso. The wings were short and broad, and forelimb musculature was extensive. Flapping power came from several muscle groups on the torso, forearm and manus (hand).\nTypically for a pterosaur, the pelvis of \"Q. lawsoni\" consists of an ilium, pubis and ischium that had fused into a single unit, articulating anteroventrally (towards the front, at the bottom) with the prepubis, a small bone that sat before the pubis and likely helped support the abdominal cavity during respiration. The pelvis of one \"Q. lawsoni\" specimen (TMM 41954-57) is large compared to that of other specimens, with deep posterior emargination and no preserved symphisis. This suggests that \"Q. lawsoni\" exhibited sexual dimorphism, similar to that suggested for other monofenestratans (i.e. \"Darwinopterus, Anhanguera\" and \"Nyctosaurus\"). The femur (thigh bone) was significantly more gracile than the humerus, though was still among the most robust bones in \"Q. lawsoni\"'s skeleton. Based on \"Zhejiangopterus\", the humerus was around eighty percent of the length of the tibiotarsus. Azhdarchids overall had fairly narrow feet, no longer than 30% of the length of the tibia, which may have borne fleshy pads similar to those of tapejarids. They were plantigrade, meaning that they walked with the sole of the foot flat on the ground. 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" possessed well-developed pedal (foot) unguals, which supported moderately curved claws, shorter and slightly straighter than those of tapejarids.\nClassification.\nWhen describing \"Quetzalcoatlus\" in 1975, Douglas Lawson and Crawford Greenewalt opted not to assign it to a clade more specific than Pterodactyloidea, though comparisons with \"Arambourgiania\" (then \"Titanopteryx\") from Jordan had been drawn earlier that year. In 1984, Lev Alexandrovich Nessov erected the subfamily Azhdarchinae within Pteranodontidae to contain \"Azhdarcho\", \"Quetzalcoatlus\", and \"Titanopteryx\". Unaware of that subfamily, in the same year, Kevin Padian erected the family Titanopterygiidae to accommodate \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and \"Titanopteryx\", defining it based on the length and general morphology of the cervical vertebrae. Two years later, in 1986, noting commonalities not only in contained genera but in diagnostic features, he rendered Titanopterygiidae a junior synonym of Azhdarchinae, elevating the latter to family level and forming the family Azhdarchidae. In 2003, the clade Azhdarchoidea was defined by David Unwin. Azhdarchids were determined to form a clade, Neoazhdarchia, with Tapejaridae. \"Montanazhdarcho\" from North America and \"Zhejiangopterus\" from China were incorporated into Azhdarchidae. In the supplementary material for their 2014 paper describing \"Kryptodrakon progenitor\", Andres, James Clark and Xing Xu named a new subfamily, Quetzalcoatlinae, of which \"Quetzalcoatlus\" is the type genus.\nThe relationship between \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and other giant azhdarchids, like \"Arambourgiania\" and \"Hatzegopteryx\", is not certain. In 2021, Brian Andres recovered them as sister taxa, with \"Arambourgiania\" being the sister taxon of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and \"Hatzegopteryx\" being slightly more basal. However, Rodrigo V. P\u00eagas and colleagues, in 2022, instead recovered \"Quetzalcoatlus\" as part of one of two quetzalcoatline branches, alongside \"Cryodrakon\"; the other giant azhdarchid genera were recovered on the other branch. A similar dichotomy was recovered by Leonardo Ortiz David and colleagues that same year, with the inclusion of \"Thanatosdrakon\" as \"Quetzalcoatlus\"' sister genus.\nThe first of the below cladograms shows the results recovered by Andres in 2021, and the second shows the results recovered by Ortiz David and colleagues in 2022.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA 2025 analysis by Henry N. Thomas and Skye N. McDavid performed a revision of Azhdarchomorpha which recovered \"Quetzalcoatlus\" as polyphyletic, with the type species \"Q\". \"nothropi\" being sister to \"Thanatosdrakon\" while 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" claded in a polytomy with the 'Tous pterosaur' and other unnamed specimens that was recovered as sister to \"Thanatosdrakon\" and \"Q\". \"nothropi\".\nA reproduction of their results is below:\nPaleobiology.\nTerrestrial locomotion.\nAzhdarchids are the only group of pterosaurs to which trackways have been confidently assigned. \"Haenamichnus\", from South Korea, matches azhdarchids in foot shape, age, and size; it is estimated that most trackmakers had a wingspan of about , though some may have had a greater wingspan of about . One long \"Haenamichnus\" trackway shows that azhdarchids walked with their limbs held directly underneath their body, which, along with the morphology of their feet, indicates they were more proficient on the ground than other pterosaurs. Terrestrial locomotion in azhdarchids like \"Quetzalcoatlus\" likely involved a pacing gait, wherein the limbs on one side of the body would move at roughly the same time, followed by those of the opposite side. For example, the forelimb on one side of the body would lift off the ground and move forward first, to avoid colliding with the hind foot, and the hind limb would follow suit. The forefoot would be planted in the ground just before the hind foot. Once the stride completed, the same process would repeat on the opposite side of the body.\nFlight.\nThe nature of flight in \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and other giant azhdarchids was poorly understood until serious biomechanical studies were conducted in the 21st century. A 1984 experiment by Paul MacCready used practical aerodynamics to test the flight of \"Quetzalcoatlus\". MacCready constructed a model flying machine or, ornithopter, with a simple computer functioning as an autopilot. The model successfully flew with a combination of soaring and wing flapping. The model was based on a then-current weight estimate of around , far lower than more modern estimates of over . The method of flight in these pterosaurs depends largely on their weight, which has been controversial, and widely differing masses have been favored by different scientists. Some researchers have suggested that these animals employed slow, soaring flight, while others have concluded that their flight was fast and dynamic. In 2010, Donald Henderson argued that the mass of \"Q. northropi\" had been underestimated, even the highest estimates, and that it was too massive to have achieved powered flight. He estimated in his 2010 paper that its mass may have been up to , and argued that it may have been flightless.\nOther flight capability estimates have disagreed with Henderson's research, suggesting instead an animal superbly adapted to long-range, extended flight. In 2010, Mike Habib, a professor of biomechanics at Chatham University, and Mark Witton, a British paleontologist, undertook further investigation into the claims of flightlessness in large pterosaurs. After factoring wingspan, body weight, and aerodynamics, computer modeling led the two researchers to conclude that \"Q. northropi\" was capable of flight up to for 7 to 10 days at altitudes of . Habib further suggested a maximum flight range of for \"Q. northropi\". Henderson's work was also further criticized by Witton and Habib in another study, which pointed out that, although Henderson used excellent mass estimations, they were based on outdated pterosaur models, which caused his mass estimations to be more than double what Habib used in his estimations and that anatomical study of \"Q. northropi\" and other big pterosaur forelimbs showed a higher degree of robustness than would be expected if they were purely terrestrial. This study proposed that large pterosaurs most likely utilized a short burst of powered flight to then transition to thermal soaring. However, a study from 2022 suggests that they would only have flown occasionally and for short distances, like the Kori bustard (the world's heaviest bird that actively flies) and that they were not able to soar at all. Studies of \"Q. northropi\" and 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" published in 2021 by Kevin Padian and colleagues instead suggested that \"Quetzalcoatlus\" was a very powerful flier. While Padian himself also suggested that the legs and feet were likely tucked under the body during flight as in modern birds, co-authors John Conway and James Cunningham endorsed a system more in line with conventional models of pterosaur flight, wherein the hind limbs were splayed out while the animal was airborne.\nLaunching.\nEarly interpretations of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" launching relied on bipedal models. In 2004, Sankar Chatterjee and R.J. Templin used a model and utilized a running launch cycle powered by the hind limbs, in which \"Q. northropi\" was only barely able to take off. In 2008, Michael Habib suggested that the only feasible takeoff method for a \"Quetzalcoatlus\" was one that was mainly powered by the forelimbs. In 2010, Mark Witton and Habib noted that the femur of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" was only a third as strong as what would be expected from a bird of equal size, whereas the humerus is considerably stronger, and affirmed that an azhdarchid the size of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" would have great difficulty taking off bipedally. Thus, they considered a quadrupedal launching method, with the forelimbs applying most of the necessary force, a likelier method of takeoff. However, in 2021, Kevin Padian and colleagues attempted to resurrect the bipedal launch model, using a comparatively lightweight estimate of . They suggested that \"Quetzalcoatlus\"' hind limbs were more powerful than previously suggested, and that they were strong enough to launch its body as high as off the ground without the aid of the forelimbs. A large breastbone would support the necessary muscles to create a flight stroke, allowing \"Quetzalcoatlus\" to gain enough clearance to begin the downstrokes needed for takeoff. In an blog post written in response to the Padian and colleagues study, Mark Witton wrote that little of \"Quetzalcoatlus\"' morphology indicated that a bipedal launch mechanism was employed, and that quadrupedal launching, even in the smaller 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", remained the likeliest model.\nPaleoecology.\nDefinitive fossils of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" have only been found from the Javelina Formation of Texas, though similar and potentially congeneric azhdarchids are known from isolated bones across North America. The formation consists of around of fluvial deposits from the middle to late Maastrichtian, and is gradually overlain by Black Peaks Formation which contains the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary. At the time of sedimentation, the coastline of the seaway was around southeast of the formation. The fauna is dominated by the large sauropod \"Alamosaurus\", which has been considered characteristic of the fauna of the Lancian of southern Laramidia, with \"Quetzalcoatlus\" noted in association despite its relative inabundance. Specimens of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" are only known from the upper half of the formation where they are the most common vertebrate, with magnetostratigraphy and uranium\u2013lead dating demonstrating that these deposits were from the latest Maastrichtian around 67 to 66 million years ago. Additional pterosaur specimens that may be \"Quetzalcoatlus\" are found in older parts of the formation, though the single oldest pterosaur fossil belongs to the azhdarchid \"Wellnhopterus\". As 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" is known only from the upper part of the formation, and those of \"Q. northropi\" are from the top of the Javelina or the base of the Black Peaks Formations, it is possible that the three taxa succeeded each other, though uncertainty allows for some overlap of the species of \"Quetzalcoatlus\".\nEven if 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" and \"Q. northropi\" coexisted, their remains are found in different facies so they may have lived in different habitats. Specimens of \"Q. northropi\" are found in stream-channel deposits consisting of sandstone and conglomerate, where scattered skeletons, limb bones of \"Alamosaurus\", and local log jams are also found. In places, the conglomerates contain accumulations of small bones such as vertebrae, scales, teeth, and osteoderms of gar, fish, turtles, and crocodilians, and shells of gastropods. The flow in these streams fluctuated dramatically and was possibly ephemeral with short duration flooding events. While abandoned channel-lake deposits are the least common in the formation, most specimens of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" have been found in them. As the channels were abandoned or cut off from active flow, the lakes would develop where sediments would accumulate and occasionally be flooded by nearby streams. Burrows can be found throughout these deposits, bones are normally excrusted with calcite, and the carbonates present suggest photosynthetic algae and microbes as found in alkaline lakes. The lakes were several hundred meters wide but only a few meters deep at their maximum extent, though the main fossil layer is from a single prolonged lake development.\nThe overbanks surrounding the channels and lakes were covered in a mature forest represented by \"Javelinoxylon\" and araucariaceaen conifers showing a warm, dry, and nonseasonal environment of a tropical lowland. Much of the wood is infested with dry-wood termites. Slender aquatic vines and palm fronds and stalks can be found throughout the abandoned channel-lake deposits. Bioturbation in the lakes show it supported an abundant fauna of soft-bodied invertebrates including crustaceans, insects and annelids with intermittent freshwater bivalves and gastropods. Common aquatic vertebrates found elsewhere are absent, suggesting an inhospitable environment that was perhaps too alkaline. 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" may have fed on the invertebrate fauna, and has a body plan similar to modern wading birds found in alkaline environments such as cranes and storks. The area surrounding lakes was vegetated with palmetto palms and trees in an evergreen or semideciduous forest with a closed canopy over tall. No nearby elevation or branches were present to assist with launching for 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" so it must have been capable of takeoff from limited open spaces and of aerial maneuvering in dense forest. \"Q. northropi\" in contrast is found in channels suggesting a riparian habitat and more solitary lifestyle, but its absence from other similar riparian habitats of the time suggests something was preferable about the Javelina environment. The floodplain would have has a mean average temperature of and a dry and nonseasonal climate, so if \"Quetzalcoatlus\" did migrate in flocks, it would not have been in response to seasonality. The closest modern equivalent to the environment of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" would be the coastal plains of southern Mexico.\nFeeding and ecological niche.\nIn 1975, Douglas Lawson rejected the notion that \"Quetzalcoatlus\" might have had a fish-eating (piscivorous) lifestyle like pteranodontids. The Big Bend site where the holotype was discovered is roughly removed from the coastline, and since Lawson believed that the river systems of the locality were too small to support an animal the size of \"Q. northropi\", he instead suggested that it was a scavenger, similar to vultures. The holotype was found in close association with the skeletons of \"Alamosaurus\", a titanosaur sauropod, which Lawson cited as further evidence. However, David Martill dismissed this connection, noting that the association was nothing more than circumstantial evidence. Due to the light construction of \"Quetzalcoatlus\"' beak, it would have had to wait for other predators to open up a carcass before it could feed. Another issue is that, while many scavenging birds have extremely flexible necks allowing them to efficiently probe for meat, \"Quetzalcoatlus\" had a stiffer neck, and would not have had the same advantages. Since 'Q'. \"lawsoni\"'s beak was relatively weak and unhooked, being compared by Wann Langston Jr. to chopsticks, it is unlikely that it could have torn flesh from a carcass. In the coming decades, further hypotheses regarding \"Quetzalcoatlus\"' ecology were put forward. Lev Alexandrovich Nesov, in 1984, suggested that \"Q. northropi\" and other azhdarchids were piscivorous after all, and that they were ecological analogs to modern skimmers, which feed by skimming the water's surface. He did not, however, indicate any morphological indicators for this behavior, and indeed, azhdarchids lack many of the adaptations necessary for such a feeding method (such as robust, aerodynamic beaks with shock-absorbing structures, and the neck flexibility necessary for skimming). Thus, skimming is very unlikely. Another hypothesis, proposed by Langston, is that azhdarchids probed for burrowing invertebrates, using its beak to pluck them from the substrate. Among the evidence provided by Langston was extensive bioturbation of the strata around \"Quetzalcoatlus\" fossils, indicative of extensive invertebrate activity; this has since been suggested to be totally circumstantial. Such a lifestyle has subsequently been suggested for 'Q'. \"lawsoni\". However, wading animals tend to have large, long and broad feet, with a high surface area. This contrasts the morphology seen in 'Q'. \"lawsoni\" and other azhdarchids, which had small, narrow feet.\nThe predominant model of azhdarchid feeding behavior is the \"terrestrial stalking\" hypothesis, which suggests that they were terrestrial generalists which fed upon small terrestrial prey, especially small tetrapods. A predecessor to this hypothesis was proposed by Gregory S. Paul in a 1987 correspondence published in the journal \"Nature.\" Paul suggested that \"Q. northropi\" was analogous to modern storks, specializing in plucking small vertebrates, such as frogs and turtles, from around watercourses. This initial iteration was supported by Sankar Chatterjee and R. J. Templin, who believed that many pterodactyloids adopted such a lifestyle. Lifestyles analogous to modern herons were also proposed by Kevin Padian and Donna Braginetz in 1988, and by S. Christopher Bennett in 2001. In a 2008 paper on the paleoecology of azhdarchids, Mark Witton and Darren Naish reviewed previous models of their ecology and found the majority to be untenable. The anatomy possessed by azhdarchids was, to them, indicative of terrestrial prey capture. They argued that the family were ecologically closest to storks or ground hornbills, and coined the term \"terrestrial stalker\" to collectively describe them. Witton elaborated in a 2013 book that the proportions of azhdarchids would have been consistent with them striding through vegetated areas with their long limbs, and their downturned skull and jaws reaching the ground. Their long, stiffened necks would be an advantage as it would help lowering and raising the head and give it a vantage point when searching for prey, and enable them to grab small animals and fruit. The internal anatomy of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\"'s cervical vertebrae suggests that it, and other mid-sized azhdarchids, may have been able to pick up prey animals weighing at maximum; prey size would have been further limited by the size of 'Q'. \"lawsoni\"'s skull and gullet rather than body mass. 'Q'. \"lawsoni\"'s skull does not exhibit cranial kinesis, meaning that the skull was essentially a rigid unit, and as such it was likely incapable of masticating hard objects.\n\"Q. northropi\" fossils have been found in plains deposits, and due to the paucity and location of its remains, was speculated by Thomas Lehman to have been a solitary hunter that favored riparian environments. 'Q'. \"lawsoni\", on the other hand, is found in great numbers in facies that likely represent alkaline lakes. It may have lived like modern gregarious wading birds, feeding on small invertebrates such as annelids, crustaceans and insects that inhabit such environments, and using its beak to probe for burrowing invertebrates. The two species, if contemporaneous, were likely separated by such behavioral and ecological differences. In a 2021 study, Claudio Labita and David Martill suggested that azhdarchids might have been less terrestrial than suggested by Witton and Naish, since azhdarchid fossils were known from marine strata, such as \"Phosphatodraco\" from Morocco and \"Arambourgiania\" from the phosphates of Jordan. They noted that no azhdarchids had been found in truly terrestrial strata, and proposed they could instead have been associated with aquatic environments, such as rivers, lakes, marine and off-shore settings.\nPterosaurs were generally thought to have gone gradually extinct by decreasing in diversity towards the end of the Cretaceous, but Longrich and colleagues suggested this impression could be a result of the poor fossil records for pterosaurs (the Signor-Lipps Effect). Pterosaurs during this time had increased niche-partitioning compared to earlier faunas from the Santonian and Campanian ages, and they were able to outcompete birds in large size based niches, and birds therefore remained small, not exceeding wingspans during the Late Cretaceous (most pterosaurs during this time had larger wingspans, and thereby avoided the small-size niche). To these researchers, this indicated that the extinction of pterosaurs was abrupt instead of gradual, caused by the catastrophic Chicxulub impact. Their extinction freed up more niches that were then filled by birds, which led to their evolutionary radiation in the Early Cenozoic.\nContemporary fauna.\nBeyond the dominant sauropod \"Alamosaurus\" the Javelina Formation is known from a diverse vertebrate fauna throughout its channel, overbank, and lake deposits. Both the pterosaurs \"Quetzalcoatlus\" and \"Wellnhopterus\" are known, and the dinosaur megafauna is represented by the ceratopsids \"Bravoceratops\" and \"Torosaurus utahensis\", hadrosaurids assigned to \"Gryposaurus\", \"Kritosaurus\" and Saurolophinae, ankylosaurs, and an indeterminate species of \"Tyrannosaurus\". Smaller theropods including the dromaeosaurid \"Saurornitholestes\" and an indeterminate troodontid have been found, as well as a variety of fishes, smaller reptiles, and mammals. Most fishes, smaller reptiles and mammals were found through the screening of microfossil localities, which also discovered scraps of dinosaurs. Fish include the stingray \"Dasyatis\", the bowfin, the gar \"Atractosteus\", while amphibians include an indeterminate frog, and reptiles are represented by the lizard \"Glyptosaurus\", the snake \"Dunnophis\", and the crocodile \"Brachychampsa\". Mammals are very common in microfossil sites of both the Black Peaks and Javelina Formations, represented in the latter by the multituberculates \"Ptilodus\", \"Mesodma\", \"Stygimys\", and \"Viridomys\", indeterminate therians, and the metatherians \"Peratherium\", \"Gelastops\", \"Bryanictis\", \"Mixodectes\", \"Palaechthon\", \"Eoconodon\", \"Carsioptychus\", \"Haploconus\", \"Ellipsodon\", and \"Promioclaenus\".\nCultural significance.\nIn 1975, artist Giovanni Caselli depicted \"Quetzalcoatlus\" as a small-headed scavenger with an extremely long neck in the book \"The evolution and ecology of the Dinosaurs\" by British paleontologist Beverly Halstead. Over the next twenty-five years prior to future discoveries, it would launch similar depictions colloquially known as \"paleomemes\" in various books, as noted by Darren Naish.\nIn 1985, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and AeroVironment used \"Q\". \"northropi\" as the basis for an experimental ornithopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). They produced a half-scale model weighing , with a wingspan of . Coincidentally, Douglas A. Lawson, who discovered \"Q. northropi\" in Texas in 1971, named it after John \"Jack\" Northrop, a developer of tailless flying wing aircraft in the 1940s. The replica of \"Q. northropi\" incorporates a \"flight control system/autopilot which processes pilot commands and sensor inputs, implements several feedback loops, and delivers command signals to its various servo-actuators\". It is on exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum.\nIn 2010, several life-sized models of \"Q. northropi\" were put on display on London's South Bank as the centerpiece exhibit for the Royal Society's 350th-anniversary exhibition. The models, which included both flying and standing individuals with wingspans of over , were intended to help build public interest in science. The models were created by scientists from the University of Portsmouth.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As an influential and prosperous trading centre during the early Middle Ages, Quedlinburg became a center of influence under the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th and 11th centuries. The castle, church and old town with around 2,100 timber houses, dating from this time of influence, were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994 because of their exceptional preservation and outstanding Romanesque architecture.\nQuedlinburg has a population of more than 24,000. The town was the capital of the district of Quedlinburg until 2007, when the district was dissolved. Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the Romanesque Road.\nHistory.\nThe town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as \"Gross Orden\" on the eastern bank of the River Bode. It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King Henry the Fowler (\"Heinrich der Vogler\"). The records of this donation were held by the abbey of Corvey.\nAccording to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the \"cradle of the German Reich\".\nAfter Henry's death in 936, his widow Saint Matilda founded a religious community for women (\"Frauenstift\") on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation, Quedlinburg Abbey, was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The \"Annals of Quedlinburg\" were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.\nThe Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by Emperor Otto I in 936, was an imperial \"Pfalz\" of the Saxon emperors. The \"Pfalz\", including the male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of \"St. Wiperti\" is situated, while the women's convent was located on the castle hill.\nIn 973, shortly before the death of Emperor Otto I, a \"Reichstag\" (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which Mieszko, duke of Polans, and Boleslav, duke of Bohemia, as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as Byzantium and Bulgaria, gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law Theophanu, a Byzantine princess whose marriage to Otto II brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.\nIn 994, Otto III granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.\nThe town became a member of the Hanseatic League in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the Bishopric of Halberstadt. In 1477, Abbess Hedwig, aided by her brothers Ernest and Albert, broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop's forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the Electorate of Saxony. Both town and abbey converted to Lutheranism in 1539 during the Protestant Reformation.\nIn 1697, Frederick Augustus I of Poland\u2013Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested Brandenburg-Prussia's claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the German Mediatisation, and Quedlinburg passed to the Kingdom of Prussia as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg. Part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813, it was included within the new Prussian Province of Saxony in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without \"taking the veil\"; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women's rights, Sofia Albertina.\nDuring the Nazi regime, the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as Heinrich Himmler saw himself as the reincarnation of the \"most German of all German\" rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for Nazi Germany. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed in 1938 and during the war. The local crematory was kept busy burning the victims of the Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp. Georg Ay was local party chief from 1931 until the end of World War II. During the war, Quedlinburg was the location of a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp and a subcamp of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. American occupation during the last months of World War II brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was removed from the tower. However, in the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg came to light.\nQuedlinburg was administered within Bezirk Halle while part of the Communist East Germany from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of Saxony-Anhalt upon German reunification in 1990.\nDuring Quedlinburg's Communist era, restoration specialists from Poland were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of \"Fachwerk\" houses.\nQuedlinburg is the setting for the acclaimed 2016 \"Frantz\", serving as a quintessential small German town in the wake of WWI, home to a family who is reeling from the death of a son in the war.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe town is located north of the Harz mountains, about 123 m above NHN. The nearest mountains reach 181 m above NHN. The largest part of the town is located in the western part of the Bode river valley. This river comes from the Harz mountains and flows into the river Saale, a tributary of the river Elbe. The municipal area of Quedlinburg is . Before the incorporation of the two (previously independent) municipalities of Gernrode and Bad Suderode in January 2014, it was only .\nDivisions.\nThe town Quedlinburg consists of Quedlinburg proper and the following \"Ortsteile\" or municipal divisions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nQuedlinburg has an oceanic climate (Cfb) resulting from prevailing westerlies, blowing from the high-pressure area in the central Atlantic towards Scandinavia. Snowfall occurs almost every winter. January and February are the coldest months of the year, with an average temperature of 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C. July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F) and 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F). The average annual precipitation is close to 438\u00a0mm with rain occurring usually from May to September. This precipitation is one of the lowest in Germany, which has an annual average hovering around 440 \u00a0mm. In August 2010, Quedlinburg was the driest place in Germany, with only 72.4 L/m2.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernance.\nThe mayor is Frank Ruch (CDU), elected in 2022.\nTown twinning.\nQuedlinburg is twinned with:\nAttractions.\nIn the centre of the town are a wide selection of half-timbered buildings from at least five different centuries (including a 14th-century structure, one of Germany's oldest), while around the outer fringes of the old town are examples of \"Jugendstil\" buildings, dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThe old town of Quedlinburg is among the largest in Germany with a size of around 90 hectares. 2000 half-timbered houses can be found here. The oldest, the \"St\u00e4nderbau\", dates back from 1347.\nAnother famous building is called \"Klopstockhaus\", the birthplace of poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock.\nSince December 1994, the old town of Quedlinburg and the castle mount with the \"Stiftskirche\" (collegiate church) are listed as one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. Quedlinburg is one of the best-preserved medieval and Renaissance towns in Europe, having escaped major damage in World War II.\nIn 2006, the Selke valley branch of the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways was extended to Quedlinburg from Gernrode, giving access to the historic steam narrow gauge railway, Alexisbad and the high Harz plateau.\nThe castle and \"Stiftskirche St. Servatius\" still dominate the town like in the early Middle Ages. The church is a prime example of German Romanesque style. The treasure of the church, containing ancient Christian religious artifacts and books, was stolen by an American soldier but brought back to Quedlinburg in 1993 and is again on display here.\nThe former \"Stiftskirche St. Wiperti\" was established in 936 when the \"Kanonikerstift St. Wigpertus\" (of male canons) was moved from the castle hill to make way for what became Quedlinburg Abbey. The church was built at the location of the first Ottonian Royal palace at Quedlinburg. Around 1020, a three-aisled crypt was added to the basilica. The crypt, which survived all later alterations to the church, is also a designated stop on the Romanesque Road today.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nAir.\nThe nearest airports to Quedlinburg are Hannover, northwest, and Leipzig/Halle Airport, southeast. Much closer, but only served by a few airlines, is Magdeburg-Cochstedt. An airfield is located at Ballenstedt-Assmussstedt for general aviation.\nRailway.\nRegional trains operated by Deutsche Bahn and the private Transdev company run on the standard-gauge Magdeburg\u2013Thale line connecting Quedlinburg station with Magdeburg, Thale, and Halberstadt.\nIn 2006, the Selke Valley branch of the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways was extended into Quedlinburg from Gernrode, giving access via the historic steam-operated narrow-gauge railway to Alexisbad and the High Harz plateau.\nBus.\nQuedlinburg is connected by regional buses to the surrounding villages and small towns. Additionally, there are long-distance buses to Berlin.\nMedia, literature, and film.\nThe \"Mitteldeutsche Zeitung\" (\"Central German Newspaper\") maintains a local newsroom in Quedlinburg. In addition, the newspapers \"SuperSonntag\" (SuperSunday), \"Wochenspiegel\" (Weekly Mirror), and \"Harzer Kreisblatt\" (Harz District Newspaper) are published locally.\nThe local public broadcaster is Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR; \"Central German Broadcasting\"), whose regional office is located in Halberstadt.\nRegionalfernsehen Harz (RFH; Harz Regional Television) broadcasts on the local cable television network.\nA number of novels have been set in Quedlinburg and the surrounding area, such as Wilhelm Raabe's \"Der Sch\u00fcdderump\". The first part of Theodor Fontane's novel C\u00e9cile (1887) takes place in Quedlinburg and Thale, as do the various novels of Dorothea Christiane Erxleben and Julius Wolff's \"The Robber Count: A Story of the Harz Country\" (1884). Other novels set in the area include Gerhard Beutel's \"Der Stadthauptmann von Quedlinburg\" (1972), Helga Glaesener's \"Du s\u00fc\u00dfe sanfte M\u00f6rderin\" (You Sweet, Gentle Murderess; 2000), and ten novels by Christian Amling about the fictional private investigator Iren\u00e4us Moll.\nBecause of its historical architecture, Quedlinburg has been used as the backdrop for various film and television projects. Several episodes (64, 67\u201470, 76) of the series \"\u00c4rger im Revier\" (Trouble in the Precinct) broadcast by RTL Zwei were filmed in Quedlinburg. From 2012 to 2017, the ARD daytime series \"Heiter bis t\u00f6dlich: Alles Klara\" was filmed in the city and its vicinity, with 48 episodes over three seasons. The following films were partially filmed in Quedlinburg:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

QRP operation is a specialized pursuit within the hobby that was first popularized in the early 1920s. QRP operators tend to limit their transmitted RF power to 5\u00a0W or less, although some also consider single-sideband (SSB) operations of up to 10\u00a0W to be QRP.\nReliable two-way communication at such low power levels can be challenging due to changing radio propagation and the difficulty of receiving the relatively weak transmitted signals. QRP enthusiasts may employ optimized antenna systems, enhanced operating skills, and a variety of special modes, in order to maximize their ability to make and maintain radio contact. Since the late 1960s, commercial transceivers specially designed for QRP operation have evolved from vacuum tube to solid state technology.\nA number of organizations dedicated to QRP operation exist, and aficionados participate in various contests designed to test their skill in making long-distance contacts at low power levels.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"QRP\" derives from the standard Q code used in radio communication, where QRP is used to request \"\"Reduce power\" and QRP? is used to ask \"Should I reduce power?\"\".\nPhilosophy.\nMost amateur transceivers are capable of transmitting approximately 100\u00a0watts, but in some parts of the world, such as the U.S., amateurs can transmit up to 1,500\u00a0watts. QRP enthusiasts contend that this practice is rarely necessary, and doing so wastes power, increases the likelihood of causing interference to nearby televisions, radios, and telephones and, for United States' amateurs, is contrary to FCC Part\u00a097 rule, which states that one must use \"the minimum power necessary to carry out the desired communications\". QRP can also be used for emergency communications during disaster recovery, when frugal use of available battery power and generator fuel is crucial.\nPractice.\nThe practice of operating with low power was popularized as early as 1924, with a variety of reports, editorials and articles published in U.S. amateur radio magazines and journals that encouraged amateurs to lower power output, both for purposes of experimentation, and for improving operating conditions by reducing interference.\nAlthough not universally agreed upon, the ARRL makes a recommendation for QRP power limits. Most amateur organizations agree that for CW, AM, FM, and data modes, the transmitter output power should be 5 watts (or less). The maximum output power for SSB (single sideband) is sometimes agreed to be no more than 10\u00a0Watts peak envelope power (PEP), while some organisations opine that the power limit should be 5\u00a0Watts. QRPers are known to regularly use less than 5\u00a0Watts, sometimes operating with as little as 100\u00a0milliwatts or even less. Extremely low power \u2014 1\u00a0Watt and below \u2014 is often referred to by hobbyists as \"QRPP\".\nCommunicating using QRP can be difficult since the QRPer must face the same challenges of radio propagation faced by amateurs using higher power levels, but with the inherent disadvantages associated with having a weaker signal on the receiving end, all other things being equal. QRP aficionados try to make up for this through more efficient antenna systems and enhanced operating skills.\nWeak signal modes.\nQRP enthusiasts may use special modes that employ technology and software designed to enhance reception of the relatively weak transmitted signals resulting from low power levels.\nQRSS: Very slow speed Morse code \nQRSS uses very slow speed CW (Morse code) to compensate for the decreased signal-to-noise ratio involved in QRP operation. QRSS enthusiasts may record a transmission for later analysis, sometimes decoding \"by ear\" while playing it back at much faster speeds, or decoding \"by eye\" on the waterfall display of a spectrum analyzer.\nCoherent CW: Critically-timed Morse code transmission\nCoherent CW uses transmitters that clock-out signals calibrated to a precise rate, allowing receivers to employ extremely narrowband filtering to increase readability.\nWSJT: Weak Signal \u2013 Joe Taylor\nWSJT is a software system that utilizes several separate modes, each optimized for a different signal path; these include meteor scatter, troposcatter, and EME communications. WSJT was named after Dr. J.H. Taylor to acknowledge his work in developing weak signal communication modes for radio.\nWSPR: Weak Signal \u2013 Propagation Reporter\nWSPR is a software suite and computer network used to monitor propagation paths for optimal communication conditions.\nEquipment.\nMany of the larger, more powerful commercial transceivers permit the operator to lower their output level to QRP levels. Commercial transceivers specially designed to operate at or near QRP power levels have been commercially available since the late 1960s.\nIn 1969 the American manufacturer Ten-Tec produced the Powermite-1, one of Ten-Tec's first assembled transceivers, and featured modular construction. All stages of the transceiver were on individual circuit boards: the transmitter was capable of about one or two watts of RF, and the receiver was a direct-conversion unit, similar to that found in the Heathkit HW-7 and HW-8 lines, which introduced many amateurs to QRP'ing and led to the popularity of the mode.\nEnthusiasts operate QRP radios on the HF bands in portable modes, usually carrying the radios in backpacks, with whip antennas. Some QRPers prefer to construct their equipment from kits, published plans, or homebrew it from scratch. Many popular designs are based on the NE612 mixer IC, i.e. the K1, K2, ATS series and the Softrock SDR.\nOrganizations.\nAmateur radio organizations dedicated to QRP include QRP Amateur Radio Club International (QRPARCI), American QRP Club, G-QRP Club based in the United Kingdom, and The Adventure Radio Society emphasizing portable QRP operation. Major QRP gatherings are held yearly at hamfests such as Dayton Hamvention, Pacificon, and Friedrichshafen.\nContests and awards.\nThere are specific operating awards, contests, clubs, and conventions devoted to QRP enthusiasts. In the United States, the November Sweepstakes, June and September VHF QSO Parties, January VHF Sweepstakes, and the ARRL International DX Contest, as well as many major international contests have designated special QRP categories. For example, during the annual ARRL's Field Day event, making a QSO (ham-to-ham contact) using \"QRP battery power\" is worth five times as many points as a contact made by conventional means. The QRP ARCI club sponsors 12 contests during the year specifically for QRP operators.\nTypical awards include the QRP ARCI club's \"thousand-miles-per-watt\" award, available to anyone presenting evidence of a qualifying contact. QRP ARCI also offers special awards for achieving the ARRL's Worked All States, Worked All Continents, and DX Century Club awards under QRP conditions. Other QRP clubs also offer similar versions of these awards, as well as general QRP operating achievement awards.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

String quartets most often consist of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The particular choice and number of instruments derives from the registers of the human voice: soprano, alto, tenor and bass (SATB). In the string quartet, two violins play the soprano and alto vocal registers, the viola plays the tenor register and the cello plays the bass register.\nComposers of notable string quartets include Joseph Haydn (68 compositions), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (23), Ludwig van Beethoven (16), Franz Schubert (15), Felix Mendelssohn (6), Johannes Brahms (3), Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (14), Alexander Borodin (2), B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (6), Elizabeth Maconchy (13), Darius Milhaud (18), Heitor Villa-Lobos (17), and Dmitri Shostakovich (15). The Italian composer Luigi Boccherini (1743\u20131805), wrote 91 string quartets.\nLess often, string quartets are written for other combinations of the standard string ensemble. These include quartets for one violin, two violas, and one cello, notably by Carl Stamitz (6 compositions) and others; and for one violin, one viola, and two cellos, by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and others.\nPiano quartet.\nAnother common standard classical quartet is the piano quartet, usually consisting of violin, viola, cello, and piano. Romantic composers Beethoven, Brahms, and Mendelssohn each wrote three important compositions in this form, and Mozart, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and Gabriel Faur\u00e9 each wrote two. Olivier Messiaen's \"Quartet for the End of Time\" substitutes clarinet for viola.\nOther instrumental quartets.\nWind quartets are scored either the same as a string quartet with the wind instrument replacing the first violin (i.e. scored for wind, violin, viola and cello) or are groups of four wind instruments. Among the latter, the SATB format woodwind quartet of flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon is relatively common.\nAn example of a wind quartet featuring four of the same types of wind instruments is the saxophone quartet, consisting of soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone and baritone saxophone. Often a second alto may be substituted for the soprano part or a bass saxophone may be substituted for the baritone.\nVocal quartet.\nCompositions for four singers have been written for quartets a cappella; accompanied by instruments, such as a piano; and accompanied by larger vocal forces, such as a choir. Brahms and Schubert wrote numerous pieces for four voices that were once popular in private salons, although they are seldom performed today. Vocal quartets also feature within larger classical compositions, such as opera, choral works, and symphonic compositions. The final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Giuseppe Verdi's \"Messa da Requiem\" are two examples of renowned concert works that include vocal quartets.\nTypically, a vocal quartet is composed of:\nBaroque quartet.\nThe baroque quartet is a form of music composition similar to the trio sonata, but with four music parts performed by three solo melodic instruments and basso continuo. The solo instruments could be strings or wind instruments.\nExamples of baroque quartets are Georg Philipp Telemann's Paris quartets.\nJazz.\nQuartets are popular in jazz and jazz fusion music. Jazz quartet ensembles are often composed of a horn, classically clarinet (or saxophone, trumpet, etc.), a chordal instrument (e.g., electric guitar, piano, Hammond organ, vibraphone, etc.), a bass instrument (e.g., double bass, tuba or bass guitar) and a drum kit. This configuration is sometimes modified by using a second horn replacing the chordal instrument, such as a trumpet and saxophone with string bass and drum kit, or by using two chordal instruments (e.g., piano and electric guitar).\nPopular music.\nRock and pop.\nThe quartet lineup is also very common in pop and rock music. A standard quartet formation in pop and rock music is an ensemble typically consisting of a vocalist, an electric guitar, a bass guitar, and a drum kit. This configuration is sometimes modified so that the vocalist also plays guitar, or sometimes a keyboard instrument (e.g., organ, piano, synthesizer) or soloing instrument (e.g., saxophone) may be used.\nVocal quartet.\nIn the 20th century Western popular music, the term \"vocal quartet\" usually refers to ensembles of four singers of the same gender. This is particularly common for barbershop quartets and Gospel quartets.\nSome well-known female US vocal quartets include The Carter Sisters; The Forester Sisters; The Chiffons; The Chordettes; The Lennon Sisters; Blackpink the South Korean girl group; and En Vogue. Some well-known male US vocal quartets include The Oak Ridge Boys; The Statler Brothers; The Ames Brothers; The Chi-Lites; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young; The Dixie Hummingbirds; The Four Aces; The Four Freshmen; The Four Seasons; Four Tops; The Statesmen Quartet; The Blackwood Brothers; Cathedral Quartet; Ernie Haase &amp; Signature Sound; Golden Gate Quartet; The Hilltoppers; The Jordanaires; and The Mills Brothers. The only known U.S. drag quartet is The Kinsey Sicks. Some mixed-gender vocal quartets include ABBA, The Pied Pipers; The Mamas &amp; the Papas; The Merry Macs; and The Weavers.\nFolk music.\nRussian.\nA Russian folk-instrument quartet commonly consists of a bayan, a prima balalaika, a prima or alto domra, and a contrabass balalaika (e.g., Quartet Moskovskaya Balalaika). Configurations without a bayan include a prima domra, a prima balalaika, an alto domra, and a bass balalaika (Quartet Skaz); or two prima domras, a prima balalaika, and a bass balalaika.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical physics and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. This behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\nLater, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were verified in tests where polarization or spin of entangled particles were measured at separate locations, statistically violating Bell's inequality. This established that the correlations produced from quantum entanglement cannot be explained in terms of local hidden variables, i.e., properties contained within the individual particles themselves.\nEntanglement can produce statistical correlations between events in widely separated places, but it cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.\nQuantum entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally with photons, electrons, top quarks, molecules and even small diamonds. The use of quantum entanglement in communication and computation is an active area of research and development.\nHistory.\nAlbert Einstein and Niels Bohr engaged in a long-running collegial dispute over the interpretation of quantum mechanics, now known as the Bohr\u2013Einstein debates. During these debates, Einstein introduced a thought experiment involving a box that emits a photon. He noted that the experimenter's choice of which measurement to make on the box would change what can be predicted about the photon, even when the photon is very far away. This argument, which Einstein had formulated by 1931, was an early recognition of what would later be called entanglement. That same year, Hermann Weyl observed in his textbook on group theory and quantum mechanics that quantum systems composed of multiple interacting parts exhibit a kind of \"Gestalt,\" in which \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". In 1932, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger derived the defining equations of quantum entanglement but left them unpublished. In 1935, Grete Hermann studied the mathematics of an electron interacting with a photon and noted the phenomenon that would later be called entanglement. Later that same year, Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published a paper on what is now known as the Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen (EPR) paradox, a thought experiment that attempted to show that \"the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete\". Their thought experiment considered two systems that interact and then separate, and they argued that, afterward, quantum mechanics could not describe the two systems individually.\nShortly after this paper appeared, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger wrote a letter to Einstein in German in which he used the word \"Verschr\u00e4nkung\" (translated by himself as \"entanglement\") to describe situations like that of the EPR scenario. Schr\u00f6dinger followed up with a full paper defining and discussing the notion of \"entanglement\", saying \"I would not call [entanglement] \"one\" but rather \"the\" characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought.\" \nLike Einstein, Schr\u00f6dinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the theory of relativity. Einstein later disparaged quantum mechanics for seemingly exhibiting \"spukhafte Fernwirkung\" or \"spooky action at a distance\", meaning the acquisition of a value of a property at one location resulting from a measurement at a distant location.\nIn 1946, John Archibald Wheeler suggested studying the polarization of pairs of gamma-ray photons produced by electron\u2013positron annihilation. Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov carried out this experiment in 1949, thereby demonstrating that the entangled particle pairs considered by EPR could be created in the laboratory.\nDespite Schr\u00f6dinger's claim of its importance, little work on entanglement was published for decades after his paper was published. In 1964 John S. Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in Bell's inequality, regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying local realism, and showed that quantum theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems. His inequality is experimentally testable, and there have been numerous relevant experiments, starting with the pioneering work of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972 and Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982.\nWhile Bell actively discouraged students from pursuing work like his as too esoteric, after a talk at Oxford a student named Artur Ekert suggested that the violation of a Bell inequality could be used as a resource for communication. Ekert followed up by publishing a quantum key distribution protocol called E91 based on it.\nIn 1992, the entanglement concept was leveraged to propose quantum teleportation, an effect that was realized experimentally in 1997.\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, Anton Zeilinger used the generation of entanglement via parametric down-conversion to develop entanglement swapping and demonstrate quantum cryptography with entangled photons.\nIn 2022, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger \"for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science\".\nConcept.\nMeaning of entanglement.\nJust as energy is a resource that facilitates mechanical operations, entanglement is a resource that facilitates performing tasks that involve communication and computation. The mathematical definition of entanglement can be paraphrased as saying that maximal knowledge about the whole of a system does not imply maximal knowledge about the individual parts of that system. If the quantum state that describes a pair of particles is entangled, then the results of measurements upon one half of the pair can be strongly correlated with the results of measurements upon the other. However, entanglement is not the same as \"correlation\" as understood in classical probability theory and in daily life. Instead, entanglement can be thought of as \"potential\" correlation that can be used to generate actual correlation in an appropriate experiment. The correlations generated from an entangled quantum state cannot in general be replicated by classical probability.\nAn example of entanglement is a subatomic particle that decays into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various conservation laws, and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a spin-zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-1/2 particles. If there is no orbital angular momentum, the total spin angular momentum after this decay must be zero (by the conservation of angular momentum). Whenever the first particle is measured to be spin up on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be spin down. This is called the spin anti-correlated case and the pair is said to be in the singlet state. Perfect anti-correlations like this could be explained by \"hidden variables\" within the particles. For example, we could hypothesize that the particles are made in pairs such that one carries a value of \"up\" while the other carries a value of \"down\". Then, knowing the result of the spin measurement upon one particle, we could predict that the other will have the opposite value. Bell illustrated this with a story about a colleague, Bertlmann, who always wore socks with mismatching colors. \"Which colour he will have on a given foot on a given day is quite unpredictable,\" Bell wrote, but upon observing \"that the first sock is pink you can be already sure that the second sock will not be pink.\" Revealing the remarkable features of quantum entanglement requires considering multiple distinct experiments, such as spin measurements along different axes, and comparing the correlations obtained in these different configurations.\nQuantum systems can become entangled through various types of interactions. For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes, see the section below on methods. Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles decohere through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made. In more detail, this process involves the particles becoming entangled with the environment, as a consequence of which, the quantum state describing the particles themselves is no longer entangled.\nMathematically, an entangled system can be defined to be one whose quantum state cannot be factored as a product of states of its local constituents; that is to say, they are not individual particles but are an inseparable whole. When entanglement is present, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). The state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or superposition, of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum cannot be written as a single product term.39\nParadox.\nThe singlet state described above is the basis for one version of the EPR paradox. In this variant, introduced by David Bohm, a source emits particles and sends them in opposite directions. The state describing each pair is entangled. In the standard textbook presentation of quantum mechanics, performing a spin measurement on one of the particles causes the wave function for the whole pair to collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the \"right choice\" when it too is measured.\nThe distance and timing of the measurements can be chosen so as to make the interval between the two measurements spacelike, hence, any causal effect connecting the events would have to travel faster than light. According to the principles of special relativity, it is not possible for any information to travel between two such measuring events. It is not even possible to say which of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events \"x\"1 and \"x\"2 there are inertial frames in which \"x\"1 is first and others in which \"x\"2 is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers would disagree about the role of cause and effect.\nFailure of local hidden-variable theories.\nA possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined \"hidden variables\". The state of the particles being measured contains some hidden variables, whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are going to be. This would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally believed this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted quantum mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete.\nLocal hidden variable theories fail, however, when measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered. If a large number of pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the local realist or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy Bell's inequality. A number of experiments have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. Moreover, when measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving relativistic reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time frame) occurs before the other, the measurement results remain correlated.\nThe fundamental issue about measuring spin along different axes is that these measurements cannot have definite values at the same time\u2015they are incompatible in the sense that these measurements' maximum simultaneous precision is constrained by the uncertainty principle. This is contrary to what is found in classical physics, where any number of properties can be measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. It has been proven mathematically that compatible measurements cannot show Bell-inequality-violating correlations, and thus entanglement is a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon.\nNonlocality and entanglement.\nAs discussed above, entanglement is necessary to produce a violation of a Bell inequality. However, the mere presence of entanglement alone is insufficient, as Bell himself noted in his 1964 paper. This is demonstrated, for example, by Werner states, which are a family of states describing pairs of particles. For appropriate choices of the key parameter that identifies a given Werner state within the full set thereof, the Werner states exhibit entanglement. Yet pairs of particles described by Werner states always admit a local hidden variable model. In other words, these states cannot power the violation of a Bell inequality, despite possessing entanglement. This can be generalized from pairs of particles to larger collections as well.\nThe violation of Bell inequalities is often called \"quantum nonlocality.\" This term is not without controversy. It is sometimes argued that using the term \"nonlocality\" carries the unwarranted implication that the violation of Bell inequalities must be explained by physical, faster-than-light signals. In other words, the failure of local hidden-variable models to reproduce quantum mechanics is not necessarily a sign of true nonlocality in quantum mechanics itself. Despite these reservations, the term \"nonlocality\" has become a widespread convention.\nThe term \"nonlocality\" is also sometimes applied to other concepts besides the nonexistence of a local hidden-variable model, such as whether states can be distinguished by local measurements. Moreover, quantum field theory is often said to be \"local\" because observables defined within spacetime regions that are spacelike separated must commute. These other uses of \"local\" and \"nonlocal\" are not discussed further here.\nMathematical details.\nThe following subsections use the formalism and theoretical framework developed in the articles bra\u2013ket notation and mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.\nPure states.\nConsider two arbitrary quantum systems A and B, with respective Hilbert spaces HA and HB. The Hilbert space of the composite system is the tensor product\n formula_1\nIf the first system is in state formula_2 and the second in state formula_3, the state of the composite system is\n formula_4\nStates of the composite system that can be represented in this form are called separable states, or product states. However, not all states of the composite system are separable. Fix a basis formula_5 for HA and a basis formula_6 for HB. The most general state in \"HA\" \u2297 \"HB\" is of the form\n formula_7.\nThis state is separable if there exist vectors formula_8 so that formula_9 yielding formula_10 and formula_11 It is inseparable if for any vectors formula_12 at least for one pair of coordinates formula_13 we have formula_14 If a state is inseparable, it is called an 'entangled state'.\nFor example, given two basis vectors formula_15 of HA and two basis vectors formula_16 of HB, the following is an entangled state:\n formula_17\nIf the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to either system A or system B a definite pure state. Another way to say this is that while the von Neumann entropy of the whole state is zero (as it is for any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this sense, the systems are \"entangled\". The above example is one of four Bell states, which are (maximally) entangled pure states (pure states of the \"HA\" \u2297 \"HB\" space, but which cannot be separated into pure states of each HA and HB).\nNow suppose Alice is an observer for system A, and Bob is an observer for system B. If in the entangled state given above Alice makes a measurement in the formula_18 eigenbasis of A, there are two possible outcomes, occurring with equal probability: Alice can obtain the outcome 0, or she can obtain the outcome 1. If she obtains the outcome 0, then she can predict with certainty that Bob's result will be 1. Likewise, if she obtains the outcome 1, then she can predict with certainty that Bob's result will be 0. In other words, the results of measurements on the two qubits will be perfectly anti-correlated. This remains true even if the systems A and B are spatially separated. This is the foundation of the EPR paradox.\nThe outcome of Alice's measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in this particular scheme. For the general argument, see no-communication theorem.\nEnsembles.\nAs mentioned above, a state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system, then one calls it an 'ensemble' and describes it by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite matrix, or a trace class when the state space is infinite-dimensional, and which has trace 1. By the spectral theorem, such a matrix takes the general form:\n formula_19\nwhere the \"w\"\"i\" are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the vectors \"\u03b1\"\"i\" are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret \u03c1 as representing an ensemble where formula_20 is the proportion of the ensemble whose states are formula_21. When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a 'pure ensemble'. When there is less than total information about the state of a quantum system we need density matrices to represent the state.\nExperimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a \"black box\" apparatus that spits electrons towards an observer. The electrons' Hilbert spaces are identical. The apparatus might produce electrons that are all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons: one with state formula_22 with spins aligned in the positive z direction, and the other with state formula_23 with spins aligned in the negative y direction. Generally, this is a mixed ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a different state.\nFollowing the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states are just density matrices on \"HA\" \u2297 \"HB\". That is, it has the general form\n formula_24\nwhere the \"w\"\"i\" are positively valued probabilities, formula_25, and the vectors are unit vectors. This is self-adjoint and positive and has trace 1.\nExtending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a mixed state is separable if it can be written as\n formula_26\nwhere the \"w\"\"i\" are positively valued probabilities and the formula_27s and formula_28s are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems A and B respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume without loss of generality that formula_27 and formula_28 are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is not separable.\nIn general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is considered difficult. The general bipartite case has been shown to be NP-hard. For the 2 \u00d7 2 and 2 \u00d7 3 cases, a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability is given by the famous Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) condition.\nReduced density matrices.\nThe idea of a reduced density matrix was introduced by Paul Dirac in 1930. Consider as above systems A and B each with a Hilbert space HA, HB. Let the state of the composite system be\n formula_31\nAs indicated above, in general there is no way to associate a pure state to the component system A. However, it still is possible to associate a density matrix. Let\n formula_32.\nwhich is the projection operator onto this state. The state of A is the partial trace of \u03c1T over the basis of system B:\n formula_33\nThe sum occurs over formula_34 and formula_35 the identity operator in formula_36. \u03c1A is sometimes called the reduced density matrix of \u03c1 on subsystem A. Colloquially, we \"trace out\" or \"trace over\" system B to obtain the reduced density matrix on A.\nFor example, the reduced density matrix of A for the entangled state\n formula_37\ndiscussed above is\n formula_38\nThis demonstrates that the reduced density matrix for an entangled pure ensemble is a mixed ensemble. In contrast, the density matrix of A for the pure product state formula_39 discussed above is\n formula_40\nthe projection operator onto formula_41.\nIn general, a bipartite pure state \"\u03c1\" is entangled if and only if its reduced states are mixed rather than pure.\nEntanglement as a resource.\nIn quantum information theory, entangled states are considered a 'resource', i.e., something costly to produce and that allows implementing valuable transformations. The setting in which this perspective is most evident is that of \"distant labs\", i.e., two quantum systems labelled \"A\" and \"B\" on each of which arbitrary quantum operations can be performed, but which do not interact with each other quantum mechanically. The only interaction allowed is the exchange of classical information, which combined with the most general local quantum operations gives rise to the class of operations called LOCC (local operations and classical communication). These operations do not allow the production of entangled states between systems A and B. But if A and B are provided with a supply of entangled states, then these, together with LOCC operations can enable a larger class of transformations.\nIf Alice and Bob share an entangled state, Alice can tell Bob over a telephone call how to reproduce a quantum state formula_42 she has in her lab. Alice performs a joint measurement on formula_42 together with her half of the entangled state and tells Bob the results. Using Alice's results Bob operates on his half of the entangled state to make it equal to formula_42. Since Alice's measurement necessarily erases the quantum state of the system in her lab, the state formula_42 is not copied, but transferred: it is said to be \"teleported\" to Bob's laboratory through this protocol.\nEntanglement swapping is variant of teleportation that allows two parties that have never interacted to share an entangled state. The swapping protocol begins with two EPR sources. One source emits an entangled pair of particles A and B, while the other emits a second entangled pair of particles C and D. Particles B and C are subjected to a measurement in the basis of Bell states. The state of the remaining particles, A and D, collapses to a Bell state, leaving them entangled despite never having interacted with each other.\nAn interaction between a qubit of A and a qubit of B can be realized by first teleporting A's qubit to B, then letting it interact with B's qubit (which is now a LOCC operation, since both qubits are in B's lab) and then teleporting the qubit back to A. Two maximally entangled states of two qubits are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables the realization of quantum interactions (or of quantum channels) in a setting where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process. There are other applications where entanglement can be seen as a resource, e.g., private communication or distinguishing quantum states.\nMultipartite entanglement.\nQuantum states describing systems made of more than two pieces can also be entangled. An example for a three-qubit system is the Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger (GHZ) state,\nformula_46\nAnother three-qubit example is the W state:\nformula_47\nTracing out any one of the three qubits turns the GHZ state into a separable state, whereas the result of tracing over any of the three qubits in the W state is still entangled. This illustrates how multipartite entanglement is a more complicated topic than bipartite entanglement: systems composed of three or more parts can exhibit multiple qualitatively different types of entanglement. A single particle cannot be maximally entangled with more than a particle at a time, a property called monogamy.\nClassification of entanglement.\nNot all quantum states are equally valuable as a resource. One method to quantify this value is to use an entanglement measure that assigns a numerical value to each quantum state. However, it is often interesting to settle for a coarser way to compare quantum states. This gives rise to different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the classification. Important examples are:\nA different entanglement classification is based on what the quantum correlations present in a state allow A and B to do: one distinguishes three subsets of entangled states: (1) the \"non-local states\", which produce correlations that cannot be explained by a local hidden variable model and thus violate a Bell inequality, (2) the \"steerable states\" that contain sufficient correlations for A to modify (\"steer\") by local measurements the conditional reduced state of B in such a way, that A can prove to B that the state they possess is indeed entangled, and finally (3) those entangled states that are neither non-local nor steerable. All three sets are non-empty.\nEntropy.\nIn this section, the entropy of a mixed state is discussed as well as how it can be viewed as a measure of quantum entanglement.\nDefinition.\nIn classical information theory H, the Shannon entropy, is associated to a probability distribution, formula_58, in the following way:\n formula_59\nSince a mixed state \u03c1 is a probability distribution over an ensemble, this leads naturally to the definition of the von Neumann entropy:\n formula_60\nwhich can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of \u03c1: \n formula_61.\nSince an event of probability 0 should not contribute to the entropy, and given that\n formula_62\nthe convention 0 log(0) \n 0 is adopted. When a pair of particles is described by the spin singlet state discussed above, the von Neumann entropy of either particle is log(2), which can be shown to be the maximum entropy for 2 \u00d7 2 mixed states.\nAs a measure of entanglement.\nEntropy provides one tool that can be used to quantify entanglement, although other entanglement measures exist. If the overall system is pure, the entropy of one subsystem can be used to measure its degree of entanglement with the other subsystems. For bipartite pure states, the von Neumann entropy of reduced states is the unique measure of entanglement in the sense that it is the only function on the family of states that satisfies certain axioms required of an entanglement measure.\nIt is a classical result that the Shannon entropy achieves its maximum at, and only at, the uniform probability distribution {1/\"n\", ..., 1/\"n\"}. Therefore, a bipartite pure state \"\u03c1\" \u2208 \"H\"A \u2297 \"H\"B is said to be a \"maximally entangled state\" if the reduced state of each subsystem of \u03c1 is the diagonal matrix\n formula_63\nFor mixed states, the reduced von Neumann entropy is not the only reasonable entanglement measure.\nR\u00e9nyi entropy also can be used as a measure of entanglement.\nEntanglement measures.\nEntanglement measures quantify the amount of entanglement in a (often viewed as a bipartite) quantum state. As aforementioned, entanglement entropy is the standard measure of entanglement for pure states (but no longer a measure of entanglement for mixed states). For mixed states, there are some entanglement measures in the literature and no single one is standard.\nMost (but not all) of these entanglement measures reduce for pure states to entanglement entropy, and are difficult (NP-hard) to compute for mixed states as the dimension of the entangled system grows.\nQuantum field theory.\nThe Reeh\u2013Schlieder theorem of quantum field theory is sometimes interpreted as saying that entanglement is omnipresent in the quantum vacuum.\nApplications.\nEntanglement has many applications in quantum information theory. With the aid of entanglement, otherwise impossible tasks may be achieved.\nAmong the best-known applications of entanglement are superdense coding and quantum teleportation.\nMost researchers believe that entanglement is necessary to realize quantum computing (although this is disputed by some).\nEntanglement is used in some protocols of quantum cryptography, but to prove the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) under standard assumptions does not require entanglement. However, the \"device independent\" security of QKD is shown exploiting entanglement between the communication partners.\nIn August 2014, Brazilian researcher Gabriela Barreto Lemos, from the University of Vienna, and team were able to \"take pictures\" of objects using photons that had not interacted with the subjects, but were entangled with photons that did interact with such objects. The idea has been adapted to make infrared images using only standard cameras that are insensitive to infrared.\nEntangled states.\nThere are several canonical entangled states that appear often in theory and experiments.\nFor two qubits, the Bell states are\n formula_64\n formula_65\nThese four pure states are all maximally entangled and form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of the two qubits. They provide examples of how quantum mechanics can violate Bell-type inequalities.\nFor \"M\" &gt; 2 qubits, the GHZ state is\n formula_66\nwhich reduces to the Bell state formula_67 for \"M\" = 2. The traditional GHZ state was defined for \"M\" = 3. GHZ states are occasionally extended to qudits, i.e., systems of \"d\" rather than 2 dimensions.\nAlso for \"M\" &gt; 2 qubits, there are spin squeezed states, a class of squeezed coherent states satisfying certain restrictions on the uncertainty of spin measurements, which are necessarily entangled. Spin squeezed states are good candidates for enhancing precision measurements using quantum entanglement.\nFor two bosonic modes, a NOON state is\n formula_68\nThis is like the Bell state formula_69 except the basis states formula_70 and formula_71 have been replaced with \"the \"N\" photons are in one mode\" and \"the \"N\" photons are in the other mode\".\nFinally, there also exist twin Fock states for bosonic modes, which can be created by feeding a Fock state into two arms leading to a beam splitter. They are the sum of multiple NOON states, and can be used to achieve the Heisenberg limit.\nFor the appropriately chosen measures of entanglement, Bell, GHZ, and NOON states are maximally entangled while spin squeezed and twin Fock states are only partially entangled.\nMethods of creating entanglement.\nEntanglement is usually created by direct interactions between subatomic particles. These interactions can take numerous forms. One of the most commonly used methods is spontaneous parametric down-conversion to generate a pair of photons entangled in polarization. Other methods include the use of a fiber coupler to confine and mix photons, photons emitted from decay cascade of the bi-exciton in a quantum dot, or the use of the Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel effect. Quantum entanglement of a particle and its antiparticle, such as an electron and a positron, can be created by partial overlap of the corresponding quantum wave functions in Hardy's interferometer. In the earliest tests of Bell's theorem, the entangled particles were generated using atomic cascades.\nIt is also possible to create entanglement between quantum systems that never directly interacted, through the use of entanglement swapping. Two independently prepared, identical particles may also be entangled if their wave functions merely spatially overlap, at least partially.\nTesting a system for entanglement.\nA density matrix \"\u03c1\" is called separable if it can be written as a convex sum of product states, namely\nformula_72\nwith formula_73 probabilities. By definition, a state is entangled if it is not separable.\nFor 2-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 respectively) the simple Peres\u2013Horodecki criterion provides both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for separability, and thus\u2014inadvertently\u2014for detecting entanglement. However, for the general case, the criterion is merely a necessary one for separability, as the problem becomes NP-hard when generalized. Other separability criteria include (but not limited to) the range criterion, reduction criterion, and those based on uncertainty relations. See Ref. for a review of separability criteria in discrete-variable systems and Ref. for a review on techniques and challenges in experimental entanglement certification in discrete-variable systems.\nA numerical approach to the problem is suggested by Jon Magne Leinaas, Jan Myrheim and Eirik Ovrum in their paper \"Geometrical aspects of entanglement\". Leinaas et al. offer a numerical approach, iteratively refining an estimated separable state towards the target state to be tested, and checking if the target state can indeed be reached.\nIn continuous variable systems, the Peres\u2013Horodecki criterion also applies. Specifically, Simon formulated a particular version of the Peres\u2013Horodecki criterion in terms of the second-order moments of canonical operators and showed that it is necessary and sufficient for formula_74-mode Gaussian states (see Ref. for a seemingly different but essentially equivalent approach). It was later found that Simon's condition is also necessary and sufficient for formula_75-mode Gaussian states, but no longer sufficient for formula_76-mode Gaussian states. Simon's condition can be generalized by taking into account the higher order moments of canonical operators or by using entropic measures.\nIn quantum gravity.\nThere is a fundamental conflict, referred to as the problem of time, between the way the concept of \"time\" is used in quantum mechanics, and the role it plays in general relativity. In standard quantum theories time acts as an independent background through which states evolve, while general relativity treats time as a dynamical variable which relates directly with matter. Part of the effort to reconcile these approaches to time results in the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation, which predicts the state of the universe is timeless or static, contrary to ordinary experience. \nWork started by Don Page and William Wootters suggests that the universe appears to evolve for observers on the inside because of energy entanglement between an evolving system and a clock system, both within the universe. In this way the overall system can remain timeless while parts experience time via entanglement. The issue remains an open question closely related to attempts at theories of quantum gravity.\nIn general relativity, gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime and that curvature derives from the distribution of matter. However, matter is governed by quantum mechanics. Integration of these two theories faces many problems. In an (unrealistic) model space called the anti-de Sitter space, the AdS/CFT correspondence allows a quantum gravitational system to be related to a quantum field theory without gravity. Using this correspondence, Mark Van Raamsdonk suggested that spacetime arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the spacetime.\nExperiments demonstrating and using entanglement.\nBell tests.\nA Bell test, also known as \"Bell inequality test\" or \"Bell experiment\", is a real-world physics experiment designed to test the theory of quantum mechanics against the hypothesis of local hidden variables. These tests empirically evaluate the implications of Bell's theorem. To date, all Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems behave. Many types of Bell tests have been performed in physics laboratories, often with the goal of ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. This is known as \"closing loopholes in Bell tests\". In earlier tests, it could not be ruled out that the result at one point could have been subtly transmitted to the remote point, affecting the outcome at the second location. However, so-called \"loophole-free\" Bell tests have since been performed where the locations were sufficiently separated that communications at the speed of light would have taken longer\u2014in one case, 10,000 times longer\u2014than the interval between the measurements.\nIn 2017, Yin et al. reported setting a new quantum entanglement distance record of 1,203\u00a0km, demonstrating the survival of a two-photon pair and a violation of a Bell inequality, reaching a CHSH valuation of , under strict Einstein locality conditions, from the Micius satellite to bases in Lijian, Yunnan and Delingha, Qinghai, increasing the efficiency of transmission over prior fiberoptic experiments by an order of magnitude.\nEntanglement of top quarks.\nIn 2023 the LHC using techniques from quantum tomography measured entanglement at the highest energy so far, a rare intersection between quantum information and high energy physics based on theoretical work first proposed in 2021. The experiment was carried by the ATLAS detector measuring the spin of top-quark pair production and the effect was observed with a more than 5\"\u03c3\" level of significance, the top quark is the heaviest known particle and therefore has a very short lifetime (formula_77 \u2248) being the only quark that decays before undergoing hadronization (~\u00a0) and spin decorrelation (~\u00a0), so the spin information is transferred without much loss to the leptonic decays products that will be caught by the detector. The spin polarization and correlation of the particles was measured and tested for entanglement with concurrence as well as the Peres\u2013Horodecki criterion and subsequently the effect has been confirmed too in the CMS detector.\nEntanglement of macroscopic objects.\nIn 2020, researchers reported the quantum entanglement between the motion of a millimetre-sized mechanical oscillator and a disparate distant spin system of a cloud of atoms. Later work complemented this work by quantum-entangling two mechanical oscillators.\nEntanglement of quarks and gluons in protons.\nPhysicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory demonstrated quantum entanglement within protons, showing quarks and gluons are interdependent rather than isolated particles. Using high-energy electron-proton collisions, they revealed maximal entanglement, reshaping our understanding of proton structure.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was fought almost entirely at sea, primarily in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States, with minor actions in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.\nIn 1793, Congress unilaterally suspended repayment of French loans from the American Revolutionary War, and in 1794 signed the Jay Treaty with Great Britain. Then engaged in the 1792 to 1797 War of the First Coalition, France retaliated by seizing U.S. ships trading with Great Britain. When diplomacy failed to resolve these issues, in October 1796, French privateers began attacking all merchant ships in U.S. waters, regardless of nationality.\nSpending cuts following the end of the American Revolutionary War left the U.S. unable to mount an effective response, and within a year over 316 American ships had been captured. In March 1798, Congress reconstituted the United States Navy, and in July authorized the use of force against France. By 1799, losses had been significantly reduced through informal cooperation with the Royal Navy, whereby merchant ships from both nations were allowed to join each other's convoys.\nThe replacement of the French First Republic by the Consulate in November 1799 led to the Convention of 1800, which ended the war. The right of Congress to authorize military action without a formal declaration of war was later confirmed by the Supreme Court. This ruling formed the basis of many similar actions since, including U.S. participation in the Vietnam War and the Gulf War in the 20th century.\nBackground.\nUnder the 1778 Treaty of Alliance, the United States had agreed to protect the French West Indies in return for French support in the American Revolutionary War. Because the treaty had no termination date, France claimed this obligation included supporting them against Great Britain and the Dutch Republic during the 1792\u20131797 War of the First Coalition. Despite popular enthusiasm for the French Revolution, there was little support for this in Congress. Neutrality allowed New England shipowners to earn huge profits evading the British blockade of French ports, while the Southern planter class feared the example set by France's abolition of slavery in 1794.\nIn 1793, Congress suspended repayment of French loans incurred during the Revolutionary War, arguing the execution of Louis XVI and establishment of the French First Republic rendered existing agreements void. They further argued American military obligations under the Treaty of Alliance applied only to a \"defensive conflict\" and thus did not apply, since France had declared war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. To ensure the U.S. did not become involved, Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1794, while President George Washington issued an executive order forbidding American merchant ships from arming themselves.\nFrance accepted these acts on the basis of \"benevolent neutrality\". They interpreted this as allowing French privateers to enter U.S. ports, and to sell captured British ships in American prize courts, but not vice versa. However, the U.S. viewed it as the right to provide the same privileges to both. These differences were further exacerbated in November 1794 when the U.S. and Britain signed the Jay Treaty. By resolving outstanding issues from the American Revolution, it led to a rapid expansion of trade between the two countries. Between 1794 and 1801, American exports to Britain nearly tripled in value, from US$33\u00a0million to $94\u00a0million.\nIn late 1796, French privateers began seizing American ships trading with the British, helped by the almost complete lack of a United States Navy. Their last warship had been sold in 1785, leaving only a small flotilla belonging to the United States Revenue Cutter Service and a few neglected coastal forts. From October 1796 to June 1797, French vessels captured 316 ships, 6% of the entire American merchant fleet, causing losses of $12 to $15 million. On 2 March 1797, the French Directory issued a decree permitting the seizure of any neutral shipping without a listing the nationalities of each crewman. Since American ships rarely carried such documents, France had effectively initiated a commerce war.\nDiplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict ended in the 1797 dispute known as the XYZ Affair. However, the hostilities created support for establishing a limited naval force, and on 18 June, President John Adams appointed Benjamin Stoddert the first Secretary of the Navy. On 7 July 1798, Congress approved the use of force against French warships in American waters, but wanted to ensure conflict did not escalate beyond these limits. As a result, it was called a \"limited\" or \"Quasi-War\", and led to political debate over whether it was constitutional. A series of rulings by the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the ability of the U.S. to conduct undeclared wars, or \"police actions\".\nForces and strategy.\nSince ships of the line were expensive to build and required highly specialised construction facilities, in 1794 Congress compromised by ordering six large frigates. By 1798, the first three were nearly complete and on 16 July 1798, additional funding was approved for the , , and , plus the frigates and . The provision of naval stores and equipment by the British allowed these to be built relatively quickly, and all saw action during the war.\nThese vessels were enhanced by so-called \"subscription ships\", privately funded vessels provided by individual cities. They included five frigates, among them the , commanded by Stephen Decatur, and four merchantmen converted into sloops. Primarily intended to attack foreign shipping, they earned huge profits for their owners; the captured over 80 enemy vessels, including the French corvette .\nWith most of the French fleet confined to Europe by the Royal Navy, Secretary Stoddert was able to focus resources on eliminating the few vessels that evaded the blockade and reached the Caribbean. The U.S. also needed convoy protection, and while there was no formal agreement with the British, considerable co-operation took place at a local level. The two navies shared a signal system, and allowed their merchantmen to join each other's convoys, most of which were provided by the British, who had four to five times more escorts available.\nThis freed the U.S. Navy to concentrate on French privateers, most of which had very shallow draft and were armed with a maximum of twenty guns. Operating from French and Spanish bases in the Caribbean, particularly Guadeloupe, they made opportunistic attacks on passing ships, before escaping back into port. To counter those tactics, the U.S. used similarly sized vessels from the Revenue Cutter Service, as well as commissioning their own privateers. The first American ship to see action was the , a converted East Indiaman with 26 guns, but most were far smaller.\nThe revenue cutter , commanded by Edward Preble, made two cruises to the West Indies and captured ten prizes. Preble turned command of \"Pickering\" over to Benjamin Hillar, who captured the much larger and more heavily armed French privateer after a nine-hour battle. In September 1800, the \"Pickering\" and her entire crew were lost at sea in a storm. Preble next commanded the frigate , which he sailed around Cape Horn into the Pacific to protect U.S. merchantmen in the East Indies. He recaptured several U.S. ships that had been seized by French privateers.\nThe first significant study of the war was written by U.S. naval historian Gardner W. Allen in 1909, and focused exclusively on ship-to-ship actions. This is how the conflict is generally remembered in the U.S., but historian Michael Palmer argues American naval operations cannot be assessed in isolation. When operating in the Caribbean &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0they entered a European theater where the war had been underway since 1793\u00a0... British ships chased and fought the same French cruisers and privateers. Both navies escorted each other's merchantmen. American warships operated from British bases. And most importantly, British policies and shifts in deployment had dramatic effects on American operations.\nSignificant naval actions.\nFrom the perspective of the U.S. Navy, the Quasi-War consisted of a series of ship-to-ship actions in U.S. coastal waters and the Caribbean; one of the first was the Capture of \"La Croyable\" on 7 July 1798 by outside Egg Harbor, New Jersey. On 20 November, a pair of French frigates, \"Insurgente\" and \"Volontaire\", captured the schooner , commanded by Lieutenant William Bainbridge; \"Retaliation\" was recaptured on 28 June 1799.\nOn 9 February 1799, the frigate captured the French Navy's frigate \"L'Insurgente\". By 1 July, under the command of Decatur, had been refitted and repaired and embarked on her mission to patrol the South Atlantic coast and West Indies in search of French ships which were preying on American merchant vessels.\nIn the action of 1 January 1800, an American merchant convoy escorted by fought off an attack by 14 French privateer barges in the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve. On 1 February, \"Constellation\" severely damaged the French frigate \"La Vengeance\" off the coast of Saint Kitts, while suffering serious damage itself. Silas Talbot led a naval expedition during the Battle of Puerto Plata Harbor in early May, capturing a Spanish army controlled coastal fort and a French corvette. When French troops occupied Cura\u00e7ao in July, and bombarded French positions on the island and landed marines to support the local Dutch troops before the French withdrew. On 12 October, the frigate \"Boston\" captured the corvette .\nOn 25 October, defeated the French brig \"Flambeau\" near Dominica. \"Enterprise\" also captured eight privateers and freed eleven U.S. merchant ships from captivity, while \"Experiment\" captured the French privateers \"Deux Amis\" and \"Diane\" and liberated numerous American merchant ships. Although U.S. military losses were light, the French had seized over 2,000 American merchant ships by the time the war ended.\nConclusion of hostilities.\nIt has been suggested that since the war was primarily driven by domestic political considerations, neither side was able to identify what a successful resolution entailed. This was enhanced by the tendency of individual commanders to pursue their own objectives, and on the American side, focusing on ship to ship actions rather than overall strategy.\nIn any event, by late 1800 U.S. and British naval operations, combined with a more conciliatory diplomatic stance by the new French government, had significantly reduced privateer activity. The Convention of 1800, signed on 30 September, ended the Quasi-War. It affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the 1778 French alliance, but failed to provide compensation for the alleged $20\u00a0million in American economic losses. While the agreement ensured the U.S. remained neutral during the Napoleonic Wars, it failed to resolve the underlying tensions with warring European nations, which led to the War of 1812.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is aligned with an organization's purpose and strategic direction (). It is expressed as the organizational goals and aspirations, policies, processes, documented information, and resources needed to implement and maintain it. Early quality management systems emphasized predictable outcomes of an industrial product production line, using simple statistics and random sampling. By the 20th century, labor inputs were typically the most costly inputs in most industrialized societies, so focus shifted to team cooperation and dynamics, especially the early signaling of problems via a continual improvement cycle. In the 21st century, QMS has tended to converge with sustainability and transparency initiatives, as both investor and customer satisfaction and perceived quality are increasingly tied to these factors. Of QMS regimes, the ISO 9000 family of standards is probably the most widely implemented worldwide \u2013 the ISO 19011 audit regime applies to both and deals with quality and sustainability and their integration.\nOther QMS, e.g. Natural Step, focus on sustainability issues and assume that other quality problems will be reduced as result of the systematic thinking, transparency, documentation and diagnostic discipline.\nThe term \"Quality Management System\" and the initialism \"QMS\" were invented in 1991 by Ken Croucher, a British management consultant working on designing and implementing a generic model of a QMS within the IT industry.\nConcept of quality \u2013 historical background.\nThe concept of a quality as we think of it now first emerged from the Industrial Revolution. Previously goods had been made from start to finish by the same person or team of people, with handcrafting and tweaking the product to meet 'quality criteria'. Mass production brought huge teams of people together to work on specific stages of production where one person would not necessarily complete a product from start to finish. In the late 19th century pioneers such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford recognized the limitations of the methods being used in mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output. Birland established Quality Departments to oversee the quality of production and rectifying of errors, and Ford emphasized standardization of design and component standards to ensure a standard product was produced. Management of quality was the responsibility of the Quality department and was implemented by Inspection of product output to 'catch' defects.\nApplication of statistical control came later as a result of World War production methods, which were advanced by the work done of W. Edwards Deming, a statistician, after whom the Deming Prize for quality is named. Joseph M. Juran focused more on managing for quality. The first edition of Juran's Quality Control Handbook was published in 1951. He also developed the \"Juran's trilogy\", an approach to cross-functional management that is composed of three managerial processes: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. These functions all play a vital role when evaluating quality.\nQuality, as a profession and the managerial process associated with the quality function, was introduced during the second half of the 20th century and has evolved since then. Over this period, few other disciplines have seen as many changes as the quality profession.\nThe quality profession grew from simple control to engineering, to systems engineering. Quality control activities were predominant in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The 1970s were an era of quality engineering and the 1990s saw quality systems as an emerging field. Like medicine, accounting, and engineering, quality has achieved status as a recognized profession.\nAs Lee and Dale (1998) state, there are many organizations that are striving to assess the methods and ways in which their overall productivity, the quality of their products and services and the required operations to achieve them are done.\nMedical devices.\nThe two primary, state of the art, guidelines for medical device manufacturer QMS and related services today are the ISO 13485 standards and the US FDA 21 CFR 820 regulations. The two have a great deal of similarity, and many manufacturers adopt QMS that is compliant with both guidelines.\nISO 13485 are harmonized with the European Union Regulation 2017/745 as well as the IVD and AIMD directives. The ISO standard is also incorporated in regulations for other jurisdictions such as Japan (JPAL) and Canada (CMDCAS).\nQuality System requirements for medical devices have been internationally recognized as a way to assure product safety and efficacy and customer satisfaction since at least 1983 and were instituted as requirements in a final rule published on October 7, 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had documented design defects in medical devices that contributed to recalls from 1983 to 1989 that would have been prevented if Quality Systems had been in place. The rule is promulgated at 21 CFR 820.\nAccording to current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), medical device manufacturers have the responsibility to use good judgment when developing their quality system and apply those sections of the FDA Quality System (QS) Regulation that are applicable to their specific products and operations, in Part 820 of the QS regulation. As with GMP, operating within this flexibility, it is the responsibility of each manufacturer to establish requirements for each type or family of devices that will result in devices that are safe and effective, and to establish methods and procedures to design, produce, and distribute devices that meet the quality system requirements.\nThe FDA has identified in the QS regulation the 7 essential subsystems of a quality system. These subsystems include:\nall overseen by management and quality audits.\nBecause the QS regulation covers a broad spectrum of devices and production processes, it allows some leeway in the details of quality system elements. It is left to manufacturers to determine the necessity for, or extent of, some quality elements and to develop and implement procedures tailored to their particular processes and devices. For example, if it is impossible to mix up labels at a manufacturer because there is only one label to each product, then there is no necessity for the manufacturer to comply with all of the GMP requirements under device labeling.\nDrug manufacturers are regulated under a different section of the Code of Federal Regulations:\nOrganizations and awards.\nThe International Organization for Standardization's ISO 9001:2015 series describes standards for a QMS addressing the principles and processes surrounding the design, development, and delivery of a general product or service. Organizations can participate in a continuing certification process to ISO 9001:2015 to demonstrate their compliance with the standard, which includes a requirement for continual (i.e. planned) improvement of the QMS, as well as more foundational QMS components such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).\nISO 9000:2005 provides information on the fundamentals and vocabulary used in quality management systems. ISO 9004:2009 provides guidance on a quality management approach for the sustained success of an organization. Neither of these standards can be used for certification purposes as they provide guidance, not requirements.\nThe Baldrige Performance Excellence Program educates organizations in improving their performance and administers the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The Baldrige Award recognizes U.S. organizations for performance excellence based on the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence. The Criteria address critical aspects of management that contribute to performance excellence: leadership; strategy; customers; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce; operations; and results.\nThe European Foundation for Quality Management's EFQM Excellence Model supports an award scheme similar to the Baldrige Award for European companies.\nIn Canada, the National Quality Institute presents the 'Canada Awards for Excellence' on an annual basis to organizations that have displayed outstanding performance in the areas of Quality and workplace wellness, and have met the institute's criteria with documented overall achievements and results.\nThe European Quality in Social Service (EQUASS) is a sector-specific quality system designed for the social services sector and addresses quality principles that are specific to service delivery to vulnerable groups, such as empowerment, rights, and person-centredness.\nThe Alliance for Performance Excellence is a network of state and local organizations that use the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence at the grassroots level to improve the performance of local organizations and economies. browsers can find Alliance members in their state and get the latest news and events from the Baldrige community.\nProcess.\nA QMS process is an element of an organizational QMS. The ISO 9001 standard requires organizations seeking compliance or certification to define the processes which form the QMS and the sequence and interaction of these processes. Butterworth-Heinemann and other publishers have offered several books which provide step-by-step guides to those seeking the quality certifications of their products.\nExamples of such processes include:\ncomply with specific requirements e.g. statistical process control and measurement systems analysis,\nISO 9001 requires that the performance of these processes be measured, analyzed and continually improved, and the results of this form an input into the management review process.\nSoftware.\nQuality management software offers the techniques, processes, structure, and resources needed to simplify manufacturing and ERP activities while handling quality concerns efficiently and cost-effectively.\nHelps manufacturers to monitor, control, and document quality processes electronically to guarantee that goods are made within tolerance, meet all necessary requirements, and are defect-free. Quality management software is often used in the manufacturing industry to identify potential issues before they occur.\nSome benefits of quality management software include:\nQuality management software can be integrated with manufacturing execution systems (MES). A MES is a complete, dynamic software system for monitoring, tracking, documenting, and controlling the manufacturing process from raw materials to final products. When combined with QMS, these systems:\nQuality management software focuses on 4 main elements:\nMost quality management software are cloud-based and offer software as a service.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry. While crystals, according to the classical crystallographic restriction theorem, can possess only two-, three-, four-, and six-fold rotational symmetries, the Bragg diffraction pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other symmetry orders\u2014for instance, five-fold.\nAperiodic tilings were discovered by mathematicians in the early 1960s, and some twenty years later, they were found to apply to the study of natural quasicrystals. The discovery of these aperiodic forms in nature has produced a paradigm shift in the field of crystallography. In crystallography, the quasicrystals were predicted in 1981 by a five-fold symmetry study of Alan Lindsay Mackay,\u2014that also brought in 1982, with the crystallographic Fourier transform of a Penrose tiling, the possibility of identifying quasiperiodic order in a material through diffraction.\nQuasicrystals had been investigated and observed earlier, but, until the 1980s, they were disregarded in favor of the prevailing views about the atomic structure of matter. In 2009, after a dedicated search, a mineralogical finding, icosahedrite, offered evidence for the existence of natural quasicrystals.\nRoughly, an ordering is non-periodic if it lacks translational symmetry, which means that a shifted copy will never match exactly with its original. The more precise mathematical definition is that there is never translational symmetry in more than \"n\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a01 linearly independent directions, where \"n\" is the dimension of the space filled, e.g., the three-dimensional tiling displayed in a quasicrystal may have translational symmetry in two directions. Symmetrical diffraction patterns result from the existence of an indefinitely large number of elements with regular spacing, a property loosely described as long-range order. Experimentally, the aperiodicity is revealed in the unusual symmetry of the diffraction pattern, that is, symmetry of orders other than two, three, four, or six.\nIn 1982, materials scientist Dan Shechtman observed that certain aluminium\u2013manganese alloys produced unusual diffractograms, which today are seen as revelatory of quasicrystal structures. Due to fear of the scientific community's reaction, it took him two years to publish the results. Shechtman's discovery challenged the long-held belief that all crystals are periodic. Observed in a rapidly solidified Al-Mn alloy, quasicrystals exhibited icosahedral symmetry, which was previously thought impossible in crystallography. This breakthrough, supported by theoretical models and experimental evidence, led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of solid-state matter. Despite initial skepticism, the discovery gained widespread acceptance, prompting the International Union of Crystallography to redefine the term \"crystal.\" The work ultimately earned Shechtman the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and inspired significant advancements in materials science and mathematics.\nOn 25 October 2018, Luca Bindi and Paul Steinhardt were awarded the Aspen Institute 2018 Prize for collaboration and scientific research between Italy and the United States after discovering icosahedrite, the first quasicrystal known to occur naturally.\nHistory.\nThe first representations of perfect quasicrystalline patterns can be found in several early Islamic works of art and architecture such as the Gunbad-i-Kabud tomb tower, the Darb-e Imam shrine and the Al-Attarine Madrasa. On July 16, 1945, in Alamogordo, New Mexico, the Trinity nuclear bomb test produced icosahedral quasicrystals. They went unnoticed at the time of the test but were later identified in samples of red trinitite, a glass-like substance formed from fused sand and copper transmission lines. Identified in 2021, they are the oldest known anthropogenic quasicrystals.\nIn 1961, Hao Wang asked whether determining if a set of tiles admits a tiling of the plane is an algorithmically unsolvable problem or not. He conjectured that it is solvable, relying on the hypothesis that every set of tiles that can tile the plane can do it \"periodically\" (hence, it would suffice to try to tile bigger and bigger patterns until obtaining one that tiles periodically). Nevertheless, two years later, his student Robert Berger constructed a set of some 20,000 square tiles (now called Wang tiles) that can tile the plane but not in a periodic fashion. As further aperiodic sets of tiles were discovered, sets with fewer and fewer shapes were found. In 1974 Roger Penrose discovered a set of just two tiles, now referred to as Penrose tiles, that produced only non-periodic tilings of the plane. These tilings displayed instances of fivefold symmetry. One year later Alan Mackay showed theoretically that the diffraction pattern from the Penrose tiling had a two-dimensional Fourier transform consisting of sharp 'delta' peaks arranged in a fivefold symmetric pattern. Around the same time, Robert Ammann created a set of aperiodic tiles that produced eightfold symmetry.\nIn 1972, R. M. de Wolf and W. van Aalst reported that the diffraction pattern produced by a crystal of sodium carbonate cannot be labeled with three indices but needed one more, which implied that the underlying structure had four dimensions in reciprocal space. Other puzzling cases have been reported, but until the concept of quasicrystal came to be established, they were explained away or denied.\nDan Shechtman first observed ten-fold electron diffraction patterns in 1982, while conducting a routine study of an aluminium\u2013manganese alloy, Al6Mn, at the US National Bureau of Standards (later NIST). Shechtman related his observation to Ilan Blech, who responded that such diffractions had been seen before. Around that time, Shechtman also related his finding to John W. Cahn of the NIST, who did not offer any explanation and challenged him to solve the observation. Shechtman quoted Cahn as saying: \"Danny, this material is telling us something, and I challenge you to find out what it is\".\nThe observation of the ten-fold diffraction pattern lay unexplained for two years until the spring of 1984, when Blech asked Shechtman to show him his results again. A quick study of Shechtman's results showed that the common explanation for a ten-fold symmetrical diffraction pattern, a type of crystal twinning, was ruled out by his experiments. Therefore, Blech looked for a new structure containing cells connected to each other by defined angles and distances but without translational periodicity. He decided to use a computer simulation to calculate the diffraction intensity from a cluster of such a material, which he termed as \"multiple polyhedral\", and found a ten-fold structure similar to what was observed. The multiple polyhedral structure was termed later by many researchers as icosahedral glass.\nShechtman accepted Blech's discovery of a new type of material and chose to publish his observation in a paper entitled \"The Microstructure of Rapidly Solidified Al6Mn\", which was written around June 1984 and published in a 1985 edition of \"Metallurgical Transactions A\". Meanwhile, on seeing the draft of the paper, John Cahn suggested that Shechtman's experimental results merit a fast publication in a more appropriate scientific journal. Shechtman agreed and, in hindsight, called this fast publication \"a winning move\". This paper, published in the \"Physical Review Letters\", repeated Shechtman's observation and used the same illustrations as the original paper.\nOriginally, the new form of matter was dubbed \"Shechtmanite\". The term \"quasicrystal\" was first used in print by Paul Steinhardt and Dov Levine shortly after Shechtman's paper was published.\nAlso in 1985, T. Ishimasa \"et al.\" reported twelvefold symmetry in Ni-Cr particles. Soon, eightfold diffraction patterns were recorded in V-Ni-Si and Cr-Ni-Si alloys. Over the years, hundreds of quasicrystals with various compositions and different symmetries have been discovered. The first quasicrystalline materials were thermodynamically unstable: when heated, they formed regular crystals. However, in 1987, the first of many stable quasicrystals were discovered, making it possible to produce large samples for study and applications.\nIn 1992, the International Union of Crystallography altered its definition of a crystal, reducing it to the ability to produce a clear-cut diffraction pattern and acknowledging the possibility of the ordering to be either periodic or aperiodic.\nIn 2001, Steinhardt hypothesized that quasicrystals could exist in nature and developed a method of recognition, inviting all the mineralogical collections of the world to identify any badly cataloged crystals. In 2007 Steinhardt received a reply by Luca Bindi, who found a quasicrystalline specimen from Khatyrka in the University of Florence Mineralogical Collection. The crystal samples were sent to Princeton University for other tests, and in late 2009, Steinhardt confirmed its quasicrystalline character. This quasicrystal, with a composition of Al63Cu24Fe13, was named icosahedrite and it was approved by the International Mineralogical Association in 2010. Analysis indicates it may be meteoritic in origin, possibly delivered from a carbonaceous chondrite asteroid. In 2011, Bindi, Steinhardt, and a team of specialists found more icosahedrite samples from Khatyrka. A further study of Khatyrka meteorites revealed micron-sized grains of another natural quasicrystal, which has a ten-fold symmetry and a chemical formula of Al71Ni24Fe5. This quasicrystal is stable in a narrow temperature range, from 1120 to 1200 K at ambient pressure, which suggests that natural quasicrystals are formed by rapid quenching of a meteorite heated during an impact-induced shock.\nShechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011 for his work on quasicrystals. \"His discovery of quasicrystals revealed a new principle for packing of atoms and molecules,\" stated the Nobel Committee and pointed that \"this led to a paradigm shift within chemistry.\" In 2014, Post of Israel issued a stamp dedicated to quasicrystals and the 2011 Nobel Prize.\nWhile the first quasicrystals discovered were made out of intermetallic components, later on quasicrystals were also discovered in soft-matter and molecular systems. Soft quasicrystal structures have been found in supramolecular dendrimer liquids and ABC Star Polymers in 2004 and 2007. In 2009, it was found that thin-film quasicrystals can be formed by self-assembly of uniformly shaped, nano-sized molecular units at an air-liquid interface. It was demonstrated that these units can be both inorganic and organic. Additionally in the 2010s, two-dimensional molecular quasicrystals were discovered, driven by intermolecular interactions and interface-interactions.\nIn 2018, chemists from Brown University announced the successful creation of a self-constructing lattice structure based on a strangely shaped quantum dot. While single-component quasicrystal lattices have been previously predicted mathematically and in computer simulations, they had not been demonstrated prior to this.\nMathematics.\nThere are several ways to mathematically define quasicrystalline patterns. One definition, the \"cut and project\" construction, is based on the work of Harald Bohr (mathematician brother of Niels Bohr). The concept of an almost periodic function (also called a quasiperiodic function) was studied by Bohr, including work of Bohl and Escanglon.\nHe introduced the notion of a superspace. Bohr showed that quasiperiodic functions arise as restrictions of high-dimensional periodic functions to an irrational slice (an intersection with one or more hyperplanes), and discussed their Fourier point spectrum. These functions are not exactly periodic, but they are arbitrarily close in some sense, as well as being a projection of an exactly periodic function.\nIn order that the quasicrystal itself be aperiodic, this slice must avoid any lattice plane of the higher-dimensional lattice. De Bruijn showed that Penrose tilings can be viewed as two-dimensional slices of five-dimensional hypercubic structures; similarly, icosahedral quasicrystals in three dimensions are projected from a six-dimensional hypercubic lattice, as first described by Peter Kramer and Roberto Neri in 1984. Equivalently, the Fourier transform of such a quasicrystal is nonzero only at a dense set of points spanned by integer multiples of a finite set of basis vectors, which are the projections of the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors of the higher-dimensional lattice.\nClassical theory of crystals reduces crystals to point lattices where each point is the center of mass of one of the identical units of the crystal. The structure of crystals can be analyzed by defining an associated group. Quasicrystals, on the other hand, are composed of more than one type of unit, so, instead of lattices, quasilattices must be used. Instead of groups, groupoids, the mathematical generalization of groups in category theory, is the appropriate tool for studying quasicrystals.\nUsing mathematics for construction and analysis of quasicrystal structures is a difficult task. Computer modeling, based on the existing theories of quasicrystals, however, greatly facilitated this task. Advanced programs have been developed allowing one to construct, visualize and analyze quasicrystal structures and their diffraction patterns. The aperiodic nature of quasicrystals can also make theoretical studies of physical properties, such as electronic structure, difficult due to the inapplicability of Bloch's theorem. However, spectra of quasicrystals can still be computed with error control.\nStudy of quasicrystals may shed light on the most basic notions related to the quantum critical point observed in heavy fermion metals. Experimental measurements on an Au\u2013Al\u2013Yb quasicrystal have revealed a quantum critical point defining the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility as temperature tends to zero. It is suggested that the electronic system of some quasicrystals is located at a quantum critical point without tuning, while quasicrystals exhibit the typical scaling behaviour of their thermodynamic properties and belong to the well-known family of heavy fermion metals.\nMaterials science.\nSince the original discovery by Dan Shechtman, hundreds of quasicrystals have been reported and confirmed. Quasicrystals are found most often in aluminium alloys (Al\u2013Li\u2013Cu, Al\u2013Mn\u2013Si, Al\u2013Ni\u2013Co, Al\u2013Pd\u2013Mn, Al\u2013Cu\u2013Fe, Al\u2013Cu\u2013V, etc.), but numerous other compositions are also known (Cd\u2013Yb, Ti\u2013Zr\u2013Ni, Zn\u2013Mg\u2013Ho, Zn\u2013Mg\u2013Sc, In\u2013Ag\u2013Yb, Pd\u2013U\u2013Si, etc.). The molecular compound ferrocenecarboxylic acid is also known to form a quasicrystal in two dimensions.\nTwo types of quasicrystals are known. The first type, polygonal (dihedral) quasicrystals, have an axis of 8-, 10-, or 12-fold local symmetry (octagonal, decagonal, or dodecagonal quasicrystals, respectively). They are periodic along this axis or two-dimensional, and quasiperiodic in planes normal to it. The second type, icosahedral quasicrystals, are aperiodic in all directions. Icosahedral quasicrystals have a three dimensional quasiperiodic structure and possess fifteen 2-fold, ten 3-fold and six 5-fold axes in accordance with their icosahedral symmetry.\nQuasicrystals fall into three groups of different thermal stability:\nExcept for the Al\u2013Li\u2013Cu system, all the stable quasicrystals are almost free of defects and disorder, as evidenced by X-ray and electron diffraction revealing peak widths as sharp as those of perfect crystals such as Si. Diffraction patterns exhibit fivefold, threefold, and twofold symmetries, and reflections are arranged quasiperiodically in three dimensions.\nThe origin of the stabilization mechanism is different for the stable and metastable quasicrystals. Nevertheless, there is a common feature observed in most quasicrystal-forming liquid alloys or their undercooled liquids: a local icosahedral order. The icosahedral order is in equilibrium in the \"liquid state\" for the stable quasicrystals, whereas the icosahedral order prevails in the \"undercooled liquid state\" for the metastable quasicrystals.\nA nanoscale icosahedral phase was formed in Zr-, Cu- and Hf-based bulk metallic glasses alloyed with noble metals.\nMost quasicrystals have ceramic-like properties including high thermal and electrical resistance, hardness and brittleness, resistance to corrosion, and non-stick\nproperties. Many metallic quasicrystalline substances are impractical for most applications due to their thermal instability; the Al\u2013Cu\u2013Fe ternary system and the Al\u2013Cu\u2013Fe\u2013Cr and Al\u2013Co\u2013Fe\u2013Cr quaternary systems, thermally stable up to 700\u00a0\u00b0C, are notable exceptions.\nThe quasi-ordered droplet crystals could be formed under Dipolar forces in the Bose Einstein condensate. While the softcore Rydberg dressing interaction has forms triangular droplet-crystals, adding a Gaussian peak to the plateau type interaction would form multiple roton unstable points in the Bogoliubov spectrum. Therefore, the excitation around the roton instabilities would grow exponentially and form multiple allowed lattice constants leading to quasi-ordered periodic droplet crystals.\nApplications.\nQuasicrystalline substances have potential applications in several forms.\nMetallic quasicrystalline coatings can be applied by thermal spraying or magnetron sputtering. A problem that must be resolved is the tendency for cracking due to the materials' extreme brittleness. The cracking could be suppressed by reducing sample dimensions or coating thickness. Recent studies show typically brittle quasicrystals can exhibit remarkable ductility of over 50% strains at room temperature and sub-micrometer scales (&lt;500\u00a0nm).\nAn application was the use of low-friction Al\u2013Cu\u2013Fe\u2013Cr quasicrystals as a coating for frying pans. Food did not stick to it as much as to stainless steel making the pan moderately non-stick and easy to clean; heat transfer and durability were better than PTFE non-stick cookware and the pan was free from perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); the surface was very hard, claimed to be ten times harder than stainless steel, and not harmed by metal utensils or cleaning in a dishwasher; and the pan could withstand temperatures of without harm. However, after an initial introduction the pans were a chrome steel, probably because of the difficulty of controlling thin films of the quasicrystal.\nThe Nobel citation said that quasicrystals, while brittle, could reinforce steel \"like armor\". When Shechtman was asked about potential applications of quasicrystals he said that a precipitation-hardened stainless steel is produced that is strengthened by small quasicrystalline particles. It does not corrode and is extremely strong, suitable for razor blades and surgery instruments. The small quasicrystalline particles impede the motion of dislocation in the material.\nQuasicrystals were also being used to develop heat insulation, LEDs, diesel engines, and new materials that convert heat to electricity. Shechtman suggested new applications taking advantage of the low coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials, for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong, hard-wearing, low-friction plastic gears. The low heat conductivity of some quasicrystals makes them good for heat insulating coatings. One of the special properties of quasicrystals is their smooth surface, which despite the irregular atomic\nstructure, the surface of quasicrystals can be smooth and flat.\nOther potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion, broad-wavelength reflectors, and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility, low friction and corrosion resistance are required. Magnetron sputtering can be readily applied to other stable quasicrystalline alloys such as Al\u2013Pd\u2013Mn.\nNon-material science applications.\nApplications in macroscopic engineering have been suggested, building quasi-crystal-like large scale engineering structures, which could have interesting physical properties. Also, aperiodic tiling lattice structures may be used instead of isogrid or honeycomb patterns. The mechanical properties of honeycombs, based on a wide range of aperiodic tilings, have been investigated through simulation and physical testing of samples produced by 3D printing. The quasicrystal inspired honeycombs offer a broader range of mechanical properties than is available from commonly used honeycombs and are generally isotropic in the plane. Of particular note are honeycombs based on the aperiodic monotile, discovered by David Smith et al. These honeycombs offer planar isotropic zero Poisson's ratio, a rare elastic property that removes orthogonal deformation in response to an applied force. And, it has been shown that composite materials constructed of a hard matrix and a network of soft material mimicking the pattern of the aperiodic monotile can offer improved strength and toughness compared to similar composites using other patterns.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25381", "revid": "50349911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25381", "title": "Recreation", "text": "Activity of leisure\nRecreation is an activity of leisure, leisure being discretionary time. The \"need to do something for recreation\" is an essential element of human biology and psychology. Recreational activities are often done for enjoyment, amusement, or pleasure and are considered to be \"fun\".\nEtymology.\nThe term \"recreation\" appears to have been used in English first in the late 14th century, first in the sense of \"refreshment or curing of a sick person\", and derived turn from Latin (\"re\": \"again\", \"creare\": \"to create, bring forth, beget\").\nPrerequisites to leisure.\nPeople spend their time on activities of daily living, work, sleep, social duties and leisure, the latter time being free from prior commitments to physiologic or social needs, a prerequisite of recreation. Leisure has increased with increased longevity and, for many, with decreased hours spent for physical and economic survival, yet others argue that time pressure has increased for modern people, as they are committed to too many tasks. Other factors that account for an increased role of recreation are affluence, population trends, and increased commercialization of recreational offerings. While one perception is that leisure is just \"spare time\", time not consumed by the necessities of living, another holds that leisure is a force that allows individuals to consider and reflect on the values and realities that are missed in the activities of daily life, thus being an essential element of personal development and civilization. This direction of thought has even been extended to the view that leisure is the purpose of work, and a reward in itself, and \"leisure life\" reflects the values and character of a nation. Leisure is human right under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nPlay, recreation and work.\nRecreation is difficult to separate from the general concept of play, which is usually the term for children's recreational activity. Children may playfully imitate activities that reflect the realities of adult life. It has been proposed that play or recreational activities are outlets of or expression of excess energy, channeling it into socially acceptable activities that fulfill individual as well as societal needs, without need for compulsion, and providing satisfaction and pleasure for the participant. A traditional view holds that work is supported by recreation, recreation being useful to \"recharge the battery\" so that work performance is improved.\nWork, an activity generally performed out of economic necessity and useful for society and organized within the economic framework, however can also be pleasurable and may be self-imposed thus blurring the distinction to recreation. Many activities in entertainment are work for one person and recreation for another. Over time, a recreational activity may become work, and vice versa. Thus, for a musician, playing an instrument may be at one time a profession, and at another a recreation.\nSimilarly, it may be difficult to separate education from recreation as in the case of recreational mathematics.\nHealth and recreation.\nRecreation has many health benefits, and, accordingly, Therapeutic Recreation has been developed to take advantage of this effect. The National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) is the nationally recognized credentialing organization for the profession of Therapeutic Recreation. Professionals in the field of Therapeutic Recreation who are certified by the NCTRC are called \"Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialists\". The job title \"Recreation Therapist\" is identified in the U.S. Dept of Labor's Occupation Outlook. Such therapy is applied in rehabilitation, psychiatric facilities for youth and adults, and in the care of the elderly, the disabled, or people with chronic diseases. Recreational physical activity is important to reduce obesity, and the risk of osteoporosis and of cancer, most significantly in men that of colon and prostate, and in women that of the breast; however, not all malignancies are reduced as outdoor recreation has been linked to a higher risk of melanoma. Extreme adventure recreation naturally carries its own hazards.\nForms and activities.\nRecreation is an essential part of human life and finds many different forms which are shaped naturally by individual interests but also by the surrounding social construction. Recreational activities can be communal or solitary, active or passive, outdoors or indoors, healthy or harmful, and useful for society or detrimental. Some recreational activities \u2013 such as gambling, recreational drug use, or delinquent activities \u2013 may violate societal norms and laws. A list of typical activities could be almost endless.\nHobby.\nA significant section of recreational activities are designated as hobbies which are activities done for pleasure on a regular basis. A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time, not professionally and not for pay. Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more availability in leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies have increased with time.\nBricolage.\nBricolage and DIY are some of the terms describing the building, modifying, or repairing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals. Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where \"individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)\". DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as marketplace motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and identity enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness). They could involve crafts that require particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. Typical interests enjoyed by the maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as home improvement, electronics, robotics, 3-D printing, and the use of Computer Numeric Control tools, as well as more traditional activities such as metalworking, woodworking, and, mainly, its predecessor, traditional arts and crafts. The subculture stresses a cut-and-paste approach to standardized hobbyist technologies, and encourages cookbook re-use of designs published on websites and maker-oriented publications. There is a strong focus on using and learning practical skills and applying them to reference designs. There is also growing work on equity and the maker culture.\nGames.\nAny structured form of play could become a game. Games are played sometimes purely for recreation, sometimes for achievement or monetary rewards as well. They are played for recreation alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs. Professionals can play as part of their work for entertainment of the audience. The games could be board games, puzzles, computer or video games.\nOutdoor recreation.\nRecreation engaged in out of doors, most commonly in natural settings. The activities themselves \u2014 such as fishing, hunting, backpacking, and horseback riding \u2014 characteristically dependent on the environment practiced in. While many of these activities can be classified as sports, they do not all demand that a participant be an athlete. Competition generally is less stressed than in individual or team sports organized into opposing squads in pursuit of a trophy or championship. When the activity involves exceptional excitement, physical challenge, or risk, it is sometimes referred to as \"adventure recreation\" or \"adventure training\", rather than an extreme sport.\nOther traditional examples of outdoor recreational activities include hiking, camping, mountaineering, cycling, canoeing, caving, kayaking, rafting, rock climbing, running, sailing, skiing, sky diving and surfing. As new pursuits, often hybrids of prior ones, emerge, they gain their own identities, such as coasteering, canyoning, fastpacking, and plogging.\nPerforming arts.\nDance.\nParticipatory dance, whether it be a folk dance, a social dance, a group dance such as a line, circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance, as is common in Western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as entertainment, social interaction or exercise, by participants rather than onlookers. The many forms of dance provide recreation for all age groups and cultures.\nMusic creation.\nMusic is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from recreation, religious or ceremonial purposes, or for entertainment. When music was only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras in Europe, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on their instruments.\nPlaying video games.\nVideo games are immersive experiences that leave some of the aesthetics to be defined by the player while reserving the author's authority on the latter.\nVisual arts.\nWoodworking, photography, moviemaking, jewelry making, software projects such as Photoshopping and home music or video production, making bracelets, artistic projects such as drawing, painting, Cosplay (design, creation, and wearing of a costume based on an already existing creative property), creating models out of card stock or paper (called papercraft) fall under the category visual arts. Many of these are practised for recreation.\nDrawing.\nDrawing goes back at least 16,000 years to Paleolithic cave representations of animals such as those at Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain. In ancient Egypt, ink drawings on papyrus, often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on Greek vases, initially geometric, later developed to the human form with black-figure pottery during the 7th century BC.\nWith paper becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as Sandro Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.\nLiterature.\nWriting may involve letters, journals and web blogs.\nIn the US, about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year. About 5% read more than 50 books per year.\nPainting.\nLike drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the Chauvet and Lascaux caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer. Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of Ramses II, Nefertari, his queen, is depicted being led by Isis. Greek and Roman art like the Hellenistic Fayum mummy portraits and Battle of Issus at Pompeii contributed to Byzantine art in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting. Models of aeroplanes, boats, cars, tanks, artillery, and even figures of soldiers and superheroes are popular subjects to build, paint and display.\nPhotography.\nAn amateur photographer practices photography as a hobby/passion and not for monetary profit. The quality of some amateur work may be highly specialized or eclectic in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the Hand-held camera. Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, including the use of cell phone. Clear pictures can now be taken with a cell phone which is a key tool for making photography more accessible to everyone.\nOrganized recreation.\nMany recreational activities are organized, typically by public institutions, voluntary group-work agencies, private groups supported by membership fees, and commercial enterprises. Examples of each of these are the National Park Service, the YMCA, the Kiwanis, and Walt Disney World. Public space such as parks and beaches are essential venues for many recreational activities and Tourism has recognized that many visitors are specifically attracted by recreational offerings. In particular, beach and waterfront promenades such as the beach area of Venice Beach in California, the Promenade de la Croisette in Cannes, the Promenade des Anglais in Nice or the lungomare of Barcola with Miramare Castle in Trieste are important recreational areas for the city population on the one hand and on the other also important tourist destinations with all advantages and disadvantages for the locals.\nIn support of recreational activities government has taken an important role in their creation, maintenance, and organization, and whole industries have developed merchandise or services. Recreation-related business is an important factor in the economy; it has been estimated that the outdoor recreation sector alone contributes $730 billion annually to the U.S. economy and generates 6.5 million jobs.\nRecreation center.\nA recreation center is a place for recreational activities usually administered by a municipal government agency. Swimming, basketball, weightlifting, volleyball and kids' play areas are very common.\nRecreation as a career.\nA recreation specialist would be expected to meet the recreational needs of a community or assigned interest group. Educational institutions offer courses that lead to a degree as a Bachelor of Arts in recreation management. People with such degrees often work in parks and recreation centers in towns, on community projects and activities. Networking with instructors, budgeting, and evaluation of continuing programs are common job duties.\nIn the United States, most states have a professional organization for continuing education and certification in recreation management. The National Recreation and Park Association administers a certification program called the CPRP (Certified Park and Recreation Professional) that is considered a national standard for professional recreation specialist practices.\ne-commerce.\nSince the beginning of the 2000s, there are more and more online booking / ticketing platforms for recreational activities that emerged. Many of them leveraged the ever-growing prevalence of internet, mobile devices and e-payments to build comprehensive online booking solutions. The first successful batch includes tourist recreation activities platform like TripAdvisor that went public. The emergence of these platforms infers the rising needs for recreation and entertainment from the growing urban citizens worldwide.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25382", "revid": "14703151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25382", "title": "Recession", "text": "Business cycle contraction\nIn economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction that occurs when there is a period of broad decline in economic activity. Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock, the bursting of an economic bubble, or a large-scale anthropogenic or natural disaster (e.g. a pandemic). There is no official definition of a recession, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nIn the United States, a recession is defined as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.\" The European Union has adopted a similar definition. In the United Kingdom and Canada, a recession is defined as negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.\nGovernments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply and decreasing interest rates or increasing government spending and decreasing taxation.\nDefinitions.\nIn a 1974 article by \"The New York Times\", Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Julius Shiskin suggested that a rough translation of the bureau's qualitative definition of a recession into a quantitative one that almost anyone can use might run like this:\nOver the years, some commentators dropped most of Shiskin's \"recession-spotting\" criteria for the simplistic rule-of-thumb of a decline in real GNI for two consecutive quarters.\nIn the United States, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is generally seen as the authority for dating US recessions. The NBER, a private economic research organization, defines an economic recession as: \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales\". The NBER also explains that: \"a recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when the economy reaches its trough.\" The NBER is considered the official arbiter of recession start and end dates for the United States. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, an independent federal agency that provides official macroeconomic and industry statistics, says \"the often-cited identification of a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth is not an official designation\" and that instead, \"The designation of a recession is the province of a committee of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research\".\nThe European Union, akin to the NBER's methodology, has embraced a definition of recession that integrates GDP alongside a spectrum of macroeconomic indicators, including employment and various other metrics. This approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of the depth and breadth of economic downturns, enabling policymakers to devise more effective strategies for economic stabilization and recovery.\nRecessions in the United Kingdom are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by the seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter figures for real GDP.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization, defines a recession as a period of at least two years during which the cumulative output gap reaches at least 2% of GDP, and the output gap is at least 1% for at least one year.\n\"GDP per capita recession\" refers to the decline of GDP per capita instead of decline of total GDP.\nAttributes.\nA recession encompasses multiple attributes that often occur simultaneously and encompasses declines in component measures of economic activity, such as GDP, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net export activity. These summary measures are indicative of underlying drivers such as employment levels and skills, household savings rates, corporate investment decisions, interest rates, demographics, and government policies (Smith, 2018; Johnson &amp; Thompson, 2020). By examining these factors comprehensively, economists gain insights into the complex dynamics that contribute to economic downturns and can formulate effective strategies for mitigating their impact (Anderson, 2019; Patel, 2017).\nEconomist Richard C. Koo wrote that under ideal conditions, a country's economy should have the household sector as net savers and the corporate sector as net borrowers, with the government budget nearly balanced and net exports near zero.\nA severe (GDP down by 10%) or prolonged (three or four years) recession is referred to as an economic depression, although some argue that their causes and cures can be different. As an informal shorthand, economists sometimes refer to different recession shapes, such as V-shaped, U-shaped, L-shaped and W-shaped recessions.\nType of recession or shape.\nThe type and shape of recessions are distinctive. In the US, v-shaped, or short-and-sharp contractions followed by rapid and sustained recovery, occurred in 1954 and 1990\u20131991; U-shaped (prolonged slump) in 1974\u20131975, and W-shaped, or double-dip recessions in 1949 and 1980\u20131982. Japan's 1993\u20131994 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997\u20131999 can be described as L-shaped. Korea, Hong Kong and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997\u20131998, although Thailand's eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.\nFront end of a recession.\nDescribes the early stages of an economic downturn with emerging negative trends across key economic sectors before a full-blown deepening recession is officially declared. Characteristics: Indicators like GDP growth, employment rates, and consumer spending start to decline. A decline in overall demand causes a slowdown in economic activity. Falling consumer confidence, falling retail sales and reduced business investment are common signs that indicate the beginning of a recession. This phase of the economic cycle can also be marked by slowing economic growth with factors like declining corporate profit margins (due to lower sales and increased costs), weakening business investment, falling industrial production (continued decline in overall manufacturing hours worked) and a deteriorating sluggish labor market (layoffs becoming more common, e.g. falling private payrolls, declining small business household employment), slower payroll growth, wage stagnation or decline and a housing market slowdown as real estate buyers in the housing sector become more cautious (followed by declines in home sales, slowing building permits and falling home prices). In financial markets some investors may become more risk-averse and bond yields may rise thereby making it more expensive for companies to borrow money, causing some businesses to struggle to meet their financial obligations.\nSummary: The front end of a recession refers to the initial phase or onset of a recession. It typically is a period of increasing economic stress (job losses often appear early on), significant uncertainty and precedes the official recognition of a recession (the technical definition of a recession is two or more consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth), signaling that the economy is transitioning toward contraction, even before the full effects are felt or officially declared. Early warning indicators can be rising inflation (potential for tighter monetary policy), widening credit spreads (tightening lending standards, strained private sector lending), rising credit delinquencies and an inverted yield curve (market expectation of much lower growth ahead, a historically reliable predictor of an approaching recession). Recessions especially in the U.S. are typically \"preceded by a rising debt service ratio for the private sector\". Some economists also consider a rising 3-month average unemployment rate above the prior year's average as an early recession signal that can precede a formal recession declaration (this is often referred to as the Sahm Rule.). The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) can also provide an early recession indication. Other \"soft\" consumer signals also tend to appear in everyday life before official statistics catch up, like slower travel (e.g. fewer flights). More early warning indicators can be found in the section \"Predictors\" Recession#Predictors. Identifying the front end of a recession is crucial for policymakers as it gives more room to act early and thereby allows for early intervention to potentially mitigate the impact of a recession before the downturn deepens.\nThe table below illustrates the progression toward recession. Each column represents a distinct phase in the economic cycle.\nBack end of a recession.\nDescribes the latter part of an economic contraction, specifically the period after the trough (the lowest point of economic activity during a recession) when the economy begins to recover. Characteristics: Indicators like employment and consumer spending transition from decline to growth. Decreasing unemployment, stabilizing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), increased business investment are common signs. Summary: The back end of a recession is a period of gradual and sustained recovery where parts of the economy start to grow again.\nPsychological aspects.\nRecessions have psychological and confidence aspects. For example, if companies expect economic activity to slow, they may reduce employment levels and save money rather than invest. Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession. Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment. The term animal spirits has been used to describe the psychological factors underlying economic activity. Keynes, in his \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\", was the first economist to claim that such emotional mindsets significantly affect the economy. Economist Robert J. Shiller wrote that the term \"refers also to the sense of trust we have in each other, our sense of fairness in economic dealings, and our sense of the extent of corruption and bad faith. When animal spirits are on ebb, consumers do not want to spend and businesses do not want to make capital expenditures or hire people.\"\nBehavioral economics has also explained many psychological biases that may trigger a recession including the availability heuristic, the money illusion, and normalcy bias.\nBalance sheet recession.\nExcessive levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause what is called a \"balance sheet recession\". This occurs when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term balance sheet derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the financial crisis was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt\u2014that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\". In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.\nFor example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have negative equity, meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero interest rates and expansion of the money supply to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type Great Depression, in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities. In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.\nKrugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept in 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained deficit spending when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates), disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).\nA July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by household leverage levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the subprime mortgage crisis. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects (Smith &amp; Johnson, 2012).\nLiquidity trap.\nA liquidity trap is a Keynesian theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero (zero interest-rate policy) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; increasing the money supply is like \"pushing on a string\". Economist Paul Krugman described the U.S. 2009 recession and Japan's lost decade as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via quantitative easing or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating inflationary expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and mercantilist policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand. He estimated in March 2010 that developed countries representing 70% of the world's GDP were caught in a liquidity trap.\nParadoxes of thrift and deleveraging.\nBehavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately, one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist Hyman Minsky also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.\nCauses of recessions.\nThere are many reasons why recessions happen. One overall reason can be lack of demand due to sharp developments in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services. Another main reason can be problems e.g. in financial markets. Because recessions have many likely explanations, it is demanding to predict them. Some variables might at first glance be the causes of recessions, but they could also be the results of a recession, which means they are endogenous to recessions. One can summarize the causes of recessions in the following categories:\nEconomic factors:\nFinancial factors:\nExternal shocks\nPredictors.\nRecessions are very challenging to predict. While some variables like the (inverted) yield curve appear to be more useful to predict a recession ahead of time than other variables, no single variable has proven to be an always reliable predictor whether recessions will actually (soon) appear, let alone predicting their sharpness and severity in terms of duration. The longest and deepest Treasury yield curve inversion in history began in July 2022, as the Federal Reserve sharply increased the fed funds rate to combat the 2021\u20132023 inflation surge. Despite widespread predictions by economists and market analysts of an imminent recession, none had materialized by July 2024, economic growth remained steady, and a Reuters survey of economists that month found they expected the economy to continue growing for the next two years. An earlier survey of bond market strategists found a majority no longer believed an inverted curve to be a reliable recession predictor. The curve began re-steepening toward positive territory in June 2024, as it had at other points during that inversion; in every previous inversion they examined; Deutsche Bank analysts found the curve had re-steepened before a recession began. The following variables and indicators are used by economists, like e.g. Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz, to try to predict the possibility of a recession:\nExcept for the above, there are no known completely reliable predictors. Analysis by Prakash Loungani of the International Monetary Fund found that only two of the sixty recessions around the world during the 1990s had been predicted by a consensus of economists one year earlier, while there were zero consensus predictions one year earlier for the 49 recessions during 2009.\nHowever, the following are considered possible predictors:\nManufacturing:\nIndustrial Production:\nChemical Activity:\nTransportation:\nCorporate Profits:\nEmployment:\nPersonal Income:\nHousehold Savings and Consumer Debt:\nRetail Sales, Consumer Confidence and Consumer Expenditures:\nHousing and non-residential construction:\nCredit Markets:\nBusiness Expectations:\nMargin of stock market traders:\nEquity allocations of fund managers:\nAsset Prices:\nGross Domestic Product:\nUnorthodox Recession Indicators:\nOverview of recession indicators:\nGovernment responses.\nKeynesian economists favor the use of expansionary macroeconomic policy during recessions to increase aggregate demand. Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. Monetarists, exemplified by economist Milton Friedman, would favor the use of limited expansionary monetary policy, while Keynesian economists may advocate increased government spending to spark economic growth. Supply-side economists promote tax cuts to stimulate business capital investment. For example, the Trump administration claimed that lower effective tax rates on new investment imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would raise investment, thereby making workers more productive and raising output and wages. Investment patterns in the United States through 2019, however, indicated that the supply-side incentives of the TCJA had little effect on investment growth. Although investments increased after 2017, much of the increase was a response to oil prices, and investment in other sectors had negligible growth.\nMonetarist economists have argued that objectives of monetary policy, i.e., controlling the money supply to influence interest rates, are best achieved by targeting the growth rate of the money supply. They maintain that money may affect output in the short term but that in the long run, expansionary monetary policy leads to inflation only. Keynesian economists have mostly adopted this analysis, modifying the theory with better integration of short and long run trends and an understanding that a change in the money supply \"affects only nominal variables in the economy, such as prices and wages, and has no effect on real variables, like employment and output\". The Federal Reserve traditionally uses monetary accommodation, a policy instrument of lowering its main benchmark interest rate, to accommodate sudden supply-side shifts in the economy. When the federal funds rate reaches the boundary of an interest rate of 0%, called the zero lower bound, the government resorts to unconventional monetary policy to stimulate recovery.\nGauti B. Eggertsson of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, using a New Keynesian macroeconomic model for policy analysis, writes that cutting taxes on labor or capital is contractionary under certain circumstances, such as those that prevailed following the economic crisis of 2008, and that temporarily increasing government spending at such times has much larger effects than under normal conditions. He says other forms of tax cuts, such as a reduction in sales taxes and investment tax credits, e.g., in the context of Japan's \"Great Recession\", are also very effective. Eggertsson infers from his analysis that the contractionary effects of labor and capital tax cuts, and the strong expansionary effect of government spending, are peculiar to the unusual environment created by zero interest rates. He asserts that with positive interest rates a labor tax cut is expansionary, per the established literature, but at zero interest rates, it reverses and tax cuts become contractionary. Further, while capital tax cuts are inconsequential in his model with a positive interest rate, they become strongly negative at zero, and the multiplier of government spending is then almost five times larger.\nPaul Krugman wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because indebted households were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: \"The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can't spend the way they used to, they're having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what's actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more\u2014and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained...\"\nJohn Maynard Keynes believed that government institutions could stimulate aggregate demand in a crisis.\nStock market.\nSome recessions have been anticipated by stock market declines. In \"Stocks for the Long Run\", Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were not followed by a recession.\nThe real estate market also usually weakens before a recession. However, real estate declines can last much longer than recessions.\nSince the business cycle is very hard to predict, Siegel has argued that it is not possible to take advantage of economic cycles for timing investments. Even the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) takes a few months to determine if a peak or trough has occurred in the US.\nConsequences.\nUnemployment.\nUnemployment is particularly high during a recession. Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a natural rate of unemployment which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to estimate the GDP gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0%, so it is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy, unless it exceeds the \"natural rate\", in which case the excess corresponds directly to a loss in the GDP.\nThe full impact of a recession on employment may not be felt for several quarters. After recessions in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s, it took five years for unemployment to fall back to its original levels. Employment discrimination claims rise during a recession.\nBusiness.\nProductivity tends to fall in the early stages of a recession, then rises again as weaker firms close. The variation in profitability between firms rises sharply. The fall in productivity could also be attributed to several macro-economic factors, such as the loss in productivity observed across the UK due to Brexit, which may create a mini-recession in the region. Global epidemics, such as COVID-19, could be another example, since they disrupt the global supply chain or prevent the movement of goods, services, and people.\nRecessions have also provided opportunities for anti-competitive mergers, with a negative impact on the wider economy; the suspension of competition policy in the United States in the 1930s may have extended the Great Depression.\nSocial effects.\nThe living standards of people dependent on wages and salaries are more affected by recessions than those who rely on fixed incomes or welfare benefits. The loss of a job has a negative impact on the stability of families, and individuals' health and well-being.\nHistory.\nGlobal.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \"Global recessions seem to occur over a cycle lasting between eight and 10 years.\" The IMF takes many factors into account when defining a global recession. Until April 2009, IMF several times communicated to the press, that a global annual real GDP growth of 3.0% or less in their view was \"equivalent to a global recession\".\nBy this measure, six periods since 1970 qualify: 1974\u20131975, 1980\u20131983, 1990\u20131993, 1998, 2001\u20132002, and 2008\u20132009. During what IMF in April 2002 termed the past three global recessions of the last three decades, global per capita output growth was zero or negative, and IMF argued\u2014at that time\u2014that because of the opposite being found for 2001, the economic state in this year by itself did not qualify as a \"global recession\".\nIn April 2009, IMF had changed their Global recession definition to \"A decline in annual per\u2011capita real World GDP (purchasing power parity weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, per\u2011capita investment, and per\u2011capita consumption.\" By this new definition, a total of four global recessions took place since World War II: 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009. All of them only lasted one year, although the third would have lasted three years (1991\u20131993) if IMF as criteria had used the normal exchange rate weighted per\u2011capita real World GDP rather than the purchase power parity weighted per\u2011capita real World GDP.\nAustralia.\nAs a result of late 1920s profit issues in agriculture and cutbacks, 1931\u20131932 saw Australia's biggest recession in its entire history. It fared better than other nations that underwent depressions, but their poor economic states influenced Australia, which depended on them for export, as well as foreign investments. The nation also benefited from greater productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with lessening the effects.\nThe economy had gone into a brief recession in 1961 because of a credit squeeze. Australia was facing a rising level of inflation in 1973, caused partially by the oil crisis happening in that same year, which brought inflation at a 13% increase. Economic recession hit by the middle of the year 1974, with no change in policy enacted by the government as a measure to counter the economic situation of the country. Consequently, the unemployment level rose and the trade deficit increased significantly.\nAnother recession came at the beginning of the 1990s as the result of a major stock collapse in October 1987, referred to now as Black Monday. Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession was not limited to the United States, but it also affected partnering nations such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.\nAustralia next went into recession in March 2020, due to the impact of huge bush fires and the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on tourism and other important aspects of the economy. This recession, while steep, only lasted until May 2020.\nEuropean Union.\nThe Eurozone experienced a recession in 2012: the economies of the 17-nation region failed to grow during any quarter of the 2012 calendar year. The recession deepened during the final quarter of the year, with the French, German and Italian economies all affected.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the 2020 recession attributed to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the first recession since the Great Recession.\nUnited States.\nAccording to economists, since 1854, the U.S. has encountered 32 cycles of expansions and contractions, with an average of 17 months of contraction and 38 months of expansion. From 1980 to 2018 there were only eight periods of negative economic growth over one fiscal quarter or more, and four periods considered recessions:\nFor the last three of these recessions, the NBER decision has approximately conformed with the definition involving two consecutive quarters of decline. While the 2001 recession did not involve two consecutive quarters of decline, it was preceded by two quarters of alternating decline and weak growth.\nSince then, the NBER has also declared a 2-month COVID-19 recession for February 2020 \u2013 April 2020.\nNBER has sometimes declared a recession before a second quarter of GDP shrinkage has been reported, but beginnings and endings can also be declared over a year after they are reckoned to have occurred. In 1947, NBER did not declare a recession despite two quarters of declining GDP, due to strong economic activity reported for employment, industrial production, and consumer spending.\nAn administration generally gets credit or blame for the state of the economy during its time in office; this state of affairs has caused disagreements about how particular recessions actually started.\nFor example, the 1981 recession is thought to have been caused by the tight-money policy adopted by Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before Ronald Reagan took office. Reagan supported that policy. Economist Walter Heller, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the 1960s, said that \"I call it a Reagan-Volcker-Carter recession.\"\nLate 2000s.\nOfficial economic data shows that a substantial number of nations were in recession as of early 2009. The US entered a recession at the end of 2007, and 2008 saw many other nations follow suit. The US recession of 2007 ended in June 2009 as the nation entered the current economic recovery. The timeline of the Great Recession details the many elements of this period.\nUnited States.\nThe United States housing market correction (a consequence of the United States housing bubble) and subprime mortgage crisis significantly contributed to a recession.\nThe 2007\u20132009 recession saw private consumption fall for the first time in nearly 20 years. This indicated the depth and severity of the recession. With consumer confidence so low, economic recovery took a long time. Consumers in the U.S. were hit hard by the Great Recession, with the value of their houses dropping and their pension savings decimated on the stock market.\nU.S. employers shed 63,000 jobs in February 2008, the most in five years. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said on 6 April 2008 that \"There is more than a 50 percent chance the United States could go into recession.\" On 1 October, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that an additional 156,000 jobs had been lost in September. On 29 April 2008, Moody's declared that nine US states were in a recession. In November 2008, employers eliminated 533,000 jobs, the largest single-month loss in 34 years. In 2008, an estimated 2.6 million U.S. jobs were eliminated.\nThe unemployment rate in the U.S. grew to 8.5% in March 2009, and there were 5.1 million job losses by March 2009 since the recession began in December 2007. That was about five million more people unemployed compared to just a year prior, which was the largest annual jump in the number of unemployed persons since the 1940s.\nAlthough the US economy grew in the first quarter by 1%, by June 2008 some analysts stated that due to a protracted credit crisis and \"rampant inflation in commodities such as oil, food, and steel\", the country was nonetheless in a recession. The third quarter of 2008 brought on a GDP retraction of 0.5%, the biggest decline since 2001. The 6.4% decline in spending during Q3 on non-durable goods, like clothing and food, was the largest since 1950.\nA November 2008 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on the survey of 51 forecasters, suggested that the recession started in April 2008 and would last 14 months. They projected real GDP declining at an annual rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2009. These forecasts represented significant downward revisions from the forecasts of three months prior.\nA December 2008 report from the National Bureau of Economic Research stated that the U.S. had been in a recession since December 2007, when economic activity peaked, based on several measures including job losses, declines in personal income, and declines in real GDP. By July 2009, a growing number of economists believed that the recession may have ended. The National Bureau of Economic Research announced on 20 September 2010 that the 2008/2009 recession ended in June 2009, making it the longest recession since World War II. Prior to the start of the recession, it appears that no known formal theoretical or empirical model was able to accurately predict the advance of this recession, except for minor signals in the sudden rise of forecasted probabilities, which were still well under 50%.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The initialism \"RSA\" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. An equivalent system was developed secretly in 1973 at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency, by the English mathematician Clifford Cocks. That system was declassified in 1997.\nRSA is used in digital signature such as RSASSA-PSS or RSA-FDH,\npublic-key encryption of very short messages (almost always a single-use symmetric key in a hybrid cryptosystem) such as RSAES-OAEP,\nand public-key key encapsulation.\nIn RSA-based cryptography, a user's \"private key\"\u2014which can be used to sign messages, or decrypt messages sent to that user\u2014is a pair of large prime numbers chosen at random and kept secret.\nA user's \"public key\"\u2014which can be used to verify messages from the user, or encrypt messages so that only that user can decrypt them\u2014is the product of the prime numbers.\nThe security of RSA is related to the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the \"factoring problem\". Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem. Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem is an open question. There are no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used.\nHistory.\nThe idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976. They also introduced digital signatures and attempted to apply number theory. Their formulation used a shared-secret-key created from exponentiation of some number, modulo a prime number. However, they left open the problem of realizing a one-way function, possibly because the difficulty of factoring was not well-studied at the time. Moreover, like Diffie-Hellman, RSA is based on modular exponentiation.\nRon Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made several attempts over the course of a year to create a function that was hard to invert. Rivest and Shamir, as computer scientists, proposed many potential functions, while Adleman, as a mathematician, was responsible for finding their weaknesses. They tried many approaches, including \"knapsack-based\" and \"permutation polynomials\". For a time, they thought what they wanted to achieve was impossible due to contradictory requirements. In April 1977, they spent Passover at the house of a student and drank a good deal of wine before returning to their homes at around midnight. Rivest, unable to sleep, lay on the couch with a math textbook and started thinking about their one-way function. He spent the rest of the night formalizing his idea, and he had much of the paper ready by daybreak. The algorithm is now known as RSA\u00a0\u2013 the initials of their surnames in same order as their paper.\nClifford Cocks, an English mathematician working for the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), described a similar system in an internal document in 1973. However, given the relatively expensive computers needed to implement it at the time, it was considered to be mostly a curiosity and, as far as is publicly known, was never deployed. His ideas and concepts were not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification.\nKid-RSA (KRSA) is a simplified, insecure public-key cipher published in 1997, designed for educational purposes. Kid-RSA gives insight into RSA and other public-key ciphers, analogous to simplified DES.\nPatent.\nA patent describing the RSA algorithm was granted to MIT on 20 September 1983: https:// \"Cryptographic communications system and method\". From DWPI's abstract of the patent:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The system includes a communications channel coupled to at least one terminal having an encoding device and to at least one terminal having a decoding device. A message-to-be-transferred is enciphered to ciphertext at the encoding terminal by encoding the message as a number M in a predetermined set. That number is then raised to a first predetermined power (associated with the intended receiver) and finally computed. The remainder or residue, C, is... computed when the exponentiated number is divided by the product of two predetermined prime numbers (associated with the intended receiver).\nA detailed description of the algorithm was published in August 1977, in \"Scientific American\"'s Mathematical Games column. This preceded the patent's filing date of December 1977. Consequently, the patent had no legal standing outside the United States. Had Cocks' work been publicly known, a patent in the United States would not have been legal either.\nWhen the patent was issued, terms of patent were 17 years. The patent was about to expire on 21 September 2000, but RSA Security released the algorithm to the public domain on 6 September 2000.\nOperation.\nThe RSA algorithm involves four steps: key generation, key distribution, public-key operation (used for encryption or verifying a signature), and private key operation (used for decryption or signing a message).\nA basic principle behind RSA is the observation that it is practical to find three very large positive integers e, d, and n, such that for all integers x (0 \u2264 \"x\" &lt; \"n\"), both (\"x\"\"e\")\"d\" and x have the same remainder when divided by n (they are congruent modulo n):formula_1However, when given only e and n, it is infeasible to compute eth roots modulo n; that is, for uniform random y (0 \u2264 \"y\" &lt; \"n\"), it is extremely difficult to find x such that \"x\"\"e\" \u2261 \"y\" (mod \"n\").\nThe integers n and e form the public key and d is the private key. The modular exponentiation to the power of e is used in encryption and in verifying signatures, and exponentiation to the power of d is used in decryption and in signing messages.\nKey generation.\nThe keys for the RSA algorithm are generated in the following way:\nThe \"public key\" consists of the modulus n and the public exponent e. The \"private key\" consists of the private exponent d, which must be kept secret. p, q, and \"\u03bb\"(\"n\") must also be kept secret because they can be used to calculate d. In fact, they can all be discarded after d has been computed.\nIn the original RSA paper, the Euler totient function \"\u03c6\"(\"n\") = (\"p\" \u2212 1)(\"q\" \u2212 1) is used instead of \"\u03bb\"(\"n\") for calculating the private exponent d. Since \"\u03c6\"(\"n\") is always divisible by \"\u03bb\"(\"n\"), the algorithm works as well. The possibility of using Euler totient function results also from Lagrange's theorem applied to the multiplicative group of integers modulo \"pq\". Thus any d satisfying \"d\"\u22c5\"e\" \u2261 1 (mod \"\u03c6\"(\"n\")) also satisfies \"d\"\u22c5\"e\" \u2261 1 (mod \"\u03bb\"(\"n\")). However, computing d modulo \"\u03c6\"(\"n\") will sometimes yield a result that is larger than necessary (i.e. \"d\" &gt; \"\u03bb\"(\"n\")). Most of the implementations of RSA will accept exponents generated using either method (if they use the private exponent d at all, rather than using the optimized decryption method based on the Chinese remainder theorem described below), but some standards such as https:// (Section B.3.1) may require that \"d\" &lt; \"\u03bb\"(\"n\"). Any \"oversized\" private exponents not meeting this criterion may always be reduced modulo \"\u03bb\"(\"n\") to obtain a smaller equivalent exponent.\nNote: The authors of the original RSA paper carry out the key generation by choosing d and then computing e as the modular multiplicative inverse of d modulo \"\u03c6\"(\"n\"), whereas most current implementations of RSA, such as those following PKCS#1, do the reverse\u2014choose e and compute d from it. Since e can safely be small and fixed, whereas d must be chosen from a large enough space to resist attack, the modern approach can reduce the cost of the public-key operation without loss of security.\nKey distribution.\nSuppose that Bob wants to send secret messages to Alice, or verify messages from Alice. If they decide to use RSA, Bob must know Alice's public key to encrypt his secret messages or verify Alice's messages, and Alice must use her private key to decrypt Bob's secret messages or sign her own messages.\nTo enable Bob to send his encrypted messages or verify her future messages, Alice transmits her public key (\"n\", \"e\") to Bob via a reliable, but not necessarily secret, route. Alice's private key (\"d\") is never distributed.\nEncryption.\nAfter Bob obtains Alice's public key, he can send a message M to Alice.\nTo do it, he first turns M into an integer m, the padded plaintext, such that 0 \u2264 \"m\" &lt; \"n\", by using an agreed-upon reversible protocol known as a padding scheme. He then computes the ciphertext c, using Alice's public key e, by:\nformula_2\nThis can be done reasonably quickly, even for very large numbers, using modular exponentiation. Bob then transmits c to Alice. Note that at least nine values of m will yield a ciphertext c equal to\nm, but this is very unlikely to occur in practice.\nDecryption.\nAlice can recover m from c by using her private key exponent d by computing\nformula_3\nGiven m, she can recover the original message M by reversing the padding scheme, or discard it as corrupted if the padding is invalid.\nAlice must discard m if the padding is invalid: if she reveals any information about m when it has invalid padding, an adversary could exploit this to decrypt (or sign) messages without knowing the private key, by sending her random or maliciously crafted ciphertexts and observing how she responds.\nExample.\nHere is an example of RSA encryption and decryption, ignoring the details of padding:\nThe public key is (\"n\" = 3233, \"e\" = 17). For a padded plaintext message m, the encryption function is\nformula_11\nThe private key is (\"n\" = 3233, \"d\" = 413). For an encrypted ciphertext c, the decryption function is\nformula_12\nFor instance, in order to encrypt \"m\" = 65, one calculates\nformula_13\nTo decrypt \"c\" = 2790, one calculates\nformula_14\nBoth of these calculations can be computed efficiently using the square-and-multiply algorithm for modular exponentiation. In real-life situations the primes selected would be much larger; in our example it would be trivial to factor \"n\" = 3233 (obtained from the freely available public key) back to the primes p and q. e, also from the public key, is then inverted to get d, thus acquiring the private key.\nPractical implementations use the Chinese remainder theorem to speed up the calculation using modulus of factors (mod \"pq\" using mod \"p\" and mod \"q\").\nThe values d\"p\", d\"q\" and qinv, which are part of the private key are computed as follows:\nformula_15\nHere is how d\"p\", d\"q\" and qinv are used for efficient decryption (encryption is efficient by choice of a suitable d and e pair):\nformula_16\nSigning.\nSuppose Alice wishes to send a signed message m to Bob. She produces a hash value \"h\" &amp;equals; hash(\"m\") of the message m, raises it to the power of d (modulo n), and attaches \"s\" &amp;equals; \"h\"\"d\" mod \"n\" as a \"signature\" to the message.\nVerifying.\nWhen Bob receives the message m and signature s, he uses the same hash algorithm in conjunction with Alice's public key to compute \"h\" &amp;equals; hash(\"m\"). He raises the signature s to the power of e (modulo n), and compares the resulting hash value with the message's hash value: formula_17 If the two agree, he knows that the author of the message was in possession of Alice's private key and that the message has not been tampered with since being sent.\nThis equation is satisfied when \"s\" &amp;equals; \"h\"\"d\" mod \"n\" because of exponentiation rules:\nformula_18\nThe modular exponentiation for signing and verification is the same underlying mathematics as for decryption and encryption, but all the other details of padding scheme for secure public-key encryption and hashing for secure digital signature are different.\nThe use of a hash, first proposed in 1978 by Michael O. Rabin in the related Rabin signature algorithm,\nand the security of the hash, is essential for security of the signature: if Alice and Bob skipped the hash, and Bob checked for \"s\"\"e\" \u2261 \"m\" (mod \"n\") instead, then anyone could forge the signature \"s\" &amp;equals; 1 on the message \"m\" &amp;equals; 1, or take two signed messages (\"m\"1, \"s\"1) and (\"m\"2, \"s\"2) from Alice and then forge a third by multiplication, (\"m\"1\"m\"2, \"s\"1\"s\"2), without knowledge of the private key.\nProofs of correctness.\nProof using Fermat's little theorem.\nThe proof of the correctness of RSA is based on Fermat's little theorem, stating that \"a\"\"p\" \u2212 1 \u2261 1 (mod \"p\") for any integer a and prime p, not dividing a.\nWe want to show that\nformula_19\nfor every integer m when p and q are distinct prime numbers and e and d are positive integers satisfying \"ed\" \u2261 1 (mod \"\u03bb\"(\"pq\")).\nSince \"\u03bb\"(\"pq\") = lcm(\"p\" \u2212 1, \"q\" \u2212 1) is, by construction, divisible by both \"p\" \u2212 1 and \"q\" \u2212 1, we can write\nformula_20\nfor some nonnegative integers h and k.\nTo check whether two numbers, such as m\"ed\" and m, are congruent mod\u00a0\"pq\", it suffices (and in fact is equivalent) to check that they are congruent mod\u00a0\"p\" and mod\u00a0\"q\" separately.\nTo show \"med\" \u2261 \"m\" (mod \"p\"), we consider two cases:\nThe verification that \"med\" \u2261 \"m\" (mod \"q\") proceeds in a completely analogous way:\nThis completes the proof that, for any integer m, and integers e, d such that \"ed\" \u2261 1 (mod \"\u03bb\"(\"pq\")),\nformula_23\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProof using Euler's theorem.\nAlthough the original paper of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman used Fermat's little theorem to explain why RSA works, it is common to find proofs that rely instead on Euler's theorem.\nWe want to show that \"med\" \u2261 \"m\" (mod \"n\"), where \"n\" = \"pq\" is a product of two different prime numbers, and e and d are positive integers satisfying \"ed\" \u2261 1 (mod \"\u03c6\"(\"n\")). Since e and d are positive, we can write \"ed\" = 1 + \"h\u03c6\"(\"n\") for some non-negative integer h. \"Assuming\" that m is relatively prime to n, we have\nformula_24\nwhere the second-last congruence follows from Euler's theorem.\nMore generally, for any e and d satisfying \"ed\" \u2261 1 (mod \"\u03bb\"(\"n\")), the same conclusion follows from Carmichael's generalization of Euler's theorem, which states that \"m\"\"\u03bb\"(n) \u2261 1 (mod \"n\") for all m relatively prime to n.\nWhen m is not relatively prime to n, the argument just given is invalid. This is highly improbable (only a proportion of 1/\"p\" + 1/\"q\" \u2212 1/(\"pq\") numbers have this property), but even in this case, the desired congruence is still true. Either \"m\" \u2261 0 (mod \"p\") or \"m\" \u2261 0 (mod \"q\"), and these cases can be treated using the previous proof.\nPadding.\nAttacks against plain RSA.\nThere are a number of attacks against plain RSA as described below.\nPadding schemes.\nTo avoid these problems, practical RSA implementations typically embed some form of structured, randomized padding into the value m before encrypting it. This padding ensures that m does not fall into the range of insecure plaintexts, and that a given message, once padded, will encrypt to one of a large number of different possible ciphertexts.\nStandards such as PKCS#1 have been carefully designed to securely pad messages prior to RSA encryption. Because these schemes pad the plaintext m with some number of additional bits, the size of the un-padded message M must be somewhat smaller. RSA padding schemes must be carefully designed so as to prevent sophisticated attacks that may be facilitated by a predictable message structure. Early versions of the PKCS#1 standard (up to version 1.5) used a construction that appears to make RSA semantically secure. However, at Crypto 1998, Bleichenbacher showed that this version is vulnerable to a practical adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack. Furthermore, at Eurocrypt 2000, Coron et al. showed that for some types of messages, this padding does not provide a high enough level of security. Later versions of the standard include Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), which prevents these attacks. As such, OAEP should be used in any new application, and PKCS#1\u00a0v1.5 padding should be replaced wherever possible. The PKCS#1 standard also incorporates processing schemes designed to provide additional security for RSA signatures, e.g. the Probabilistic Signature Scheme for RSA (RSA-PSS).\nSecure padding schemes such as RSA-PSS are as essential for the security of message signing as they are for message encryption. Two USA patents on PSS were granted (https:// and https://); however, these patents expired on 24 July 2009 and 25 April 2010 respectively. Use of PSS no longer seems to be encumbered by patents. Note that using different RSA key pairs for encryption and signing is potentially more secure.\nSecurity and practical considerations.\nUsing the Chinese remainder algorithm.\nFor efficiency, many popular crypto libraries (such as OpenSSL, Java and .NET) use for decryption and signing the following optimization based on the Chinese remainder theorem. The following values are precomputed and stored as part of the private key:\nThese values allow the recipient to compute the exponentiation \"m\" = \"c\"\"d\" (mod \"pq\") more efficiently as follows:\nformula_30,\nformula_31,\nformula_32,\nformula_33.\nThis is more efficient than computing exponentiation by squaring, even though two modular exponentiations have to be computed. The reason is that these two modular exponentiations both use a smaller exponent and a smaller modulus.\nInteger factorization and the RSA problem.\nThe security of the RSA cryptosystem is based on two mathematical problems: the problem of factoring large numbers and the RSA problem. Full decryption of an RSA ciphertext is thought to be infeasible on the assumption that both of these problems are hard, i.e., no efficient algorithm exists for solving them. Providing security against \"partial\" decryption may require the addition of a secure padding scheme.\nThe RSA problem is defined as the task of taking eth roots modulo a composite n: recovering a value m such that \"c\" \u2261 \"m\"\"e\" (mod \"n\"), where (\"n\", \"e\") is an RSA public key, and c is an RSA ciphertext. Currently the most promising approach to solving the RSA problem is to factor the modulus n. With the ability to recover prime factors, an attacker can compute the secret exponent d from a public key (\"n\", \"e\"), then decrypt c using the standard procedure. To accomplish this, an attacker factors n into p and q, and computes lcm(\"p\" \u2212 1, \"q\" \u2212 1) that allows the determination of d from e. No polynomial-time method for factoring large integers on a classical computer has yet been found, but it has not been proven that none exists; see integer factorization for a discussion of this problem.\nThe first RSA-512 factorization in 1999 used hundreds of computers and required the equivalent of 8,400 MIPS years, over an elapsed time of about seven months. By 2009, Benjamin Moody could factor an 512-bit RSA key in 73 days using only public software (GGNFS) and his desktop computer (a dual-core Athlon64 with a 1,900\u00a0MHz CPU). Just less than 5\u00a0gigabytes of disk storage was required and about 2.5\u00a0gigabytes of RAM for the sieving process.\nRivest, Shamir, and Adleman noted that Miller has shown that \u2013 assuming the truth of the extended Riemann hypothesis \u2013 finding d from n and e is as hard as factoring n into p and q (up to a polynomial time difference). However, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman noted, in section IX/D of their paper, that they had not found a proof that inverting RSA is as hard as factoring.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], the largest publicly known factored RSA number had 829\u00a0bits (250 decimal digits, RSA-250). Its factorization, by a state-of-the-art distributed implementation, took about 2,700 CPU-years. In practice, RSA keys are typically 1024 to 4096 bits long. In 2003, RSA Security estimated that 1024-bit keys were likely to become crackable by 2010. As of 2020, it is not known whether such keys can be cracked, but minimum recommendations have moved to at least 2048\u00a0bits. It is generally presumed that RSA is secure if n is sufficiently large, outside of quantum computing.\nIf n is 300\u00a0bits or shorter, it can be factored in a few hours on a personal computer, using software already freely available. Keys of 512\u00a0bits have been shown to be practically breakable in 1999, when RSA-155 was factored by using several hundred computers, and these are now factored in a few weeks using common hardware. Exploits using 512-bit code-signing certificates that may have been factored were reported in 2011. A theoretical hardware device named TWIRL, described by Shamir and Tromer in 2003, called into question the security of 1024-bit keys.\nIn 1994, Peter Shor showed that a quantum computer \u2013 if one could ever be practically created for the purpose \u2013 would be able to factor in polynomial time, breaking RSA; see Shor's algorithm.\nFaulty key generation.\nFinding the large primes p and q is usually done by testing random numbers of the correct size with probabilistic primality tests that quickly eliminate virtually all of the nonprimes.\nThe numbers p and q should not be \"too close\", lest the Fermat factorization for n be successful. If \"p\" \u2212 \"q\" is less than 2\"n\"1/4 (\"n\" = \"p\"\u22c5\"q\", which even for \"small\" 1024-bit values of n is ), solving for p and q is trivial. Furthermore, if either \"p\" \u2212 1 or \"q\" \u2212 1 has only small prime factors, n can be factored quickly by Pollard's \"p\" \u2212 1 algorithm, and hence such values of p or q should be discarded.\nIt is important that the private exponent d be large enough. Michael J.\u00a0Wiener showed that if p is between q and 2\"q\" (which is quite typical) and \"d\" &lt; \"n\"1/4/3, then d can be computed efficiently from n and\u00a0e.\nThere is no known attack against small public exponents such as \"e\" = 3, provided that the proper padding is used. Coppersmith's attack has many applications in attacking RSA specifically if the public exponent e is small and if the encrypted message is short and not padded. 65537 is a commonly used value for\u00a0e; this value can be regarded as a compromise between avoiding potential small-exponent attacks and still allowing efficient encryptions (or signature verification). The NIST Special Publication on Computer Security (SP\u00a0800-78 Rev.\u00a01 of August 2007) does not allow public exponents e smaller than 65537, but does not state a reason for this restriction.\nIn October 2017, a team of researchers from Masaryk University announced the ROCA vulnerability, which affects RSA keys generated by an algorithm embodied in a library from Infineon known as RSALib. A large number of smart cards and trusted platform modules (TPM) were shown to be affected. Vulnerable RSA keys are easily identified using a test program the team released.\nImportance of strong random number generation.\nA cryptographically strong random number generator, which has been properly seeded with adequate entropy, must be used to generate the primes p and q. An analysis comparing millions of public keys gathered from the Internet was carried out in early 2012 by Arjen K.\u00a0Lenstra, James P.\u00a0Hughes, Maxime Augier, Joppe W.\u00a0Bos, Thorsten Kleinjung and Christophe Wachter. They were able to factor 0.2% of the keys using only Euclid's algorithm.\nThey exploited a weakness unique to cryptosystems based on integer factorization. If \"n\" = \"pq\" is one public key, and \"n\"\u2032 = \"p\"\u2032\"q\"\u2032 is another, then if by chance \"p\" = \"p\"\u2032 (but q is not equal to q'), then a simple computation of gcd(\"n\", \"n\"\u2032) = \"p\" factors both n and n', totally compromising both keys. Lenstra et al. note that this problem can be minimized by using a strong random seed of bit length twice the intended security level, or by employing a deterministic function to choose q given p, instead of choosing p and q independently.\nNadia Heninger was part of a group that did a similar experiment. They used an idea of Daniel J.\u00a0Bernstein to compute the GCD of each RSA key n against the product of all the other keys n' they had found (a 729-million-digit number), instead of computing each gcd(\"n\", \"n\"\u2032) separately, thereby achieving a very significant speedup, since after one large division, the GCD problem is of normal size.\nHeninger says in her blog that the bad keys occurred almost entirely in embedded applications, including \"firewalls, routers, VPN devices, remote server administration devices, printers, projectors, and VOIP phones\" from more than 30 manufacturers. Heninger explains that the one-shared-prime problem uncovered by the two groups results from situations where the pseudorandom number generator is poorly seeded initially, and then is reseeded between the generation of the first and second primes. Using seeds of sufficiently high entropy obtained from key stroke timings or electronic diode noise or atmospheric noise from a radio receiver tuned between stations should solve the problem.\nStrong random number generation is important throughout every phase of public-key cryptography. For instance, if a weak generator is used for the symmetric keys that are being distributed by RSA, then an eavesdropper could bypass RSA and guess the symmetric keys directly.\nTiming attacks.\nKocher described a new attack on RSA in 1995: if the attacker Eve knows Alice's hardware in sufficient detail and is able to measure the decryption times for several known ciphertexts, Eve can deduce the decryption key d quickly. This attack can also be applied against the RSA signature scheme. In 2003, Boneh and Brumley demonstrated a more practical attack capable of recovering RSA factorizations over a network connection (e.g., from a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)-enabled webserver). This attack takes advantage of information leaked by the Chinese remainder theorem optimization used by many RSA implementations.\nOne way to thwart these attacks is to ensure that the decryption operation takes a constant amount of time for every ciphertext. However, this approach can significantly reduce performance. Instead, most RSA implementations use an alternate technique known as cryptographic blinding. RSA blinding makes use of the multiplicative property of RSA. Instead of computing \"c\"\"d\" (mod \"n\"), Alice first chooses a secret random value r and computes (\"r\"\"e\"\"c\")\"d\" (mod \"n\"). The result of this computation, after applying Euler's theorem, is \"rc\"\"d\" (mod \"n\"), and so the effect of r can be removed by multiplying by its inverse. A new value of r is chosen for each ciphertext. With blinding applied, the decryption time is no longer correlated to the value of the input ciphertext, and so the timing attack fails.\nAdaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks.\nIn 1998, Daniel Bleichenbacher described the first practical adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack against RSA-encrypted messages using the PKCS\u00a0#1\u00a0v1 padding scheme (a padding scheme randomizes and adds structure to an RSA-encrypted message, so it is possible to determine whether a decrypted message is valid). Due to flaws with the PKCS\u00a0#1 scheme, Bleichenbacher was able to mount a practical attack against RSA implementations of the Secure Sockets Layer protocol and to recover session keys. As a result of this work, cryptographers now recommend the use of provably secure padding schemes such as Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding, and RSA Laboratories has released new versions of PKCS\u00a0#1 that are not vulnerable to these attacks.\nA variant of this attack, dubbed \"BERserk\", came back in 2014. It impacted the Mozilla NSS Crypto Library, which was used notably by Firefox and Chrome.\nSide-channel analysis attacks.\nA side-channel attack using branch-prediction analysis (BPA) has been described. Many processors use a branch predictor to determine whether a conditional branch in the instruction flow of a program is likely to be taken or not. Often these processors also implement simultaneous multithreading (SMT). Branch-prediction analysis attacks use a spy process to discover (statistically) the private key when processed with these processors.\nSimple Branch Prediction Analysis (SBPA) claims to improve BPA in a non-statistical way. In their paper, \"On the Power of Simple Branch Prediction Analysis\", the authors of SBPA (Onur Aciicmez and Cetin Kaya Koc) claim to have discovered 508 out of 512\u00a0bits of an RSA key in 10 iterations.\nFault injection attack.\nA power-fault attack on RSA implementations was described in 2010 The author recovered the key by varying the CPU power voltage outside limits; this caused multiple power faults on the server.\nThe CRT implementation is sensitive to fault injection attacks. If an attacker can obtain 1 faulty signature, the private key can be calculated.\nTricky implementation.\nThere are many details to keep in mind in order to implement RSA securely (strong PRNG, acceptable public exponent, etc.). This makes the implementation challenging, to the point that the book \"Practical Cryptography With Go\" suggests avoiding RSA if possible.\nImplementations.\nSome cryptography libraries that provide support for RSA include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25389", "revid": "2607788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25389", "title": "Robert A. Heinlein", "text": "American author and aeronautical engineer (1907\u20131988)\nRobert Anson Heinlein ( ; July 7, 1907 \u2013 May 8, 1988) was an American science fiction author, aeronautical engineer, and naval officer. Sometimes called the \"dean of science fiction writers\", he was among the first to emphasize scientific accuracy in his fiction and was thus a pioneer of the subgenre of hard science fiction. His published works, both fiction and non-fiction, express admiration for competence and emphasize the value of critical thinking. His plots often presented provocative situations which challenged conventional social mores. His work continues to have an influence on the science-fiction genre and on modern culture more generally.\nHeinlein became one of the first American science-fiction writers to break into mainstream magazines such as \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in the late 1940s. He was one of the best-selling science-fiction novelists for many decades. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke are often considered the \"Big Three\" of English-language science fiction authors. Notable Heinlein works include \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", \"Starship Troopers\" (which helped mold the space marine and mecha archetypes) and \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\". His work sometimes had controversial aspects, such as plural marriage in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", militarism in \"Starship Troopers\" and technologically competent women characters who were formidable, yet often stereotypically feminine\u2014such as \"Friday\".\nHeinlein used his science fiction as a way to explore provocative social and political ideas and to speculate how progress in science and engineering might shape the future of politics, race, religion, and sex.\nWithin the framework of his stories, Heinlein repeatedly addressed certain social themes: the importance of individual liberty and self-reliance, the nature of sexual relationships, the obligations individuals owe to their societies, the influence of organized religion on culture and government, and the tendency of society to repress nonconformist thought. He also speculated on the influence of space travel on human cultural practices.\nHeinlein was heavily influenced by the visionary writers and philosophers of his day. William H. Patterson Jr., writing in \"Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century\", states that by 1930, Heinlein was a progressive liberal who had spent some time in the open sexuality climate of New York's Jazz Age Greenwich Village. Heinlein believed that some level of socialism was inevitable and was already occurring in the United States; as a young man he was absorbing the social concepts of writers such as H. G. Wells and Upton Sinclair. Heinlein adopted many of the progressive social beliefs of his day and projected them forward. In later years, he began to espouse more moderate views and to believe that a strong world government was the only way to avoid mutual nuclear annihilation.\nHeinlein was named the first Science Fiction Writers Grand Master in 1974. Four of his novels won Hugo Awards. In addition, fifty years after publication, seven of his works were awarded \"Retro Hugos\"\u2014awards given retrospectively for works that were published before the Hugo Awards came into existence. In his fiction, Heinlein coined terms that have become part of the English language, including grok, waldo and speculative fiction, as well as popularizing existing terms like \"TANSTAAFL\", \"pay it forward\", and \"space marine\". He also anticipated mechanical computer-aided design with \"Drafting Dan\" in his novel \"The Door into Summer\" and described a modern version of a waterbed in his novel \"Stranger in a Strange Land\".\nLife.\nBirth, childhood, and early education.\nHeinlein, born on July 7, 1907, to Rex Ivar Heinlein (an accountant) and Bam Lyle Heinlein, in Butler, Missouri, was the third of seven children. He was a sixth-generation German-American; a family tradition had it that Heinleins fought in every American war, starting with the War of Independence.\nHe spent his childhood in Kansas City, Missouri. The outlook and values of this time and place (in his own words, \"The Bible Belt\") had an influence on his fiction, especially in his later works, as he drew heavily upon his childhood in establishing the setting and cultural atmosphere in \"Time Enough for Love\" and \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\". The 1910 return of Halley's Comet inspired the young child's life-long interest in astronomy.\nIn January 1924, the sixteen-year-old Heinlein lied about his age to enlist in Company C, 110th Engineer Regiment, of the Missouri National Guard, in Kansas City. His family could not afford to send Heinlein to college, so he sought an appointment to a military academy. When Heinlein graduated from Kansas City Central High School in 1924, he was initially prevented from attending the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis because his older brother Rex was a student there, and at the time, regulations discouraged multiple family members from attending the academy simultaneously. He instead matriculated at Kansas City Community College and began vigorously petitioning Missouri Senator James A. Reed for an appointment to the Naval Academy. In part due to the influence of the Pendergast machine, the Naval Academy admitted him in June 1925. Heinlein received his discharge from the Missouri National Guard as a staff sergeant. Reed later told Heinlein that he had received 100 letters of recommendation for nomination to the Naval Academy, 50 for other candidates and 50 for Heinlein.\nNavy.\nHeinlein's experience in the U.S. Navy exerted a strong influence on his character and writing. In 1929, he graduated from the Naval Academy with the equivalent of a bachelor of arts in engineering. (At that time, the Academy did not confer degrees.) He ranked fifth in his class academically but with a class standing of 20th of 243 due to disciplinary demerits. The U.S. Navy commissioned him as an ensign shortly after his graduation. He advanced to lieutenant junior grade in 1931 while serving aboard the new aircraft carrier , where he worked in radio communications\u2014a technology then still in its earlier stages. The captain of this carrier, Ernest J. King, later served as the Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet during World War II. Military historians twice interviewed Heinlein during his later years and asked him about Captain King and his service as the commander of the U.S. Navy's first modern aircraft carrier. Heinlein also served as gunnery officer aboard the destroyer in 1933 and 1934, reaching the rank of lieutenant. His brother, Lawrence Heinlein, served in the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the Missouri National Guard, reaching the rank of major general in the National Guard.\nMarriages.\nIn 1929, Heinlein married Elinor Curry of Kansas City. However, their marriage lasted only about one year. His second marriage, to Leslyn MacDonald (1904\u20131981) in 1932, lasted 15 years. MacDonald was, according to the testimony of Heinlein's Navy friend, Rear Admiral Cal Laning, \"astonishingly intelligent, widely read, and extremely liberal, though a registered Republican\", while Isaac Asimov later recalled that Heinlein was, at the time, \"a flaming liberal\". \"(See section: Politics of Robert Heinlein.)\"\nAt the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Heinlein met and befriended a chemical engineer named Virginia \"Ginny\" Gerstenfeld. After the war, her engagement having fallen through, she attended UCLA for doctoral studies in chemistry, and while there reconnected with Heinlein. As his second wife's alcoholism gradually spun out of control, Heinlein moved out and the couple filed for divorce. Heinlein's friendship with Virginia turned into a relationship and on October 21, 1948\u2014shortly after the decree nisi came through\u2014they married in the town of Raton, New Mexico. Soon thereafter, they set up housekeeping in the Broadmoor district of Colorado Springs, Colorado, in a house that Heinlein and his wife designed. As the area was newly developed, they were allowed to choose their own house number, 1776 Mesa Avenue. The design of the house was featured in \"Popular Mechanics\". They remained married until Heinlein's death. In 1965, after various chronic health problems of Virginia's were traced back to altitude sickness, they moved to Santa Cruz, California, which is at sea level. Robert and Virginia designed and built a new residence, circular in shape, in the nearby village of Bonny Doon.\nGinny undoubtedly served as a model for many of his intelligent, fiercely independent female characters. She was a chemist and rocket test engineer, and held a higher rank in the Navy than Heinlein himself. She was also an accomplished college athlete, earning four varsity letters. In 1953\u20131954, the Heinleins voyaged around the world (mostly via ocean liners and cargo liners, as Ginny detested flying), which Heinlein described in \"Tramp Royale.\" The trip provided background material for science fiction novels set aboard spaceships on long voyages, such as \"Podkayne of Mars\", \"Friday\" and \"\", the latter initially being set on a cruise much as detailed in \"Tramp Royale\". Ginny acted as the first reader of his manuscripts. Isaac Asimov believed that Heinlein made a swing to the right politically at the same time he married Ginny.\nCalifornia.\nIn 1934, Heinlein was discharged from the Navy, owing to pulmonary tuberculosis. During a lengthy hospitalization, and inspired by his own experience while bed-ridden, he developed a design for a waterbed.\nAfter his discharge, Heinlein attended a few weeks of graduate classes in mathematics and physics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), but he soon quit, either because of his ill-health or because of a desire to enter politics.\nHeinlein supported himself at several occupations, including real estate sales and silver mining, but for some years found money in short supply. Heinlein was active in Upton Sinclair's socialist End Poverty in California movement (EPIC) in the early 1930s. He was deputy publisher of the \"EPIC News\", which Heinlein noted \"recalled a mayor, kicked out a district attorney, replaced the governor with one of our choice.\" When Sinclair gained the Democratic nomination for Governor of California in 1934, Heinlein worked actively in the campaign. Heinlein himself ran for the California State Assembly in 1938, but was unsuccessful. He was running as a left-wing Democrat in a conservative district, and was defeated in the Democratic primary by fewer than 500 votes out of over 10,000 cast.\nAuthor.\nWhile not destitute after the campaign\u2014he had a small disability pension from the Navy\u2014Heinlein turned to writing to pay off his mortgage. His first published story, \"Life-Line\", was printed in the August 1939 issue of \"Astounding Science Fiction\". Originally written for a contest, it sold to \"Astounding\" for significantly more than the contest's first-prize payoff. Another Future History story, \"Misfit\", followed in November. Some saw Heinlein's talent and stardom from his first story, and he was quickly acknowledged as a leader of the new movement toward \"social\" science fiction. In California he hosted the Ma\u00f1ana Literary Society, a 1940\u201341 series of informal gatherings of new authors. He was the guest of honor at Denvention, the 1941 Worldcon, held in Denver. During World War II, Heinlein was employed by the Navy as a civilian aeronautical engineer at the Navy Aircraft Materials Center at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Pennsylvania. Heinlein recruited Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp to also work there. While at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyards, Asimov, Heinlein, and de Camp brainstormed unconventional approaches to kamikaze attacks, such as using sound to detect approaching planes.\nAs the war wound down in 1945, Heinlein began to re-evaluate his career. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, along with the outbreak of the Cold War, galvanized him to write nonfiction on political topics. In addition, he wanted to break into better-paying markets. He published four influential short stories for \"The Saturday Evening Post\" magazine, leading off, in February 1947, with \"The Green Hills of Earth\". That made him the first science fiction writer to break out of the \"pulp ghetto\". In 1950, the movie \"Destination Moon\"\u2014the documentary-like film for which he had written the story and scenario, co-written the script, and invented many of the effects\u2014won an Academy Award for special effects.\nHeinlein created SF stories with social commentary about relationships. In \"The Puppet Masters\", a 1951 alien invasion novel, the point of view character Sam persuades fellow operative Mary to marry him. When they go to the county clerk, they are offered a variety of marriage possibilities; \"Term, renewable or lifetime\", as short as six months or as long as forever.\nAlso, he embarked on a series of juvenile novels for the Charles Scribner's Sons publishing company that went from 1947 through 1959, at the rate of one book each autumn, in time for Christmas presents to teenagers. He also wrote for \"Boys' Life\" in 1952.\nHeinlein used topical materials throughout his juvenile series beginning in 1947, but in 1958 he interrupted work on \"The Heretic\" (the working title of \"Stranger in a Strange Land\") to write and publish a book exploring ideas of civic virtue, initially serialized as \"Starship Soldiers\". In 1959, his novel (now entitled \"Starship Troopers\") was considered by the editors and owners of Scribner's to be too controversial for one of its prestige lines, and it was rejected. Heinlein found another publisher (Putnam), feeling himself released from the constraints of writing novels for children. He had told an interviewer that he did not want to do stories that merely added to categories defined by other works. Rather he wanted to do his own work, stating that: \"I want to do my own stuff, my own way\". He wrote a series of challenging books that redrew the boundaries of science fiction, including \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961) and \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" (1966).\nLater life and death.\nBeginning in 1970, Heinlein had a series of health crises, broken by strenuous periods of activity in his hobby of stonemasonry: in a private correspondence, he referred to that as his \"usual and favorite occupation between books\". The decade began with a life-threatening attack of peritonitis, recovery from which required more than two years, and treatment of which required multiple transfusions of Heinlein's rare blood type, A2 negative. As soon as he was well enough to write again, he began work on \"Time Enough for Love\" (1973), which introduced many of the themes found in his later fiction.\nIn the mid-1970s, Heinlein wrote two articles for the \"Britannica Compton Yearbook\". He and Ginny crisscrossed the country helping to reorganize blood donation in the United States in an effort to assist the system which had saved his life. At science fiction conventions to receive his autograph, fans would be asked to co-sign with Heinlein a beautifully embellished pledge form he supplied stating that the recipient agrees that they will donate blood. He was the guest of honor at the Worldcon in 1976 for the third time at MidAmeriCon in Kansas City, Missouri. At that Worldcon, Heinlein hosted a blood drive and donors' reception to thank all those who had helped save lives.\nBeginning in 1977, and including an episode while vacationing in Tahiti in early 1978, he had episodes of reversible neurologic dysfunction due to transient ischemic attacks. Over the next few months, he became more and more exhausted, and his health again began to decline. The problem was determined to be a blocked carotid artery, and he had one of the earliest known carotid bypass operations to correct it.\nIn 1980, Robert Heinlein was a member of the Citizen's Advisory Council on National Space Policy, chaired by Jerry Pournelle, which met at the home of SF writer Larry Niven to write space policy papers for the incoming Reagan administration. Members included such aerospace industry leaders as former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, General Daniel O. Graham, aerospace engineer Max Hunter and North American Rockwell VP for Space Shuttle development George Merrick. Policy recommendations from the Council included ballistic missile defense concepts which were later transformed into what was called the Strategic Defense Initiative. Heinlein assisted with Council contribution to the Reagan SDI spring 1983 speech. Asked to appear before a Joint Committee of the United States Congress that year, he testified on his belief that spin-offs from space technology were benefiting the infirm and the elderly.\nHeinlein's surgical treatment re-energized him, and he wrote five novels from 1980 until he died in his sleep from emphysema and heart failure on May 8, 1988.\nIn 1995, Spider Robinson wrote the novel \"Variable Star\" based on an outline and notes created by Heinlein. Heinlein's posthumously published nonfiction includes a selection of correspondence and notes edited into a somewhat autobiographical examination of his career, published in 1989 under the title \"Grumbles from the Grave\" by his wife, Virginia; his book on practical politics written in 1946 and published as \"Take Back Your Government\" in 1992; and a travelogue of their first around-the-world tour in 1954, \"Tramp Royale\". The novel \"Podkayne of Mars,\" which had been edited against Heinlein's wishes in its original release, was reissued with the original ending. \"Stranger In a Strange Land\" was originally published in a shorter form, but both the long and short versions are now simultaneously available in print.\nHeinlein's archive is housed by the Special Collections department of McHenry Library at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The collection includes manuscript drafts, correspondence, photographs and artifacts. A substantial portion of the archive has been digitized and it is available online through the Robert A. and Virginia Heinlein Archives.\nWritten works.\nHeinlein published 32 novels, 59 short stories, and 16 collections during his lifetime. Nine films, two television series, several episodes of a radio series, and a board game have been derived more or less directly from his work. He wrote a screenplay for one of the films. Heinlein edited an anthology of other writers' SF short stories.\nThree nonfiction books and two poems have been published posthumously. \"For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs\" was published posthumously in 2003; \"Variable Star\", written by Spider Robinson based on an extensive outline by Heinlein, was published in September 2006. Four collections have been published posthumously.\nEarly work, 1939\u20131958.\nHeinlein began his career as a writer of stories for \"Astounding Science Fiction\" magazine, which was edited by John Campbell. The science fiction writer Frederik Pohl has described Heinlein as \"that greatest of Campbell-era sf writers\". Isaac Asimov said that, from the time of his first story, the science fiction world accepted that Heinlein was the best science fiction writer in existence, adding that he would hold this title through his lifetime.\nAlexei and Cory Panshin noted that Heinlein's impact was immediately felt. In 1940, the year after selling 'Life-Line' to Campbell, he wrote three short novels, four novelettes, and seven short stories. They went on to say that \"No one ever dominated the science fiction field as Bob did in the first few years of his career.\" Alexei expresses awe in Heinlein's ability to show readers a world so drastically different from the one we live in now, yet have so many similarities. He says that \"We find ourselves not only in a world other than our own, but identifying with a living, breathing individual who is operating within its context, and thinking and acting according to its terms.\"\nThe first novel that Heinlein wrote, \"\" (1939), did not see print during his lifetime, but Robert James tracked down the manuscript and it was published in 2003. Though some regard it as a failure as a novel, considering it little more than a disguised lecture on Heinlein's social theories, some readers took a very different view. In a review of it, John Clute wrote:\nI'm not about to suggest that if Heinlein had been able to publish [such works] openly in the pages of \"Astounding\" in 1939, SF would have gotten the future right; I would suggest, however, that if Heinlein, and his colleagues, had been able to publish adult SF in \"Astounding\" and its fellow journals, then SF might not have done such a grotesquely poor job of prefiguring something of the flavor of actually living here at the onset of 2004.\n\"For Us, the Living\" was intriguing as a window into the development of Heinlein's radical ideas about man as a social animal, including his interest in free love. The root of many themes found in his later stories can be found in this book. It also contained a large amount of material that could be considered background for his other novels. This included a detailed description of the protagonist's treatment to avoid being banished to Coventry (a lawless land in the Heinlein mythos where unrepentant law-breakers are exiled).\nIt appears that Heinlein at least attempted to live in a manner consistent with these ideals, even in the 1930s, and had an open relationship in his marriage to his second wife, Leslyn. He was also a nudist; nudism and body taboos are frequently discussed in his work. At the height of the Cold War, he built a bomb shelter under his house, like the one featured in \"Farnham's Freehold\".\nAfter \"For Us, the Living\", Heinlein began selling (to magazines) first short stories, then novels, set in a Future History, complete with a time line of significant political, cultural, and technological changes. A chart of the future history was published in the May 1941 issue of \"Astounding\". Over time, Heinlein wrote many novels and short stories that deviated freely from the Future History on some points, while maintaining consistency in some other areas. The Future History was eventually overtaken by actual events. These discrepancies were explained, after a fashion, in his later World as Myth stories.\nHeinlein's first novel published as a book, \"Rocket Ship Galileo\", was initially rejected because going to the Moon was considered too far-fetched, but he soon found a publisher, Scribner's, that began publishing a Heinlein juvenile once a year for the Christmas season. Eight of these books were illustrated by Clifford Geary in a distinctive white-on-black scratchboard style. Some representative novels of this type are \"Have Space Suit\u2014Will Travel\", \"Farmer in the Sky\", and \"Starman Jones\". Many of these were first published in serial form under other titles, e.g., \"Farmer in the Sky\" was published as \"Satellite Scout\" in the Boy Scout magazine \"Boys' Life\". There has been speculation that Heinlein's intense obsession with his privacy was due at least in part to the apparent contradiction between his unconventional private life and his career as an author of books for children. However, \"For Us, the Living\" explicitly discusses the political importance Heinlein attached to privacy as a matter of principle.\nThe novels that Heinlein wrote for a young audience are commonly called \"the Heinlein juveniles\", and they feature a mixture of adolescent and adult themes. Many of the issues that he takes on in these books have to do with the kinds of problems that adolescents experience. His protagonists are usually intelligent teenagers who have to make their way in the adult society they see around them. On the surface, they are simple tales of adventure, achievement, and dealing with stupid teachers and jealous peers. Heinlein was a vocal proponent of the notion that juvenile readers were far more sophisticated and able to handle more complex or difficult themes than most people realized. His juvenile stories often had a maturity to them that made them readable for adults. \"Red Planet\", for example, portrays some subversive themes, including a revolution in which young students are involved; his editor demanded substantial changes in this book's discussion of topics such as the use of weapons by children and the misidentified sex of the Martian character. Heinlein was always aware of the editorial limitations put in place by the editors of his novels and stories, and while he observed those restrictions on the surface, was often successful in introducing ideas not often seen in other authors' juvenile SF.\nIn 1957, James Blish wrote that one reason for Heinlein's success \"has been the high grade of machinery which goes, today as always, into his story-telling. Heinlein seems to have known from the beginning, as if instinctively, technical lessons about fiction which other writers must learn the hard way (or often enough, never learn). He does not always operate the machinery to the best advantage, but he always seems to be aware of it.\"\n1959\u20131960.\nHeinlein decisively ended his juvenile novels with \"Starship Troopers\" (1959), a controversial work and his personal riposte to leftists calling for President Dwight D. Eisenhower to stop nuclear testing in 1958. \"The 'Patrick Henry' ad shocked 'em\", he wrote many years later of the campaign. \"\"Starship Troopers\" outraged 'em.\" \"Starship Troopers\" is a coming-of-age story about duty, citizenship, and the role of the military in society. The book portrays a society in which suffrage is earned by demonstrated willingness to place society's interests before one's own, at least for a short time and often under onerous circumstances, in government service; in the case of the protagonist, this was military service.\nLater, in \"Expanded Universe\", Heinlein said that it was his intention in the novel that service could include positions outside strictly military functions such as teachers, police officers, and other government positions. This is presented in the novel as an outgrowth of the failure of unearned suffrage government and as a very successful arrangement. In addition, the franchise was only awarded after leaving the assigned service; thus those serving their terms\u2014in the military, or any other service\u2014were excluded from exercising any franchise. Career military were completely disenfranchised until retirement.\nMiddle period work, 1961\u20131973.\nFrom about 1961 (\"Stranger in a Strange Land\") to 1973 (\"Time Enough for Love\"), Heinlein explored some of his most important themes, such as individualism, libertarianism, and free expression of physical and emotional love. Three novels from this period, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", and \"Time Enough for Love\", won the Libertarian Futurist Society's Prometheus Hall of Fame Award, designed to honor classic libertarian fiction. Jeff Riggenbach described \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" as \"unquestionably one of the three or four most influential libertarian novels of the last century\".\nHeinlein did not publish \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" until some time after it was written, and the themes of free love and radical individualism are prominently featured in his long-unpublished first novel, \"For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs\".\n\"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" tells of a war of independence waged by the Lunar penal colonies, with significant comments from a major character, Professor La Paz, regarding the threat posed by government to individual freedom.\nAlthough Heinlein had previously written a few short stories in the fantasy genre, during this period he wrote his first fantasy novel, \"Glory Road\". In \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and \"I Will Fear No Evil\", he began to mix hard science with fantasy, mysticism, and satire of organized religion. Critics William H. Patterson, Jr., and Andrew Thornton believe that this is simply an expression of Heinlein's longstanding philosophical opposition to positivism. Heinlein stated that he was influenced by James Branch Cabell in taking this new literary direction. The penultimate novel of this period, \"I Will Fear No Evil\", is according to critic James Gifford \"almost universally regarded as a literary failure\" and he attributes its shortcomings to Heinlein's near-death from peritonitis.\nLater work, 1980\u20131987.\nAfter a seven-year hiatus brought on by poor health, Heinlein produced five new novels in the period from 1980 (\"The Number of the Beast\") to 1987 (\"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\"). These books have a thread of common characters and time and place. They most explicitly communicated Heinlein's philosophies and beliefs, and many long, didactic passages of dialog and exposition deal with government, sex, and religion. These novels are controversial among his readers and one critic, David Langford, has written about them very negatively. Heinlein's four Hugo awards were all for books written before this period.\nMost of the novels from this period are recognized by critics as forming an offshoot from the Future History series and are referred to by the term \"World as Myth\".\nThe tendency toward authorial self-reference begun in \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and \"Time Enough for Love\" becomes even more evident in novels such as \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\", whose first-person protagonist is a disabled military veteran who becomes a writer, and finds love with a female character.\nThe 1982 novel \"Friday\", a more conventional adventure story (borrowing a character and backstory from the earlier short story \"Gulf\", also containing suggestions of connection to \"The Puppet Masters\") continued a Heinlein theme of expecting what he saw as the continued disintegration of Earth's society, to the point where the title character is strongly encouraged to seek a new life off-planet. It concludes with a traditional Heinlein note, as in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" or \"Time Enough for Love\", that freedom is to be found on the frontiers.\nThe 1984 novel \" is a sharp satire of organized religion. Heinlein himself was agnostic.\nPosthumous publications.\nSeveral Heinlein works have been published since his death, including the aforementioned \" as well as 1989's \"Grumbles from the Grave\", a collection of letters between Heinlein and his editors and agent; 1992's \"Tramp Royale\", a travelogue of a southern hemisphere tour the Heinleins took in the 1950s; \"Take Back Your Government\", a how-to book about participatory democracy written in 1946 and reflecting his experience as an organizer with the EPIC campaign of 1934 and the movement's aftermath as an important factor in California politics before the Second World War; and a tribute volume called \"Requiem: Collected Works and Tributes to the Grand Master\", containing some additional short works previously unpublished in book form. \"Off the Main Sequence\", published in 2005, includes three short stories never before collected in any Heinlein book (Heinlein called them \"stinkeroos\").\nSpider Robinson, a colleague, friend, and admirer of Heinlein, wrote \"Variable Star\", based on an outline and notes for a novel that Heinlein prepared in 1955. The novel was published as a collaboration, with Heinlein's name above Robinson's on the cover, in 2006.\nA complete collection of Heinlein's published work has been published by the Heinlein Prize Trust as the \"Virginia Edition\", after his wife. See the Complete Works section of Robert A. Heinlein bibliography for details.\nOn February 1, 2019, Phoenix Pick announced that through a collaboration with the Heinlein Prize Trust, a reconstruction of the full text of an unpublished Heinlein novel had been produced. It was published in March 2020. The reconstructed novel, entitled \"The Pursuit of the Pankera: A Parallel Novel about Parallel Universes\", is an alternative version of \"The Number of the Beast\", with the first one-third of \"The Pursuit of the Pankera\" mostly the same as the first one-third of \"The Number of the Beast\" but the remainder of \"The Pursuit of the Pankera\" deviating entirely from \"The Number of the Beast\", with a completely different story-line. The newly reconstructed novel pays homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs and E. E. \"Doc\" Smith. It was edited by Patrick Lobrutto. Some reviewers describe the newly reconstructed novel as more in line with the style of a traditional Heinlein novel than was \"The Number of the Beast\". \"The Pursuit of the Pankera\" was considered superior to the original version of \"The Number of the Beast\" by some reviewers. Both \"The Pursuit of the Pankera\" and a new edition of \"The Number of the Beast\" were published in March 2020. The new edition of the latter shares the subtitle of \"The Pursuit of the Pankera\", hence entitled \"The Number of the Beast: A Parallel Novel about Parallel Universes\".\nMovies.\nHeinlein contributed to the final draft of the script for \"Destination Moon\" (1950) and served as a technical adviser for the film. Heinlein also shared screenwriting credit for \"Project Moonbase\" (1953).\nInfluences.\nThe primary influence on Heinlein's writing style may have been Rudyard Kipling. Kipling is the first known modern example of \"indirect exposition\", a writing technique for which Heinlein later became famous. In his famous text on \"On the Writing of Speculative Fiction\", Heinlein quotes Kipling:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Stranger in a Strange Land\" originated as a modernized version of Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\". His wife suggested that the child be raised by Martians instead of wolves. Likewise, \"Citizen of the Galaxy\" can be seen as a reboot of Kipling's novel \"Kim\".\nThe \"Starship Troopers\" idea of needing to serve in the military in order to vote can be found in Kipling's \"The Army of a Dream\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But as a little detail we never mention, if we don't volunteer in some corps or other\u2014as combatants if we're fit, as non-combatants if we ain't\u2014till we're thirty-five\u2014we don't vote, and we don't get poor-relief, and the women don't love us.\nPoul Anderson once said of Kipling's science fiction story \"As Easy as A.B.C.\", \"a wonderful science fiction yarn, showing the same eye for detail that would later distinguish the work of Robert Heinlein\".\nHeinlein described himself as also being influenced by George Bernard Shaw, having read most of his plays. Shaw is an example of an earlier author who used the competent man, a favorite Heinlein archetype. He denied, though, any direct influence of \"Back to Methuselah\" on \"Methuselah's Children\".\nViews.\nHeinlein's books probe a range of ideas about a range of topics such as sexuality, race, politics, and the military. Many were seen as radical or as ahead of their time in their social criticism. His books have inspired considerable debate about the specifics, and the evolution, of Heinlein's own opinions, and have earned him both lavish praise and a degree of criticism. He has also been accused of contradicting himself on various philosophical questions.\nBrian Doherty cites William Patterson, saying that the best way to gain an understanding of Heinlein is as a \"full-service iconoclast, the unique individual who decides that things do not have to be, and won't continue, as they are\". He says this vision is \"at the heart of Heinlein, science fiction, libertarianism, and America. Heinlein imagined how everything about the human world, from our sexual mores to our religion to our automobiles to our government to our plans for cultural survival, might be flawed, even fatally so.\"\nThe critic Elizabeth Anne Hull, for her part, has praised Heinlein for his interest in exploring fundamental life questions, especially questions about \"political power\u2014our responsibilities to one another\" and about \"personal freedom, particularly sexual freedom\".\nEdward R. Murrow hosted a series on CBS Radio called \"This I Believe\", which solicited an entry from Heinlein in 1952. Titled \"Our Noble, Essential Decency\". In it, Heinlein broke with the normal trends, stating that he believed in his neighbors (some of whom he named and described), community, and towns across America that share the same sense of good will and intentions as his own, going on to apply this same philosophy to the US, and humanity in general.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I believe in my fellow citizens. Our headlines are splashed with crime. Yet for every criminal, there are ten thousand honest, decent, kindly men. If it were not so, no child would live to grow up. Business could not go on from day to day. Decency is not news. It is buried in the obituaries, but it is a force stronger than crime.\nPolitics.\nHeinlein's political positions shifted throughout his life. Heinlein's early political leanings were liberal. In 1934, he worked actively for the Democratic campaign of Upton Sinclair for Governor of California. After Sinclair lost, Heinlein became an anti-communist Democratic activist. He made an unsuccessful bid for a California State Assembly seat in 1938. Heinlein's first novel, \"For Us, the Living\" (written 1939), consists largely of speeches advocating the Social Credit philosophy, and the early story \"Misfit\" (1939) deals with an organization\u2014\"The Cosmic Construction Corps\"\u2014that seems to be Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps translated into outer space.\nOf this time in his life, Heinlein later said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the time I wrote \"Methuselah's Children\" I was still politically quite na\u00efve and still had hopes that various libertarian notions could be put over by political processes... It [now] seems to me that every time we manage to establish one freedom, they take another one away. Maybe two. And that seems to me characteristic of a society as it gets older, and more crowded, and higher taxes, and more laws.\nHeinlein's fiction of the 1940s and 1950s, however, began to espouse conservative views. After 1945, he came to believe that a strong world government was the only way to avoid mutual nuclear annihilation. His 1949 novel \"Space Cadet\" describes a future scenario where a military-controlled global government enforces world peace. Heinlein ceased considering himself a Democrat in 1954.\nThe Heinleins formed the Patrick Henry League in 1958, and they worked in the 1964 Barry Goldwater presidential campaign.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Robert A. Heinlein opened his Colorado Springs newspaper on April 5, 1958, he read a full-page ad demanding that the Eisenhower Administration stop testing nuclear weapons. The science fiction author was flabbergasted. He called for the formation of the Patrick Henry League and spent the next several weeks writing and publishing his own polemic that lambasted \"Communist-line goals concealed in idealistic-sounding nonsense\" and urged Americans not to become \"soft-headed\".\nHeinlein's response ad was entitled \"Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?\". It started with the famous Henry quotation: \"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!!\" It then went on to admit that there was some risk to nuclear testing (albeit less than the \"willfully distorted\" claims of the test ban advocates), and risk of nuclear war, but that \"The alternative is surrender. We accept the risks.\" Heinlein was among those who in 1968 signed a pro\u2013Vietnam War ad in \"Galaxy Science Fiction\".\nHeinlein always considered himself a libertarian; in a letter to Judith Merril in 1967 (never sent) he said, \"As for libertarian, I've been one all my life, a radical one. You might use the term 'philosophical anarchist' or 'autarchist' about me, but 'libertarian' is easier to define and fits well enough.\"\n\"Stranger in a Strange Land\" was embraced by the 1960s counterculture, and libertarians have found inspiration in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\". Both groups found resonance with his themes of personal freedom in both thought and action.\nRace.\nHeinlein grew up in the era of racial segregation in the United States and wrote some of his most influential fiction at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. He explicitly made the case for using his fiction not only to predict the future but also to educate his readers about the value of racial equality and the importance of racial tolerance. His early novels were ahead of their time both in their explicit rejection of racism and in their inclusion of protagonists of color. In the context of science fiction before the 1960s, the mere existence of characters of color was a remarkable novelty, with green occurring more often than brown. For example, his 1948 novel \"Space Cadet\" explicitly uses aliens as a metaphor for minorities. The 1947 story \"Jerry Was a Man\" uses enslaved genetically modified chimpanzees as a symbol for Black Americans fighting for civil rights. In his novel \"The Star Beast\", the \"de facto\" foreign minister of the Terran government is an undersecretary, a Mr. Kiku, who is from Africa. Heinlein explicitly states his skin is \"ebony black\" and that Kiku is in an arranged marriage that is happy.\nIn a number of his stories, Heinlein challenges his readers' possible racial preconceptions by introducing a strong, sympathetic character, only to reveal much later that he or she is of African or other ancestry. In several cases, the covers of the books show characters as being light-skinned when the text states or at least implies that they are dark-skinned or of African ancestry. Heinlein repeatedly denounced racism in his nonfiction works, including numerous examples in \"Expanded Universe\".\nHeinlein reveals in \"Starship Troopers\" that the novel's protagonist and narrator, Johnny Rico, the formerly disaffected scion of a wealthy family, is Filipino, actually named \"Juan Rico\" and speaks Tagalog in addition to English.\nRace was a central theme in some of Heinlein's fiction. The most prominent example is \"Farnham's Freehold\", which casts a white family into a future in which white people are the slaves of cannibalistic black rulers. In the 1941 novel \"Sixth Column\" (also known as \"The Day After Tomorrow\"), a white resistance movement in the United States defends itself against an invasion by an Asian fascist state (the \"Pan-Asians\") using a \"super-science\" technology that allows ray weapons to be tuned to specific races. The idea for the story was pushed on Heinlein by editor John W. Campbell and the story itself was based on a then-unpublished story by Campbell, and Heinlein wrote later that he had \"had to re-slant it to remove racist aspects of the original story line\" and that he did not \"consider it to be an artistic success\". However, the novel prompted a heated debate in the scientific community regarding the plausibility of developing ethnic bioweapons. John Hickman, writing in the \"European Journal of American Studies\", identifies examples of anti\u2013East Asian racism in some of Heinlein's works, particularly \"Sixth Column\".\nHeinlein summed up his attitude toward people of any race in his essay \"Our Noble, Essential Decency\" thus:\nIndividualism and self-determination.\nIn keeping with his belief in individualism, his work for adults\u2014and sometimes even his work for juveniles\u2014often portrays both the oppressors and the oppressed with considerable ambiguity. Heinlein believed that individualism was incompatible with ignorance. He believed that an appropriate level of adult competence was achieved through a wide-ranging education, whether this occurred in a classroom or not. In his juvenile novels, more than once a character looks with disdain at a student's choice of classwork, saying, \"Why didn't you study something useful?\" In \"Time Enough for Love\", Lazarus Long gives a long list of capabilities that anyone should have, concluding, \"Specialization is for insects.\" The ability of the individual to create himself is explored in stories such as \"I Will Fear No Evil\", \"'\u2014All You Zombies\u2014'\", and \"By His Bootstraps\".\nHeinlein claimed to have written \"Starship Troopers\" in response to \"calls for the unilateral ending of nuclear testing by the United States\". Heinlein suggests in the book that the Bugs are a good example of Communism being something that humans cannot successfully adhere to, since humans are strongly defined individuals, whereas the Bugs, being a collective, can all contribute to the whole without consideration of individual desire.\nThe Competent Man.\nA common theme in Heinlein's writing is his frequent use of the \"competent man\", a stock character who exhibits a very wide range of abilities and knowledge, making him a form of polymath. This trope was notably common in 1950s U.S. science fiction. While Heinlein was not the first to use such a character type, the heroes and heroines of his fiction (with Jubal Harshaw being a prime example) generally have a wide range of abilities, and one of Heinlein's characters, Lazarus Long, gives a wide summary of requirements:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.\u2014\u200a\nPredecessors of Heinlein's competent heroes include the protagonists of George Bernard Shaw, like Henry Higgins in \"Pygmalion\" and Caesar in \"Caesar and Cleopatra\", as well as the citizen soldiers in Rudyard Kipling's \"The Army of a Dream\".\nSexuality.\nFor Heinlein, personal liberation included sexual liberation, and free love was a major subject of his writing starting in 1939, with \"For Us, the Living\". During Heinlein's early period, his writing for younger readers needed to take into account the perceptions of sexuality by editors and the buying public; as critic William H. Patterson has put it, his dilemma was \"to sort out what was really objectionable from what was only excessive over-sensitivity to imaginary librarians\".\nBy his middle period, sexual freedom and the elimination of sexual jealousy became a major theme; for instance, in \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961), the progressively minded but sexually conservative reporter, Ben Caxton, acts as a dramatic foil for the less parochial characters, Jubal Harshaw and Valentine Michael Smith (Mike). Another of the main characters, Jill, is homophobic, and says that \"nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped it's partly her own fault.\"\nAccording to Gary Westfahl,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Heinlein is a problematic case for feminists; on the one hand, his works often feature strong female characters and vigorous statements that women are equal to or even superior to men; but these characters and statements often reflect hopelessly stereotypical attitudes about typical female attributes. It is disconcerting, for example, that in \"Expanded Universe\" Heinlein calls for a society where all lawyers and politicians are women, essentially on the grounds that they possess a mysterious feminine practicality that men cannot duplicate.\nIn books written as early as 1956, Heinlein dealt with incest and the sexual nature of children. Many of his books including \"Time for the Stars\", \"Glory Road\", \"Time Enough for Love\", and \"The Number of the Beast\" dealt explicitly or implicitly with incest, sexual feelings and relations between adults, children, or both. The treatment of these themes include the romantic relationship and eventual marriage of two characters in \"The Door into Summer\" who met when one was a 30-year-old engineer and the other was an 11-year-old girl, and who eventually married when time-travel rendered the girl an adult while the engineer aged minimally, or the more overt intra-familial incest in \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\" and \"Time Enough for Love\". Heinlein often posed situations where the nominal purpose of sexual taboos was irrelevant to a particular situation, due to future advances in technology. For example, in \"Time Enough for Love\" Heinlein describes a brother and sister (Joe and Llita) who were mirror twins, being complementary diploids with entirely disjoint genomes, and thus not at increased risk for unfavorable gene duplication due to consanguinity. In this instance, Llita and Joe were props used to explore the concept of incest, where the usual objection to incest\u2014heightened risk of genetic defect in their children\u2014was not a consideration. Peers such as L. Sprague de Camp and Damon Knight have commented critically on Heinlein's portrayal of incest and pedophilia in a lighthearted and even approving manner. Diane Parkin-Speer suggests that Heinlein's intent seems more to provoke the reader and to question sexual norms than to promote any particular sexual agenda.\nPhilosophy.\nIn \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\", Heinlein has the main character, Maureen, state that the purpose of metaphysics is to ask questions: \"Why are we here?\" \"Where are we going after we die?\" (and so on); and that you are not allowed to answer the questions. \"Asking\" the questions is the point of metaphysics, but \"answering\" them is not, because once you answer this kind of question, you cross the line into religion. Maureen does not state a reason for this; she simply remarks that such questions are \"beautiful\" but lack answers. Maureen's son/lover Lazarus Long makes a related remark in \"Time Enough for Love\". In order for us to answer the \"big questions\" about the universe, Lazarus states at one point, it would be necessary to stand \"outside\" the universe.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Heinlein was deeply interested in Alfred Korzybski's general semantics and attended a number of seminars on the subject. His views on epistemology seem to have flowed from that interest, and his fictional characters continue to express Korzybskian views to the very end of his writing career. Many of his stories, such as \"Gulf\", \"If This Goes On\u2014\", and \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", depend strongly on the premise, related to the well-known Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis, that by using a correctly designed language, one can change or improve oneself mentally, or even realize untapped potential (as in the case of Joe in \"Gulf\"\u2014whose last name may be Greene, Gilead or Briggs).\nWhen Ayn Rand's novel \"The Fountainhead\" was published, Heinlein was very favorably impressed, as quoted in \"Grumbles\u00a0...\" and mentioned John Galt\u2014the hero in Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\"\u2014as a heroic archetype in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\". He was also strongly affected by the religious philosopher P. D. Ouspensky. Freudianism and psychoanalysis were at the height of their influence during the peak of Heinlein's career, and stories such as \"Time for the Stars\" indulged in psychological theorizing.\nHowever, he was skeptical about Freudianism, especially after a struggle with an editor who insisted on reading Freudian sexual symbolism into his juvenile novels. Heinlein was fascinated by the social credit movement in the 1930s. This is shown in \"Beyond This Horizon\" and in his 1938 novel \"\", which was finally published in 2003, long after his death.\nPay it forward.\nOn that theme, the phrase \"pay it forward\", though it was already in occasional use as a quotation, was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein in his book \"Between Planets\", published in 1951:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The banker reached into the folds of his gown, pulled out a single credit note. \"But eat first\u2014a full belly steadies the judgment. Do me the honor of accepting this as our welcome to the newcomer.\"\nHis pride said no; his stomach said YES! Don took it and said, \"Uh, thanks! That's awfully kind of you. I'll pay it back, first chance.\"\n\"Instead, pay it forward to some other brother who needs it.\"\nHe referred to this in a number of other stories, although sometimes just saying to pay a debt back by helping others, as in one of his last works, \"Job, a Comedy of Justice\".\nHeinlein was a mentor to Ray Bradbury, giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him. In Bradbury's novel \"Dandelion Wine\", published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr. Jonas, the Junkman:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How do I thank Mr. Jonas, he wondered, for what he's done? How do I thank him, how pay him back? No way, no way at all. You just can't pay. What then? What? Pass it on somehow, he thought, pass it on to someone else. Keep the chain moving. Look around, find someone, and pass it on. That was the only way...\nBradbury has also advised that writers he has helped thank him by helping other writers.\nHeinlein both preached and practiced this philosophy; now the Heinlein Society, a humanitarian organization founded in his name, does so, attributing the philosophy to its various efforts, including Heinlein for Heroes, the Heinlein Society Scholarship Program, and Heinlein Society blood drives. Author Spider Robinson made repeated reference to the doctrine, attributing it to his spiritual mentor Heinlein.\nInfluence and legacy.\nHonorifics.\nHeinlein is usually identified, along with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, as one of the three masters of science fiction to arise in the so-called Golden Age of science fiction, associated with John W. Campbell and his magazine \"Astounding\".\nIn the 1950s he was a leader in bringing science fiction out of the low-paying and less prestigious \"pulp ghetto\". Most of his works, including short stories, have been continuously in print in many languages since their initial appearance and are still available as new paperbacks decades after his death.\nHe was at the top of his form during, and himself helped to initiate, the trend toward social science fiction, which went along with a general maturing of the genre away from space opera to a more literary approach touching on such adult issues as politics and human sexuality. In reaction to this trend, hard science fiction began to be distinguished as a separate subgenre, but paradoxically Heinlein is also considered a seminal figure in hard science fiction, due to his extensive knowledge of engineering and the careful scientific research demonstrated in his stories. Heinlein himself stated\u2014with obvious pride\u2014that in the days before pocket calculators, he and his wife Virginia once worked for several days on a mathematical equation describing an Earth\u2013Mars rocket orbit, which was then subsumed in a single sentence of the novel \"Space Cadet\".\nWriting style.\nHeinlein is often credited with bringing serious writing techniques to the genre of science fiction. For example, when writing about fictional worlds, previous authors were often limited by the reader's existing knowledge of a typical \"space opera\" setting, leading to a relatively low creativity level: The same starships, death rays, and horrifying rubbery aliens becoming ubiquitous. This was necessary unless the author was willing to go into long expositions about the setting of the story, at a time when the word count was at a premium in SF.\nBut Heinlein utilized a technique called \"indirect exposition\", perhaps first introduced by Rudyard Kipling in his own science fiction venture, the Aerial Board of Control stories. Kipling had picked this up during his time in India, using it to avoid bogging down his stories set in India with explanations for his English readers. This technique\u2014mentioning details in a way that lets the reader infer more about the universe than is actually spelled out\u2014became a trademark rhetorical technique of Heinlein and writers influenced by him. Heinlein was significantly influenced by Kipling beyond this, for example quoting him in \"On the Writing of Speculative Fiction\".\nLikewise, Heinlein's name is often associated with the competent hero, a character archetype who, though he or she may have flaws and limitations, is a strong, accomplished person able to overcome any soluble problem set in their path. They tend to feel confident overall, have a broad life experience and set of skills, and not give up when the going gets tough. This style influenced not only the writing style of a generation of authors, but even their personal character. Harlan Ellison said, \"Very early in life when I read Robert Heinlein, I got the thread that runs through his stories\u2014the notion of the competent man ... I've always held that as my ideal. I've tried to be a very competent man.\"\nRules of writing.\nWhen fellow writers, or fans, wrote Heinlein asking for writing advice, he famously gave out his own list of rules for becoming a successful writer:\nAbout which he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The above five rules really have more to do with how to write speculative fiction than anything said above them. But they are amazingly hard to follow\u2014which is why there are so few professional writers and so many aspirants, and which is why I am not afraid to give away the racket!\nHeinlein later published an entire article, \"On the Writing of Speculative Fiction\", which included his rules, and from which the above quote is taken. When he says \"anything said above them\", he refers to his other guidelines. For example, he describes most stories as fitting into one of a handful of basic categories:\nIn the article, Heinlein proposes that most stories fit into either the gadget story or the human interest story, which is itself subdivided into the three latter categories. He also credits L. Ron Hubbard as having identified \"The Man-Who-Learned-Better\".\nInfluence among writers.\nHeinlein has had a pervasive influence on other science fiction writers. In a 1953 poll of leading science fiction authors, he was cited more frequently as an influence than any other modern writer. Critic James Gifford writes that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although many other writers have exceeded Heinlein's output, few can claim to match his broad and seminal influence. Scores of science fiction writers from the prewar Golden Age through the present day loudly and enthusiastically credit Heinlein for blazing the trails of their own careers, and shaping their styles and stories.\u2014\u200a\nHeinlein gave Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle extensive advice on a draft manuscript of \"The Mote in God's Eye\". He contributed a cover blurb \"Possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read.\" In their novel \"Footfall\", Niven and Pournelle included Robert A. Heinlein as a character under the name \"Bob Anson.\" Anson in the novel is a respected and well-known science-fiction author. Writer David Gerrold, responsible for creating the tribbles in \"Star Trek\", also credited Heinlein as the inspiration for his \"Dingilliad\" series of novels. Gregory Benford refers to his novel \"Jupiter Project\" as a Heinlein tribute. Similarly, Charles Stross says his Hugo Award-nominated novel \"Saturn's Children\" is \"a space opera and late-period Robert A. Heinlein tribute\", referring to Heinlein's \"Friday\". The theme and plot of Kameron Hurley's novel, \"The Light Brigade\" clearly echo those of Heinlein's \"Starship Troopers\".\nWords and phrases coined.\nEven outside the science fiction community, several words and phrases coined or adopted by Heinlein have passed into common English usage:\nInspiring culture and technology.\nIn 1962, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then still using his birth name, Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds, a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways (including its name) after the treatment of religion in the novel \"Stranger in a Strange Land\". This spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as \"grok\", \"Thou art God\", and \"Never Thirst\". Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, there was a frequent exchange of correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and he was a paid subscriber to their magazine, \"Green Egg\". This Church still exists as a 501(C)(3) religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community today. Zell-Ravenheart's wife, Morning Glory coined the term polyamory in 1990, another movement that includes Heinlein concepts among its roots.\nHeinlein was influential in making space exploration seem to the public more like a practical possibility. His stories in publications such as \"The Saturday Evening Post\" took a matter-of-fact approach to their outer-space setting, rather than the \"gee whiz\" tone that had previously been common. The documentary-like film \"Destination Moon\" advocated a Space Race with an unspecified foreign power almost a decade before such an idea became commonplace, and was promoted by an unprecedented publicity campaign in print publications. Many of the astronauts and others working in the U.S. space program grew up on a diet of the Heinlein juveniles, best evidenced by the naming of a crater on Mars after him, and a tribute interspersed by the Apollo 15 astronauts into their radio conversations while on the moon.\nHeinlein was also a guest commentator (along with fellow SF author Arthur C. Clarke) for Walter Cronkite's coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. He remarked to Cronkite during the landing that, \"This is the greatest event in human history, up to this time. This is\u2014today is New Year's Day of the Year One.\"\nHeinlein has inspired many transformational figures in business and technology including Lee Felsenstein, the designer of the first mass-produced portable computer, Marc Andreessen, co-author of the first widely-used web browser, and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX.\nHeinlein Society.\nThe Heinlein Society was founded by Virginia Heinlein on behalf of her husband, to \"pay forward\" the legacy of the writer to future generations of \"Heinlein's Children\". The foundation has programs to:\nThe Heinlein society also established the Robert A. Heinlein Award in 2003 \"for outstanding published works in science fiction and technical writings to inspire the human exploration of space\".\nHonors.\nIn his lifetime, Heinlein received four Hugo Awards, for \"Double Star\", \"Starship Troopers\", \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", and \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", and was nominated for four Nebula Awards, for \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", \"Friday\", \"Time Enough for Love\", and \"Job: A Comedy of Justice\". He was also given seven Retro-Hugos: two for best novel: \"Beyond This Horizon\" and \"Farmer in the Sky\"; three for best novella: \"If This Goes On...\", \"Waldo\", and \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\"; one for best novelette: \"The Roads Must Roll\"; and one for best dramatic presentation: \"Destination Moon\".\nHeinlein was also nominated for six Hugo Awards for the works \"Have Space Suit: Will Travel\", \"Glory Road\", \"Time Enough for Love\", \"Friday\", \"Job: A Comedy of Justice\" and \"Grumbles from the Grave\", as well as six Retro Hugo Awards for \"Magic, Inc.\", \"Requiem\", \"Coventry\", \"Blowups Happen\", \"Goldfish Bowl\", and \"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag\".\nHeinlein won the Locus Award for \"All-Time Favorite Author\" in 1973, and for \"All-Time Best Author\" in 1988.\nThe Science Fiction Writers of America named Heinlein its first Grand Master in 1974, presented 1975. Officers and past presidents of the Association select a living writer for lifetime achievement (now annually and including fantasy literature).\nIn 1977, Heinlein was awarded the Inkpot Award, and in 1985, he was awarded the Eisner Awards \"Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award\".\nMain-belt asteroid 6312 Robheinlein (1990 RH4), discovered on September 14, 1990, by H. E. Holt at Palomar, was named after him.\nIn 1994 the International Astronomical Union named Heinlein crater on Mars in his honor.\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Heinlein in 1998.\nIn 2001 the United States Naval Academy created the Robert A. Heinlein Chair in Aerospace Engineering.\nHeinlein was the Ghost of Honor at the 2008 World Science Fiction Convention in Denver, Colorado, which held several panels on his works. Nearly seventy years earlier, he had been a Guest of Honor at the same convention.\nIn 2016, after an intensive online campaign to win a vote for the opening, Heinlein was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians. His bronze bust, created by Kansas City sculptor E. Spencer Schubert, is on permanent display in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City.\nThe Libertarian Futurist Society has honored eight of Heinlein's novels and two short stories with their Hall of Fame award. The first two were given during his lifetime for \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" and \"Stranger in a Strange Land\". Five more were awarded posthumously for \"Red Planet\", \"Methuselah's Children\", \"Time Enough for Love\", and the short stories \"Requiem\" and \"Coventry\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nCritical.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n A critique of Heinlein from a Marxist perspective.

{"id": "25391", "revid": "38205273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25391", "title": "Russia", "text": "Country in Eastern Europe and North Asia\nRussia, or the Russian Federation, is a country in Eastern Europe and North Asia. It is the largest country in the world, spanning eleven time zones and sharing land borders with fourteen countries. With a population of over 140 million, Russia is the most populous country in Europe and the ninth-most populous country in the world. It is a highly urbanised country, with sixteen of its urban areas having more than 1\u00a0million inhabitants. Moscow, the most populous metropolitan area in Europe, is the capital and largest city of Russia; and Saint Petersburg is its second-largest city and cultural centre.\nHuman settlement on the territory of modern Russia dates back to the Lower Paleolithic. The East Slavs emerged as a recognised group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988, it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated; the Grand Duchy of Moscow led the unification of Russian lands, leading to the proclamation of the Tsardom of Russia in 1547. By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and the efforts of Russian explorers, developing into the Russian Empire, which remains the third-largest empire in history. However, with the Russian Revolution in 1917, Russia's monarchic rule was abolished and eventually replaced by the Russian SFSR\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state. Following the Russian Civil War, the Russian SFSR established the Soviet Union with three other Soviet republics, within which it was the largest and principal constituent. The Soviet Union underwent rapid industrialisation in the 1930s, amidst the deaths of millions under Joseph Stalin's rule, and later played a decisive role for the Allies in World War II by leading large-scale efforts on the Eastern Front\u2014rising as a global superpower. With the onset of the Cold War, it competed with the United States for ideological dominance and international influence. The Soviet era of the 20th century saw some of the most significant Russian technological achievements, including the first human-made satellite and the first human expedition into outer space.\nIn 1991, the Russian SFSR emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the Russian Federation. Following the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the Soviet government structure was abolished and a new constitution was adopted, which established a federal semi-presidential system. Since the turn of the century, Russia's political system has been dominated by Vladimir Putin, under whom the country has experienced democratic backsliding and has transformed from an authoritarian regime to an autocratic dictatorship. Post-Soviet Russia has been militarily involved in numerous conflicts, including its war with Georgia in 2008 and its war with Ukraine since 2014. The latter has involved the internationally unrecognised annexations of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea in 2014 and four other regions in 2022, during an ongoing war.\nRussia is generally considered a great power and is a regional power, possessing the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons and having the third-highest military expenditure in the world. Its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying on its vast mineral and energy resources, mainly oil and natural gas production. However, Russia ranks very low in international measurements of democracy, human rights and freedom of the press, and also has high levels of perceived corruption. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a member state of several international organisations. Russia is home to 32 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nEtymology.\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the English name \"Russia\" first appeared in the 14th century, borrowed from , used in the 11th century and frequently in 12th-century British sources, in turn derived from and the suffix .\nThere are several words in Russian which translate to \"Russians\" in English. The noun and adjective refers to ethnic Russians. The adjective denotes Russian citizens regardless of ethnicity. The same applies to the more recently coined noun , in the sense of citizen of the Russian state.\nThe oldest endonyms used were \"Rus'\" () and the \"Russian land\" (). According to the \"Primary Chronicle\", the word \"Rus'\" is derived from the Rus' people, who were a Swedish tribe, and from where the three original members of the Rurikid dynasty came from. The Finnish word for Swedes, , has the same origin. In modern historiography, the early medieval East Slavic state is usually referred to as \"Kievan Rus\"', named after its capital city. Another Medieval Latin name for \"Rus'\" was \"Ruthenia\".\nIn Russian, the current name of the country, (), comes from the Byzantine Greek name (). The name () was first attested in 1387. The name appeared in Russian sources in the 15th century and began to replace the vernacular \"Rus'\" during the rise of Moscow as the centre of a unified Russian state. However, until the end of the 17th century, the country was more often referred to by its inhabitants as \"Rus'\", the \"Russian land\" (), or the \"Muscovite state\" (), among other variations.\nIn 1721, Peter the Great proclaimed the Russian Empire (). The name \"Rossiya\" was used as the common designation for the multinational Russian Empire and then for the modern Russian state. \"Rossiya\" is distinguished from the ethnonym \"russkiy\", as it refers to a supranational identity, including ethnic Russians. After the Russian Revolution and the proclamation of the Russian SFSR in 1918, the \"Russian\" in the title of the state was \"Rossiyskaya\", rather than \"Russkaya\", as the former denoted a multinational state, while the latter had ethnic dimensions. In modern Russian, the name \"Rus'\" is still used in poetry or prose to refer to either the older Russia or an imagined essence of Russia.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first human settlement on Russia dates back to the Oldowan period in the early Lower Paleolithic. About 2 million years ago, representatives of \"Homo erectus\" migrated to the Taman Peninsula in southern Russia. Flint tools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in the North Caucasus. Radiocarbon dated specimens from Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains estimate the oldest Denisovan specimen lived 195\u2013122,700 years ago. Fossils of \"Denny\", an archaic human hybrid that was half Neanderthal and half Denisovan, and lived some 90,000 years ago, was also found within the latter cave. Russia was home to some of the last surviving Neanderthals, from about 45,000 years ago, found in Mezmaiskaya cave.\nThe first trace of an early modern human in Russia dates back to 45,000 years, in Western Siberia. The discovery of high concentration cultural remains of anatomically modern humans, from at least 40,000 years ago, was found at Kostyonki\u2013Borshchyovo, and at Sungir, dating back to 34,600 years ago\u2014both in western Russia. Humans reached Arctic Russia at least 40,000 years ago, in Mamontovaya Kurya. Ancient North Eurasian populations from Siberia genetically similar to Mal'ta\u2013Buret' culture and Afontova Gora were an important genetic contributor to Ancient Native Americans and Eastern Hunter-Gatherers.\nThe Kurgan hypothesis places the Volga-Dnieper region of southern Russia and Ukraine as the urheimat of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. Early Indo-European migrations from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe of Ukraine and Russia spread Yamnaya ancestry and Indo-European languages across large parts of Eurasia. Nomadic pastoralism developed in the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe beginning in the Chalcolithic. Remnants of these steppe civilisations were discovered in places such as Ipatovo, Sintashta, Arkaim, and Pazyryk, which bear the earliest known traces of horses in warfare. The genetic makeup of speakers of the Uralic language family in northern Europe was shaped by migration from Siberia that began at least 3,500 years ago.\nIn the 3rd to 4th centuries AD, the Gothic kingdom of Oium existed in southern Russia, which was later overrun by Huns. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the Bosporan Kingdom, which was a Hellenistic polity that succeeded the Greek colonies, was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes such as the Huns and Eurasian Avars. The Khazars, who were of Turkic origin, ruled the steppes between the Caucasus in the south, to the east past the Volga river basin, and west as far as Kyiv on the Dnieper river until the 10th century. After them came the Pechenegs who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the Cumans and the Kipchaks.\nThe ancestors of Russians are among the Slavic tribes that separated from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, who appeared in the northeastern part of Europe c.\u20091500\u202fyears ago. The East Slavs gradually settled western Russia (approximately between modern Moscow and Saint-Petersburg) in two waves: one moving from Kiev towards present-day Suzdal and Murom and another from Polotsk towards Novgorod and Rostov. Prior to Slavic migration, that territory was populated by Finno-Ugrian peoples. From the 7th century onwards, the incoming East Slavs slowly assimilated the native Finno-Ugrians.\nKievan Rus'.\nThe establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of Varangians, the Vikings who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas. According to the \"Primary Chronicle\", a Varangian from the Rus' people, named Rurik, was elected ruler of Novgorod in 862. In 882, his successor Oleg ventured south and conquered Kiev, which had been previously paying tribute to the Khazars. Rurik's son Igor and Igor's son Sviatoslav subsequently subdued all local East Slavic tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate, and launched several military expeditions to Bulgaria, Byzantium and Persia.\nIn the 10th to 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and his son Yaroslav the Wise (1019\u20131054) constitute the Golden Age of Kiev, which saw the acceptance of Orthodox Christianity from Byzantium, and the creation of the first East Slavic written legal code, the \"Russkaya Pravda\". The age of feudalism and decentralisation had come, marked by constant in-fighting between members of the Rurik dynasty that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of Vladimir-Suzdal in the north-east, the Novgorod Republic in the north, and Galicia-Volhynia in the south-west. By the 12th century, Kiev lost its pre-eminence and Kievan Rus' had fragmented into different principalities. Prince Andrey Bogolyubsky sacked Kiev in 1169 and made Vladimir his base, leading to political power being shifted to the north-east.\nLed by Prince Alexander Nevsky, Novgorodians repelled the invading Swedes in the Battle of the Neva in 1240, as well as the Germanic crusaders in the Battle on the Ice in 1242.\nKievan Rus' finally fell to the Mongol invasion of 1237\u20131240, which resulted in the sacking of Kiev and other cities, as well as the death of a major part of the population. The invaders, later known as Tatars, formed the state of the Golden Horde, which ruled over Russia for the next two centuries. Only the Novgorod Republic escaped foreign occupation after it agreed to pay tribute to the Mongols. Galicia-Volhynia would later be absorbed by Lithuania and Poland, while the Novgorod Republic continued to prosper in the north. In the northeast, the Byzantine-Slavic traditions of Kievan Rus' were adapted to form the Russian autocratic state.\nGrand Principality of Moscow.\nThe destruction of Kievan Rus' saw the eventual rise of the Grand Principality of Moscow, initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal. While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the \"gathering of the Russian lands\". When the seat of the Metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church moved to Moscow in 1325, its influence increased. Moscow's last rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as the chief fur trade centre and the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League.\nLed by Prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow, the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed its parent duchy and surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as Tver and Novgorod.\nIvan III (\"the Great\") threw off the control of the Golden Horde and gained sovereignty over the ethnically Russian lands; he later adopted the title of sovereign of all Russia. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire. Ivan\u00a0III married Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor Constantine\u00a0XI, and made the Byzantine double-headed eagle his own, and eventually Russia's, coat-of-arms. Vasili III united all of Russia by annexing the last few independent Russian states in the early 16th century.\nTsardom of Russia.\nIn development of the Third Rome ideas, the grand prince Ivan\u00a0IV (\"the Terrible\") was officially crowned as the first tsar of all Russia in 1547. The tsar promulgated a new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal representative body (the Zemsky Sobor), revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government. During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates: Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga, and the Khanate of Sibir in southwestern Siberia. Ultimately, by the end of the 16th century, Russia expanded east of the Ural Mountains. However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful Livonian War against the coalition of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (later the united Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth), the Kingdom of Sweden, and Denmark\u2013Norway for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade. In 1572, an invading army of Crimean Tatars were thoroughly defeated in the crucial Battle of Molodi.\nThe death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient Rurik dynasty in 1598, and in combination with the disastrous famine of 1601\u20131603, led to a civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, taking advantage, occupied parts of Russia, extending into the capital Moscow. In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by merchant Kuzma Minin and prince Dmitry Pozharsky. The Romanov dynasty acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of the Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.\nRussia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of the Cossacks. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian tsar, Alexis, whose acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War. Ultimately, Ukraine was split along the Dnieper, leaving the eastern part, (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian rule. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of vast Siberia continued, hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian River Routes, and by the mid-17th century, there were Russian settlements in eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. In 1648, Semyon Dezhnyov became the first European to navigate through the Bering Strait.\nImperial Russia.\nUnder Peter the Great, Russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721, and established itself as one of the European great powers. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700\u20131721), securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade. In 1703, on the Baltic Sea, Peter founded Saint Petersburg as Russia's new capital. Throughout his rule, sweeping reforms were made, which brought significant Western European cultural influences to Russia. He was succeeded by Catherine I (1725\u20131727), followed by Peter II (1727\u20131730), and Anna. The reign of Peter\u00a0I's daughter Elizabeth in 1741\u20131762 saw Russia's participation in the Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763). During the conflict, Russian troops overran East Prussia, reaching Berlin. However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the Kingdom of Prussia by pro-Prussian Peter\u00a0III of Russia.\nCatherine\u00a0II (\"the Great\"), who ruled in 1762\u20131796, presided over the Russian Age of Enlightenment. She extended Russian political control over the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and annexed most of its territories into Russia, making it the most populous country in Europe. In the south, after the successful Russo-Turkish Wars against the Ottoman Empire, Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, by dissolving the Crimean Khanate, and annexing Crimea. As a result of victories over Qajar Iran through the Russo-Persian Wars, by the first half of the 19th century, Russia also conquered the Caucasus. Catherine's successor, her son Paul, was unstable and focused predominantly on domestic issues. Following his short reign, Catherine's strategy was continued with Alexander\u00a0I's (1801\u20131825) wresting of Finland from the weakened Sweden in 1809, and of Bessarabia from the Ottomans in 1812. In North America, the Russians became the first Europeans to reach and colonise Alaska. In 1803\u20131806, the first Russian circumnavigation was made. In 1820, a Russian expedition discovered the continent of Antarctica.\nGreat power and development of society, sciences, and arts.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Russia joined alliances with various European powers, and fought against France. The French invasion of Russia at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold Russian winter led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which the pan-European Grande Arm\u00e9e faced utter destruction. Led by Mikhail Kutuzov and Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, the Imperial Russian Army ousted Napoleon and drove throughout Europe in the War of the Sixth Coalition, ultimately entering Paris. Alexander I controlled Russia's delegation at the Congress of Vienna, which defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.\nThe officers who pursued Napoleon into Western Europe brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia, and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive Decembrist revolt of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of Nicholas I (1825\u20131855), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe, was disrupted by defeat in the Crimean War.\nGreat liberal reforms and capitalism.\nNicholas's successor Alexander\u00a0II (1855\u20131881) enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the emancipation reform of 1861. These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the Imperial Russian Army, which liberated much of the Balkans from Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the 1877\u20131878 Russo-Turkish War. During most of the 19th and early 20th century, Russia and Britain colluded over Afghanistan and its neighbouring territories in Central and South Asia; the rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as the Great Game.\nThe late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander\u00a0II was assassinated in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists. The reign of his son Alexander\u00a0III (1881\u20131894) was less liberal but more peaceful.\nConstitutional monarchy and World War.\nUnder last Russian emperor, Nicholas\u00a0II (1894\u20131917), the Revolution of 1905 was triggered by the humiliating failure of the Russo-Japanese War. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms (Russian Constitution of 1906), including granting freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the State Duma.\nRevolution and civil war.\nIn 1914, Russia entered World War\u00a0I in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its Triple Entente allies. In 1916, the Brusilov Offensive of the Imperial Russian Army almost completely destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, high casualties, and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the Russian Revolution of 1917, carried out in two major acts. In early 1917, Nicholas II was forced to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and later executed during the Russian Civil War. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the Provisional Government, and proclaimed the Russian Republic. On 19 January [O.S. 6 January], 1918, the Russian Constituent Assembly declared Russia a democratic federal republic (thus ratifying the Provisional Government's decision). The next day the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.\nAn alternative socialist establishment co-existed, the Petrograd Soviet, wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called \"soviets\". The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it, and eventually, the October Revolution, led by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first socialist state. The Russian Civil War broke out between the anti-communist White movement and the Bolsheviks with its Red Army. In the aftermath of signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that concluded hostilities with the Central Powers of World War\u00a0I, Bolshevist Russia surrendered most of its western territories, which hosted 34% of its population, 54% of its industries, 32% of its agricultural land, and roughly 90% of its coal mines.\nThe Allied powers launched an unsuccessful military intervention in support of anti-communist forces. In the meantime, both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the Red Terror and White Terror. By the end of the violent civil war, Russia's economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged, and as many as 10 million perished during the war, mostly civilians. Millions became White \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and the Russian famine of 1921\u20131922 claimed up to five\u00a0million victims.\nSoviet Union.\nCommand economy and Soviet society.\nOn 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aides formed the Soviet Union, by joining the Russian SFSR into a single state with the Byelorussian, Transcaucasian, and Ukrainian republics. Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of 15 republics, the largest in size and population being the Russian SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically.\nFollowing Lenin's death in 1924, a troika was designated to take charge. Eventually Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party, managed to suppress all opposition factions and consolidate power in his hands to become the country's dictator by the 1930s. Leon Trotsky, the main proponent of world revolution, was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of Socialism in One Country became the official line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the Great Purge.\nStalinism and modernisation.\nUnder Stalin's leadership, the government launched a command economy, industrialisation of the largely rural country, and collectivisation of its agriculture. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to penal labour camps, including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to Stalin's rule, and millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, led to the Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933, which killed 5.7 to 8.7 million, 3.3 million of them in the Russian SFSR. The Soviet Union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time.\nWorld War II and United Nations.\nThe Soviet Union entered World War II on 17 September 1939 with its invasion of Poland, in accordance with a secret protocol within the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany. The Soviet Union later invaded Finland, and occupied and annexed the Baltic states, as well as parts of Romania. On 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest theater of World War\u00a0II.\nEventually, some 5 million Red Army troops were captured by the Nazis; the latter deliberately starved to death or otherwise killed 3.3\u00a0million Soviet POWs, and a vast number of civilians, as the \"Hunger Plan\" sought to fulfil Generalplan Ost. Although the Wehrmacht had considerable early success, their attack was halted in the Battle of Moscow. Subsequently, the Germans were dealt major defeats first at the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942\u20131943, and then in the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943. Another German failure was the Siege of Leningrad, in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by German and Finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered. Soviet forces steamrolled through Eastern and Central Europe in 1944\u20131945 and captured Berlin in May 1945. In August 1945, the Red Army invaded Manchuria and ousted the Japanese from Northeast Asia, contributing to the Allied victory over Japan.\nThe 1941\u20131945 period of World War\u00a0II is known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet Union, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II, and later became the Four Policemen, which was the foundation of the United Nations Security Council. During the war, Soviet civilian and military death were about 26\u201327 million, accounting for about half of all World War\u00a0II casualties. The Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation, which caused the Soviet famine of 1946\u20131947. However, at the expense of a large sacrifice, the Soviet Union emerged as a global superpower.\nSuperpower and Cold War.\nAfter World War II, according to the Potsdam Conference, the Red Army occupied parts of Eastern and Central Europe, including East Germany and the eastern regions of Austria. Dependent communist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states. After becoming the world's second nuclear power, the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Pact alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the rivalling United States and NATO.\nKhrushchev Thaw reforms and economic development.\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953 and a short period of collective rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and launched the policy of de-Stalinization, releasing many political prisoners from the Gulag labour camps. The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw. At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba.\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, \"Sputnik\u00a01\", thus starting the Space Age. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the \"Vostok\u00a01\" crewed spacecraft on 12 April 1961.\nPeriod of developed socialism or Era of Stagnation.\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until Leonid Brezhnev became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the Era of Stagnation. The 1965 Kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralisation of the Soviet economy. In 1979, after a communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. In May 1988, the Soviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.\nPerestroika, democratisation and Russian sovereignty.\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (restructuring) in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.\nBy 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the Baltic states chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a referendum was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation. In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin became the first directly elected President in Russian history when he was elected President of the Russian SFSR. In August 1991, a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 25 December 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, along with contemporary Russia, fourteen other post-Soviet states emerged.\nIndependent Russian Federation.\nTransition to a market economy and political crises.\nThe economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led Russia into a deep and prolonged depression. During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including privatisation and market and trade liberalisation were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of \"shock therapy\". The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of Russian oligarchs. Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight. The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services\u2014the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed, and millions plunged into poverty, while extreme corruption, as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly.\nIn late 1993, tensions between Yeltsin and the Russian parliament culminated in a constitutional crisis which ended violently through military force. During the crisis, Yeltsin was backed by Western governments, and over 100 people were killed.\nModern liberal constitution, international cooperation and economic stabilisation.\nIn December, a referendum was held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers. The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the North Caucasus, both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist Islamist insurrections. From the time Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an intermittent guerrilla war was fought between the rebel groups and Russian forces. Terrorist attacks against civilians were carried out by Chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of Russian civilians.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia assumed responsibility for settling the latter's external debts. In 1992, most consumer price controls were eliminated, causing extreme inflation and significantly devaluing the rouble. High budget deficits coupled with increasing capital flight and inability to pay back debts, caused the 1998 Russian financial crisis, which resulted in a further GDP decline.\nMovement towards a modernised economy, political centralisation and democratic backsliding.\nOn 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister and his chosen successor, Vladimir Putin. Putin then won the 2000 presidential election, and defeated the Chechen insurgency in the Second Chechen War.\nPutin won a second presidential term in 2004. High oil prices and a rise in foreign investment saw the Russian economy and living standards improve significantly. Putin's rule increased stability, while transforming Russia into an authoritarian state. In 2008, Putin took the post of prime minister, while Dmitry Medvedev was elected President for one term, to hold onto power despite legal term limits; this period has been described as a \"tandemocracy\".\nFollowing a diplomatic crisis with neighbouring Georgia, the Russo-Georgian War took place during 1\u201312 August 2008, resulting in Russia recognising two separatist states in the territories that it occupies in Georgia. It was the first European war of the 21st century. The 2008 constitutional amendments saw the terms of the president extend to six years and the lower house (State Duma) to five years. Putin then went on to win the 2012 presidential election, which fueled the \"Snow Revolution\" protests.\nInvasion of Ukraine.\nIn early 2014, following a pro-Western revolution in neighbouring Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea after a disputed referendum on the status of Crimea was staged under Russian occupation. The annexation generated an insurgency in the Donbas region of Ukraine, supported by Russian military intervention as part of an undeclared war against Ukraine. Russian mercenaries and military forces, with the support of local separatist militias, waged a war in eastern Ukraine against the new Ukrainian government after the Russian government fostered anti-government and pro-Russian protests in the region, although most residents had opposed secession from Ukraine. Amidst nationwide protests against corruption, Putin was re-elected for his second consecutive term in the 2018 presidential election.\nIn a major escalation of the conflict, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The invasion marked the largest conventional war in Europe since World War\u00a0II, and was met with international condemnation, as well as expanded sanctions against Russia.\nAs a result, Russia was expelled from the Council of Europe in March, and was suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council in April. In September, following successful Ukrainian counteroffensives, Putin announced a \"partial mobilisation\", Russia's first mobilisation since Operation Barbarossa. In the end of September, Putin proclaimed the annexation of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions, the largest annexation in Europe since World War\u00a0II. Putin and Russian-installed leaders signed treaties of accession, internationally unrecognised and widely denounced as illegal. As a result of the invasion, hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to have been killed or injured, while Russia has been accused of numerous war crimes. The war in Ukraine has further exacerbated Russia's demographic crisis.\nIn June 2023, the Wagner Group, a private military contractor fighting for Russia in Ukraine, declared an open rebellion against the Russian Ministry of Defence, capturing Rostov-on-Don, before beginning a march on Moscow. However, after negotiations between Wagner and the Belarusian government, the rebellion was called off. The leader of the rebellion, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was later killed in a plane crash. Putin won his third consecutive term in the 2024 presidential election, by winning 88% of the vote, the highest percentage in a presidential election in post-Soviet Russia.\nGeography.\nRussia's vast landmass stretches over the easternmost part of Europe and the northernmost part of Asia. It spans the northernmost edge of Eurasia and has the world's fourth-longest coastline, of over . Russia lies between latitudes 41\u00b0 and 82\u00b0 N, and longitudes 19\u00b0 E and 169\u00b0 W, extending some east to west, and north to south. Russia, by landmass, is larger than three continents, and has the same surface area as Pluto.\nRussia has nine major mountain ranges, and they are found along the southernmost regions, which share a significant portion of the Caucasus Mountains (containing Mount Elbrus, which at is the highest peak in Russia and Europe); the Altai and Sayan Mountains in Siberia; and in the East Siberian Mountains and the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East (containing Klyuchevskaya Sopka, which at is the highest active volcano in Eurasia). The Ural Mountains, running north to south through the country's west, are rich in mineral resources, and form the traditional boundary between Europe and Asia. The lowest point in Russia and Europe, is situated at the head of the Caspian Sea, where the Caspian Depression reaches some below sea level.\nRussia, as one of the world's only three countries bordering three oceans, has links with a great number of seas. Its major islands and archipelagos include Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, the New Siberian Islands, Wrangel Island, the Kuril Islands (four of which are disputed with Japan), and Sakhalin. The Diomede Islands, administered by Russia and the United States, are just apart; and Kunashir Island of the Kuril Islands is merely from Hokkaido, Japan.\nRussia, home of over 100,000 rivers, has one of the world's largest surface water resources, with its lakes containing approximately one-quarter of the world's liquid fresh water. Lake Baikal, the largest and most prominent among Russia's fresh water bodies, is the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake, containing over one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. Ladoga and Onega in northwestern Russia are two of the largest lakes in Europe. Russia is second only to Brazil by total renewable water resources. The Volga in western Russia, widely regarded as Russia's national river, is the longest river in Europe and forms the Volga Delta, the largest river delta in the continent. The Siberian rivers of Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and Amur are among the world's longest rivers.\nClimate.\nThe size of Russia and the remoteness of many of its areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate throughout most of the country, except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. Mountain ranges in the south and east obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian and Pacific oceans, while the European Plain spanning its west and north opens it to influence from the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. Most of northwest Russia and Siberia have a subarctic climate, with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of northeast Siberia (mostly Sakha, where the Northern Pole of Cold is located with the record low temperature of ), and more moderate winters elsewhere. Russia's vast coastline along the Arctic Ocean and the Russian Arctic islands have a polar climate.\nThe coastal part of Krasnodar Krai on the Black Sea, most notably Sochi, and some coastal and interior strips of the North Caucasus possess a humid subtropical climate with mild and wet winters. In many regions of East Siberia and the Russian Far East, winter is dry compared to summer, while other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The westernmost parts of Kaliningrad Oblast and some parts in the south of Krasnodar Krai and the North Caucasus have an oceanic climate. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some southernmost slivers of Siberia, possess a semi-arid climate.\nThroughout much of the territory, there are only two distinct seasons, winter and summer, as spring and autumn are usually brief. The coldest month is January (February on the coastline); the warmest is usually July. Great ranges of temperature are typical. In winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. Summers can be quite hot, even in Siberia. Climate change in Russia is causing more frequent wildfires, and thawing the country's large expanse of permafrost.\nBiodiversity.\nRussia, owing to its gigantic size, has diverse ecosystems, including polar deserts, tundra, forest-tundra, taiga, mixed and broadleaf forest, forest steppe, steppe, semi-desert, and subtropics. About half of Russia's territory is forested, and it has the world's largest area of forest. \nRussian biodiversity includes 12,500 species of vascular plants, 2,200 species of bryophytes, about 3,000 species of lichens, 7,000\u20139,000 species of algae, and 20,000\u201325,000 species of fungi. Russian fauna is composed of 320 species of mammals, over 732 species of birds, 75 species of reptiles, about 30 species of amphibians, 343 species of freshwater fish (high endemism), approximately 1,500 species of saltwater fishes, 9 species of cyclostomata, and approximately 100\u2013150,000 invertebrates (high endemism). Approximately 1,100 rare and endangered plant and animal species are included in the Russian Red Data Book.\nRussia's entirely natural ecosystems are conserved in nearly 15,000 specially protected natural territories of various statuses, occupying more than 10% of the country's total area. They include 45 biosphere reserves, 64 national parks, and 101 nature reserves. Although in decline, the country still has many ecosystems which are still considered intact forest, mainly in the northern taiga areas, and the subarctic tundra of Siberia. Russia had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 9.02 in 2019, ranking 10th out of 172 countries, and the first ranked major nation globally.\nGovernment and politics.\nRussia, by constitution, is a symmetric federal republic with a semi-presidential system, wherein the president is the head of state, and the prime minister is the head of government. It is structured as a multi-party representative democracy, with the federal government composed of three branches:\nThe president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term and may be elected no more than twice. Ministries of the government are composed of the premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister (whereas the appointment of the latter requires the consent of the State Duma). United Russia is the dominant political party in Russia, and has been described as \"big tent\" and the \"party of power\".\nPost-Soviet Russia was a flawed democracy during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin.223 However, following the presidencies of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, it has experienced significant democratic backsliding.223 The political system evolved from electoral authoritarianism into a consolidated authoritarian regime.323 Some political scientists have characterized Putin as the head of a dictatorship, or a personalist regime. Putin's second tenure as president has led to further autocratization,512 which has been the most significant since the Soviet era, with some authors suggesting a regeneration of totalitarian elements. Putin's ruling policies are generally referred to as Putinism.\nPolitical divisions.\nRussia, by constitution, is a symmetric (with the possibility of an asymmetric configuration) federation. Unlike the Soviet asymmetric model of the RSFSR, where only republics were \"subjects of the federation\", the current constitution raised the status of other regions to the level of republics and made all regions equal with the title \"subject of the federation\". The regions of Russia have reserved areas of competence, but regions do not have sovereignty, do not have the status of a sovereign state, do not have the right to indicate any sovereignty in their constitutions and do not have the right to secede from the country. The laws of the regions cannot contradict federal laws.\nThe federal subjects have equal representation\u2014two delegates each\u2014in the Federation Council, the upper house of the Federal Assembly. They do, however, differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy. The federal districts of Russia were established by Putin in 2000 to facilitate central government control of the federal subjects. Originally seven, currently there are eight federal districts, each headed by an envoy appointed by the president.\nForeign relations.\nRussia has the world's sixth-largest diplomatic network as of 2024[ [update]]. It maintains diplomatic relations with 187 United Nations member states, two partially-recognised states, and two United Nations observer states, along with 143 embassies. Russia is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It is generally described as a great power; however, some scholars view Russia's global influence as being in decline. Russia is also a former superpower as the leading constituent of the former Soviet Union. and the legal successor to Soviet foreign policies. It is a member state of the G20, the OSCE, BRICS, WTO, and the APEC; and the leading member state of organisations such as the CIS, the EAEU, the CSTO, and the SCO. Russia was also a member state of the G8 (now the G7) and part of the Council of Europe before its expulsion from the two groups in 2014 and 2022, respectively.\nRussia maintains close relations with neighbouring Belarus, which is a part of the Union State, a supranational confederation of the two states. Serbia has been a historically close ally of Russia, as both countries share a strong mutual cultural, ethnic, and religious affinity. From the 21st century, relations between Russia and China have significantly strengthened bilaterally and economically due to shared political interests. India is the largest customer of Russian military equipment, and the two countries share a strong strategic and diplomatic relationship since the Soviet era. Russia wields significant political influence across the geopolitically important South Caucasus and Central Asia, and the two regions have been described as being part of Russia's \"backyard\", or \"near abroad\".\nRussia shares a complex strategic, energy, and defence relationship with Turkey. It maintains cordial relations with Iran, as it is a strategic and economic ally. Russia has also significantly developed its relations with North Korea following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with increased defence co-operation. At the same time, its relations with neighbouring Ukraine and the Western world\u2014specifically the United States and the collective countries of the European Union and NATO\u2014have collapsed.\nIn the 21st century, Russia has pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at securing regional dominance in Europe and increasing its international influence, as well as increasing domestic support for the government. It has initiated military interventions in the post-Soviet states of Georgia and Ukraine, as well as in Syria during its prolonged civil war in a bid to increase its influence in the Middle East. Russia has also increasingly pushed to expand its influence across the Arctic, the Asia\u2013Pacific, Africa and Latin America. Two-thirds of the world's population, specifically the developing countries of the Global South, are either neutral or leaning towards Russia politically. Russia has also continued using subversive tactics to increase perceptions of its geopolitical power in its rival countries, including cyberwarfare, disinformation campaigns, sabotage attacks, assassination attempts, airspace violations, electoral interferences, and nuclear saber-rattling.\nMilitary.\nThe Russian Armed Forces are divided into the Ground Forces, the Navy, and the Aerospace Forces\u2014and there are also two independent arms of service: the Strategic Missile Troops and the Airborne Troops. As of 2025[ [update]], the military have 1.1 million active-duty personnel, which is the world's fifth-largest, and about 1.5 million reserve personnel. It is mandatory for all male citizens aged 18\u201327 to be drafted for a year of service in the Armed Forces.\nRussia is among the five recognised nuclear-weapons states, with the world's largest stockpile of nuclear weapons; over half of the world's nuclear weapons are owned by Russia. Russia possesses the second-largest fleet of ballistic missile submarines, and is one of the only three countries operating strategic bombers. As of 2023[ [update]], Russia maintains the world's third-highest military expenditure, spending $109 billion, corresponding to about 5.9% of its GDP. It was also the third-largest arms exporter in 2020\u20132024, and has a large and indigenous defence industry, which produces the majority of its military equipment.\nHuman rights.\nViolations of human rights in Russia have been increasingly reported by leading democracy and human rights groups. In particular, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say that Russia is not democratic and allows few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens.\nSince 2004, Freedom House has ranked Russia as \"not free\" in its \"Freedom in the World\" survey. Since 2011, the Economist Intelligence Unit has ranked Russia as an \"authoritarian regime\" in its Democracy Index, ranking it 150th out of 167 countries in 2024. In regards to media freedom, Russia was ranked 162nd out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' Press Freedom Index for 2024. The Russian government has been widely criticised by political dissidents and human rights activists for unfair elections, crackdowns on opposition political parties and protests, persecution of non-governmental organisations and enforced suppression and killings of independent journalists, and censorship of mass media and internet.\nMuslims, especially Salafis, have faced persecution in Russia. To quash the insurgency in the North Caucasus, Russian authorities have been accused of indiscriminate killings, arrests, forced disappearances, and torture of civilians. In Dagestan, some Salafis along with facing government harassment based on their appearance, have had their homes blown up in counterinsurgency operations. Chechens and Ingush in Russian prisons reportedly take more abuse than other ethnic groups. During the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia has set up filtration camps where many Ukrainians are subjected to abuses and forcibly sent to Russia; the camps have been compared to those used in the Chechen Wars. Political repression also increased following the start of the invasion, with laws adopted that establish punishments for \"discrediting\" the armed forces.\nRussia has introduced several restrictions on LGBTQ rights. In 2013, an anti-LGBTQ law banning \"gay propaganda\" was unanimously passed by the State Duma and the Federation Council, later being signed into law by Vladimir Putin. In 2020, the Russian parliament legalized a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, and in 2021 the Ministry of Justice designated the LGBTQ rights group Russian LGBT Network as a \"foreign agent\". In 2022, further amendments were made to the 2013 anti-LGBTQ law. In 2023, the Russian parliament passed a bill banning gender reassignment surgery for transgender people and the Supreme Court of Russia banned the international LGBTQ movement as \"extremist\", outlawing it in the country. In 2024, the Supreme Court issued the first convictions from the latter ruling.\nLaw, corruption and crime.\nPost-Soviet Russia under the regime of Vladimir Putin has been governed by a form of crony capitalism. Its political system has been variously described as a kleptocracy, an oligarchy, and a plutocracy. As of 2024[ [update]], it is the lowest rated European country in Transparency International's annual Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking 154th out of the 180 countries listed. \nCorruption has significantly increased following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is seen as a significant issue in society. It affects various sectors, including the economy, the government, law enforcement, healthcare, education, and the military. Russia's shadow economy was estimated to be about 44% of the total GDP in 2018. Penal military units have been deployed as storm troops during the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War since 2022, such as the Storm-Z and Storm-V units. According to estimates by the BBC, around 48,000 prisoners were recruited to fight for the Wagner Group.\nThe primary and fundamental statement of laws in Russia is the constitution. Statutes, such as the Russian Civil Code and the Russian Criminal Code, are the predominant legal sources of Russian law. Russia has the largest incarcerated population in Europe, and the fifth-largest incarcerated population in the world. Its incarceration rate is among the highest in Europe, although the number has fallen steadily, by 59% since 2000. As of 2021[ [update]], Russia's intentional homicide rate stood at 6.8 per 100,000 people. In 2023, Russia had the world's second-largest illegal arms trade market, after the United States, was described as a key hub for human trafficking, and was ranked first in Europe and 19th globally in the Global Organized Crime Index.\nEconomy.\nRussia has a high-income, industrialized, mixed market-oriented economy following a turbulent transition from the Soviet planned model during the 1990s. According to the International Monetary Fund, it has the ninth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest economy by GDP (PPP). As of 2023[ [update]], the service sector accounts for roughly 57% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (30%), while the agricultural sector is the smallest, at 3% of total GDP. It has a labour force of about 73 million, which is the eighth-largest in the world. Russia's largest trading partner is China.\nRussia's human development is ranked as \"very high\" in the annual Human Development Index. Roughly 70% of Russia's total GDP is driven by final consumption, and the country has the world's twelfth-largest consumer market. Russia has the fifth-highest number of billionaires in the world. However, its income inequality remains comparatively high compared to other developed countries. The variance of natural resources among its federal subjects has also led to regional economic disparities. High levels of corruption, declining oil export revenues, a shrinking labor force, human capital flight, and an aging and declining population also remain major barriers to future economic growth.\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country has faced extensive sanctions and other negative financial actions from the Western world and its allies which have the aim of isolating the Russian economy from the Western financial system. However, Russia has completed its transition into a war economy, and has shown resilience to such measures broadly, maintaining economic stability and growth\u2014driven primarily by high military expenditure, rising household consumption and wages, low unemployment, and increased government spending. Yet, inflation has remained comparatively high, with experts predicting the sanctions will have a long-term negative effect on the Russian economy.\nTransport and energy.\nRailway transport in Russia is mostly controlled by the state-run Russian Railways. The total length of common-used railway tracks is the world's third-longest, exceeding . As of 2019[ [update]], Russia has the world's fifth-largest road network, with over 1.5 million\u00a0km of roads. However, its road density is among the world's lowest, in part to its vast land area. Russia's inland waterways are the longest in the world, totaling . It has over 900 airports, ranking seventh in the world, of which the busiest is Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow. The largest ports include the Port of Novorossiysk, the Great Port of Saint Petersburg and the Port of Vladivostok.\nRussia has one of the world's largest amounts of energy resources throughout its vast landmass, particularly natural gas and oil, which play a crucial role in its energy self-sufficiency and exports. It has been widely described as an energy superpower. Russia has the world's largest proven gas reserves, the second-largest coal reserves, the eighth-largest proven oil reserves, and the largest oil shale reserves in Europe. As of 2023[ [update]], it is also the second-largest producer and the third-largest exporter of natural gas, as well as the second-largest producer and exporter of crude oil. Russia's large oil and gas sector accounted for 30% of its federal budget revenues in 2024, down from 50% in the mid-2010s, suggesting economic diversification.\nRussia is the world's third-largest energy producer as of 2023[ [update]]. Fossil fuels account for over 64% of energy production and 87% of energy consumption. Natural gas is by far the largest source of energy, comprising over half of the energy production and 42% of electricity consumption. Russia was the first country to develop civilian nuclear power, building the world's first nuclear power plant in 1954, and remains a pioneer in nuclear energy technology and is considered a world leader in fast neutron reactors. Russia is the world's fourth-largest nuclear energy producer. Russian energy policy aims to expand the role of nuclear energy and develop new reactor technology. Russia is the sole country that builds and operates nuclear-powered icebreakers, which ease navigation along the Northern Sea Route, and aid in utilizing its Arctic policy in its continental shelf.\nRussia joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, and ratified the agreement in 2019. Its greenhouse gas emissions are the fourth-largest in the world as of 2023[ [update]]. Coal accounts for over 10% of its energy consumption. Russia is the fifth-largest hydroelectric producer as of 2022[ [update]], with hydroelectric power contributing almost a fifth to the total energy generation (17%). Though it is the eighth-largest renewable energy producer as of 2023[ [update]], the use and development of other renewable energy resources remain negligible, as Russia is among the few countries without strong governmental or public support for a renewable energy transition.\nAgriculture and fishery.\nAgriculture, forestry and fishing contributes about 3.3% of the country's total GDP as of 2023[ [update]]. It has the world's fourth-largest cultivated area, at . However, due to the harshness of its environment, only about 13.1% of its land is agricultural, with an additional 7.4% being arable. The country's agricultural land is considered part of the \"breadbasket\" of Europe. More than one-third of the sown area is devoted to fodder crops, and the remaining farmland is used industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits. The main product of Russian farming has always been grain, which occupies well over half the cropland. Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat and the largest producer of barley and buckwheat. It is also among the largest exporters of maize and sunflower oil, as well as the leading producer of fertiliser.\nVarious analysts of climate change adaptation foresee large opportunities for Russian agriculture during the rest of the 21st century as arability increases in Siberia, which would lead to both internal and external migration to the region. Owing to its large coastline along three oceans and twelve marginal seas, Russia maintains the world's sixth-largest fishing industry, capturing nearly 5 million tons of fish in 2018. It is home to the world's finest caviar, the beluga, and produces about one-third of all canned fish and some one-fourth of the world's total fresh and frozen fish.\nScience and technology.\nRussia spent about 1% of its GDP on research and development in 2019, with the world's tenth-highest budget. It also ranked tenth worldwide in the number of scientific publications in 2020, with roughly 1.3 million papers. Since 1904, Nobel Prize were awarded to 26 Soviets and Russians in physics, chemistry, medicine, economy, literature and peace. Russia ranked 60th in the Global Innovation Index in 2025.\nSince the times of Nikolay Lobachevsky, who pioneered the non-Euclidean geometry, and Pafnuty Chebyshev, a prominent tutor, Russian mathematicians became among the world's most influential. Dmitry Mendeleev invented the Periodic table, the main framework of modern chemistry. Nine Soviet and Russian mathematicians have been awarded with the Fields Medal. Grigori Perelman was offered the first ever Clay Millennium Prize Problems Award for his final proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture in 2002, as well as the Fields Medal in 2006.\nAlexander Popov was among the inventors of radio, while Nikolai Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were co-inventors of laser and maser. Oleg Losev made crucial contributions in the field of semiconductor junctions, and discovered light-emitting diodes. Vladimir Vernadsky is considered one of the founders of geochemistry, biogeochemistry, and radiogeology. \u00c9lie Metchnikoff is known for his groundbreaking research in immunology. Ivan Pavlov is known chiefly for his work in classical conditioning. Lev Landau made fundamental contributions to many areas of theoretical physics.\nNikolai Vavilov was best known for having identified the centres of origin of cultivated plants. Trofim Lysenko was known mainly for Lysenkoism. Many famous Russian scientists and inventors were \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Igor Sikorsky was an aviation pioneer. Vladimir Zworykin was the inventor of the iconoscope and kinescope television systems. Theodosius Dobzhansky was the central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work in shaping the modern synthesis. George Gamow was one of the foremost advocates of the Big Bang theory.\nSpace exploration.\nRoscosmos is Russia's national space agency. The country's achievements in the field of space technology and space exploration can be traced back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the father of theoretical astronautics, whose works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as Sergey Korolyov, Valentin Glushko, and many others who contributed to the success of the Soviet space programme in the early stages of the Space Race and beyond.\nIn 1957, the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, \"Sputnik\u00a01\", was launched. In 1961, the first human trip into space was successfully made by Yuri Gagarin. Many other Soviet and Russian space exploration records ensued. In 1963, Valentina Tereshkova became the first and youngest woman in space, having flown a solo mission on Vostok 6. In 1965, Alexei Leonov became the first human to conduct a spacewalk, exiting the space capsule during Voskhod 2.\nIn 1957, Laika, a Soviet space dog, became the first animal to orbit the Earth, aboard Sputnik 2. In 1966, Luna\u00a09 became the first spacecraft to achieve a survivable landing on a celestial body, the Moon. In 1968, Zond 5 brought the first Earthlings (two tortoises and other life forms) to circumnavigate the Moon. In 1970, Venera\u00a07 became the first spacecraft to land on another planet, Venus. In 1971, Mars\u00a03 became the first spacecraft to land on Mars. During the same period, \"Lunokhod 1\" became the first space exploration rover, while \"Salyut\u00a01\" became the world's first space station.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], Russia has 181 active satellites in space, which is the third-highest in the world. Between the final flight of the Space Shuttle programme in 2011 and the 2020 SpaceX's first crewed mission, Soyuz rockets were the only launch vehicles capable of transporting astronauts to the ISS. Luna\u00a025 launched in August 2023, was the first of the Luna-Glob Moon exploration programme.\nTourism.\nMost foreign tourists come from China. Major tourist routes in Russia include a journey around the Golden Ring of Russia, a theme route of ancient Russian cities; cruises on large rivers such as the Volga; hikes on mountain ranges such as the Caucasus Mountains, and journeys on the famous Trans-Siberian Railway. Russia's most visited and popular landmarks include Red Square, the Peterhof Palace, the Kazan Kremlin, the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius and Lake Baikal.\nMoscow, the nation's cosmopolitan capital and historic core, is a bustling modern megacity; it retains classical and Soviet-era architecture while boasting high art, world class ballet, and modern skyscrapers. Saint Petersburg, the imperial capital, is famous for its classical architecture, cathedrals, museums and theatres, white nights, crisscrossing rivers and numerous canals. Russia is famed worldwide for its rich museums, such as the State Russian, the State Hermitage, and the Tretyakov Gallery, and for theatres such as the Bolshoi and the Mariinsky. The Moscow Kremlin and the Saint Basil's Cathedral are among the cultural landmarks of Russia.\nDemographics.\nRussia had an estimated population of 146.0 million in 2025 (143.6 million excluding Crimea and Sevastopol), down from 147.2 million in the 2021 census. It is the most populous country in Europe and ninth-most populous country in the world. With a population density of , Russia is one of the world's most sparsely populated countries, with the vast majority of its people concentrated within its western part. The country is highly urbanised, with two-thirds of the population living in urban areas. As of 2024[ [update]], the total fertility rate across Russia is estimated to be 1.41 children born per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and among the lowest in the world. Subsequently, it has one of the oldest populations in the world, with a median age of 41.9 years.\nRussia's population peaked at over 148 million in 1993, having subsequently declined due to its death rate exceeding its birth rate, which some analysts have called a demographic crisis. In 2009, it recorded annual population growth for the first time in fifteen years, and subsequently experienced annual population growth due to declining death rates, increased birth rates, and increased immigration. However, these population gains have been reversed since 2020, as excessive deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the largest peacetime decline in its history. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the demographic crisis has deepened, owing to high military fatalities and renewed emigration. Recent studies have shown that between 15-45% of Russian emigrants have returned to Russia, though these numbers are not conclusive.\nRussia is a multinational state with many subnational entities associated with different minorities. There are over 193 ethnic groups nationwide. In the 2010 census, roughly 81% of the population were ethnic Russians, and the remaining 19% of the population were ethnic minorities. Over four-fifths of Russia's population was of European descent\u2014of whom the vast majority were Slavs, with a substantial minority of Finno-Ugric and Germanic peoples. Russia has the third-largest immigrant population in the world, with over 12 million immigrants residing in the country as of 2019[ [update]]. The vast majority of the Immigrants hail from post-Soviet states, with about half of them being from Ukraine and Kazakhstan as of 2020[ [update]].\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguage.\nRussian is the official and the predominantly spoken language in Russia. It is the most spoken native language in Europe, the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia, as well as the world's most widely spoken Slavic language. Russian is one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station, as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\nRussia is a multilingual nation: approximately 100\u2013150 minority languages are spoken across the country. According to the Russian Census of 2010, 137.5\u00a0million across the country spoke Russian, 3.1\u00a0million spoke Tatar, and 1.1\u00a0million spoke Ukrainian. The constitution gives the country's individual republics the right to establish their own state languages in addition to Russian, as well as guarantee its citizens the right to preserve their native language and to create conditions for its study and development. However, various experts have claimed Russia's linguistic diversity is rapidly declining due to many languages becoming endangered.\nReligion.\nRussia is constitutionally a secular state that officially enshrines freedom of religion. The largest religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, chiefly represented by the Russian Orthodox Church, which is legally recognised for its \"special role\" in the country's \"history and the formation and development of its spirituality and culture.\" Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism are recognised by Russian law as the \"traditional\" religions of the country constituting its \"historical heritage\".\nIslam is the second-largest religion in Russia and is traditional among the majority of peoples in the North Caucasus and some Turkic peoples in the Volga-Ural region. Large populations of Buddhists are found in Kalmykia, Buryatia, Zabaykalsky Krai, and they are the vast majority of the population in Tuva. A negligible population practices other religions\u2014such as Rodnovery (Slavic Neopaganism), Assianism (Scythian Neopaganism), other ethnic Paganisms, and inter-Pagan movements such as Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism, various movements of Hinduism, Siberian shamanism and Tengrism, various Neo-Theosophical movements such as Roerichism\u2014among other faiths. Some religious minorities have faced oppression and some have been banned in the country: notably, in 2017 the Jehovah's Witnesses were outlawed in Russia, facing persecution ever since, after having been declared an \"extremist\" and \"nontraditional\" faith.\nIn 2012, the research organisation Sreda, in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice, published the Arena Atlas, an adjunct to the 2010 census, enumerating in detail the religious populations and nationalities of Russia, based on a large-sample country-wide survey. The results showed that 47.3% of Russians declared themselves Christians\u2014including 41% Russian Orthodox, 1.5% simply Orthodox or members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, 4.1% unaffiliated Christians, and less than 1% Old Believers, Catholics or Protestants\u201425% were believers without affiliation to any specific religion, 13% were atheists, 6.5% were Muslims, 1.2% were followers of \"traditional religions honouring gods and ancestors\" (Rodnovery, other Paganisms, Siberian shamanism and Tengrism), 0.5% were Buddhists, 0.1% were religious Jews and 0.1% were Hindus.\nEducation.\nRussia has a near-universal adult literacy rate, and has compulsory education for a duration of 11 years, exclusively for children aged 7 to 17\u201318. It grants free education to its citizens by constitution. The Ministry of Education of Russia is responsible for primary and secondary education, as well as vocational education, while the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia is responsible for science and higher education. Regional authorities regulate education within their jurisdictions within the prevailing framework of federal laws. As of 2021[ [update]], over 41% of the Russian population has a bachelor's degree or an equivalent\u2014which is among the highest percentages of tertiary-level graduates in the world.\nRussia's pre-school education system is highly developed and optional, some four-fifths of children aged 3 to 6 attend day nurseries or kindergartens. Primary school is compulsory for eleven years, starting from age 6 to 7, and leads to a basic general education certificate. An additional two or three years of schooling are required for the secondary-level certificate, and some seven-eighths of Russians continue their education past this level.\nAdmission to an institute of higher education is selective and highly competitive: first-degree courses usually take five years. The oldest and largest universities in Russia are Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg State University. There are ten across the country.\nHealth.\nRussia constitutionally guarantees free, universal health care for all Russian citizens through a compulsory state health insurance programme. The Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation oversees the Russian public healthcare system, and the sector employs more than two million people. Federal regions also have their own departments of health that oversee local administration. A separate private health insurance plan is needed to access private healthcare in Russia.\nRussia spent 7.39% of its GDP on healthcare in 2021. Its healthcare expenditure is notably lower than other developed nations. Russia has one of the world's most female-biased sex ratios, with 0.859 males to every female, due to its high male mortality rate. As of 2022[ [update]], the overall life expectancy in Russia at birth is 73 years (68 years for males and 78 years for females), an increase of roughly 4.86 years from 2000. The country has a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births).\nThe principal causes of death in Russia are cardiovascular diseases. The country's historically high alcohol consumption rate is the biggest health issue, as it remains one of the world's highest, despite a stark decrease in the last decade. Other prevalent health issues are obesity, with most adults being overweight or obese, and smoking, which is among the highest in the world. Russia's high suicide rate also remains a significant social issue.\nCulture.\nRussian culture reflects a long, gradual, and complex amalgamation of various elements that coincided with centuries of development, expansion, and interaction with different peoples, artistic movements, and cultures. Russia has heavily influenced classical music, ballet, theatre, mathematics, sport, painting, and cinema. Russian writers and philosophers have played an important role in the development of European literature and thought. Russia has also made pioneering contributions to science, technology, and space exploration.\nRussia is home to 32 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 21 of which are cultural, while 31 lie on the tentative list. The large global Russian diaspora has also played a major role in spreading Russian culture throughout the world. Russia's national symbol, the double-headed eagle, dates back to the Tsardom period and is featured in its coat of arms and heraldry. The Russian Bear and Mother Russia are often used as national personifications of the country. Matryoshka dolls are a cultural icon of Russia.\nHolidays.\nRussia has eight official holidays spanning public, patriotic, and religious commemorations. The year starts with New Year's Day on 1 January, soon followed by Russian Orthodox Christmas on 7 January; the two are the country's most popular holidays. Defender of the Fatherland Day, dedicated to men, is celebrated on 23 February. International Women's Day on 8 March, gained momentum in Russia during the Soviet era. The annual celebration of women has become so popular, especially among Russian men, that the flower vendors of Moscow often see profits \"fifteen times\" more compared to other holidays. Spring and Labour Day, originally a Soviet era holiday dedicated to workers, is celebrated on 1 May.\nVictory Day, which honours Soviet victory over Nazi Germany and the End of World War II in Europe, is celebrated on 9 May as an annual large parade in Moscow's Red Square and marks the famous Immortal Regiment civil event. Other patriotic holidays include Russia Day on 12 June, celebrated to commemorate Russia's declaration of sovereignty from the collapsing Soviet Union, and Unity Day on 4 November, commemorating the 1612 uprising that marked the end of the Polish occupation of Moscow.\nThere are many popular non-public holidays. Old New Year is celebrated on 14 January. Maslenitsa is an ancient and popular East Slavic folk holiday. Cosmonautics Day on 12 April, in tribute to the first human trip into space. Two major Christian holidays are Easter and Trinity Sunday.\nArt and architecture.\nEarly Russian painting is represented in icons and vibrant frescos. In the early 15th century, master icon painter Andrei Rublev created some of Russia's most treasured religious art. The Russian Academy of Arts, which was established in 1757 to train Russian artists, brought Western techniques of secular painting to Russia. In the 18th century, academicians Ivan Argunov, Dmitry Levitzky, Vladimir Borovikovsky became influential. The early 19th century saw many prominent paintings by Karl Briullov and Alexander Ivanov, both of whom were known for Romantic historical canvases. Ivan Aivazovsky, another Romantic painter, is considered one of the greatest masters of marine art.\nIn the 1860s, a group of critical realists (Peredvizhniki), led by Ivan Kramskoy, Ilya Repin and Vasiliy Perov broke with the academy, and portrayed the many-sided aspects of social life in paintings. The turn of the 20th century saw the rise of symbolism, represented by Mikhail Vrubel and Nicholas Roerich. The Russian avant-garde flourished from approximately 1890 to 1930; globally influential artists from this era were El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, Natalia Goncharova, Wassily Kandinsky, and Marc Chagall.\nThe history of Russian architecture begins with early woodcraft buildings of ancient Slavs and the church architecture of Kievan Rus'. The Christianization of Kievan Rus' brought centuries Byzantine architecture. Following Mongol occupation, Kievan Rus' cut its ties with the Byzantine Empire, and Russian architecture saw native innovations, such as the invention of the iconostasis. Aristotle Fioravanti and other Italian architects brought Renaissance trends to the Grand Principality of Moscow, which influenced the reconstruction of the Moscow Kremlin. The 16th century saw the development of the unique tent-like churches and the onion dome design, which is a distinctive feature of Russian architecture. In the 17th century, the \"fiery style\" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and Yaroslavl, gradually paving the way for the Naryshkin baroque of the 1680s.\nAfter the reforms of Peter the Great, Russia's architecture became influenced by Western European styles. The 18th-century taste for Rococo architecture led to the works of Bartolomeo Rastrelli and his followers. The most influential Russian architects of the eighteenth century, Vasily Bazhenov, Matvey Kazakov, and Ivan Starov, created lasting monuments in Moscow and Saint Petersburg and established a base for the more Russian forms that followed. During the reign of Catherine the Great, Saint Petersburg was transformed into an outdoor museum of Neoclassical architecture. Under Alexander I, Empire style became the \"de facto\" architectural style. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Neo-Byzantine and Russian Revival style. In the early 20th century, Russian neoclassical revival became a trend. Prevalent styles of the late 20th century were Art Nouveau, Constructivism, and Socialist Classicism.\nMusic.\nUntil the 18th century, music in Russia consisted mainly of church music and folk songs and dances. In the 19th century, it was defined by the tension between classical composer Mikhail Glinka along with other members of The Mighty Handful, who were later succeeded by the Belyayev circle, and the Russian Musical Society led by composers Anton and Nikolay Rubinstein. The later tradition of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era, was continued into the 20th century by Sergei Rachmaninoff. World-renowned composers of the 20th century include Alexander Scriabin, Alexander Glazunov, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, and later Edison Denisov, Sofia Gubaidulina, Georgy Sviridov, and Alfred Schnittke.\nDuring the Soviet era, popular music also produced a number of renowned figures, such as the two balladeers\u2014Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava, and performers such as Alla Pugacheva. Jazz, even with sanctions from Soviet authorities, flourished and evolved into one of the country's most popular musical forms. By the 1980s, rock music became popular across Russia, and produced bands such as Aria, Aquarium, DDT, and Kino; the latter's leader Viktor Tsoi, was in particular, a gigantic figure. Pop music has continued to flourish in Russia since the 1960s, with globally famous acts such as t.A.T.u.\nLiterature and philosophy.\nRussian literature is among the world's most influential and developed. It can be traced to the Middle Ages, when epics and chronicles in Old East Slavic were composed. By the Age of Enlightenment, literature had grown in importance, with works from Mikhail Lomonosov, Denis Fonvizin, Gavrila Derzhavin, and Nikolay Karamzin. From the early 1830s, during the Golden Age of Russian Poetry, literature underwent an astounding golden age in poetry, prose and drama. Romantic literature permitted a flowering of poetic talent: Vasily Zhukovsky and later his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Following Pushkin's footsteps, a new generation of poets were born, including Mikhail Lermontov, Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, Fyodor Tyutchev and Afanasy Fet.\nThe first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol. Then, during the Age of Realism, came Ivan Turgenev, who mastered both short stories and novels. Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy soon became internationally renowned. Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin wrote prose satire, while Nikolai Leskov is best remembered for his shorter fiction. In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and became a leading dramatist. Other important 19th-century developments included the fabulist Ivan Krylov, non-fiction writers such as the critic Vissarion Belinsky, and playwrights such as Aleksandr Griboyedov and Aleksandr Ostrovsky. The beginning of the 20th century ranks as the Silver Age of Russian Poetry. This era had poets such as Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Boris Pasternak, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Sergei Yesenin and Konstantin Balmont. It also produced some first-rate novelists and short-story writers, such as Aleksandr Kuprin, Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, Leonid Andreyev, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Andrei Bely.\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, Russian literature split into Soviet and white \u00e9migr\u00e9 parts. In the 1930s, Socialist realism became the predominant trend in Russia. Its leading figure was Maxim Gorky, who laid the foundations of this style. Mikhail Bulgakov was one of the leading writers of the Soviet era. Nikolay Ostrovsky's novel How the Steel Was Tempered has been among the most successful works of Russian literature. Influential \u00e9migr\u00e9 writers include Vladimir Nabokov and Isaac Asimov, who was considered one of the \"Big Three\" science fiction writers. Some writers dared to oppose Soviet ideology, such as Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who wrote about life in the Gulag camps.\nRussian literature faced rapid and difficult changes during the turbulent post-Soviet 1990s, with writers and publishers struggling to adjust to new economic and political developments. Domestic literature subsequently declined in influence among most Russians, who now had sudden and rapid access to a wide volume of previously suppressed Western literary movements. Nevertheless, this environment fostered experimental and postmodern literature and satire. At the beginning of the 21st century, the most discussed figures, postmodernists Victor Pelevin and Vladimir Sorokin, remained the leading Russian writers.\nRussian philosophy has been influential. Religious and spiritual philosophy is represented by Vladimir Solovyov, Nikolai Berdyaev, Pavel Florensky, Semyon Frank, Nikolay Lossky, Vasily Rozanov, and others. Mystic Helena Blavatsky gained an international following as the leading theoretician of Theosophy and the co-founder of the Theosophical Society. Alexander Herzen is known as one of the fathers of agrarian populism. Mikhail Bakunin is referred to as the father of anarchism. Peter Kropotkin was the most important theorist of anarcho-communism. Mikhail Bakhtin's writings have significantly inspired scholars in various fields. Vladimir Lenin, a major revolutionary, developed a variant of communism known as Leninism. Leon Trotsky, Lenin's contemporary and co-revolutionary, founded his own strain of Marxism known as Trotskyism. Alexander Zinoviev was a prominent philosopher and writer in the second half of the 20th century.\nCuisine.\nRussian cuisine has been formed by the country's diverse climate, cultural and religious traditions, and vast geography; it shares similarities with neighbouring countries. Crops of rye, wheat, barley, and millet provide the ingredients for various breads, pancakes and cereals, as well as for many drinks. Bread, of many varieties, is very popular across Russia. Flavourful soups and stews include shchi, borsch, ukha, solyanka, and okroshka. Smetana (a heavy sour cream) and mayonnaise are often added to soups and salads. Pirozhki, blini, and syrniki are native types of pancakes. Beef Stroganoff, Chicken Kiev, pelmeni, and shashlyk are popular meat dishes. Other meat dishes include stuffed cabbage rolls (golubtsy) usually filled with meat. Salads include Olivier salad, vinegret, and dressed herring.\nRussia's national non-alcoholic drink is kvass, and the national alcoholic drink is vodka; its production in Russia (and elsewhere) dates back to the 14th century. The country has the world's highest vodka consumption, while beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage. Wine has become increasingly popular in Russia in the 21st century. Tea has been popular in Russia for centuries.\nMass media and cinema.\nThere are 400 news agencies in Russia, among which the largest internationally operating are TASS, RIA Novosti, Sputnik, and Interfax. Television is the most popular medium in Russia. Among the 3,000 licensed radio stations nationwide, notable ones include Radio Rossii, Vesti FM, Echo of Moscow, Radio Mayak, and Russkoye Radio. Of the 16,000 registered newspapers, , , , \"Izvestia\", and are popular. State-run Channel One and Russia-1 are the leading news channels, while RT is the flagship of Russia's international media operations. Russia has the largest video gaming market in Europe, with over 65 million players nationwide.\nRussian and later Soviet cinema was a hotbed of invention, resulting in world-renowned films such as \"Battleship Potemkin\", which was named the greatest film of all time at the Brussels World's Fair in 1958. Soviet-era filmmakers, most notably Sergei Eisenstein and Andrei Tarkovsky, would go on to become among of the world's most innovative and influential directors. Eisenstein was a student of Lev Kuleshov, who developed the groundbreaking Soviet montage theory of film editing at the world's first film school, the All-Union Institute of Cinematography. Dziga Vertov's \"Kino-Eye\" theory had a large effect on the development of documentary filmmaking and cinema realism. Many Soviet socialist realism films were artistically successful, including \"Chapaev\", \"The Cranes Are Flying\", and \"Ballad of a Soldier\".\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in Soviet cinema. The comedies of Eldar Ryazanov and Leonid Gaidai were immensely popular, with many of their catchphrases still in use today. In 1961\u201368 Sergey Bondarchuk directed an Oscar-winning film adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's epic \"War and Peace\", which was the most expensive film made in the Soviet Union. In 1969, Vladimir Motyl's \"White Sun of the Desert\" was released, a very popular film in a genre of ostern; the film is traditionally watched by cosmonauts before any trip into space. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian cinema industry suffered large losses; however, since the late 2000s, it has seen growth once again, and continues to expand.\nSports.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Russia. The Soviet Union national football team became the first European champions by winning Euro 1960, and reached the finals of Euro 1988. Russian clubs CSKA Moscow and Zenit Saint Petersburg won the UEFA Cup in 2005 and 2008. The Russian national football team reached the semi-finals of Euro 2008. Russia was the host nation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, Russian teams are currently suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions.\nIce hockey is very popular in Russia, and the Soviet national ice hockey team dominated the sport internationally throughout its existence. Bandy is Russia's national sport, and it has historically been the highest-achieving country in the sport. The Russian national basketball team won EuroBasket 2007, and the Russian basketball club PBC CSKA Moscow is among the most successful European basketball teams. The annual Formula One Russian Grand Prix was held at the Sochi Autodrom in the Sochi Olympic Park, until its termination following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nHistorically, Russian athletes have been one of the most successful contenders in the Olympic Games. Russia is the leading nation in rhythmic gymnastics, and Russian synchronised swimming is considered to be the world's best. Figure skating is another popular sport in Russia, especially pair skating and ice dancing. Russia has produced numerous prominent tennis players. Chess is also a widely popular pastime in the nation, with many of the world's top chess players being Russian for decades. The 1980 Summer Olympic Games were held in Moscow, and the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics were hosted in Sochi. However, Russia has also had 43 Olympic medals stripped from its athletes due to doping violations, which is the most of any country, and nearly a third of the global total.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nGovernment\nGeneral information"}

{"id": "25400", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25400", "title": "Rational choice model", "text": "Class of models in the behavioral sciences\nRational choice modeling refers to the use of decision theory (the theory of rational choice) as a set of guidelines to help understand economic and social behavior. The theory tries to approximate, predict, or mathematically model human behavior by analyzing the behavior of a rational actor facing the same costs and benefits.\nRational choice models are most closely associated with economics, where mathematical analysis of behavior is standard. However, they are widely used throughout the social sciences, and are commonly applied to cognitive science, criminology, political science, and sociology.\nOverview.\nThe basic premise of rational choice theory is that the decisions made by individual actors will collectively produce aggregate social behaviour. The theory also assumes that individuals have preferences out of available choice alternatives. These preferences are assumed to be complete and transitive. Completeness refers to the individual being able to say which of the options they prefer (i.e. individual prefers A over B, B over A or are indifferent to both). Alternatively, transitivity is where the individual weakly prefers option A over B and weakly prefers option B over C, leading to the conclusion that the individual weakly prefers A over C. The rational agent will then perform their own cost\u2013benefit analysis using a variety of criterion to perform their self-determined best choice of action.\nOne version of rationality is instrumental rationality, which involves achieving a goal using the most cost effective method without reflecting on the worthiness of that goal. Duncan Snidal emphasises that the goals are not restricted to self-regarding, selfish, or material interests. They also include other-regarding, altruistic, as well as normative or ideational goals.\nRational choice theory does not claim to describe the choice process, but rather it helps predict the outcome and pattern of choice. It is consequently assumed that the individual is a self-interested or \u201chomo economicus\u201d. Here, the individual comes to a decision that optimizes their preferences by balancing costs and benefits.\nRational choice theory has proposed that there are two outcomes of two choices regarding human action. Firstly, the feasible region will be chosen within all the possible and related action. Second, after the preferred option has been chosen, the feasible region that has been selected was picked based on restriction of financial, legal, social, physical or emotional restrictions that the agent is facing. After that, a choice will be made based on the preference order.\nThe concept of rationality used in rational choice theory is different from the colloquial and most philosophical use of the word. In this sense, \"rational\" behaviour can refer to \"sensible\", \"predictable\", or \"in a thoughtful, clear-headed manner.\" Rational choice theory uses a much more narrow definition of rationality. At its most basic level, behavior is rational if it is reflective and consistent (across time and different choice situations). More specifically, behavior is only considered irrational if it is logically incoherent, i.e. self-contradictory.\nEarly neoclassical economists writing about rational choice, including William Stanley Jevons, assumed that agents make consumption choices so as to maximize their happiness, or utility. Contemporary theory bases rational choice on a set of choice axioms that need to be satisfied, and typically does not specify where the goal (preferences, desires) comes from. It mandates just a consistent ranking of the alternatives. Individuals choose the best action according to their personal preferences and the constraints facing them.\nActions, assumptions, and individual preferences.\nRational choice theory can be viewed in different contexts. At an individual level, the theory suggests that the agent will decide on the action (or outcome) they most prefer. If the actions (or outcomes) are evaluated in terms of costs and benefits, the choice with the maximum net benefit will be chosen by the rational individual. Rational behaviour is not solely driven by monetary gain, but can also be driven by emotional motives.\nThe theory can be applied to general settings outside of those identified by costs and benefits. In general, rational decision making entails choosing among all available alternatives the alternative that the individual most prefers. The \"alternatives\" can be a set of actions (\"what to do?\") or a set of objects (\"what to choose/buy\"). In the case of actions, what the individual really cares about are the outcomes that results from each possible action. Actions, in this case, are only an instrument for obtaining a particular outcome.\nFormal statement.\nThe available alternatives are often expressed as a set of objects, for example a set of \"j\" exhaustive and exclusive actions:\nformula_1\nFor example, if a person can choose to vote for either Roger or Sara or to abstain, their set of possible alternatives is:\nformula_2\nThe theory makes two technical assumptions about individuals' preferences over alternatives:\nTogether these two assumptions imply that given a set of exhaustive and exclusive actions to choose from, an individual can \"rank\" the elements of this set in terms of his preferences in an internally consistent way (the ranking constitutes a total ordering, minus some assumptions), and the set has at least one maximal element.\nThe preference between two alternatives can be:\nResearch since the 1980s sought to develop models that weaken these assumptions and argue some cases of this behaviour can be considered rational. However, the Dutch book theorems show that this comes at a major cost of internal coherence, such that weakening any of the Von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern axioms makes. The most severe consequences are associated with violating independence of irrelevant alternatives, and transitive preferences, or fully abandoning completeness rather than weakening it to \"asymptotic\" completeness.\nUtility maximization.\nOften preferences are described by their utility function or \"payoff function\". This is an ordinal number that an individual assigns over the available actions, such as:\nformula_3\nThe individual's preferences are then expressed as the relation between these ordinal assignments. For example, if an individual prefers the candidate Sara over Roger over abstaining, their preferences would have the relation:\nformula_4\nA preference relation that as above satisfies completeness, transitivity, and, in addition, continuity, can be equivalently represented by a utility function.\nBenefits.\nThe rational choice approach allows preferences to be represented as real-valued utility functions. Economic decision making then becomes a problem of maximizing this utility function, subject to constraints (e.g. a budget). This has many advantages. It provides a compact theory that makes empirical predictions with a relatively sparse model \u2013 just a description of the agent's objectives and constraints. Furthermore, optimization theory is a well-developed field of mathematics. These two factors make rational choice models tractable compared to other approaches to choice. Most importantly, this approach is strikingly general. It has been used to analyze not only personal and household choices about\ntraditional economic matters like consumption and savings, but also choices about education, marriage, child-bearing, migration, crime and so on, as well as business decisions about output, investment, hiring, entry, exit, etc. with varying degrees of success.\nIn the field of political science rational choice theory has been used to help predict human decision making and model for the future; therefore it is useful in creating effective public policy, and enables the government to develop solutions quickly and efficiently.\nDespite the empirical shortcomings of rational choice theory, the flexibility and tractability of rational choice models (and the lack of equally powerful alternatives) lead to them still being widely used.\nApplications.\nRational choice theory has become increasingly employed in social sciences other than economics, such as sociology, evolutionary theory and political science in recent decades. It has had far-reaching impacts on the study of political science, especially in fields like the study of interest groups, elections, behaviour in legislatures, coalitions, and bureaucracy. In these fields, the use of rational choice theory to explain broad social phenomena is the subject of controversy.\nRational choice theory in political science.\nRational choice theory provides a framework to explain why groups of rational individuals can come to collectively irrational decisions. For example, while at the individual level a group of people may have common interests, applying a rational choice framework to their individually rational preferences can explain group-level outcomes that fail to accomplish any one individual's preferred objectives. Rational choice theory provides a framework to describe outcomes like this as the product of rational agents performing their own cost\u2013benefit analysis to maximize their self-interests, a process that doesn't always align with the group's preferences.\nRational choice in voting behavior.\nVoter behaviour shifts significantly thanks to rational theory, which is ingrained in human nature, the most significant of which occurs when there are times of economic trouble. An example in economic policy, economist Anthony Downs concluded that a high income voter \u2018votes for whatever party he believes would provide him with the highest utility income from government action\u2019, using rational choice theory to explain people's income as their justification for their preferred tax rate.\nDowns' work provides a framework for analyzing tax-rate preference in a rational choice framework. He argues that an individual votes if it is in their rational interest to do so. Downs models this utility function as B + D &gt; C, where B is the benefit of the voter winning, D is the satisfaction derived from voting and C is the cost of voting. It is from this that we can determine that parties have moved their policy outlook to be more centric in order to maximise the number of voters they have for support. It is from this very simple framework that more complex adjustments can be made to describe the success of politicians as an outcome of their ability or failure to satisfy the utility function of individual voters.\nRational choice theory in international relations.\nRational choice theory has become one of the major tools used to study international relations. Proponents of its use in this field typically assume that states and the policies crafted at the national outcome are the outcome of self-interested, politically shrewd actors including, but not limited to, politicians, lobbyists, businesspeople, activists, regular voters and any other individual in the national audience. The use of rational choice theory as a framework to predict political behavior has led to a rich literature that describes the trajectory of policy to varying degrees of success. For example, some scholars have examined how states can make credible threats to deter other states from a (nuclear) attack. Others have explored under what conditions states wage war against each other. Yet others have investigated under what circumstances the threat and imposition of international economic sanctions tend to succeed and when they are likely to fail.\nRational choice theory in social interactions.\nRational choice theory and social exchange theory involves looking at all social relations in the form of costs and rewards, both tangible and non tangible.\nAccording to Abell, Rational Choice Theory is \"understanding individual actors... as acting, or more likely interacting, in a manner such that they can be deemed to be doing the best they can for themselves, given their objectives, resources, circumstances, as they seem them\". Rational Choice Theory has been used to comprehend the complex social phenomena, of which derives from the actions and motivations of an individual. Individuals are often highly motivated by their wants and needs.\nBy making calculative decisions, it is considered as rational action. Individuals are often making calculative decisions in social situations by weighing out the pros and cons of an action taken towards a person. The decision to act on a rational decision is also dependent on the unforeseen benefits of the friendship. Homan mentions that actions of humans are motivated by punishment or rewards. This reinforcement through punishments or rewards determines the course of action taken by a person in a social situation as well. Individuals are motivated by mutual reinforcement and are also fundamentally motivated by the approval of others. Attaining the approval of others has been a generalized character, along with money, as a means of exchange in both Social and Economic exchanges. In Economic exchanges, it involves the exchange of goods or services. In Social exchange, it is the exchange of approval and certain other valued behaviors.\nRational Choice Theory in this instance, heavily emphasizes the individual's interest as a starting point for making social decisions. Despite differing view points about Rational choice theory, it all comes down to the individual as a basic unit of theory. Even though sharing, cooperation and cultural norms emerge, it all stems from an individual's initial concern about the self.\nG.S Becker offers an example of how Rational choice can be applied to personal decisions, specifically regarding the rationale that goes behind decisions on whether to marry or divorce another individual. Due to the self-serving drive on which the theory of rational choice is derived, Becker concludes that people marry if the expected utility from such marriage exceeds the utility one would gain from remaining single, and in the same way couples would separate should the utility of being together be less than expected and provide less (economic) benefit than being separated would. Since the theory behind rational choice is that individuals will take the course of action that best serves their personal interests, when considering relationships it is still assumed that they will display such mentality due to deep-rooted, self-interested aspects of human nature.\nSocial Exchange and Rational Choice Theory both comes down to an individual's efforts to meet their own personal needs and interests through the choices they make. Even though some may be done sincerely for the welfare of others at that point of time, both theories point to the benefits received in return. These returns may be received immediately or in the future, be it tangible or not.\nColeman discussed a number of theories to elaborate on the premises and promises of rational choice theory. One of the concepts that He introduced was Trust. It is where \"individuals place trust, in both judgement and performance of others, based on rational considerations of what is best, given the alternatives they confront\". In a social situation, there has to be a level of trust among the individuals. He noted that this level of trust is a consideration that an individual takes into concern before deciding on a rational action towards another individual. It affects the social situation as one navigates the risks and benefits of an action. By assessing the possible outcomes or alternatives to an action for another individual, the person is making a calculated decision. In another situation such as making a bet, you are calculating the possible lost and how much can be won. If the chances of winning exceeds the cost of losing, the rational decision would be to place the bet. Therefore, the decision to place trust in another individual involves the same rational calculations that are involved in the decision of making a bet.\nEven though rational theory is used in Economics and Social settings, there are some similarities and differences. The concept of reward and reinforcement is parallel to each other while the concept of cost is also parallel to the concept of punishment. However, there is a difference of underlying assumptions in both contexts. In a social setting, the focus is often on the current or past reinforcements, with no guarantee of immediate tangible or intangible returns from another individual in the future. In Economics, decisions are made with heavier emphasis on future rewards.\nDespite having both perspectives differ in focus, they primarily reflect on how individuals make different rational decisions when given an immediate or long-term circumstances to consider in their rational decision making.\nCriticism.\nBoth the assumptions and the behavioral predictions of rational choice theory have sparked criticism from various camps.\nThe limits of rationality.\nAs mentioned above, some economists have developed models of bounded rationality, such as Herbert Simon, which hope to be more psychologically plausible without completely abandoning the idea that reason underlies decision-making processes. Simon argues factors such as imperfect information, uncertainty and time constraints all affect and limit our rationality, and therefore our decision-making skills. Furthermore, his concepts of 'satisficing' and 'optimizing' suggest sometimes because of these factors, we settle for a decision which is good enough, rather than the best decision. Other economists have developed more theories of human decision-making that allow for the roles of uncertainty, institutions, and determination of individual tastes by their socioeconomic environment (cf. Fernandez-Huerga, 2008).\nPhilosophical critiques.\nMartin Hollis and Edward J. Nell's 1975 book offers both a philosophical critique of neo-classical economics and an innovation in the field of economic methodology. Further, they outlined an alternative vision to neo-classicism based on a rationalist theory of knowledge. Within neo-classicism, the authors addressed consumer behaviour (in the form of indifference curves and simple versions of revealed preference theory) and marginalist producer behaviour in both product and factor markets. Both are based on rational optimizing behaviour. They consider imperfect as well as perfect markets since neo-classical thinking embraces many market varieties and disposes of a whole system for their classification. However, the authors believe that the issues arising from basic maximizing models have extensive implications for econometric methodology (Hollis and Nell, 1975, p.\u00a02). In particular it is this class of models \u2013 rational behavior as maximizing behaviour \u2013 which provide support for specification and identification. And this, they argue, is where the flaw is to be found. Hollis and Nell (1975) argued that positivism (broadly conceived) has provided neo-classicism with important support, which they then show to be unfounded. They base their critique of neo-classicism not only on their critique of positivism but also on the alternative they propose, rationalism. Indeed, they argue that rationality is central to neo-classical economics \u2013 as rational choice \u2013 and that this conception of rationality is misused. Demands are made of it that it cannot fulfill. Ultimately, individuals do not always act rationally or conduct themselves in a utility maximising manner.\nDuncan K. Foley (2003, p.\u00a01) has also provided an important criticism of the concept of \"rationality\" and its role in economics. He argued that\u201cRationality\u201d has played a central role in shaping and establishing the hegemony of contemporary mainstream economics. As the specific claims of robust neoclassicism fade into the history of economic thought, an orientation toward situating explanations of economic phenomena in relation to rationality has increasingly become the touchstone by which mainstream economists identify themselves and recognize each other. This is not so much a question of adherence to any particular conception of rationality, but of taking rationality of individual behavior as the unquestioned starting point of economic analysis.\nFoley (2003, p.\u00a09) went on to argue thatThe concept of rationality, to use Hegelian language, represents the relations of modern capitalist society one-sidedly. The burden of rational-actor theory is the assertion that \u2018naturally\u2019 constituted individuals facing existential conflicts over scarce resources would rationally impose on themselves the institutional structures of modern capitalist society, or something approximating them. But this way of looking at matters systematically neglects the ways in which modern capitalist society and its social relations in fact constitute the \u2018rational\u2019, calculating individual. The well-known limitations of rational-actor theory, its static quality, its logical antinomies, its vulnerability to arguments of infinite regress, its failure to develop a progressive concrete research program, can all be traced to this starting-point.\nMore recently Edward J. Nell and Karim Errouaki (2011, Ch. 1) argued that:The DNA of neoclassical economics is defective. Neither the induction problem nor the problems of methodological individualism can be solved within the framework of neoclassical assumptions. The neoclassical approach is to call on rational economic man to solve both. Economic relationships that reflect rational choice should be \u2018projectible\u2019. But that attributes a deductive power to \u2018rational\u2019 that it cannot have consistently with positivist (or even pragmatist) assumptions (which require deductions to be simply analytic). To make rational calculations projectible, the agents may be assumed to have idealized abilities, especially foresight; but then the induction problem is out of reach because the agents of the world do not resemble those of the model. The agents of the model can be abstract, but they cannot be endowed with powers actual agents could not have. This also undermines methodological individualism; if behaviour cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of the \u2018rational choices of agents\u2019, a social order cannot reliably follow from the choices of agents.\nHerfeld (2020) offers a useful review of the literature on rational choice theory and its uses to examine a range of criticisms of its use in economics that philosophers have made. She argues that debates about RCT have often been confused and that this is due to the fact, in her view, that the theory is not the single unified approach that some seem to think it is. Instead she suggests there are a number of substantially different varieties used by economists. Her solution is to suggest that RCT should be thought of as a diverse set of strategies, with the nature and validity of criticisms becoming context/variety dependant.\nPsychological critiques.\nThe validity of Rational Choice Theory has been generally refuted by the results of research in behavioral psychology. The revision or alternative theory that arises from these discrepancies is called Prospect Theory.\nThe 'doubly-divergent' critique of Rational Choice Theory implicit in Prospect Theory has sometimes been presented as a revision or alternative. Daniel Kahneman's work has been notably elaborated by research undertaken and supervised by Jonathan Haidt and other scholars.\nEmpirical critiques.\nIn their 1994 work, \"Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory\", Donald P. Green and Ian Shapiro argue that the empirical outputs of rational choice theory have been limited. They contend that much of the applicable literature, at least in political science, was done with weak statistical methods and that when corrected many of the empirical outcomes no longer hold. When taken in this perspective, rational choice theory has provided very little to the overall understanding of political interaction \u2013 and is an amount certainly disproportionately weak relative to its appearance in the literature. Yet, they concede that cutting-edge research, by scholars well-versed in the general scholarship of their fields (such as work on the U.S. Congress by Keith Krehbiel, Gary Cox, and Mat McCubbins) has generated valuable scientific progress.\nMethodological critiques.\nSchram and Caterino (2006) contains a fundamental methodological criticism of rational choice theory for promoting the view that the natural science model is the only appropriate methodology in social science and that political science should follow this model, with its emphasis on quantification and mathematization. Schram and Caterino argue instead for methodological pluralism. The same argument is made by William E. Connolly, who in his work Neuropolitics shows that advances in neuroscience further illuminate some of the problematic practices of rational choice theory.\nSociological critiques.\nPierre Bourdieu fiercely opposed rational choice theory as grounded in a misunderstanding of how social agents operate. Bourdieu argued that social agents do not continuously calculate according to explicit rational and economic criteria. According to Bourdieu, social agents operate according to an implicit practical logic \u2013 a practical sense \u2013 and bodily dispositions. Social agents act according to their \"feel for the game\" (the \"feel\" being, roughly, habitus, and the \"game\" being the field).\nOther social scientists, inspired in part by Bourdieu's thinking have expressed concern about the inappropriate use of economic metaphors in other contexts, suggesting that this may have political implications. The argument they make is that by treating everything as a kind of \"economy\" they make a particular vision of the way an economy works seem more natural. Thus, they suggest, rational choice is as much ideological as it is scientific.\nCriticism based on motivational assumptions.\nRational choice theorists discuss individual values and structural elements as equally important determinants of outcomes. However, for methodological reasons in the empirical application, more emphasis is usually placed on social structural determinants. Therefore, in line with structural functionalism and social network analysis perspectives, rational choice explanations are considered mainstream in sociology.\nCriticism based on the assumption of realism.\nSome of the scepticism among sociologists regarding rational choice stems from their perspective on realist assumptions. Social research has shown that social agents usually act solely based on habit or impulse, the power of emotion. For example, people predict the expected consequences of various options in stock markets or during economic crises, and they choose the best option through collective \"emotional drives,\" implying social forces rather than \"rational\" choices.\nEconomists counterargue that critics in sociology commonly misunderstand rational choice when critiquing rational choice theory. Rational choice theory does not explain what rational people would do in a given situation, which falls under decision theory. Theoretical choice focuses on social outcomes rather than individual outcomes. Social outcomes are identified as stable equilibria in which individuals have no incentive to deviate from their course of action. This orientation of others' behaviour toward social outcomes may be unintended or undesirable. Therefore, the conclusions generated in such cases are relegated to the \"study of irrational behaviour\".\nCriticism based on the biopolitical paradigm.\nThe basic assumptions of rational choice theory do not take into account external factors (social, cultural, economic) that interfere with autonomous decision-making. Representatives of the biopolitical paradigm such as Michel Foucault drew attention to the micro-power structures that shape the soul, body and mind and thus top-down impose certain decisions on individuals. Humans \u2013 according to the assumptions of the biopolitical paradigm \u2013 therefore conform to dominant social and cultural systems rather than to their own subjectively defined goals, which they would seek to achieve through rational and optimal decisions.\nCritiques on the basis of evolutionary psychology.\nAn evolutionary psychology perspective suggests that many of the seeming contradictions and biases regarding rational choice can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. Thus, when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death it may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains. Proponents argue it may also explain differences between groups.\nCritiques on the basis of emotion research.\nProponents of emotional choice theory criticize the rational choice paradigm by drawing on new findings from emotion research in psychology and neuroscience. They point out that rational choice theory is generally based on the assumption that decision-making is a conscious and reflective process based on thoughts and beliefs. It presumes that people decide on the basis of calculation and deliberation. However, cumulative research in neuroscience suggests that only a small part of the brain's activities operate at the level of conscious reflection. The vast majority of its activities consist of unconscious appraisals and emotions. The significance of emotions in decision-making has generally been ignored by rational choice theory, according to these critics. Moreover, emotional choice theorists contend that the rational choice paradigm has difficulty incorporating emotions into its models, because it cannot account for the social nature of emotions. Even though emotions are felt by individuals, psychologists and sociologists have shown that emotions cannot be isolated from the social environment in which they arise. Emotions are inextricably intertwined with people's social norms and identities, which are typically outside the scope of standard rational choice models. Emotional choice theory seeks to capture not only the social but also the physiological and dynamic character of emotions. It represents a unitary action model to organize, explain, and predict the ways in which emotions shape decision-making.\nThe difference between public and private spheres.\nHerbert Gintis has also provided an important criticism to rational choice theory. He argued that rationality differs between the public and private spheres. The public sphere being what you do in collective action and the private sphere being what you do in your private life. Gintis argues that this is because \u201cmodels of rational choice in the private sphere treat agents\u2019 choices as instrumental\u201d. \u201cBehaviour in the public sphere, by contrast, is largely non-instrumental because it is non-consequential\". Individuals make no difference to the outcome, \u201cmuch as single molecules make no difference to the properties of the gas\" (Herbert, G). This is a weakness of rational choice theory as it shows that in situations such as voting in an election, the rational decision for the individual would be to not vote as their vote makes no difference to the outcome of the election. However, if everyone were to act in this way the democratic society would collapse as no one would vote. Therefore, we can see that rational choice theory does not describe how everything in the economic and political world works, and that there are other factors of human behaviour at play.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are the only extant subgroup of the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family.\nThe five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are:\nThe Romance languages spread throughout the world owing to the period of European colonialism beginning in the 15th century. There are more than 900 million native speakers of Romance languages found worldwide, mainly in the Americas, Europe, and parts of Africa. French, Spanish, and Portuguese also have many non-native speakers; they are widely used as lingua francas. There are also numerous regional Romance languages and dialects. All five of the most widely spoken Romance languages are also official languages of the European Union.\nName and languages.\nThe term \"Romance\" derives from the Vulgar Latin adverb , \"in Roman\", derived from : for instance, in the expression , \"to speak in Roman\" (that is, the Latin vernacular), contrasted with , \"to speak in Latin\" (Medieval Latin, the conservative version of the language used in writing and formal contexts or as a lingua franca), and with , \"to speak in Barbarian\" (the non-Latin languages of the peoples living outside the Roman Empire). From this adverb the noun \"romance\" originated, which applied initially to anything written , or \"in the Roman vernacular\".\nMost of the Romance-speaking part of Europe has traditionally been a dialect continuum, where the speech variety of a location differs only slightly from that of a neighboring location, but over a longer distance these differences become so great that people from two remote locations unambiguously speak separate languages. This makes drawing language boundaries difficult, and thus there is no unambiguous way to divide the Romance varieties into individual languages. Even the criterion of mutual intelligibility can become ambiguous when it comes to determining whether two language varieties belong to the same language or not.\nThe following is a list of groupings of Romance languages, with some languages chosen to exemplify each grouping. Not all languages are listed, and the groupings should not be interpreted as well-separated genetic clades in a tree model:\nModern status.\nThe Romance language most widely spoken natively today is Spanish, followed by Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian, which together cover a vast territory in Europe and beyond, and work as official and national languages in dozens of countries. In Europe, at least one Romance language is official in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Romania, Moldova, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and Vatican City. In these countries, French, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Romansh and Catalan have constitutional official status.\nFrench, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Romanian are also official languages of the European Union. Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, and Catalan were the official languages of the defunct Latin Union; and French and Spanish are two of the six official languages of the United Nations. Outside Europe, French, Portuguese and Spanish are spoken and enjoy official status in various countries that emerged from the respective colonial empires.\nWith almost 500 million speakers worldwide, Spanish is an official language in Spain and in nine countries of South America, home to about half that continent's population; in six countries of Central America (all except Belize); and in Mexico. In the Caribbean, it is official in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. In all these countries, Latin American Spanish is the vernacular language of the majority of the population, giving Spanish the most native speakers of any Romance language. In Africa, Spanish is one of the official languages of Equatorial Guinea. Spanish was one of the official languages in the Philippines in Southeast Asia until 1973. In the 1987 constitution, Spanish was removed as an official language (replaced by English), and was listed as an optional language.\nPortuguese, in its homeland, Portugal, is spoken by almost the entire population of 10 million. As the official language of Brazil, it is spoken by more than 200 million people, making Portuguese the most spoken official Romance language in a single country. As Portuguese is also spoken in neighboring eastern Paraguay and northern Uruguay, this accounts for slightly more than half the population of South America.\nPortuguese is the official language of six African countries (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe), and is spoken as a native language by perhaps 16 million residents of that continent. In Asia, Portuguese is co-official with other languages in East Timor and Macau, while most Portuguese-speakers in Asia\u2014some 400,000\u2014are in Japan due to return immigration of Japanese Brazilians. In North America 1,000,000 people speak Portuguese as their home language, mainly immigrants from Brazil, Portugal, and other Portuguese-speaking countries and their descendants. In Oceania, Portuguese is the second most spoken Romance language, after French, due mainly to the number of speakers in East Timor. Its closest relative, Galician, has co-official status in the autonomous community of Galicia in Spain, together with Spanish.\nOutside Europe, French is spoken natively most in the Canadian province of Quebec, and in parts of New Brunswick and Ontario. Canada is officially bilingual, with French and English being the official languages and government services in French theoretically mandated to be provided nationwide. In parts of the Caribbean, such as Haiti, French has official status, but most people speak creoles such as Haitian Creole as their native language. French also has official status in much of Africa, with relatively few native speakers but large numbers of second language speakers.\nAlthough Italy also had some colonial possessions before World War II, its language did not remain official after the end of the colonial period. As a result, Italian outside Italy and Switzerland is now spoken only as a minority language by immigrant communities in North and South America and Australia. In some former Italian colonies in Africa\u2014namely Libya, Eritrea and Somalia\u2014it is spoken by a few educated people in commerce and government.\nRomania did not establish a colonial empire. The native range of Romanian includes Moldova, where it is the dominant language and spoken by a majority of the population, and neighboring areas in Serbia (Vojvodina and the Bor District), Bulgaria, Hungary, and Ukraine (Bukovina, Budjak) and in some villages between the Dniester and Bug rivers. As with Italian, Romanian is spoken outside its ethnic range by immigrant communities. In Europe, Romanian speakers form about two percent of the population in Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Romanian is also spoken in Israel by Romanian Jews, where it is the native language of five percent of the population, and is spoken by many more as a secondary language. The Aromanian language is spoken today by Aromanians in Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, and Greece. Flavio Biondo was the first scholar to have observed (in 1435) linguistic affinities between the Romanian and Italian languages, as well as their common Latin origin.\nThe total of 880 million native speakers of Romance languages (ca. 2020) are divided as follows:\nCatalan is the official language of Andorra. In Spain, it is co-official with Spanish in Catalonia, the Valencian Community (under the name Valencian), and the Balearic Islands, and it is recognized, but not official, in an area of Aragon known as La Franja. In addition, it is spoken by many residents of Alghero, on the island of Sardinia and is co-official in that city. Galician, with more than three million speakers, is official together with Spanish in Galicia, and has legal recognition in neighbouring territories in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. A few other languages have official recognition on a regional or otherwise limited level; for instance, Asturian and Aragonese in Spain; Mirandese in Portugal; Friulian, Sardinian and Franco-Proven\u00e7al in Italy; and Romansh in Switzerland.\nThe remaining Romance languages survive mostly as spoken languages for informal contact. National governments have historically viewed linguistic diversity as an economic, administrative or military liability, as well as a potential source of separatist movements; therefore, they have generally fought to eliminate it, by extensively promoting the use of the official language, restricting the use of the other languages in the media, recognizing them as mere \"dialects\", or even persecuting them. As a result, all of these languages are considered endangered to varying degrees according to the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages, ranging from \"vulnerable\" (e.g. Sicilian and Venetian) to \"severely endangered\" (Franco-Proven\u00e7al, most of the Occitan varieties). Since the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, increased sensitivity to the rights of minorities has allowed some of these languages to start recovering their prestige and lost rights. Yet it is unclear whether these political changes will be enough to reverse the decline of minority Romance languages.\nHistory.\nBetween 350 BC and 150 AD, the expansion of the Roman Empire, together with its administrative and educational policies, made Latin the dominant native language in continental Western Europe. Latin also exerted a strong influence in southeastern Britain, the Roman province of Africa, western Germany, Pannonia and the Balkans.\nDuring the empire's decline, and after its fragmentation and the collapse of its Western half in the fifth and sixth centuries, spoken varieties of Latin became more isolated from each other, with the western dialects coming under heavy Germanic influence (the Goths and Franks in particular) and the eastern dialects coming under Slavic influence. The dialects diverged from Latin at an accelerated rate and eventually evolved into a continuum of recognizably different typologies. The colonial empires established by Portugal, Spain, and France from the fifteenth century onward spread their languages to the other continents to such an extent that about two-thirds of all Romance language speakers today live outside Europe.\nDespite other influences (e.g. \"substratum\" from pre-Roman languages, especially Continental Celtic languages; and \"superstratum\" from later Germanic or Slavic invasions), the phonology, morphology, and lexicon of all Romance languages consist mainly of evolved forms of Vulgar Latin. However, some notable differences exist between today's Romance languages and their Roman ancestor. With only one or two exceptions, Romance languages have dropped the Latin inflection system, instead making extensive use of prepositions. Romance languages also normally have SVO sentence structure. By most measures, Sardinian and Italian are the least divergent languages from Latin, while French has changed the most. However, all Romance languages are closer to each other than to classical Latin.\nVulgar Latin.\nDocumentary evidence about Vulgar Latin for the purposes of comprehensive research is limited, and the literature is often hard to interpret or generalize. Many of its speakers were soldiers, slaves, displaced peoples, and forced resettlers, and more likely to be natives of conquered lands than natives of Rome. In Western Europe, Latin gradually replaced Celtic and other Italic languages, which were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.\nTo some scholars, this suggests the form of Vulgar Latin that evolved into the Romance languages was around during the time of the Roman Empire (from the end of the first century BC), and was spoken alongside the written Classical Latin which was reserved for official and formal occasions. Other scholars argue that the distinctions are more rightly viewed as indicative of sociolinguistic and register differences normally found within any language. With the rise of the Roman Empire, spoken Latin spread first throughout Italy and then through southern, western, central, and southeastern Europe, and northern Africa along parts of western Asia.\nLatin reached a stage when innovations became generalised around the sixth and seventh centuries. After that time and within two hundred years, it became a dead language since \"the Romanized people of Europe could no longer understand texts that were read aloud or recited to them.\" By the eighth and ninth centuries Latin gave way to Romance.\nFall of the Western Roman Empire.\nDuring the political decline of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century, there were large-scale migrations into the empire, and the Latin-speaking world was fragmented into several independent states. Central Europe and the Balkans were occupied by Germanic and Slavic tribes, as well as by Huns.\nBritish and African Romance\u2014the forms of Vulgar Latin used in Britain and the Roman province of Africa, where it had been spoken by much of the urban population\u2014disappeared in the Middle Ages (as did Moselle Romance in Germany). But the Germanic tribes that had penetrated Roman Italy, Gaul, and Hispania eventually adopted Latin/Romance and the remnants of the culture of ancient Rome alongside existing inhabitants of those regions, and so Latin remained the dominant language there. In part due to regional dialects of the Latin language and local environments, several languages evolved from it.\nFall of the Eastern Roman Empire.\nMeanwhile, large-scale migrations into the Eastern Roman Empire started with the Goths and continued with Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Slavs, Pechenegs, Hungarians and Cumans. The invasions of Slavs were the most thoroughgoing, and they partially reduced the Romanic element in the Balkans. The invasion of the Turks and conquest of Constantinople in 1453 marked the end of the empire.\nThe surviving local Romance languages were Dalmatian and Common Romanian.\nEarly Romance.\nOver the course of the fourth to eighth centuries, local changes in phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon accumulated to the point that the speech of any locale was noticeably different from that of another. In principle, differences between any two lects increased the more they were separated geographically, reducing easy mutual intelligibility between speakers of distant communities. Clear evidence of some levels of change is found in the \"Reichenau Glosses\", an eighth-century compilation of about 1,200 words from the fourth-century Vulgate of Jerome that had changed in phonological form or were no longer normally used, along with their eighth-century equivalents in proto-Franco-Proven\u00e7al. The following are some examples with reflexes in several modern Romance languages for comparison:\nIn all of the above examples, the words appearing in the fourth century Vulgate are the same words as would have been used in Classical Latin of c. 50 BC. It is likely that some of these words had already disappeared from casual speech by the time of the \"Glosses\"; but if so, they may well have been still widely understood, as there is no recorded evidence that the common people of the time had difficulty understanding the language. By the 8th century, the situation was very different. During the late 8th century, Charlemagne, holding that \"Latin of his age was by classical standards intolerably corrupt\", successfully imposed Classical Latin as an artificial written vernacular for Western Europe. Unfortunately, this meant that parishioners could no longer understand the sermons of their priests, forcing the Council of Tours in 813 to issue an edict that priests needed to translate their speeches into the , an explicit acknowledgement of the reality of the Romance languages as separate languages from Latin.\nBy this time, and possibly as early as the 6th century according to Price (1984), the Romance lects had split apart enough to be able to speak of separate Gallo-Romance, Ibero-Romance, Italo-Romance and Eastern Romance languages. Some researchers have postulated that the major divergences in the spoken dialects began or accelerated considerably in the 5th century, as the formerly widespread and efficient communication networks of the Western Roman Empire rapidly broke down, leading to the total disappearance of the Western Roman Empire by the end of the century. During the period between the 5th\u201310th centuries AD Romance vernaculars documentation is scarce as the normal writing language used was Medieval Latin, with vernacular writing only beginning in earnest in the 11th or 12th century. The earliest such texts are the Indovinello Veronese from the eight century and the Oaths of Strasbourg from the second half of the ninth century.\nRecognition of the vernaculars.\nFrom the 10th century onwards, some local vernaculars developed a written form and began to supplant Latin in many of its roles. In some countries, such as Portugal, this transition was expedited by force of law; whereas in others, such as Italy, many prominent poets and writers used the vernacular of their own accord \u2013 some of the most famous in Italy being Giacomo da Lentini and Dante Alighieri. Well before that, the vernacular was also used for practical purposes, such as the testimonies in the Placiti Cassinesi, written 960\u2013963.\nUniformization and standardization.\nThe invention of the printing press brought a tendency towards greater uniformity of standard languages within political boundaries, at the expense of other Romance languages and dialects less favored politically. In France, for instance, the dialect spoken in the region of Paris gradually spread to the entire country, and the Occitan of the south lost ground.\nSamples.\nLexical and grammatical similarities among the Romance languages, and between Latin and each of them, are apparent from the following examples in various Romance lects, all meaning 'She always closes the window before she dines/before dining'.\nSome of the divergence comes from semantic change: where the same root words have developed different meanings. For example, the Portuguese word is descended from Latin \"window\" (and is thus cognate to French , Italian , Romanian and so on), but now means \"skylight\" and \"slit\". Cognates may exist but have become rare, such as in Spanish, or dropped out of use entirely. The Spanish and Portuguese terms meaning \"to throw through a window\" and meaning \"replete with windows\" also have the same root, but are later borrowings from Latin.\nLikewise, Portuguese also has the word , a cognate of Italian and Spanish , but uses it in the sense of \"to have a late supper\" in most varieties, while the preferred word for \"to dine\" is (related to archaic Spanish \"to eat\") because of semantic changes in the 19th century. Galician has both (from medieval \"f\u1ebdestra\", the ancestor of standard Portuguese ) and the less frequently used and .\nAs an alternative to (originally the genitive form), Italian has the pronoun , a cognate of the other words for \"she\", but it is hardly ever used in speaking.\nSpanish, Asturian, and Leonese and Mirandese and Sardinian come from Latin \"wind\" (cf. English \"window\", etymologically 'wind eye'), and Portuguese , Galician , Mirandese from Latin * \"small opening\", a derivative of \"door\".\nSardinian (alternative for /) comes from Old Italian and is similar to other Romance languages such as French (from Italian ), Portuguese , Romanian , Spanish , Catalan and Corsican (alternative for ).\nClassification and related languages.\nAlong with Latin and a few extinct languages of ancient Italy, the Romance languages make up the Italic branch of the Indo-European family. Identifying subdivisions of the Romance languages is inherently problematic, because most of the linguistic area is a dialect continuum, and in some cases political biases can come into play. A tree model is often used, but the selection of criteria results in different trees. Most classification schemes are, implicitly or not, historical and geographic, resulting in groupings such as Ibero- and Gallo-Romance. A major division can be drawn between Eastern and Western Romance, separated by the La Spezia-Rimini line.\nThe main subfamilies that have been proposed by Ethnologue within the various classification schemes for Romance languages are:\nRanking by distance.\nAnother approach involves attempts to rank the distance of Romance languages from each other or from their common ancestor (i.e. ranking languages based on how conservative or innovative they are, although the same language may be conservative in some respects while innovative in others). By most measures, French is the most highly differentiated Romance language, although Romanian has changed the greatest amount of its vocabulary, while Italian and Sardinian have changed the least. Standard Italian can be considered a \"central\" language, which is generally somewhat easy to understand to speakers of other Romance languages, whereas French and Romanian are peripheral and quite dissimilar from the rest of Romance.\nPidgins, creoles, and mixed languages.\nSome Romance languages have developed varieties which seem dramatically restructured as to their grammars or to be mixtures with other languages. There are several dozens of creoles of French, Spanish, and Portuguese origin, some of them spoken as national languages and lingua franca in former European colonies.\nCreoles of French:\nCreoles of Spanish:\nCreoles of Portuguese:\nAuxiliary and constructed languages.\nLatin and the Romance languages have also served as the inspiration and basis of numerous auxiliary and constructed languages, so-called \"Neo-Romance languages\".\nThe concept was first developed in 1903 by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano, under the title Latino sine flexione. He wanted to create a \"naturalistic\" international language, as opposed to an autonomous constructed language like Esperanto or Volap\u00fck which were designed for maximal simplicity of lexicon and derivation of words. Peano used Latin as the base of his language because, as he described it, Latin had been the international scientific language until the end of the 18th century.\nOther languages developed include Idiom Neutral (1902), Interlingue-Occidental (1922), Interlingua (1951) and Lingua Franca Nova (1998). The most famous and successful of these is Interlingua. Each of these languages has attempted to varying degrees to achieve a pseudo-Latin vocabulary as common as possible to living Romance languages. Some languages have been constructed specifically for communication among speakers of Romance languages, the Pan-Romance languages.\nThere are also languages created for artistic purposes only, such as Talossan. Because Latin is a very well attested ancient language, some amateur linguists have even constructed Romance languages that mirror real languages that developed from other ancestral languages. These include Brithenig (which mirrors Welsh), Breathanach (mirrors Irish), Wenedyk (mirrors Polish), \u00derj\u00f3trunn (mirrors Icelandic), and Helvetian (mirrors German).\nSound changes.\nConsonants.\nSignificant sound changes affected the consonants of the Romance languages.\nApocope.\nThere was a tendency to eliminate final consonants in Vulgar Latin, either by dropping them (apocope) or adding a vowel after them (epenthesis).\nMany final consonants were rare, occurring only in certain prepositions (e.g. \"towards\", \"at, near (a person)\"), conjunctions ( \"but\"), demonstratives (e.g. \"that (over there)\", \"this\"), and nominative singular noun forms, especially of neuter nouns (e.g. \"milk\", \"honey\", \"heart\"). Many of these prepositions and conjunctions were replaced by others, while the nouns were regularized into forms based on their oblique stems that avoided the final consonants (e.g. *, *, *).\nFinal \"-m\" was dropped in Vulgar Latin. Even in Classical Latin, final , , were often elided in poetic meter, suggesting the was weakly pronounced, probably marking the nasalisation of the vowel before it. This nasal vowel lost its nasalization in the Romance languages except in monosyllables, where it became e.g. Spanish &lt; \"quem\" \"whom\", French \"anything\" &lt; \"rem\" \"thing\"; note especially French and Catalan &lt; \"meum\" \"my (m.sg.)\" which are derived from monosyllabic &gt; *, whereas Spanish disyllabic and Portuguese and Catalan monosyllabic are derived from disyllabic &gt; *.\nAs a result, only the following final consonants occurred in Vulgar Latin:\nFinal was eventually lost in many languages, although this often occurred several centuries after the Vulgar Latin period. For example, the reflex of was dropped in Old French and Old Spanish only around 1100. In Old French, this occurred only when a vowel still preceded the (generally &lt; Latin ). Hence \"amat\" \"he loves\" &gt; Old French but \"venit\" \"he comes\" &gt; Old French : the was never dropped and survives into Modern French in liaison, e.g. \"is he coming?\" (the corresponding in \"aime-t-il?\" is analogical, not inherited). Old French also kept the third-person plural ending intact.\nIn Italo-Romance and the Eastern Romance languages, eventually all final consonants were either lost or protected by an epenthetic vowel, except for some articles and a few monosyllabic prepositions \"con\", \"per\", \"in\". Modern Standard Italian still has very few consonant-final words, although Romanian has regained them through later loss of final and . For example, \"am\u0101s\" \"you love\" &gt; \"ame\" &gt; Italian ; \"amant\" \"they love\" &gt; *\"aman\" &gt; Ital. . On the evidence of \"sloppily written\" Lombardic language documents, however, the loss of final in northern Italy did not occur until the 7th or 8th century, after the Vulgar Latin period, and the presence of many former final consonants is betrayed by the syntactic gemination (\"raddoppiamento sintattico\") that they trigger. It is also thought that after a long vowel became rather than simply disappearing: \"n\u014ds\" &gt; \"noi\" \"we\", \"cr\u0101s\" &gt; \"crai\" \"tomorrow\" (southern Italy). In unstressed syllables, the resulting diphthongs were simplified: \"can\u0113s\" &gt; * &gt; \"cani\" \"dogs\"; \"am\u012bc\u0101s\" &gt; * &gt; \"amiche\" \"(female) friends\", where nominative \"am\u012bcae\" should produce \"**amice\" rather than \"amiche\" (note masculine \"am\u012bc\u012b\" &gt; \"amici\" not \"*amichi\").\nCentral Western Romance languages eventually regained a large number of final consonants through the general loss of final and , e.g. Catalan \"milk\" &lt; \"lactem\", \"fire\" &lt; \"focum\", \"fish\" &lt; \"piscem\". In French, most of these secondary final consonants (as well as primary ones) were lost before around 1700, but tertiary final consonants later arose through the loss of &lt; \"-a\". Hence masculine \"fr\u012bgidum\" \"cold\" &gt; Old French &gt; \"froid\" , feminine \"fr\u012bgidam\" &gt; Old French &gt; \"froide\" .\nPalatalization.\nIn Romance languages the term 'palatalization' is used to describe the phonetic evolution of velar stops preceding a front vowel and of consonant clusters involving yod or of the palatal approximant itself. The process involving gestural blending and articulatory reinforcement, starting from Late Latin and Early Romance, generated a new series of consonants in Romance languages.\nLenition.\nStop consonants shifted by lenition in Vulgar Latin in some areas.\nThe voiced labial consonants and (represented by \u27e8b\u27e9 and \u27e8v\u27e9, respectively) both developed a fricative as an intervocalic allophone. This is clear from the orthography; in medieval times, the spelling of a consonantal \u27e8v\u27e9 is often used for what had been a \u27e8b\u27e9 in Classical Latin, or the two spellings were used interchangeably. In many Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Romanian, etc.), this fricative later developed into a ; but in others (Spanish, Galician, some Catalan and Occitan dialects, etc.) reflexes of and simply merged into a single phoneme.\nSeveral other consonants were \"softened\" in intervocalic position in Western Romance (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Northern Italian), but normally not phonemically in the rest of Italy (except some cases of \"elegant\" or Ecclesiastical words), nor apparently at all in Romanian. The dividing line between the two sets of dialects is called the La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line and is one of the most important isogloss bundles of the Romance dialects. The changes (instances of diachronic lenition resulting in phonological restructuring) are as follows:\nSingle voiceless plosives became voiced: \"-p-, -t-, -c-\" &gt; \"-b-, -d-, -g-\". Subsequently, in some languages they were further weakened, either becoming fricatives or approximants, (as in Spanish) or disappearing entirely (such as and lost between vowels in French, but &gt; ). The following example shows progressive weakening of original /t/: e.g. \"v\u012btam\" &gt; Italian \"vita\" , Portuguese \"vida\" (European Portuguese ), Spanish \"vida\" (Southern Peninsular Spanish ), and French \"vie\" . Some scholars have speculated that these sound changes may be due in part to the influence of Continental Celtic languages, while scholarship of the past few decades has proposed internal motivations.\nThe sound /h/ was lost but later reintroduced into individual Romance languages. The so-called \"h aspir\u00e9\" \"aspirated h\" in French, now completely silent, was a borrowing from Frankish. In Spanish, word-initial /f/ changed to /h/ during its Medieval stage and was lost afterwards (for example \"farina\" &gt; \"harina\"). Romanian acquired it most likely from the adstrate.\nConsonant length is no longer phonemically distinctive in most Romance languages. However some languages of Italy (Italian, Sardinian, Sicilian, and numerous other varieties of central and southern Italy) do have long consonants like , etc., where the doubling indicates either actual length or, in the case of plosives and affricates, a short hold before the consonant is released, in many cases with distinctive lexical value: e.g. \"note\" (notes) vs. \"notte\" (night), \"cade\" (s/he, it falls) vs. \"cadde\" (s/he, it fell), \"caro\" (dear, expensive) vs. \"carro\" (cart, car). They may even occur at the beginning of words in Romanesco, Neapolitan, Sicilian and other southern varieties, and are occasionally indicated in writing, e.g. Sicilian \"cchi\u00f9\" (more), and \"cc\u00e0\" (here). In general, the consonants , , and are long at the start of a word, while the archiphoneme is realised as a trill in the same position. In much of central and southern Italy, the affricates /t\u0283/ and /d\u0292/ weaken synchronically to fricative [\u0283] and [\u0292] between vowels, while their geminate congeners do not, e.g. \"cacio\" (cheese) vs. \"caccio\" (I chase). In Italian the geminates /\u0283\u0283/, /\u0272\u0272/, and /\u028e\u028e/ are pronounced as long [\u0283\u0283], [\u0272\u0272], and [\u028e\u028e] between vowels, but normally reduced to short following pause: \"lasciare\" 'let, leave' or \"la sciarpa\" 'the scarf' with [\u0283\u0283], but post-pausal \"sciarpa\" with [\u0283].\nA few languages have regained secondary geminate consonants. The double consonants of Piedmontese exist only after stressed , written \"\u00eb\", and are not etymological: \"v\u00ebdde\" (Latin \"vid\u0113re\", to see), \"s\u00ebcca\" (Latin \"sicca\", dry, feminine of \"sech\"). In standard Catalan and Occitan, there exists a geminate sound written \"\u0140l\" (Catalan) or \"ll\" (Occitan), but it is usually pronounced as a simple sound in colloquial (and even some formal) speech in both languages.\nVowel prosthesis.\nIn Late Latin a prosthetic vowel /i/ (lowered to /e/ in most languages) was inserted at the beginning of any word that began with (referred to as \"s impura\") and a voiceless consonant (#sC- &gt; isC-):\nWhile Western Romance words fused the prosthetic vowel with the word, cognates in Eastern Romance and southern Italo-Romance did not, e.g. Italian \"scrivere\", \"spada\", \"spirito\", \"Stefano\", and \"stato\", Romanian \"scrie\", \"spat\u0103\", \"spirit\", \"\u0218tefan\" and \"stat\". In Italian, syllabification rules were preserved instead by vowel-final articles, thus feminine \"spada\" as \"la spada\", but instead of rendering the masculine \"*il stato\", \"lo stato\" came to be the norm. Though receding at present, Italian once had a prosthetic maintaining /s/ syllable-final if a consonant preceded such clusters, so that 'in Switzerland' was \"in\" \"Svizzera\". Some speakers still use the prothetic productively, and it is fossilized in a few set locutions such as \"in ispecie\" 'especially' or \"per iscritto\" 'in writing' (a form whose survival may have been buttressed in part by the word \"iscritto\" &lt; Latin \"\u012bnscr\u012bptus\").\nStressed vowels.\nLoss of vowel length, reorientation.\nOne profound change that affected Vulgar Latin was the reorganisation of its vowel system. Classical Latin had five short vowels, \"\u0103, \u0115, \u012d, \u014f, \u016d\", and five long vowels, \"\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b\", each of which was an individual phoneme (see the table in the right, for their likely pronunciation in IPA), and four diphthongs, \"ae\", \"oe\", \"au\" and \"eu\" (five according to some authors, including \"ui\"). There were also long and short versions of \"y\", representing the rounded vowel in Greek borrowings, which however probably came to be pronounced even before Romance vowel changes started.\nThere is evidence that in the imperial period all the short vowels except \"a\" differed by quality as well as by length from their long counterparts. So, for example \"\u0113\" was pronounced close-mid while \"\u0115\" was pronounced open-mid , and \"\u012b\" was pronounced close while \"\u012d\" was pronounced near-close .\nDuring the Proto-Romance period, phonemic length distinctions were lost. Vowels came to be automatically pronounced long in stressed, open syllables (i.e. when followed by only one consonant), and pronounced short everywhere else. This situation is still maintained in modern Italian: \"cade\" \"he falls\" vs. \"cadde\" \"he fell\".\nThe Proto-Romance loss of phonemic length originally produced a system with nine different quality distinctions in monophthongs, where only original had merged. Soon, however, many of these vowels coalesced:\nFurther variants are found in southern Italy and Corsica, which also boasts a completely distinct system.\nThe Sardinian-type vowel system is also found in a small region belonging to the Lausberg area (also known as \"Lausberg zone\"; compare ) of southern Italy, in southern Basilicata, and there is evidence that the Romanian-type \"compromise\" vowel system was once characteristic of most of southern Italy, although it is now limited to a small area in western Basilicata centered on the Castelmezzano dialect, the area being known as , the German word for 'outpost'. The Sicilian vowel system, now generally thought to be a development based on the Italo-Western system, is also represented in southern Italy, in southern Cilento, Calabria and the southern tip of Apulia, and may have been more widespread in the past.\nThe greatest variety of vowel systems outside of southern Italy is found in Corsica, where the Italo-Western type is represented in most of the north and center and the Sardinian type in the south, as well as a system resembling the Sicilian vowel system (and even more closely the Carovignese system) in the Cap Corse region; finally, in between the Italo-Western and Sardinian system is found, in the Taravo region, a unique vowel system that cannot be derived from any other system, which has reflexes like Sardinian for the most part, but the short high vowels of Latin are uniquely reflected as mid-low vowels.\nGallurese and Sassarese appear to belong to the southern dialects of Corsica historically, but have a notable Logudorese Sardinian substratum \u2013 or adstratum \u2013 that is significantly stronger in Sassarese than in Gallurese.\nThe Proto-Romance allophonic vowel-length system was phonemicized in the Gallo-Romance languages as a result of the loss of many final vowels. Some northern Italian languages (e.g. Friulian) still maintain this secondary phonemic length, but most languages dropped it by either diphthongizing or shortening the new long vowels.\nFrench phonemicized a third vowel length system around AD 1300 as a result of the sound change /VsC/ &gt; /VhC/ &gt; (where \"V\" is any vowel and \"C\" any consonant). This vowel length began to be lost in Early Modern French, but the long vowels are still usually marked with a circumflex (and continue to be distinguished regionally, chiefly in Belgium). A fourth vowel length system, still non-phonemic, has now arisen: All nasal vowels as well as the oral vowels (which mostly derive from former long vowels) are pronounced long in all stressed closed syllables, and all vowels are pronounced long in syllables closed by the voiced fricatives .\nLatin diphthongs.\nThe Latin diphthongs and , pronounced and in earlier Latin, were early on monophthongized.\n became by the 1st century a.d. at the latest. Although this sound was still distinct from all existing vowels, the neutralization of Latin vowel length eventually caused its merger with &lt; short \"e\": e.g. \"caelum\" \"sky\" &gt; French , Spanish/Italian , Portuguese , with the same vowel as in \"mele\" \"honey\" &gt; French/Spanish , Italian , Portuguese . Some words show an early merger of \"ae\" with , as in \"praeda\" \"booty\" &gt; *\"pr\u0113da\" &gt; French (vs. expected **\"pri\u00e9e\"), Italian (not **\"prieda\") \"prey\"; or \"faenum\" \"hay\" &gt; *\"f\u0113num\" &gt; Spanish , French (but Italian /fj\u025bno/).\n generally merged with : \"poenam\" \"punishment\" &gt; Romance * &gt; Spanish/Italian , French ; \"foedus\" \"ugly\" &gt; Romance * &gt; Spanish , Portuguese . There are relatively few such outcomes, since was rare in Classical Latin (most original instances had become Classical , as in Old Latin \"one\" &gt; Classical ) and so was mostly limited to Greek loanwords, which were typically learned (high-register) terms.\n\"au\" merged with \"\u014d\" in the popular speech of Rome already by the 1st century b.c. A number of authors remarked on this explicitly, e.g. Cicero's taunt that the populist politician Publius Clodius Pulcher had changed his name from \"Claudius\" to ingratiate himself with the masses. This change never penetrated far from Rome, however, and the pronunciation /au/ was maintained for centuries in the vast majority of Latin-speaking areas, although it eventually developed into some variety of \"o\" in many languages. For example, Italian and French have as the usual reflex, but this post-dates diphthongization of and the French-specific palatalization &gt; (hence \"causa\" &gt; French , Italian not **\"cuosa\"). Spanish has , but Portuguese spelling maintains \u27e8ou\u27e9, which has developed to (and still remains as in some dialects, and in others). Occitan, Dalmatian, Sardinian, and many other minority Romance languages still have while in Romanian it underwent diaresis like in &gt; (a-ur). A few common words, however, show an early merger with \"\u014d\" , evidently reflecting a generalization of the popular Roman pronunciation: e.g. French , Italian , Occitan , Romanian (all meaning \"tail\") must all derive from \"c\u014dda\" rather than Classical \"cauda\". Similarly, Spanish , Portuguese , French , Romanian , and Sardinian , \"or\u00edcla\" \"ear\" must derive from \"\u014dric(u)la\" rather than Classical \"auris\" (Occitan was probably influenced by the unrelated \"ausir\" &lt; \"aud\u012bre\" \"to hear\"), and the form \"oricla\" is in fact reflected in the Appendix Probi.\nFurther developments.\nMetaphony.\nAn early process that operated in all Romance languages to varying degrees was metaphony (vowel mutation), conceptually similar to the umlaut process so characteristic of the Germanic languages. Depending on the language, certain stressed vowels were raised (or sometimes diphthongized) either by a final /i/ or /u/ or by a directly following /j/. Metaphony is most extensive in the Italo-Romance languages, and applies to nearly all languages in Italy; however, it is absent from Tuscan, and hence from standard Italian. In many languages affected by metaphony, a distinction exists between final /u/ (from most cases of Latin ) and final /o/ (from Latin , and some cases of , esp. masculine \"mass\" nouns), and only the former triggers metaphony.\nSome examples:\nDiphthongization.\nA number of languages diphthongized some of the free vowels, especially the open-mid vowels :\nThese diphthongization had the effect of reducing or eliminating the distinctions between open-mid and close-mid vowels in many languages. In Spanish and Romanian, all open-mid vowels were diphthongized, and the distinction disappeared entirely. Portuguese is the most conservative in this respect, keeping the seven-vowel system more or less unchanged (but with changes in particular circumstances, e.g. due to metaphony). Other than before palatalized consonants, Catalan keeps intact, but split in a complex fashion into and then coalesced again in the standard dialect (Eastern Catalan) in such a way that most original have reversed their quality to become .\nIn French and Italian, the distinction between open-mid and close-mid vowels occurred only in closed syllables. Standard Italian more or less maintains this. In French, /e/ and merged by the twelfth century or so, and the distinction between and was eliminated without merging by the sound changes , . Generally this led to a situation where both and occur allophonically, with the close-mid vowels in open syllables and the open-mid vowels in closed syllables. In French, both and were partly rephonemicized: Both and occur in open syllables as a result of , and both and occur in closed syllables as a result of .\nOld French also had numerous falling diphthongs resulting from diphthongization before palatal consonants or from a fronted /j/ originally following palatal consonants in Proto-Romance or later: e.g. /pats\u02b2e/ \"peace\" &gt; PWR */padz\u02b2e/ (lenition) &gt; OF /pajts/; *\"punctum\" \"point\" &gt; Gallo-Romance */pon\u02b2to/ &gt; */poj\u0272to/ (fronting) &gt; OF /p\u00f5jnt/. During the Old French period, preconsonantal /l/ [\u026b] vocalized to /w/, producing many new falling diphthongs: e.g. \"sweet\" &gt; PWR */dolts\u02b2e/ &gt; OF /du\u026bts/ &gt; \"douz\" /duts/; \"fallet\" \"fails, is deficient\" &gt; OF &gt; \"faut\" \"is needed\"; \"bellus\" \"beautiful\" &gt; OF &gt; \"beaus\" . By the end of the Middle French period, \"all\" falling diphthongs either monophthongized or switched to rising diphthongs: proto-OF &gt; early OF &gt; modern spelling \u27e8ai ei i oi ui oi ui au eau eu i ou ou u\u27e9 &gt; mod. French .\nNasalization.\nIn both French and Portuguese, nasal vowels eventually developed from sequences of a vowel followed by a nasal consonant (/m/ or /n/). Originally, all vowels in both languages were nasalized before any nasal consonants, and nasal consonants not immediately followed by a vowel were eventually dropped. In French, nasal vowels before remaining nasal consonants were subsequently denasalized, but not before causing the vowels to lower somewhat, e.g. \"d\u014dnat\" \"he gives\" &gt; OF \"dune\" &gt; \"donne\" , \"f\u0113minam\" &gt; \"femme\" . Other vowels remained nasalized, and were dramatically lowered: \"f\u012bnem\" \"end\" &gt; \"fin\" (often pronounced ); \"linguam\" \"tongue\" &gt; \"langue\" ; \"\u016bnum\" \"one\" &gt; \"un\" .\nIn Portuguese, /n/ between vowels was dropped, and the resulting hiatus eliminated through vowel contraction of various sorts, often producing diphthongs: \"manum, *man\u014ds\" &gt; PWR *\"manu, \u02c8manos\" \"hand(s)\" &gt; \"m\u00e3o, m\u00e3os\" ; \"canem, can\u0113s\" \"dog(s)\" &gt; PWR *\"kane, \u02c8kanes\" &gt; *\"can, \u02c8canes\" &gt; \"c\u00e3o, c\u00e3es\" ; \"rati\u014dnem, rati\u014dn\u0113s\" \"reason(s)\" &gt; PWR *\"ra\u02c8d\u02b2z\u02b2one, ra\u02c8d\u02b2z\u02b2ones\" &gt; *\"ra\u02c8dzon, ra\u02c8dzones\" &gt; \"raz\u00e3o, raz\u00f5es\" (Brazil), (Portugal). Sometimes the nasalization was eliminated: \"l\u016bna\" \"moon\" &gt; Galician-Portuguese \"l\u0169a\" &gt; \"lua\"; \"v\u0113na\" \"vein\" &gt; Galician-Portuguese \"v\u1ebda\" &gt; \"veia\". Nasal vowels that remained actually tend to be raised (rather than lowered, as in French): \"f\u012bnem\" \"end\" &gt; \"fim\" ; \"centum\" \"hundred\" &gt; PWR \"t\u02b2s\u02b2\u025bnto\" &gt; \"cento\" ; \"pontem\" \"bridge\" &gt; PWR \"p\u0254nte\" &gt; \"ponte\" (Brazil), (Portugal).\nRomanian shows evidence of past nasalization phenomena, the loss of palatal nasal [\u0272] in vie &lt; Lat. vinia, and the rhotacism of intervocalic /n/ in words like m\u0103runt &lt; Lat. minutu for example. The effect of nasalization is observed in vowel closing to /i \u0268 u/ before single /n/ and nasal+consonant clusters. Latin /nn/ and /m/ did not cause the same effect.\nFront-rounded vowels.\nCharacteristic of the Gallo-Romance and Rhaeto-Romance languages are the front rounded vowels . All of these languages, with the exception of Catalan, show an unconditional change /u/ &gt; /y/, e.g. \"l\u016bnam\" &gt; French \"lune\" , Occitan . Many of the languages in Switzerland and Italy show the further change /y/ &gt; /i/. Also very common is some variation of the French development (lengthened in open syllables) &gt; &gt; , with mid back vowels diphthongizing in some circumstances and then re-monophthongizing into mid-front rounded vowels. (French has both and , with developing from in certain circumstances.)\nUnstressed vowels.\nOriginally in Proto-Romance, the same nine vowels developed in unstressed as stressed syllables.\nIn Sardinian, they coalesced into five vowels in the same way as in stressed syllables.\nIn Italo-Western Romance, they coalesced into seven vowels, as in stressed syllables, but then unstressed low-mid merged into the high-mid vowels , resulting in a five-vowel system in unstressed syllables.\nWord-final short \"-u\" appears to have been raised to , rather than lowered to . However, it is possible that in reality, final comes from \"long\" *\"-\u016b\" &lt; \"-um\", where original final \"-m\" caused vowel lengthening as well as nasalization. Evidence of this comes from Rhaeto-Romance, in particular Sursilvan, which preserves reflexes of both final \"-us\" and \"-um\", and where the latter, but not the former, triggers metaphony. This suggests the development \"-us\" &gt; &gt; , but \"-um\" &gt; &gt; .\nIn final unstressed syllables, most Italo-Western Romance languages show further coalescence, although the original five-vowel system was preserved as-is in some of the more conservative central Italian languages:\nVarious later changes happened in individual languages, e.g.:\nIntertonic vowels.\nThe so-called \"intertonic vowels\" are word-internal unstressed vowels, i.e. not in the initial, final, or \"tonic\" (i.e. stressed) syllable, hence intertonic. Intertonic vowels were the most subject to loss or modification. Already in Vulgar Latin intertonic vowels between a single consonant and a following /r/ or /l/ tended to drop: \"v\u00e9tulum\" \"old\" &gt; \"veclum\" &gt; Dalmatian \"vieklo\", Sicilian \"vecchiu\", Portuguese \"velho\". But many languages ultimately dropped almost all intertonic vowels.\nGenerally, those languages south and east of the La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line (Romanian and Central-Southern Italian) maintained intertonic vowels, while those to the north and west (Western Romance) dropped all except /a/. Standard Italian generally maintained intertonic vowels, but typically raised unstressed /e/ &gt; /i/. Examples:\nPortuguese is more conservative in maintaining some intertonic vowels other than /a/: e.g. *\"offer\u1e17scere\" \"to offer\" &gt; Portuguese \"oferecer\" vs. Spanish \"ofrecer\", French \"offrir\" (&lt; *\"offer\u012bre\"). French, on the other hand, drops even intertonic /a/ after the stress: \"St\u00e9phanum\" \"Stephen\" &gt; Spanish \"Esteban\" but Old French \"Estievne\" &gt; French \"\u00c9tienne\". Many cases of /a/ before the stress also ultimately dropped in French: \"sacram\u00e9ntum\" \"sacrament\" &gt; Old French \"sairement\" &gt; French \"serment\" \"oath\".\nWriting systems.\nThe Romance languages for the most part have continued to use the Latin alphabet while adapting it to their evolution.\nOne exception was Romanian, where before the nineteenth century, the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet was used due to Slavic influence after the Roman retreat. A Cyrillic alphabet was also used for Romanian (then called Moldovan) in the USSR. The non-Christian populations of Spain also used the scripts of their religions (Arabic and Hebrew) to write Romance languages such as Judaeo-Spanish and Mozarabic in \"aljamiado\".\nLetters.\nThe classical Latin alphabet of 23 letters \u2013 \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"I\", \"K\", \"L\", \"M\", \"N\", \"O\", \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\", \"V\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"Z\" \u2013 was modified and augmented in various ways to yield the spelling systems of the Romance languages. In particular, the single Latin letter \"V\" split into \"V\" (consonant) and \"U\" (vowel), and the letter \"I\" split into \"I\" and \"J\". The Latin letter \"K\" and the new letter \"W\", which came to be widely used in Germanic languages, are seldom used in most Romance languages \u2013 mostly for unassimilated foreign names and words. Indeed, in Italian prose is properly . Portuguese and Catalan eschew importation of \"foreign\" letters more than most languages. Thus Wikipedia is in Catalan but in Spanish; chikungunya, sandwich, kiwi are , , in Portuguese but , , in Spanish.\nWhile most of the 23 basic Latin letters have maintained their phonetic value, for some of them it has diverged considerably; and the new letters added since the Middle Ages have been put to different uses in different scripts. Some letters, notably \"H\" and \"Q\", have been variously combined in digraphs or trigraphs (see below) to represent phonetic phenomena that could not be recorded with the basic Latin alphabet, or to get around previously established spelling conventions. Most languages added auxiliary marks (diacritics) to some letters, for these and other purposes.\nThe spelling systems of most Romance languages are fairly simple, and consistent within any language.\nSpelling rules are typically phonemic (as opposed to being strictly phonetic); as a result of this, the actual pronunciation of standard written forms can vary substantially according to the speaker's accent (which may differ by region) or the position of a sound in the word or utterance (allophony).\nThe following letters have notably different values between languages, or between Latin and the Romance languages:\nB, V: Merged in Spanish and some dialects of Catalan, where both letters represent a single phoneme pronounced as either or depending on position, with no differentiation between B and V.\nC: Generally a \"hard\" , but \"soft\" (fricative or affricate) before \"e\", \"i\", or \"y\".\nG: Generally a \"hard\" , but \"soft\" (fricative or affricate) before \"e\", \"i\", or \"y\". In some languages, like Spanish, the hard \"g\", phonemically , is pronounced as a fricative after vowels. In Romansch, the soft \"g\" is a voiced palatal plosive or a voiced alveolo-palatal affricate .\nH: Silent in most languages; used to form various digraphs. But represents in Romanian, Walloon and Gascon Occitan.\nJ: Represents the fricative in most languages, the palatal approximant in Romansh and in several of the languages of Italy, and [x] or [h] in Spanish (depending on the variety). Italian does not use this letter in native words, replacing it with \"gi\" before a vowel.\nQ: As in Latin, its phonetic value is that of a hard \"c\", i.e. , and in native words it is almost always followed by a (sometimes silent) \"u\". Romanian does not use this letter in native words, using \"ch\" instead.\nS: Generally voiceless , but in some languages it can be voiced instead in certain contexts (especially between vowels). In Spanish, Romanian, Galician and several varieties of Italian, it is always pronounced voiceless between vowels. If the phoneme /s/ is represented by the letter S, predictable assimilations are normally not shown (e.g. Italian 'sled', spelled \"slitta\" but pronounced , never with ). Also at the end of syllables it may represent special allophonic pronunciations. In Romansh, it also stands for a voiceless or voiced fricative, or , before certain consonants.\nW: No Romance language uses this letter in native words, with the exception of Walloon.\nX: Its pronunciation is rather variable, both between and within languages. In the Middle Ages, the languages of Iberia used this letter to denote the voiceless postalveolar fricative , which is still the case in modern Catalan and Portuguese. With the Renaissance the classical pronunciation \u2013 or similar consonant clusters, such as , , or \u2013 were frequently reintroduced in latinisms and hellenisms. In Venetian it represents , and in Ligurian the voiced postalveolar fricative . Italian does not use this letter in native words for historical reasons.\nY: This letter is not used in most languages, with the prominent exceptions of French and Spanish, where it represents before vowels (or various similar fricatives such as the palatal fricative , in Spanish), and the vowel or semivowel elsewhere.\nZ: In most languages it represents the sound . However, in Italian it denotes the affricates and (which are two separate phonemes, but rarely contrast; among the few examples of minimal pairs are \"ray\" with , \"race\" with (both are phonetically long between vowels); in Romansh the voiceless affricate ; and in Galician and Spanish it denotes either the voiceless dental fricative or .\nOtherwise, letters that are not combined as digraphs generally represent the same phonemes as suggested by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), whose design was, in fact, greatly influenced by Romance spelling systems.\nDigraphs and trigraphs.\nSince most Romance languages have more sounds than can be accommodated in the Roman Latin alphabet they all resort to the use of digraphs and trigraphs \u2013 combinations of two or three letters with a single phonemic value. The concept (but not the actual combinations) is derived from Classical Latin, which used, for example, \"TH\", \"PH\", and \"CH\" when transliterating the Greek letters \"\u03b8\", \"\u03d5\" (later \"\u03c6\"), and \"\u03c7\". These were once aspirated sounds in Greek before changing to corresponding fricatives, and the \"H\" represented what sounded to the Romans like an following , , and respectively. Some of the digraphs used in modern scripts are:\nCI: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican and Romanian to represent before \"A\", \"O\", or \"U\".\nCH: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican, Romanian, Romansh and Sardinian to represent before \"E\" or \"I\" (including yod ); in Occitan, Spanish, Astur-leonese and Galician; or in Romansh before \"A\", \"O\" or \"U\"; and in most other languages. In Catalan it is used in some old spelling conventions for .\nDD: used in Sicilian and Sardinian to represent the voiced retroflex plosive . In recent history more accurately transcribed as \"DDH\".\nDJ: used in Walloon and Catalan for .\nGI: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican and Romanian to represent before \"A\", \"O\", or \"U\", and in Romansh to represent or or (before \"A\", \"E\", \"O\", and \"U\") or \nGH: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican, Romanian, Romansh and Sardinian to represent before \"E\" or \"I\" (including yod ), and in Galician for the voiceless pharyngeal fricative (not standard sound).\nGL: used in Romansh before consonants and \"I\" and at the end of words for .\nGLI: used in Italian and Corsican for and Romansh for .\nGN: used in French, some Romance languages in Italy, Corsican, Romansh Walloon for , as in \"champignon\"; in Italian to represent , as in \"ogni\" or \"lo gnocco\".\nGU: used before \"E\" or \"I\" to represent or in all Romance languages except Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Corsican, Romansh, and Romanian, which use GH instead.\nIG: used at the end of word in Catalan for , as in \"maig\", \"safareig\" or \"enmig\".\nIX: used between vowels or at the end of word in Catalan/Aragonese for , as in \"caixa\"/\"caixa\" or \"calaix\"/\"calaixo\".\nJH: used in Walloon for /\u0292/ or /h/.\nLH: used in Portuguese and Occitan .\nLL: used in Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Astur-leonese, Norman and Dg\u00e8rn\u00e9siais, originally for which has merged in some cases with . Represents in French unless it follows \"I\" (\"i\") when it represents (or in some dialects). As in Italian, it is used in Occitan for a long .\nL\u00b7L: used in Catalan for a geminate consonant .\nNH: used in Portuguese and Occitan for , used in official Galician for .\nN-: used in Piedmontese and Ligurian for between two vowels.\nNN: used in Leonese for , in Italian for geminate .\nNY: used in Catalan, Aragonese and Walloon for .\nQU: represents in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, and Romansh; in French, Astur-leonese (normally before \"e\" or \"i\"); (before \"e\" or \"i\") or (normally before \"a\" or \"o\") in Occitan, Catalan and Portuguese; in Spanish (always before \"e\" or \"i\").\nRR: used between vowels in several languages (Occitan, Catalan, Spanish) to denote a trilled or a guttural R, instead of the flap .\nSC: used before \"E\" or \"I\" in Italian, Romance languages in Italy as , in European Portuguese as and in French, Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan and Hispanic American Spanish as in words of certain etymology (notice this would represent in standard peninsular Spanish)\nSCH: used in Romansh for or , in Italian for before \"E\" or \"I\", including yod .\nSCI: used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, and Corsican to represent before \"A\", \"O\", or \"U\".\nSH: used in Aranese, Spanish (almost only in foreign words), Occitan and Walloon for .\nSS: used in French, Portuguese, Piedmontese, Romansh, Occitan, and Catalan for between vowels, in Italian, Romance languages of Italy, and Corsican for long .\nTS: used in Catalan for .\nTSH: used in Walloon for /t\u0283/.\nTG: used in Romansh for or . In Catalan is used for before \"E\" and \"I\", as in \"metge\" or \"fetge\".\nTH: used in J\u00e8rriais for ; used in Aranese for either or .\nTJ: used between vowels and before \"A\", \"O\" or \"U\", in Catalan for , as in \"sotjar\" or \"mitj\u00f3\".\nTSCH: used in Romansh for .\nTX: used at the beginning or at the end of word or between vowels in Catalan for , as in \"txec\", \"esquitx\" or \"atxa\".\nTZ: used in Catalan for .\nXH: used in Walloon for /\u0283/ or /h/, depending on the dialect.\nWhile the digraphs \"CH\", \"PH\", \"RH\" and \"TH\" were at one time used in many words of Greek origin, most languages have now replaced them with \"C/QU\", \"F\", \"R\" and \"T\". Only French has kept these etymological spellings, which now represent or , , and , respectively.\nDouble consonants.\nGemination, in the languages where it occurs, is usually indicated by doubling the consonant, except when it does not contrast phonemically with the corresponding short consonant, in which case gemination is not indicated. In J\u00e8rriais, long consonants are marked with an apostrophe: is a long , is a long , and is a long . The phonemic contrast between geminate and single consonants is widespread in Italian, and normally indicated in the traditional orthography: 'done' vs. 'fate, destiny'; 's/he, it fell' vs. 's/he, it falls'. The double consonants in French orthography, however, are merely etymological. In Catalan, the gemination of is marked by a (\"flying point\"): .\nDiacritics.\nRomance languages also introduced various marks (diacritics) that may be attached to some letters, for various purposes. In some cases, diacritics are used as an alternative to digraphs and trigraphs; namely to represent a larger number of sounds than would be possible with the basic alphabet, or to distinguish between sounds that were previously written the same. Diacritics are also used to mark word stress, to indicate exceptional pronunciation of letters in certain words, and to distinguish words with same pronunciation (homophones).\nDepending on the language, some letter-diacritic combinations may be considered distinct letters, e.g. for the purposes of lexical sorting. This is the case, for example, of Romanian \"\u0219\" () and Spanish \"\u00f1\" ().\nThe following are the most common use of diacritics in Romance languages.\nUpper and lowercase.\nMost languages are written with a mixture of two distinct but phonetically identical variants or \"cases\" of the alphabet: majuscule (\"uppercase\" or \"capital letters\"), derived from Roman stone-carved letter shapes, and minuscule (\"lowercase\"), derived from Carolingian writing and Medieval quill pen handwriting which were later adapted by printers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\nIn particular, all Romance languages capitalize (use uppercase for the first letter of) the following words: the first word of each complete sentence, most words in names of people, places, and organizations, and most words in titles of books. The Romance languages do not follow the German practice of capitalizing all nouns including common ones. Unlike English, the names of months, days of the weeks, and derivatives of proper nouns are usually not capitalized: thus, in Italian one capitalizes \"Francia\" (\"France\") and \"Francesco\" (\"Francis\"), but not \"francese\" (\"French\") or \"francescano\" (\"Franciscan\").

Forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to the Middle Ages (see medieval football). Rugby football spread to other English public schools in the 19th century and across the British Empire as former pupils continued to play it.\nRugby football split into two codes in 1895, when twenty-one clubs from the North of England left the Rugby Football Union to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (renamed the Rugby Football League in 1922) at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, over payments to players who took time off work to play (\"broken-time payments\"), thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay players. Rugby union turned professional one hundred years later, following the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. The respective world governing bodies are World Rugby (rugby union) and the International Rugby League (rugby league).\nCanadian football and, to a lesser extent, American football were once considered forms of rugby football, but are seldom now referred to as such. The governing body of Canadian football, Football Canada, was known as the Canadian Rugby Union as late as 1967, more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with rugby rules.\nForms.\nFollowing the 1895 split in rugby football, the two forms rugby league and rugby union differed in administration only. Soon, however, the desire among the northern clubs to make the rules simpler and more attractive to paying spectators meant that the rules of rugby league were modified e.g. reducing teams from 15 to 13 players, removing the line-out and replacing the ruck with the play-the-ball, resulting in two distinct sports.\nThe form of rugby played at the Olympic Games is known as rugby sevens, based broadly on a rugby union format, and organised by World Rugby. In this form of the game, each team has seven players on the field at one time playing seven-minute halves. The rules and pitch size are the same as rugby union. Rugby nines represents a similar innovation in the league code.\nHistory.\nAntecedents of rugby.\nAlthough rugby football was codified at Rugby School, many rugby playing countries had pre-existing football games similar to rugby.\nForms of traditional football similar to rugby have been played throughout Europe and beyond. Many of these involved handling of the ball, and scrummaging formations. For example, New Zealand had K\u012b-o-rahi, Australia marn grook, Japan kemari, Georgia lelo burti, the Scottish Borders Jeddart Ba' and Cornwall Cornish hurling, Central Italy Calcio Fiorentino, South Wales cnapan, East Anglia Campball, Ireland caid, an ancestor of Gaelic football, and France had La Soule.\nEstablishment of modern rugby.\nIn 1871, English clubs met to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). In 1892, after charges of professionalism (compensation of team members) were made against some clubs for paying players for missing work, the Northern Rugby Football Union, usually called the Northern Union (NU), was formed. The existing rugby union authorities responded by issuing sanctions against the clubs, players, and officials involved in the new organization. After the schism, the separate clubs were named \"rugby league\" and \"rugby union\".\nGlobal status of rugby codes.\nRugby union.\nRugby union is both a professional and amateur game, and is dominated by the first tier unions: England, New Zealand, Ireland, Wales, South Africa, Australia, Argentina, Scotland, Italy, France and Japan. Second and third tier unions include Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Georgia, Germany, Hong Kong, Kenya, Namibia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Samoa, Spain, Tonga, the United States, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. Rugby Union is administered by World Rugby (WR), whose headquarters are located in Dublin, Ireland. It is the national sport in New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Georgia, Wales and Madagascar, and is the most popular form of rugby globally. The Olympic Games have admitted the seven-a-side version of the game, known as Rugby sevens, into the programme from Rio de Janeiro in 2016 onwards. There was a possibility sevens would be a demonstration sport at the 2012 London Olympics but many sports including sevens were dropped.\nThe premier international competition is the Rugby World Cup. Currently there are four major domestic professional leagues globally:\nRugby league.\nRugby league is also both a professional and amateur game, administered on a global level by the Rugby League International Federation. In addition to amateur and semi-professional competitions in the United States, Russia, Lebanon, Serbia, Europe and Australasia, there are two major professional competitions\u2014the Australasian National Rugby League and the Super League. International Rugby League is dominated by Australia, England and New Zealand, though Tonga and Samoa have threatened this hegemony regularly since 2017. In Papua New Guinea, it is the national sport. Other nations from the South Pacific and Europe also play in the Pacific Cup and European Cup respectively.\nThe premier international competition is the Rugby League World Cup, which is contested quadrennially. The premier international club competition is the World Club Challenge, which is contested annually in February. Currently there are two major domestic professional leagues globally:\nGridiron football.\nIn Canada and the United States, rugby developed into gridiron football. During the late 1800s (and even the early 1900s), the two forms of the game were very similar (to the point where the United States was able to win the gold medal for rugby union at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics), but numerous rule changes have differentiated the gridiron-based game from its rugby counterpart, introduced by Walter Camp in the United States and John Thrift Meldrum Burnside in Canada. Among unique features of the North American game are \nWorldwide, there are three major professional leagues of gridiron football, both domestic:\nRules.\nBoth major codes of rugby\u2014rugby league and rugby union\u2014share several distinctive characteristics that set them apart from other types of football. One of the most notable features is the use of an oval-shaped ball, which influences the style and flow of gameplay. Another defining rule in both codes is the strict prohibition of forward passing. This means that players are not allowed to throw the ball ahead to a teammate; instead, they must either pass the ball laterally or backward. As a result, teams can only advance toward the opponent\u2019s try line by running with the ball in hand or by kicking it strategically. Additionally, in contrast to American and Canadian football, athletes in both rugby union and rugby league do not wear protective gear or armor such as helmets or heavy padding. The physicality of the sport is managed through technique, rules, and discipline, rather than through the use of extensive protective equipment. \nThe two rugby codes differ as the result of changes made to the rules of rugby league. League implemented these changes with the aim of making a faster-paced and more try-oriented game than rugby union. \nThe main differences between the two games, besides league having teams of 13 players and union of 15, involve the tackle and its aftermath:\nSet pieces of the union code include the scrum and the line-out. The scrum occurs after a minor infringement of the rules (most often a knock-on, when a player knocks the ball forward). After an infringement, packs of opposing players \"scrum\" or push against each other for possession. In a line-out, parallel lines of players from each team, arranged perpendicular to the touch-line, attempt to catch the ball thrown from touch. A rule has been added to line-outs which allows the jumper to be pulled down once a players' feet are on the ground.\nIn the league code, the scrum still exists albeit with greatly reduced importance. In league, the scrum involves fewer players and is rarely contested. Set pieces are generally started from the play-the-ball situation. \nMany of the rugby league positions have names and requirements similar to rugby union positions. Notably, however, there are no flankers in rugby league.\nCulture.\nHome countries.\nIn England, rugby union is widely regarded as an \"establishment\" sport, played mostly by members of the upper and middle classes. For example, many pupils at public schools and grammar schools play rugby union, although the game (which had a long history of being played at state schools until the 1980s) is becoming increasingly popular in comprehensive schools. Despite this stereotype, the game, particularly in the West Country is popular amongst all classes. In contrast, rugby league has traditionally been seen as a working-class pursuit. Another exception to rugby union's upper-class stereotype is in Wales, where it has been traditionally associated with small village teams made up of coal miners and other industrial workers who played on their days off. In Ireland, both rugby union and rugby league are unifying forces across the national and sectarian divide, with the Ireland international teams representing both political entities.\nIn Australia, support for both codes is concentrated in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory (55% of the population), though rugby league is far more popular. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at private schools.\nExceptions to the above include New Zealand, Wales, France (except Paris), Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Scottish Borders, County Limerick (see Munster Rugby) and the Pacific Islands, where rugby union is popular in working class communities. Nevertheless, rugby league is perceived as the game of the working-class people in northern England and in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland.\nIn the United Kingdom, rugby union fans sometimes used the term \"rugger\" as an alternative name for the sport (see Oxford '-er'), although this archaic expression has not had currency since the 1950s or earlier. New Zealanders refer to rugby union simply as either \"rugby\" or \"union\", or even simply \"football\", and to rugby league as \"rugby league\" or \"league\". In the U.S., people who play rugby are sometimes called \"ruggers\", a term little used elsewhere except facetiously.\nInternationally.\nThere is a strong tradition of rugby union in France, particularly in the Basque, Occitan and Catalan areas along the border with Spain. The game is very popular in South Africa, having been introduced by English-speaking settlers in the 19th century. British colonists also brought the game with them to Australia and New Zealand, where the game is widely played. It has spread since to much of Polynesia, having particularly strong followings in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Rugby union continues to grow in the Americas and parts of Asia as well. French influence, and the influence of ex-pat students studying in France, expanded rugby's reach to Romania and Georgia which are the preeminent European nations behind the Six Nations Championship. British influence spread the game to Argentina, where the game took root, and the game developed in Italy thanks to influence from both France and Argentina; both Argentina and Italy have become Tier 1 nations in the sport, while Georgia. officially a Tier 2 nation, regularly ranks up with the Tier 1 countries.\nInjuries.\nAbout a quarter of rugby players are injured in each season.\nBeing a high contact sport, rugby union has the highest announced rates of concussions and outside England also has the highest number of catastrophic injuries among team sports. A 2014 study found that during match play concussion was reported at a higher level, and during training at a lower level, but still at a higher level than most players of any other sport receive.\nRugby ball.\nA rugby ball is a diamond shape ball used for easier passing. Richard Lindon and Bernardo Solano started making balls for Rugby School out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pigs' bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig's bladder, although early balls were more plum-shaped than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig's bladder was.\nIn rugby union, World Rugby regulates the size and shape of the ball under Law 2 (also known as Law E.R.B); an official rugby union ball is oval and made of four panels, has a length in-line of 280\u2013300 millimetres, a circumference (end to end) of 740\u2013770 millimetres, and a circumference (in width) of 580\u2013620 millimetres. It is made of leather or suitable synthetic material and may be treated to make it water resistant and easier to grip. The rugby ball may not weigh more than 460\u00a0grams or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71\u201368.75 kilopascals, or 0.67\u20130.70 kilograms per square centimetre, or 9.5\u201310.0\u00a0lbs per square inch. Spare balls are allowed under the condition that players or teams do not seek an advantage by changing the ball. Smaller sized balls may also be used in games between younger players.\nMuch larger versions of traditional balls are also available for purchase, but these are mainly for their novelty attraction.\nWorld Cups.\nThe Rugby League World Cup was the first World Cup of either of the Rugby codes and was first held in France in 1954, and as of 2013 occurs on a four-year cycle. It is an international tournament that is organized by the International Rugby League. The event is played in the league format and features the top 16 teams from around the world with three different winners recorded so far. Australia won the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, played in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. The Kangaroos backed this up by winning the 2021 tournament also. The women's version of the Rugby League World Cup which is known as the Women's Rugby League World Cup, first held in 2000 and New Zealand won the inaugural tournament. There is the third Rugby League World Cup competition, which is known as the Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup. First held in 2008, it is played with wheelchair-bound teams and England won the inaugural tournament. \nThe Rugby World Cup, which was first held in New Zealand and Australia in 1987, occurs every four years. It is an international tournament organized by World Rugby. The event is played in the union format and features the top 20 teams from around the world with four different winners recorded so far. South Africa won the 2023 Rugby World Cup, which was played in France. The women's version of the Rugby World Cup which is known as the Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991 and the United States won the inaugural tournament. \nSince 2013, these two World Cups alternate every two years during the four-year period, with the exceptions of 2021 and 2026 for the RLWC.\nRugby shirt.\nRugby shirts were formerly entirely made of cotton but are now made of synthetic fabric. This material has the advantage of not absorbing as much water or mud as cotton. Owing to the more aggressive nature of the game, rugby clothing, in general, is designed to be much more robust and hardwearing than that worn for association football.\nThe rugby jerseys are slightly different depending on the type of rugby game played. The shirts worn by rugby league footballers commonly have a large \"V\" around the neck. The players in rugby union wear jerseys with a more traditional design, sometimes completely white (Cahors Rugby in France). The number of the player and his or her surname are placed on the upper back of the jersey (often name above number, with the number being significantly larger and more central), and the logo of the team on the upper left chest.\nRugby betting.\nWith the popularity of rugby over the years, many betting establishments have made it possible for viewers of the game to place wagers on games. The various types of wagers that can be placed on games vary, however, the main types of bets that can be placed are as follows:\nLike most team sports, both forms of rugby are vulnerable to match-fixing, particularly bets involving easily manipulated outcomes such as conceding penalties and first point scorer. A recent example is a deliberate infringement by Ryan Tandy in order for the first points scored to be a penalty goal in a 2010 NRL match; the attempt backfired when instead of taking a shot at goal, a try was scored.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rugby involves running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, the game is played between two teams of 15 players each, using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by people regardless of gender, age or size. In 2023, there were more than 10\u00a0million players worldwide, of whom 8.4\u00a0million were registered. World Rugby, previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 116 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\nIn 1845, the first rules of the game were written by pupils at Rugby School; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by Blackheath F.C. to leave The Football Association in 1863 and, in 1895, the split between rugby union and rugby league. Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game open to professionals at the highest level for the first time.\nRugby union spread from the Home Nations of the United Kingdom and Ireland, with other early proponents of the sport including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. The sport is primarily followed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Georgia, Southern Africa, Argentina, and in more recent times, Japan, Korea, South America, the United States and Canada, its growth occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and through French proponents (Rugby Europe) in Europe. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their \"de facto\" national sport include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Wales.\nInternational matches have taken place since 1871 when the first game was played between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. The Rugby World Cup, first held in 1987, is held every four years. The Six Nations Championship in Europe and The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere are other important international competitions that are held annually.\nThe Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991, and the United States won their inaugural title. There is also the Women's Six Nations Championship which is held annually alongside the men's counterpart.\nNational club and provincial competitions include the Premiership in England, the Top 14 in France, the Bunnings NPC in New Zealand, the League One in Japan and the Currie Cup in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the United Rugby Championship of club teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa and Wales, European Rugby Champions Cup in Europe, and Super Rugby in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nPrimitive forms of football included harpastum, played by the Romans, where two opposing teams competed to throw a large ball into an opposition net, fighting for possession of the ball. Medieval Irishmen played caid, carrying an inflated bladder and using arched trees as goals. The Welsh played an inter-parish game using a wooden ball called cnapan. Frenchmen played \"la soule\" and Georgians played \"lelo burti\". \"Football\" as a game was well established by 1803 at Rugby School and by the 1830s, \"running in\" with the ball in hand was allowed but subject to hacking and \"collaring\".Former Rugby School student Albert Pell is credited with having formed the first \"football\" team while a student at Cambridge University. Major private schools each used different rules during this early period, with former pupils from Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities. A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of a written set of rules at Rugby School in 1845, followed by the Cambridge Rules that were drawn up in 1848.\nFormed in 1863, the national governing body The Football Association (FA) began codifying a set of universal football rules. These new rules specifically banned players from running with the ball in hand and also disallowed hacking (kicking players in the shins), both of which were legal and common tactics under the Rugby School's rules of the sport. In protest at the imposition of the new rules, the Blackheath Club left the FA followed by several other clubs that also favoured the \"Rugby Rules\". Although these clubs decided to ban hacking soon afterwards, the split was permanent, and the FA's codified rules became known as \"association football\" whilst the clubs that had favoured the Rugby Rules formed the Rugby Football Union in 1871, and their code became known as \"rugby football\".\nIn 1895, there was a major schism within rugby football in England in which numerous clubs from Northern England resigned from the RFU over the issue of reimbursing players for time lost from their workplaces. The split highlighted the social and class divisions in the sport in England. Although the rules of the game were not a factor in the split, the breakaway teams subsequently adopted some rule changes and this became the separate code of \"rugby league\". The RFU's code thereafter took on the name \"rugby union\" to differentiate it from rugby league, but both versions of the sport are known simply as \"rugby\" throughout most of the world.\nFirst internationals.\nThe first rugby football international was played on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England in Edinburgh. Scotland won the game by one goal and one try to one goal. By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams and in 1883 the first international competition, the Home Nations Championship had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first rugby sevens tournament, the Melrose Sevens, which is still held annually.\nTwo important overseas tours took place in 1888: a British Isles team visited Australia and New Zealand\u2014although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future British and Irish Lions tours; and the 1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team brought the first overseas team to British spectators.\nDuring the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888\u2014the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia, followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe. Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team. Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches. Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.\nBetween 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: New Zealand in 1905, followed by South Africa in 1906 and Australia in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics, and were far more successful than critics had expected.\nThe New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a haka before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to suggest that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in singing the Welsh national anthem, \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\", as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event. In 1905 France played England in its first international match.\nRugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the New Zealand Army team. During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games, and Cambridge and Oxford continued their annual University Match.\nThe first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the Scottish Rugby Union centenary celebrations.\nWorld Cup and professionalism.\nIn 1987, the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016. Both men and women's Sevens took place at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.\nRugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game \"open\" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players. However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of \"shamateurism\", including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995. Following the introduction of professionalism trans-national club competitions were started, with the Heineken Cup in the Northern Hemisphere and Super Rugby in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe Tri Nations, an annual international tournament involving Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, kicked off in 1996. In 2012, this competition was extended to include Argentina, a country whose impressive performances in international games (especially finishing in third place in the 2007 Rugby World Cup) was deemed to merit inclusion in the competition. As a result of the expansion to four teams, the tournament was renamed The Rugby Championship.\nTeams and positions.\nEach team starts the match with 15 players on the field and typically seven or eight substitutes but this varies at amateur level. The 15 players on the field are divided into eight forwards (two more than in rugby league) and seven backs. There are typically significantly more forwards on the bench than backs with, for example, South Africa having a 7\u20131 split in favour of forwards in their August 2023 match against New Zealand in Twickenham. A 6-2 or 5\u20133 split is more common.\nForwards.\nThe main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball. Forwards play a vital role in tackling and rucking opposing players. Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out. The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.\nFront row.\nThe front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.\nSecond row.\nThe second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team and specialise as line-out jumpers. The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.\nBack row.\nThe back row, not to be confused with 'Backs', is the third and final row of the forward positions, who are often referred to as the loose forwards. The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions, known as the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'. The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack, and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.\nBacks.\nThe role of the backs is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.\nHalf-backs.\nThe half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half, also known in the Southern Hemisphere as half-back and first five-eighth respectively. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance. They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs. Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs. They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half. They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.\nThree-quarters.\nThere are four three quarter positions: two centres (inside and outside) and two wings (left and right). In the Southern Hemisphere, the inside centre is commonly referred to as the second five-eighth, while the outside centre is simply known as the centre. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences. The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries. Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.\nFull-back.\nThe full-back is normally positioned several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line. Two of the most important attributes of a good full-back are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.\nLaws and gameplay.\nScoring.\nRugby union is played between two teams\u00a0\u2013 the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points. The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.\nPlaying field.\nAccording to World Rugby's Laws of the Game, a typical rugby ground, formally known as the \"playing enclosure\", is formed by two major zones:\nThe referee (and their assistants) generally have full authority and responsibility for all players and other officials inside the playing enclosure. Fences or ropes (particularly at amateur clubs) are generally used to mark the extent of this area, although in modern stadia this may include the entire arena floor or other designated space.\nThe Laws, above all, require that the playing enclosure's surface be safe, whilst also permitting grass, sand, clay, snow or conforming artificial turf to be used; the surface would generally be uniform across both the playing area and perimeter area, although depending on how large the perimeter is, other surfaces such as dirt, artificial turf, etc. may be used outside of a \"sliding\" perimeter from the bounds of the playing area.\nPlaying area.\nFor the most part, the \"playing area\" is where the majority of play occurs. The ball is generally considered live whilst in this area, so long as players do not infringe, with special rules applied to specific zones of the playing area.\nThe playing area consists of:\nField of play.\nA typical \"field of play\" is generally 100 metres long by 68\u201370 metres wide for senior rugby, depending on the specific requirements of each ground. The Laws require the field of play to be between long, with a width of between .\nAs other football codes, such as association football and rugby league, have specified a preferred or standard 68 metre width, this is often used unless a ground has been specifically designed to accommodate a 70-metre rugby field. 100 metres is the typical length, with a line (see below) often marked at halfway with \"50\" on it, representing 50 metres from each goal line. The variations have been allowed in the Laws, possibly to accommodate older grounds (perhaps even pre-metrification when yards and feet were specified) and developing nations.\nOther lines and markings.\nThe field of play is divided by a solid \"halfway\" line, drawn perpendicular to the sidelines at their midpoint. A 0.5m line is marked perpendicular to the halfway lines at its midpoint, designating the spot where the kickoffs shall be taken. The areas between each goal line and the halfway line are known as \"halves\" as in other football codes.\nA pair of solid lines are also drawn perpendicular to the sidelines, 22 metres (formerly 25 yards) from each end of the field of play and called the 22-metre lines, or \"22\"s. An area at each end, also known as the \"22\", is bounded by, but does not include, the sidelines, goal line and 22-metre line. In this area, a defensive player who cleanly catches a ball kicked by the other team, without the ball having already touched the ground after the kick, is entitled to claim a free kick, or \"mark\". Additionally, if the ball is kicked into touch by a player who had at least one foot on or behind their own 22-metre line, the line-out formed at the spot where the ball crossed the touch-line instead of being taken in line with the spot from where it was kicked.\nAdditional broken or dashed lines (of 5 metre dash lengths, according to the Laws) are drawn in each half or on each side of, the field, each with specific purposes under the Laws:\nGenerally, points where the dashed lines intersect other lines will be marked with a \"T\" or cross shape, although the extensions of dashed lines are generally not drawn within 5 metres of the goal lines or sidelines, to allow a clear demarcation of the field of play's boundaries.\nThe Laws require the playing area to be rectangular in shape, however variations may be permitted with the approval of relevant unions. A notable example is Chatswood Oval in Sydney, Australia, an elliptically shaped cricket ground which is the home of Gordon rugby club, that has curved dead-ball lines to maximise the available in-goal space.\nWhere multiple sports share a field (e.g. a rugby league and a rugby union club sharing one field), lines may be overlaid on top of each other, sometimes in different colours. However, particularly for television, rugby union line markings are generally painted white. Some exceptions include the Wallabies (Australia's national team) who often have yellow markings. Local clubs may use black, yellow, or other colours on grass, with other surfaces possibly requiring different marking techniques.\nUnlike association football, where on-field advertising is strictly forbidden in the laws, World Rugby allows sponsors logos to be painted on the playing surface. This is another way in which clubs can make money in the professional era and is also often used by host nations, professional leagues and tournaments as additional revenue streams, particularly when games are broadcast. In recent years, augmented reality technology has been used to replace painting to protect the surface or save costs on painting fields, producing a similar effect for broadcast albeit sometimes with poorer results.\nIn-goal areas.\nThe in-goal areas sit behind the goal lines, equivalent to American football's \"end zones\". The in-goal areas must be between deep and cover the full width of the field. A ball grounded in this area by an attacking player will generally result in a try being awarded, unless there has been a previous infringement, or the player has gone out-of-bounds whilst in possession of the ball.\nPerimeter area.\nThe perimeter area is considered \"out-of-bounds\" for the ball and the players, normally resulting in the non-infringing team receiving possession of the ball at a restart. The perimeter area can be divided into two areas:\nFor the purposes of determining if a ball is \"out-of-bounds\" (i.e. has left the playing area), the perimeter area extends indefinitely away from the playing area.\nWhen a ball or player goes into touch, a lineout throw is generally awarded to the opposition at the spot on the sideline where they left the field. Exceptions include a kick out \"on the full\" (i.e. the ball did not land in the field-of-play before going into touch) in which case the lineout would still take place on the sideline but back in line with where the ball was kicked, or when a team takes a free kick from a penalty where they would retain the right to throw-in.\nThe perimeter area should be clear and free of obstructions and heavy, solid objects which could pose a danger to players for at least 5 metres from the playing area, according to the Laws. Players often leave the playing area whether accidentally or due to being forced off of the field, sometimes sliding or needing to slow down from a sprint. Many venues at elite levels leave larger spaces around the field to accommodate fitter and faster (or heavier) players. Fixed cameras on tripods and advertising hoardings are often the main culprits for injuring players in the perimeter area.\nFlag posts.\nAlso required in the perimeter area are a set of 14 flag posts, each with a minimum height of 1.2 metres, marking the intersections of certain lines or other nominated distances. These are generally a plastic pole on a spring loaded or otherwise soft base, sometimes with a flag on top, covered in foam padding. Others may be moulded plastic or disposable cardboard. At lower levels, these flags may not be used, but are still specified in the Laws. Flags are placed as follows:\nGoalposts.\nRugby goalposts are H-shaped and are situated in the middle of the goal lines at each end of the field. They consist of two vertical poles (known as \"uprights\"), generally made of steel or other metal but sometimes wood or a plastic, apart, connected by a horizontal \"crossbar\" above the ground. The minimum height for posts' uprights is , with taller posts generally seen. The bottom parts of each upright are generally wrapped in purpose-made padding to protect players from injury when coming into contact with the posts and creating another opportunity for sponsors. Until a Law change by World Rugby in 2020, it was possible for an attacking player to score a try by grounding the ball against the base of the upright as the padding was considered an extension of the goal line.\nMatch structure.\nAt the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. The dropkick must make contact with the ground before being kicked. If the ball does not reach the opponent's line 10 meters away, the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a scrum at the centre of the half-way line.\nIf the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a ruck will result.\nGames are divided into 40-minute halves, with an intermission of not more than 15 minutes in the middle. The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break. Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes. The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when\u2014as in many professional tournaments\u2014he is assisted by an official time-keeper. If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is \"dead\", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.\nIn the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.\nPassing and kicking.\nForward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards. The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways\u2014by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or maul. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. A \"knock-on\" is committed when a player knocks the ball forward, and play is restarted with a scrum.\nAny player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into touch so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch. If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.\nBreakdowns.\nThe aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, by tackling them, and either bringing them to ground (which is frequently followed by a ruck) or contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). A ruck or maul is called a breakdown, and each is governed by a specific law.\nTackling\nA player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds), and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or ankle-tap). Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.\nRucking and Mauling\nMauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set. A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.\nSet pieces.\nLineout.\nWhen the ball leaves the side of the field, a line-out is awarded against the team which last touched the ball. Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between from the touchline. The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball into touch. The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.\nBoth sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates. A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick.\nScrum.\nA scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement. It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, if a player takes the ball over their own try line and puts the ball down, when a player is accidentally offside or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.\nA scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team crouching down and binding together in three rows, before interlocking with the opposing team. For each team, the front row consists of two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker. The two props are typically amongst the strongest players on the team. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3\u20134\u20131 formation. Once a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the \"feed\" rolls the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the \"tunnel\". The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession. The side that wins possession can either keep the ball under their feet while driving the opposition back, in order to gain ground, or transfer the ball to the back of the scrum where it can be picked up by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.\nOfficials and offences.\nThere are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees. The referees are commonly addressed as \"Sir\". The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of indicating when the ball had gone into \"touch\"; their role has been expanded and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such as watching for foul play and checking offside lines. In addition, for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match official (TMO; popularly called the \"video referee\"), to assist with certain decisions, linked up to the referee by radio. The referees have a system of hand signals to indicate their decision.\nCommon offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a scrum, ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside. The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a \"tap\" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum. Players may be sent off (signalled by a red card) or temporarily suspended (\"sin-binned\") for ten minutes (yellow card) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.\nOccasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be \"cited\" by the citing commissioner after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.\nReplacements and substitutions.\nDuring the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons). A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward. In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.\nPrior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, World Rugby changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.\nEquipment.\nThe most basic items of equipment for a game of rugby union are the ball itself, a rugby shirt (also known as a \"jersey\"), rugby shorts, socks, and boots. The rugby ball is oval in shape (technically a prolate spheroid), and is made up of four panels. The ball was historically made of leather, but in the modern era most games use a ball made from a synthetic material. World Rugby lays out specific dimensions for the ball, in length, in circumference of length and in circumference of width. Rugby boots have soles with studs to allow grip on the turf of the pitch. The studs may be either metal or plastic but must not have any sharp edges or ridges.\nProtective equipment is optional and strictly regulated. The most common items are mouthguards, which are worn by almost all players, and are compulsory in some rugby-playing nations. Other protective items that are permitted include headgear; thin (not more than 10\u00a0mm thick), non-rigid shoulder pads and shin guards, which are worn underneath socks. Bandages or tape can be worn to support or protect injuries; some players wear tape around the head to protect the ears in scrums and rucks. Female players may also wear chest pads. Although not worn for protection, some types of fingerless mitts are allowed to aid grip.\nIt is the responsibility of the match officials to check players' clothing and equipment before a game to ensure that it conforms to the laws of the game.\nGoverning bodies.\nThe international governing body of rugby union (and associated games such as sevens) is World Rugby. The World Rugby headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland. World Rugby, founded in 1886, governs the sport worldwide and publishes the game's laws and rankings. As of February 2014, World Rugby (then known as the IRB, for International Rugby Board) recorded 119 unions in its membership, 101 full members and 18 associate member countries. According to World Rugby, rugby union is played by men and women in over 100 countries. World Rugby controls the Rugby World Cup, the Women's Rugby World Cup, Rugby World Cup Sevens, HSBC Sevens Series, HSBC Women's Sevens Series, World Under 20 Championship, World Under 20 Trophy, Nations Cup and the Pacific Nations Cup. World Rugby holds votes to decide where each of these events are to be held, except in the case of the Sevens World Series for men and women, for which World Rugby contracts with several national unions to hold individual events.\nSix regional associations, which are members of World Rugby, form the next level of administration; these are:\nSANZAAR (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is a joint venture of the South African Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby, Rugby Australia and the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) that operates Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations before the entry of Argentina). Although UAR initially had no representation on the former SANZAR board, it was granted input into the organisation's issues, especially with regard to The Rugby Championship, and became a full SANZAAR member in 2016 (when the country entered Super Rugby).\nNational unions oversee rugby union within individual countries and are affiliated to World Rugby. Since 2016, the World Rugby Council has 40 seats. A total of 11 unions\u2014the eight foundation unions of England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France, plus Argentina, Canada and Italy\u2014have two seats each. In addition, the six regional associations have two seats each. Four more unions\u2014Georgia, Japan, Romania and the USA\u2014have one seat each. Finally, the chairman and vice chairman, who usually come from one of the eight foundation unions (although the current vice chairman, Agust\u00edn Pichot, is with the non-foundation Argentine union) have one vote each.\nGlobal reach.\nThe earliest countries to adopt rugby union were England, the country of inception, and the other three Home Nations, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel, and overseas university students. The first rugby club in France was formed by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year Argentina recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires. In turn, French and Argentine travellers, particularly students, spread the Game beyond the British Empire, forming roots in particular in Italy, Romania, Uruguay and Chile.\nEight countries have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport; they are Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, Wales and South Africa.\nOceania.\nA rugby club was formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to New Zealand by Charles Monro in 1870, who played rugby while a student at Christ's College, Finchley.\nSeveral island nations have embraced the sport of rugby. Rugby was first played in Fiji c.\u20091884 by European and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba on Viti Levu island. Fiji then sent their first overseas team to Samoa in 1924, who in turn set up their own union in 1924. Along with Tonga, other countries to have national rugby teams in Oceania include the Cook Islands, Niue, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.\nNorth America and Caribbean.\nIn North America, a club formed in Montreal in 1868, Canada's first club. The city of Montreal also played its part in the introduction of the sport in the United States, when students of McGill University played against a team from Harvard University in 1874. The two variants of gridiron football \u2014 Canadian football and, to a lesser extent, American football \u2014 were once considered forms of rugby football, but the introduction of the legal forward pass severed the conceptual link between the old world rugby codes and new world gridiron codes, and they are seldom now referred to as forms of rugby football. One lasting element of the link, the governing body of Canadian football, Football Canada, was known as the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) as late as 1967, more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union. The Grey Cup, the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing in the namesake championship of the professional Canadian Football League (CFL), was originally awarded to the champion of the CRU. The two strongest leagues in the CRU, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union in Eastern Canada and the Western Interprovincial Football Union in Western Canada, evolved into the present day CFL.\nAlthough the exact date of arrival of rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to British Guiana in 1933, switched their venue to Barbados; introducing rugby to the island. Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include Jamaica and Bermuda.\nRugby union is the fastest growing college sport and sport in general in the US.\nMajor League Rugby is the top professional rugby union competition in the US and Canada. One American professional team, American Raptors, formerly the MLR Glendale and Colorado Raptors, plays in the broadly South American Super Rugby Americas competition.\nEurope.\nThe growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers, attendances, and viewership has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were left to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy and Czechoslovakia. In 1934, instigated by the French Rugby Federation, FIRA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB. The founding members were Italy, Romania, Netherlands, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden.\nFour European teams have had, at different times, notable success; the most successful, Italy, joined the Five Nations Championship in 2000 as its sixth member, and while it remains the weakest of the Six Nations, it has recorded numerous wins over all its 6N rivals with the exception of England, as well as defeating South Africa, Australia and Argentina in official matches. Before Italy's ascension, Romania enjoyed a period of success as their teams, backed by a supportive Communist government, regularly challenged the major European nations. The fall of Communism in Romania led to an era of steep decline from which Romania has yet to fully emerge, but it remains one of the most prominent of the second level European teams. Georgia, in the Caucasus, rose to prominence in the early 21st century; the traditional national game lelo bore strong similarities to rugby union, meaning the country was naturally attracted to the sport upon independence, and the Georgians are now regarded as the top European nation below the traditional Six Nations, and even possibly on a par with Italy. Having qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup through the final repechage, Portugal had a startlingly successful tournament, holding Georgia to an 18\u201318 draw, and performing strongly against Tier One sides Wales and Australia before an historic victory over eventual quarter-finalists Fiji. Portugal demonstrated significant fan support during the tournament.\nOther European rugby playing nations of note include Russia, whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933. Rugby union in Spain, often associated with the Basque and Catalan regions near the French border, is also relatively strong in this context, having twice missed out on World Cup qualification by rule breaches having gained the points required, and hosting several large crowds for European Professional Rugby Cup matches.\nIn 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA\u2013AER (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur \u2013 Association Europ\u00e9enne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of Rugby Europe in 2014.\nSouth America.\nAlthough Argentina is the best-known rugby playing nation in South America, founding the Argentine Rugby Union in 1899, several other countries on the continent have a long history. Rugby had been played in Brazil since the end of the 19th century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when S\u00e3o Paulo beat Santos in an inter-city match. It took Uruguay several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the Montevideo Cricket Club; these efforts succeeded in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs. Other South American countries that formed a rugby union include Chile (1948), and Paraguay (1968).\nSuper Rugby Americas is the professional Rugby union competition in South America.\nAsia.\nMany Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. India began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the Calcutta Football Club forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area. In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered. Sri Lanka claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920. The first recorded match in Malaysia was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the HMS Malaya Cup which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.\nRugby union was introduced to Japan in 1899 by two Cambridge students: Ginnosuke Tanaka and Edward Bramwell Clarke. The Japan RFU was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented when Japan hosted the 2019 World Cup. It was the first country outside the Commonwealth, Ireland and France to host the event, and was viewed by the IRB as an opportunity for rugby union to extend its reach, particularly in Asia. Other Asian playing countries of note include Singapore, South Korea, China and The Philippines, while the former British colony of Hong Kong is notable within rugby for its development of the rugby sevens game, especially the Hong Kong Sevens tournament which was founded in 1976.\nRugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States began in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War. When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries. The official union of Oman was formed in 1971. Bahrain founded its union a year later, while in 1975 the Dubai Sevens, the Gulf's leading rugby tournament, was created. Rugby remains a minority sport in the region with Israel and the United Arab Emirates, as of 2019, being the only member unions from the Middle East to be included in the IRB World Rankings.\nAfrica.\nIn 1875, rugby was introduced to South Africa by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town. The game spread quickly across the country, displacing Winchester College football as the sport of choice in South Africa and spreading to nearby Zimbabwe. South African settlers also brought the game with them to Namibia and competed against British administrators in British East Africa. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a \"whites-only\" policy to playing the game. This resulted in rugby being viewed as a bourgeois sport by the indigenous people with limited appeal. Despite this, enclaves of black participation developed notably in the Eastern Cape and in Harare. The earliest countries to see the playing of competitive rugby include South Africa, and neighbouring Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe), which formed the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union in 1895 and became a regular stop for touring British and New Zealand sides.\nIn more recent times, the sport has been embraced by several African nations. In the early 21st century Madagascar has experienced crowds of 40,000 at national matches, while Namibia, whose history of rugby can be dated from 1915, have qualified for the final stages of the World Cup seven times since 1999. Other African nations to be represented in the World Rugby Rankings as Member Unions include C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. South Africa and Kenya are among the 15 \"core teams\" that participate in every event of the men's World Rugby Sevens Series.\nWomen's rugby union.\nRecords of women's rugby football date from the late 19th century, with the first documented source being Emily Valentine's writings, in which she states that she set up a rugby team in Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Ireland in 1887. Although there are reports of early women's matches in New Zealand and France, one of the first notable games to prove primary evidence was the 1917 war-time encounter between Cardiff Ladies and Newport Ladies; a photo of which shows the Cardiff team before the match at the Cardiff Arms Park. Since the 1980s, the game has grown in popularity among female athletes, and by 2010, according to World Rugby, women's rugby was being played in over 100 countries.\nThe English-based Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU), responsible for women's rugby in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, was founded in 1983, and is the oldest formally organised national governing body for women's rugby. This was replaced in 1994 by the Rugby Football Union for Women (RFUW) in England with each of the other Home Nations governing their own countries.\nThe premier international competition in rugby union for women is the Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991; from 1994 through 2014, it was held every four years. After the 2014 event, the tournament was brought forward a year to 2017 to avoid clashing with other sporting cycles, in particular the Rugby World Cup Sevens competition. The Women's Rugby World Cup returned to a four-year cycle after 2017, with future competitions to be held in the middle year of the men's World Cup cycle.\nMajor international competitions.\nRugby World Cup.\nThe most important competition in rugby union is the Rugby World Cup, a men's tournament that has taken place every four years since the inaugural event in 1987. South Africa are the reigning champions, having defeated New Zealand 11\u201312 in the final of the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France. South Africa has the highest number of World Cup wins: 4 (1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023). New Zealand won the title three times (1987, 2011 and 2015), Australia have won twice (1991 and 1999), and England once (2003). England is the only team from the Northern Hemisphere to have won the Rugby World Cup.\nThe Rugby World Cup has continued to grow since its inception in 1987. The first tournament, in which 16 teams competed for the title, was broadcast to 17 countries with an accumulated total of 230\u00a0million television viewers. Ticket sales during the pool stages and finals of the same tournament was less than a million. The 2007 World Cup was contested by 94 countries with ticket sales of 3,850,000 over the pool and final stage. The accumulated television audience for the event, then broadcast to 200 countries, was a claimed 4.2\u00a0billion.\nThe 2019 Rugby World Cup took place in Japan between 20 September and 2 November. It was the ninth edition and the first time the tournament has been held in Asia.\nRegional tournaments.\nMajor international competitions are the Six Nations Championship and The Rugby Championship, held in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere respectively.\nThe Six Nations is an annual competition involving the European teams England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Each country plays the other five once. Following the first internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales began competing in the 1880s, forming the \"Home International Championships\". France joined the tournament in the 1900s; in 1910, the term \"Five Nations\" first appeared. However, the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence. France then rejoined in 1939\u20131940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further eight years. France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, the first of which was played in 1947. In 2000, Italy became the sixth nation in the contest and Rome's Stadio Olimpico has replaced Stadio Flaminio as the venue for their home games since 2013.\nThe Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams. From its inception in 1996 through 2011, it was known as the Tri Nations, as it featured the hemisphere's traditional powers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. These teams have dominated world rankings in recent years, and many considered the Tri Nations to be the toughest competition in international rugby. The Tri Nations was initially played on a home and away basis with the three nations playing each other twice.\nIn 2006, a new system was introduced where each nation plays the others three times, though in 2007 and 2011 the teams played each other only twice, as both were World Cup years. Since Argentina's strong performances in the 2007 World Cup, after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) invited the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) to join an expanded Four Nations tournament in 2012. The competition has been officially rechristened as The Rugby Championship beginning with the 2012 edition. The competition reverted to the Tri Nations' original home-and-away format, but now involving four teams. In World Cup years, an abbreviated tournament is held in which each team plays the others only once. In 2020, the \"Tri Nations\" format was temporarily revived due to the withdrawal of South Africa owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRugby within multi-sport events.\nRugby union was played at the Olympic Games in 1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924. As per Olympic rules, the nations of Scotland, Wales and England were not allowed to play separately as they are not sovereign states. In 1900, France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 points to 8 and defeating Germany 27 points to 17. In 1908, Australia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three. In 1920, the United States, fielding a team with many players new to the sport of rugby, upset France in a shock win, eight points to zero. In 1924, the United States again defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport.\nIn 2009, the International Olympic Committee voted with a majority of 81 to 8 that rugby union be reinstated as an Olympic sport in at least the 2016 and 2020 games, but in the sevens, 4-day tournament format. This is something the rugby world has aspired to for a long time and Bernard Lapasset, president of the International Rugby Board, said the Olympic gold medal would be considered to be \"the pinnacle of our sport\" (Rugby Sevens).\nRugby sevens has been played at the Commonwealth Games since the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur. The most gold medal holders are New Zealand who have won the competition on four successive occasions until South Africa beat them in 2014. Rugby union has also been an Asian Games event since the 1998 games in Bangkok, Thailand. In the 1998 and 2002 editions of the games, both the usual fifteen-a-side variety and rugby sevens were played, but from 2006 onwards, only rugby sevens was retained. In 2010, the women's rugby sevens event was introduced. The event is likely to remain a permanent fixture of the Asian Games due to elevation of rugby sevens as an Olympic sport from the 2016 Olympics onwards.\nWomen's international rugby.\nWomen's international rugby union began in 1982, with a match between France and the Netherlands played in Utrecht. As of 2009 over six hundred women's internationals have been played by over forty different nations.\nThe first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Wales in 1991 and was won by the United States. The second tournament took place in 1994, and from that time through 2014 was held every four years. The New Zealand Women's team then won four straight World Cups (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010) before England won in 2014. Following the 2014 event, World Rugby moved the next edition of the event to 2017, with a new four-year cycle from that point forward. New Zealand are the current World Cup holders.\nAs well as the Women's Rugby World Cup, there are also other regular tournaments (including a Six Nations) run in parallel to the men's competition. The Women's Six Nations, first played in 1996 has been dominated by England, who have won the tournament on 14 occasions, including a run of seven consecutive wins from 2006 to 2012. However, since then, England have won only in 2017; reigning champion France have won in each even-numbered year (2014, 2016, 2018) whilst Ireland won in 2013 and 2015.\nProfessional rugby union.\nRugby union has been professionalised since 1995. Professionalism has brought mixed results, with grassroots participation falling and financial struggles in the professional arena. The following table shows professional and semi-professional rugby union competitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVariants.\nRugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side game. The two most common differences in adapted versions are fewer players and reduced player contact.\nThe oldest variant is rugby sevens (sometimes 7s or VIIs), a fast-paced game which originated in Melrose, Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes. Major tournaments include the Hong Kong Sevens and Dubai Sevens, both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game.\nA more recent variant of the sport is rugby tens (10s or Xs), a Malaysian invention with ten players per side.\nTouch rugby, in which \"tackles\" are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular both as a training game and more formally as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults.\nSeveral variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a less physical contact. Mini rugby is a version aimed at fostering the sport in children. It is played with only eight players and on a smaller pitch.\nTag Rugby is a version in which the players wear a belt with two tags attached by velcro, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in that kicking the ball is not allowed. Similar to Tag Rugby, American Flag Rugby, (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9. Both American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ from Tag Rugby in that they introduce more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.\nTen man rugby is a style of play in rugby union in which the team uses the power of its forwards to dominate possession, scrums and line-outs, and the kicking ability of its fly-half to attain position. The four three-quarter backs and the full back are not usually used in attack; if they are, this is usually restricted to the inside centre on the crash ball, and chasing kicks, especially garryowens. Ten man rugby is a very conservative style of play, and not particularly entertaining for the spectator, but can be effective if a team has a strong pack and a good 10, and perhaps less effective backs. The term \"ten man rugby\" is somewhat derogatory, though most teams will employ these tactics to a degree, especially in foul weather, but usually not exclusively.\nOther less formal variants include beach rugby and snow rugby.\nInfluence on other sports.\nRugby league was formed after the Northern Union broke from the Rugby Football Union in a disagreement over payment to players. It went on to change its laws and became a football code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.\nAmerican football and Canadian football are derived from early forms of rugby football.\nAustralian rules football was influenced by rugby football and other games originating in English public schools.\nJames Naismith took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent basketball. The most obvious contribution is the jump ball's similarity to the line-out as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years of the sport. Naismith played rugby at McGill University.\nSwedish football was a code whose rules were a mix of Association and Rugby football rules.\nRugby lends its name to wheelchair rugby, a full-contact sport which contains elements of rugby such as crossing a try line with the ball to score.\nStatistics and records.\nAccording to a 2023 report by the Centre for the International Business of Sport, over ten million people play rugby union or one of its variants organised by the IRB. This is a significant increase since the previous report in 2011. The report also claimed that since 2011 participation has grown by 33 per cent in Africa, 28 per cent in South America and 18 per cent in Asia and North America. In 2023 the IRB published a breakdown of the total number of players worldwide by national unions. It recorded a total of 10.9\u00a0million players globally, of those, 8.4\u00a0million were registered members playing for a club affiliated to their country's union. The 2016 World Rugby Year in Review reported 8.5\u00a0million players, of which 3.2\u00a0million were registered union players and 1.9\u00a0million were registered club players; 22% of all players were female.\nThe most capped international player from the tier 1 nations is Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones who has played over 150 internationals.\nWhile the top scoring tier 1 international player is New Zealand's Dan Carter, who has amassed 1442 points during his career. In April 2010 Lithuania which is a second tier rugby nation, broke the record of consecutive international wins for second tier rugby nations. In 2016, the All Blacks of New Zealand set the new record 18 consecutive test wins among tier 1 rugby nations, bettering their previous consecutive run of 17. This record was equalled by England on 11 March 2017 with a win over Scotland at Twickenham. The highest scoring international match between two recognised unions was Hong Kong's 164\u201313 victory over Singapore on 27 October 1994. While the largest winning margin of 152 points is held by two countries, Japan (a 155\u20133 win over Chinese Taipei) and Argentina (152\u20130 over Paraguay) both in 2002.\nThe record attendance for a rugby union game was set on 15 July 2000 in which New Zealand defeated Australia 39\u201335 in a Bledisloe Cup game at Stadium Australia in Sydney before 109,874 fans. The record attendance for a match in Europe of 104,000 (at the time a world record) was set on 1 March 1975 when Scotland defeated Wales 12\u201310 at Murrayfield in Edinburgh during the 1975 Five Nations Championship. This crowd however is an estimate and contemporaneous newspaper accounts list a crowd of 80,000 only. The record attendance for a domestic club match is 99,124, set when Racing 92 defeated Toulon in the 2016 Top 14 final on 24 June at Camp Nou in Barcelona. The match had been moved from its normal site of Stade de France near Paris due to scheduling conflicts with France's hosting of UEFA Euro 2016. The record attendance for a regular season club fixture is 83,761, set when Harlequins played Saracens at Wembley Stadium during a Premiership game in 2012.\nIn culture.\nThomas Hughes's 1857 novel \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\", set at Rugby School, includes a rugby football match, also portrayed in the 1940s film of the same name. James Joyce mentions Irish team Bective Rangers in several of his works, including \"Ulysses\" (1922) and \"Finnegans Wake\" (1939), while his 1916 semi-autobiographical work \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" has an account of Ireland international James Magee. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his 1924 Sherlock Holmes tale \"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\", mentions that Dr Watson played rugby for Blackheath.\nHenri Rousseau's 1908 work \"Joueurs de football\" shows two pairs of rugby players competing. Other French artists to have represented the sport in their works include Albert Gleizes' (1912), Robert Delaunay's (1916) and Andr\u00e9 Lhote's (1917). The 1928 Gold Medal for Art at the Amsterdam Olympics was won by Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby for his work \"Rugby\".\nIn film, Ealing Studios' 1949 comedy \"A Run for Your Money\" and the 1979 BBC Wales television film \"Grand Slam\" both centre on fans attending a match. Films that explore the sport in more detail include independent production \"Old Scores\" (1991) and \"Forever Strong\" (2008). \"Invictus\" (2009), based on John Carlin's book \"Playing the Enemy\", explores the events of the 1995 Rugby World Cup and Nelson Mandela's attempt to use the sport to connect South Africa's people post-apartheid.\nIn public art and sculpture, there are many works dedicated to the sport. There is a bronze statue of a rugby line-out by pop artist Gerald Laing at Twickenham and one of rugby administrator Sir Tasker Watkins at the Millennium Stadium. Rugby players to have been honoured with statues include Gareth Edwards in Cardiff and Danie Craven in Stellenbosch.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrinted sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nElectronic sources"}
{"id": "25406", "revid": "24013162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25406", "title": "Rugby World Cup", "text": "International men's rugby union competition\nThe Men's Rugby World Cup is a rugby union tournament contested every four years between the top international teams, the winners of which are recognised as the world champions of the sport.\nThe tournament is administered by World Rugby, the sport's international governing body. The winners are awarded the Webb Ellis Cup, named after William Webb Ellis who, according to a popular legend, invented rugby by picking up the ball during a football game and running with it.\nThe tournament was first held in 1987 and was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. Four countries have won the trophy; South Africa four times, New Zealand three times, Australia twice, and England once. South Africa is the current champion, having defeated New Zealand in the final of the 2023 tournament.\nSixteen teams participated in the tournament from 1987 until 1995; in 1999, the tournament expanded to twenty teams. Japan hosted the 2019 Rugby World Cup and France hosted the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The tournament will expand again to twenty-four teams when it is held in Australia in 2027.\nStarting in 2021, the women's equivalent tournament was officially renamed the Rugby World Cup to promote equality with the men's tournament. However, the 2021 event was the only one to use this naming convention as at the end of the 2023 World Cup, World Rugby announced that all future tournaments would include the words \"Men's\" or \"Women's\" in their titles. The first event to use this convention will be the 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup, while the 2027 Men's Rugby World Cup will be the first to include \"Men's\" in its title.\nFormat.\nQualification.\nUnder the current format, 20 teams qualify for each Rugby World Cup. Twelve teams qualify automatically based on their performance in the previous World Cup\u2014the top three teams in each of the four group (pool) stages of the previous tournament qualify for the next tournament as seeded teams. The qualification system for the remaining eight places is region-based, with a total eight teams allocated for Europe, five for Oceania, three for the Americas, two for Africa, and one for Asia. The last place is determined by an intercontinental play-off.\nTournament.\nThe tournament involves twenty nations competing over six weeks in September and October. There are two stages\u2014a pool, followed by a knockout round. Nations are divided into four pools, A through to D, of five nations each. The teams are seeded based on the World Rankings. The four highest-ranked teams are drawn into pools A to D. The next four highest-ranked teams are then drawn into pools A to D, followed by the next four. The remaining positions in each pool are filled by the qualifiers.\nNations play four pool games, playing their respective pool members once each. A bonus points system is used during pool play. If two or more teams are level on points, a system of criteria determines the higher ranked.\nEight teams\u2014the winner and runner-up from each of the four pools\u2014enter the knockout stage. The knockout stage consists of quarter- and semi-finals, and then the final. The winner of each pool is placed against a runner-up of a different pool in a quarter-final. The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals, and the respective winners proceed to the final. Losers of the semi-finals contest for third place, called the 'Bronze Final'. If a match in the knockout stages ends in a draw, the winner is determined through extra time. If that fails, the match goes into sudden death and the next team to score any points is the winner.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nBefore the Rugby World Cup, there was no truly global rugby union competition, but there were a number of other tournaments. One of the oldest is the annual Six Nations Championship, which started in 1883 as the Home Nations Championship, a tournament between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It expanded to the Five Nations in 1910, when France joined the tournament. France did not participate from 1931 to 1939, during which period it reverted to a Home Nations championship. In 2000, Italy joined the competition, which became the Six Nations.\nRugby union was also played at the Summer Olympic Games, first appearing at the 1900 Paris games and subsequently at London in 1908, Antwerp in 1920, and Paris again in 1924. France won the first gold medal, then Australasia, with the last two being won by the United States. However rugby union ceased to be on Olympic program after 1924.\nThe idea of a Rugby World Cup had been suggested on numerous occasions going back to the 1950s, but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB. The idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s, with the Australian Rugby Union (ARU; now known as Rugby Australia) in 1983, and the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU; now known as New Zealand Rugby) in 1984 independently proposing the establishment of a world cup. A proposal was again put to the IRFB in 1985 and this time passed 10\u20136. The delegates from Australia, France, New Zealand and South Africa all voted for the proposal, and the delegates from Ireland and Scotland against; the English and Welsh delegates were split, with one from each country for and one against.\nThe inaugural tournament, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand, was held in May and June 1987, with sixteen nations taking part. The inaugural World Cup in 1987, did not involve any qualifying process; instead, the 16 places were automatically filled by seven eligible International Rugby Football Board (IRFB, now World Rugby) member nations, and the rest by invitation. New Zealand became the first-ever champions, defeating France 29\u20139 in the final. The subsequent 1991 tournament was hosted by England, with matches played throughout Britain, Ireland and France. Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the second tournament, where eight of the sixteen places were contested in a twenty-four-nation tournament. This tournament saw the introduction of a qualifying tournament; eight places were allocated to the quarter-finalists from 1987, and the remaining eight decided by a thirty-five nation qualifying tournament. Australia won the second tournament, defeating England 12\u20136 in the final.\nIn 1992, eight years after their last official series, South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after the dismantling of the apartheid system. With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament and met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15\u201312 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.\nProfessional era.\nThe 1999 tournament was hosted by Wales with matches also being held throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. The tournament included a repechage system, alongside specific regional qualifying places. The number of participating nations was increased from sixteen to twenty\u2014and has remained to date at twenty. Australia claimed their second title, defeating France in the final. The combination of the sport turning professional after 1995 and the increase in teams from sixteen to twenty led to a number of remarkably lopsided results in both the 1999 and 2003 tournaments, with two matches in each tournament resulting in teams scoring over 100 points; Australia's 142\u20130 win over Namibia in 2003 stands as the most lopsided score in Rugby World Cup history.\nIn 2003 and 2007, the qualifying format allowed for eight of the twenty available positions to be automatically filled by the eight quarter-finalists of the previous tournament. The remaining twelve positions were filled by continental qualifying tournaments. Ten positions were filled by teams qualifying directly through continental competitions. Another two places were allocated for a cross-continental repechage.\nThe 2003 event was hosted by Australia, although it was originally intended to be held jointly with New Zealand. England emerged as champions defeating Australia in extra time. England's win broke the southern hemisphere's dominance in the event. Such was the celebration of England's victory that an estimated 750,000 people gathered in central London to greet the team, making the day the largest sporting celebration of its kind ever in the United Kingdom.\nThe 2007 competition was hosted by France, with matches also being held in Wales and Scotland. South Africa claimed their second title by defeating defending champions England 15\u20136. The biggest story of the tournament, however, was Argentina who racked up wins against some of the top European teams\u2014France, Ireland, and Scotland\u2014to finish first in the Pool of death and finish third overall in the tournament. The attention from Argentina's performance led to Argentina participating in SANZAAR and the professionalization of rugby in Argentina.\nThe 2011 tournament was awarded to New Zealand in November 2005, ahead of bids from Japan and South Africa. The All Blacks reclaimed their place atop the rugby world with a narrow 8\u20137 win over France in the 2011 final.\nThe opening weekend of the 2015 tournament, hosted by England, generated the biggest upset in Rugby World Cup history when Japan, who had not won a single World Cup match since 1991, defeated heavily favoured South Africa. Overall, New Zealand once again won the final, this time against Australia. In doing so, they became the first team in World Cup history to win three titles, as well as the first to successfully defend a title.\nJapan's hosting of the 2019 World Cup marked the first time the tournament had been held outside the traditional rugby strongholds; Japan won all four of their pool matches to top their group and qualify to the quarter-finals for the first time. The tournament saw South Africa claim their third trophy to match New Zealand for the most Rugby World Cup titles. South Africa defeated England 32\u201312 in the final.\nStarting in 2021, gender designations were removed from the titles of the men's and women's World Cups. Accordingly, all World Cups for men and women will officially bear the \"Rugby World Cup\" name. The first tournament to be affected by the new policy was the 2022 women's tournament held in New Zealand, which retained its original title of \"Rugby World Cup 2021\" despite having been delayed from its original schedule due to COVID-19 issues.\nFrance hosted the 2023 World Cup. The tournament was won by South Africa, who defeated New Zealand 12\u201311 to become the second nation to successfully defend their World Champion title and the first nation to win the tournament four times.\nTrophy.\nWinners of the Rugby World Cup are presented with the Webb Ellis Cup, named after William Webb Ellis. The trophy is also referred to simply as the \"Rugby World Cup\". The trophy was chosen in 1987 for use in the competition, and was created in 1906 by Garrard's Crown Jewellers. The trophy is restored, repaired and its plinth engraved with the winner's name by Thomas Lyte between tournaments. The words 'The International Rugby Football Board' and 'The Webb Ellis Cup' are engraved on the face of the cup. It stands thirty-eight centimetres high and is silver gilded in gold, and supported by two cast scroll handles, one with the head of a satyr, and the other a head of a nymph. In Australia the trophy is colloquially known as \"Bill\"\u2014a reference to William Webb Ellis.\nSelection of hosts.\nTournaments are organised by Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWCL), which is itself owned by World Rugby. The selection of host is decided by a vote of World Rugby Council members. The voting procedure is managed by a team of independent auditors, and the voting kept secret. The host nation is generally selected five or six years before the competition.\nThe tournament has been hosted by multiple nations. For example, the 1987 tournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. World Rugby requires that the hosts must have a venue with a capacity of at least 60,000 spectators for the final. Host nations sometimes construct or upgrade stadia in preparation for the World Cup, such as Millennium Stadium\u2014purposely built for the 1999 tournament\u2014and Eden Park, upgraded for 2011. The first country outside of the traditional rugby nations of SANZAAR or the Six Nations to be awarded the hosting rights was 2019 host Japan. France hosted the 2023 tournament. The next tournament to be hosted by a nation outside the traditional nations will be the 2031 tournament in the United States.\nTournament growth.\nMedia coverage.\nOrganizers of the Rugby World Cup, as well as the Global Sports Impact, state that the Rugby World Cup is the third largest sporting event in the world, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics, although other sources question whether this is accurate.\nReports emanating from World Rugby and its business partners have frequently touted the tournament's media growth, with cumulative worldwide television audiences of 300 million for the inaugural 1987 tournament, 1.75 billion in 1991, 2.67 billion in 1995, 3 billion in 1999, 3.5 billion in 2003, and 4 billion in 2007. The 4 billion figure was widely dismissed as the global audience for television is estimated to be about 4.2 billion.\nHowever, independent reviews have called into question the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies. The event's supposed drawing power outside of a handful of rugby strongholds was also downplayed significantly, with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million average audience produced by the 2007 final coming from Australasia, South Africa, the British Isles and France. Other sports have been accused of exaggerating their television reach over the years; such claims are not exclusive to the Rugby World Cup.\nWhile the event's global popularity remains a matter of dispute, high interest in traditional rugby nations is well documented. The 2003 final, between Australia and England, became the most watched rugby union match in the history of Australian television. The 2023 tournament achieved 1.33 billion viewing hours across all programming making it the most viewed rugby event of all time.\nRevenue.\nNotes:\nResults.\nPerformance of nations.\nTwenty-five nations have participated at the Rugby World Cup (excluding qualifying tournaments). The only nations to host and win a tournament are New Zealand (1987 and 2011) and South Africa (1995). The performance of other host nations includes England (1991 final hosts) and Australia (2003 hosts) both finishing runners-up, while France (2007 hosts) finished fourth, and Wales (1999 hosts) and Japan (2019 hosts) reached the quarter-finals. Wales became the first host nation to be eliminated at the pool stages in 1991 while England became the first solo host nation to be eliminated at the pool stages in 2015. Of the twenty-five nations that have participated in at least one tournament, ten of them have never missed a tournament.\nQualification results.\nAs of the 2027 World Cup, 27 nations have qualified to compete across 11 tournaments.\nRecords and statistics.\nThe record for most points overall is held by English player Jonny Wilkinson, who scored 277 during his World Cup career. New Zealand All Black Grant Fox holds the record for most points in one competition, with 126 in 1987; Sam Whitelock of New Zealand holds the record for most World Cup matches: 26 between 2011 and 2023. All Black Simon Culhane holds the record for most points in a match by one player, 45, as well as the record for most conversions in a match, 20. All Black Marc Ellis holds the record for most tries in a match, six, which he scored against Japan in 1995.\nNew Zealand's Jonah Lomu is the youngest player to appear in a final\u2014aged 20 years and 43 days in the 1995 final. Lomu (playing in two tournaments) and South African Bryan Habana (playing in three tournaments) share the record for most total World Cup tournament tries, both scoring 15. Lomu (in 1999) and Habana (in 2007) also share the record, along with All Black Julian Savea (in 2015) and Will Jordan (in 2023), for most tries in a tournament, with 8 each. South Africa's Jannie de Beer kicked five drop-goals against England in 1999\u2014an individual record for a single World Cup match. The record for most penalties in a match is 8, held by Australian Matt Burke, Argentinian Gonzalo Quesada, Scotland's Gavin Hastings and France's Thierry Lacroix, with Quesada also holding the record for most penalties in a tournament, with 31.\nThe most points scored in a game is 145, by the All Blacks against Japan in 1995, while the widest winning margin is 142, held by Australia in a match against Namibia in 2003.\nA total of 25 players have been sent off (red carded) in the tournament. Welsh lock Huw Richards was the first, while playing against New Zealand in 1987. No player has been red carded more than once.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no infinite loop or infinite chain of references can occur.\nA process that exhibits recursion is \"recursive\". Video feedback displays recursive images, as does an infinity mirror. \nFormal definitions.\nIn mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibits recursive behavior when it can be defined by two properties:\nFor example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's \"ancestor\". One's ancestor is either:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is another classic example of recursion:\nFib(0) = 0 as base case 1,\nFib(1) = 1 as base case 2,\nFor all integers \"n\" &gt; 1, Fib(\"n\") = Fib(\"n\" \u2212 1) + Fib(\"n\" \u2212 2).\nMany mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the natural numbers by the Peano axioms can be described as: \"Zero is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.\" By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.\nOther recursively defined mathematical objects include factorials, functions (e.g., recurrence relations), sets (e.g., Cantor ternary set), and fractals.\nThere are various more tongue-in-cheek definitions of recursion; see recursive humor.\nInformal definition.\nRecursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.\nTo understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules, while the running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps.\nRecursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure.\nWhen a procedure is thus defined, this immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete.\nEven if it is properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old, partially executed invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration as to how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason, recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations.\nIn language.\nLinguist Noam Chomsky, among many others, has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language.\nThis can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: \"Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous\", in which the sentence \"witches are dangerous\" occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.\nThis provides a way of understanding the creativity of language\u2014the unbounded number of grammatical sentences\u2014because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: \"Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...\". There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.\nThe generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by Daniel Everett on the basis of his claims about the Pirah\u00e3 language. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this. Literary self-reference can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.\nRecursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in natural language semantics. The word \"and\", for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, \"and\" is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one.\nA recursive grammar is a formal grammar that contains recursive production rules.\nRecursive humor.\nRecursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a circular definition or self-reference, in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an infinite regress. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their glossary along the lines of:\nRecursion, \"see Recursion\".\nA variation is found on page 269 in the index of some editions of Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book \"The C Programming Language\"; the index entry recursively refers to itself (\"recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269\"). Early versions of this joke can be found in \"Let's talk Lisp\" by Laurent Sikl\u00f3ssy (published by Prentice Hall PTR on December 1, 1975, with a copyright date of 1976) and in \"Software Tools\" by Kernighan and Plauger (published by Addison-Wesley Professional on January 11, 1976). The joke also appears in \"The UNIX Programming Environment\" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of \"The C Programming Language\". The joke is part of the functional programming folklore and was already widespread in the functional programming community before the publication of the aforementioned books.\nAnother joke is that \"To understand recursion, you must understand recursion.\" In the English-language version of the Google web search engine, when a search for \"recursion\" is made, the site suggests \"Did you mean: \"recursion\".\" An alternative form is the following, from Andrew Plotkin: \"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to Douglas Hofstadter than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is.\"\nRecursive acronyms are other examples of recursive humor. PHP, for example, stands for \"PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\", WINE stands for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator\", GNU stands for \"GNU's not Unix\", and SPARQL denotes the \"SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language\".\nIn mathematics.\nRecursively defined sets.\nExample: the natural numbers.\nThe canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the natural numbers:\n0 is in formula_1\nif \"n\" is in formula_1, then \"n\" + 1 is in formula_1\nThe set of natural numbers is the smallest set satisfying the previous two properties.\nIn mathematical logic, the Peano axioms (or Peano postulates or Dedekind\u2013Peano axioms), are axioms for the natural numbers presented in the 19th century by the German mathematician Richard Dedekind and by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. The Peano Axioms define the natural numbers referring to a recursive successor function and addition and multiplication as recursive functions.\nExample: Proof procedure.\nAnother interesting example is the set of all \"provable\" propositions in an axiomatic system that are defined in terms of a proof procedure which is inductively (or recursively) defined as follows:\nFinite subdivision rules.\nFinite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create fractal-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the Cantor set is a subdivision rule, as is barycentric subdivision.\nFunctional recursion.\nA function may be recursively defined in terms of itself. A familiar example is the Fibonacci number sequence: \"F\"(\"n\") = \"F\"(\"n\" \u2212 1) + \"F\"(\"n\" \u2212 2). For such a definition to be useful, it must be reducible to non-recursively defined values: in this case \"F\"(0) = 0 and \"F\"(1) = 1.\nProofs involving recursive definitions.\nApplying the standard technique of proof by cases to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields structural induction \u2014 a powerful generalization of mathematical induction widely used to derive proofs in mathematical logic and computer science.\nRecursive optimization.\nDynamic programming is an approach to optimization that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the Bellman equation, which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).\nThe recursion theorem.\nIn set theory, this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist. Given a set X, an element a of X and a function \"f\": \"X\" \u2192 \"X\", the theorem states that there is a unique function formula_4 (where formula_5 denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that\nformula_6\nformula_7\nfor any natural number n.\nDedekind was the first to pose the problem of unique definition of set-theoretical functions on formula_8 by recursion, and gave a sketch of an argument in the 1888 essay \"Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?\" \nProof of uniqueness.\nTake two functions formula_4 and formula_10 such that:\nformula_6\nformula_12\nformula_7\nformula_14\nwhere a is an element of X.\nIt can be proved by mathematical induction that \"F\"(\"n\") = \"G\"(\"n\") for all natural numbers \nn:\nBase Case: \"F\"(0) = \"a\" = \"G\"(0) so the equality holds for \"n\" = 0.\nInductive Step: Suppose \"F\"(\"k\") = \"G\"(\"k\") for some formula_15. Then \"F\"(\"k\" + 1) = \"f\"(\"F\"(\"k\")) = \"f\"(\"G\"(\"k\")) = \"G\"(\"k\" + 1).\nHence \"F\"(\"k\") = \"G\"(\"k\") implies \"F\"(\"k\" + 1) = \"G\"(\"k\" + 1).\nBy induction, \"F\"(\"n\") = \"G\"(\"n\") for all formula_16.\nIn computer science.\nA common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a computer programming technique, this is called divide and conquer and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is dynamic programming. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.\nA classic example of recursion is the definition of the factorial function, given here in Python code:\ndef factorial(n):\n if n &gt; 0:\n return n * factorial(n - 1)\n else:\n return 1 \nThe function calls itself recursively on a smaller version of the input and multiplies the result of the recursive call by , until reaching the base case, analogously to the mathematical definition of factorial.\nRecursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in parsers for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.\nRecurrence relations are equations which define one or more sequences recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be \"solved\" to obtain a non-recursive definition (e.g., a closed-form expression).\nUse of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is usually the simplicity of instructions. The main disadvantage is that the memory usage of recursive algorithms may grow very quickly, rendering them impractical for larger instances.\nIn biology.\nShapes that seem to have been created by recursive processes sometimes appear in plants and animals, such as in branching structures in which one large part branches out into two or more similar smaller parts. One example is Romanesco broccoli.\nIn the social sciences.\nAuthors use the concept of \"recursivity\" to foreground the situation in which specifically \"social\" scientists find themselves when producing knowledge about the world they are always already part of. According to Audrey Alejandro, \u201cas social scientists, the recursivity of our condition deals with the fact that we are both subjects (as discourses are the medium through which we analyse) and objects of the academic discourses we produce (as we are social agents belonging to the world we analyse).\u201d From this basis, she identifies in recursivity a fundamental challenge in the production of emancipatory knowledge which calls for the exercise of reflexive efforts:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;we are socialised into discourses and dispositions produced by the socio-political order we aim to challenge, a socio-political order that we may, therefore, reproduce unconsciously while aiming to do the contrary. The recursivity of our situation as scholars \u2013 and, more precisely, the fact that the dispositional tools we use to produce knowledge about the world are themselves produced by this world \u2013 both evinces the vital necessity of implementing reflexivity in practice and poses the main challenge in doing so.\u2014\u200a\nIn business.\nRecursion is sometimes referred to in management science as the process of iterating through levels of abstraction in large business entities. A common example is the recursive nature of management hierarchies, ranging from line management to senior management\u00a0via middle management. It also encompasses the larger issue of capital structure in corporate governance.\nIn art.\nThe Matryoshka doll is a physical artistic example of the recursive concept.\nRecursion has been used in paintings since Giotto's \"Stefaneschi Triptych\", made in 1320. Its central panel contains the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych itself as an offering. This practice is more generally known as the Droste effect, an example of the Mise en abyme technique.\nM. C. Escher's \"Print Gallery\" (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city containing a gallery which recursively contains the picture, and so \"ad infinitum\".\nIn culture.\nThe film \"Inception\" has colloquialized the appending of the suffix \"-ception\" to a noun to jokingly indicate the recursion of something.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25408", "revid": "50335409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25408", "title": "Robert Byrd", "text": "American politician (1917\u20132010)\nRobert Carlyle Byrd (born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr.; November 20, 1917 \u2013 June 28, 2010) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from West Virginia for over 51 years, from 1959 until his death in 2010. A Democrat, Byrd also served as a U.S. representative for six years, from 1953 until 1959. He remains the longest-serving U.S. senator in history; he was the longest-serving member in the history of the United States Congress until surpassed by Representative John Dingell of Michigan. Byrd is the only West Virginian to have served in both chambers of the state legislature and in both chambers of Congress.\nByrd's political career spanned more than sixty years. He first entered the political arena by organizing and leading a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s, an action he later described as \"the greatest mistake I ever made\". He then served in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1947 to 1950, and the West Virginia State Senate from 1950 to 1952. Initially elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1952, Byrd served there for six years before being elected to the Senate in 1958. He rose to become one of the Senate's most powerful members, serving as secretary of the Senate Democratic Caucus from 1967 to 1971 and\u2014after defeating his longtime colleague Ted Kennedy for the job\u2014as Senate Majority Whip from 1971 to 1977. Over the next 12 years, Byrd led the Democratic caucus as Senate Majority Leader and Senate Minority Leader. In 1989, he stepped down, following the pressure to make way for new party leadership. As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd held the position of President pro tempore four times when his party was in the majority. This placed him third in the line of presidential succession, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\nByrd became West Virginia\u2019s Senior Senator in 1985 following the retirement of Jennings Randolph. He served three different tenures as chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations, which enabled Byrd to steer a great deal of federal money toward projects in West Virginia. Critics derided his efforts as pork barrel spending, while Byrd argued that the many federal projects he worked to bring to West Virginia represented progress for the people of his state. Notably, Byrd strongly opposed Clinton's 1993 efforts to allow homosexuals to serve in the military and supported efforts to limit same-sex marriage. Although he filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and supported the Vietnam War earlier in his career, Byrd's views changed considerably over the course of his life; by the early 2000s, he had completely renounced racism and segregation. Byrd was outspoken in his opposition to the Iraq War. Renowned for his knowledge of Senate precedent and parliamentary procedure, Byrd wrote a four-volume history of the Senate in later life. Near the end of his life, Byrd was in declining health and was hospitalized several times. He died in office on June 28, 2010, at the age of 92, and was buried at Columbia Gardens Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.\nBackground.\nRobert Byrd was born on November 20, 1917, as Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, to Cornelius Calvin Sale and his wife Ada Mae (Kirby). When he was ten months old, his mother died on Armistice Day during the 1918 flu pandemic. Byrd was the youngest of four and in accordance with his mother's wishes, his father dispersed the children among relatives. Calvin Jr. was adopted by his biological father's sister and her husband, Vlurma and Titus Byrd, who changed his name to Robert Carlyle Byrd and raised him in the coal mining region of southern West Virginia, primarily in the coal town of Stotesbury, West Virginia. Robert Byrd's biological father Calvin Sale went on to have four more children with his second wife, Ola (Pruitt) Sale.\nByrd was educated in the public schools of Stotesbury. Byrd played the violin at the Mark Twain School orchestra and the bass drum in the Mark Twain High School marching band. He was the valedictorian of his 1934 graduating class at Stotesbury's Mark Twain High School.\nMarriage and children.\nOn May 29, 1937, Byrd married Erma Ora James (June 12, 1917 \u2013 March 25, 2006) who was born to a coal mining family in Floyd County, Virginia. Her family moved to Raleigh County, West Virginia, where she met Byrd when they attended the same high school.\nRobert Byrd had two daughters (Mona Byrd Fatemi and Marjorie Byrd Moore), six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.\nKu Klux Klan.\nIn the early 1940s, Byrd recruited 150 of his friends and associates to create a new chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in Sophia, West Virginia.\nAs a young boy, Byrd had witnessed his adoptive father walk in a Klan parade in Matoaka, West Virginia. While growing up, Byrd had heard that \"the Klan defended the American way of life against racemixers and communists\". He then wrote to Joel L. Baskin, Grand Dragon of the Realm of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, who responded that he would come and organize a chapter when Byrd had recruited 150 people.\nIt was Baskin who told Byrd, \"You have a talent for leadership, Bob\u00a0\u2026 The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation\". Byrd later recalled, \"Suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone important had recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought of a political career had never really hit me. But strike me that night, it did\". Byrd became a recruiter and leader of his chapter. When it came time to elect the top officer (Exalted Cyclops) in the local Klan unit, Byrd won unanimously. Despite his later claim to have only been a KKK member for a year, documents indicate that Byrd joined the KKK around 1941, and a 1946 letter to Samuel Green indicates that Byrd was a Klan member until at least 1946.\nIn December 1944, Byrd wrote to segregationist Mississippi Senator Theodore G. Bilbo:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side\u00a0... Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.\nIn 1946, Byrd wrote a letter to Samuel Green, the Ku Klux Klan's Grand Wizard, stating, \"The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia and in every state in the nation\". The same year, he was encouraged to run for the West Virginia House of Delegates by the Klan's grand dragon; Byrd won, and took his seat in January 1947. However, during his campaign for the United States House of Representatives in 1952, he announced that, \"after about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization\", and that during the nine years that have followed, he had never been interested in the Klan. He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was anti-communist, but also suggested his participation there \"reflected the fears and prejudices\" of the time.\nByrd later called joining the KKK \"the greatest mistake I ever made\". In 1997, he told an interviewer he would encourage young people to become involved in politics but also warned, \"Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena\". In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he \"was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision\u2014 a jejune and immature outlook\u2014seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions\". Byrd also said in 2005, \"I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times \u2026 and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened\". However, in a 2005 book, Byrd claimed that the Klan had been made of \"upstanding people\" like lawyers, judges, clergy and doctors.\nEarly career.\nByrd worked as a gas station attendant, grocery store clerk, and butcher. During World War II, he worked as a welder in shipyards in Baltimore and Tampa. After returning to West Virginia, he bought a grocery store in Sophia. In 1946, he won a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates, representing Raleigh County from 1947 to 1950. Byrd became a local celebrity after a radio station in Beckley began broadcasting his \"fiery fundamentalist lessons\". In 1950, he was elected to the West Virginia Senate, where he served from December 1950 to December 1952.\nIn 1951, Byrd was among the official witnesses of the execution of Harry Burdette and Fred Painter, which was the first use of the electric chair in West Virginia. In 1965 the state abolished capital punishment, with the last execution having occurred in 1959.\nContinued education.\nEarly in his career Byrd attended Beckley College, Concord College, Morris Harvey College, Marshall College, and George Washington University Law School, and joined the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.\nByrd began night classes at American University Washington College of Law in 1953, while a member of the United States House of Representatives. He earned his Juris Doctor degree \"cum laude\" a decade later, by which time he was a U.S. Senator. President John F. Kennedy spoke at the commencement ceremony on June 10, 1963, and presented the graduates their diplomas, including Byrd. Byrd completed law school in an era when only three years of undergraduate education were required. He later decided to complete his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, and in 1994 he graduated \"summa cum laude\" from Marshall University.\nCongressional service.\nIn 1952, Byrd was elected to the United States House of Representatives for West Virginia's 6th congressional district, succeeding E. H. Hedrick, who retired from the House to make an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for governor. Byrd was re-elected twice from this district, anchored in Charleston and also including his home in Sophia, serving from January 3, 1953, to January 3, 1959. Byrd defeated Republican incumbent W. Chapman Revercomb for the United States Senate in 1958. Revercomb's record supporting civil rights had become an issue, playing in Byrd's favor. Byrd was re-elected to the Senate eight times. He was West Virginia's junior senator for his first four terms; his colleague from 1959 to 1985 was Jennings Randolph, who had been elected on the same day as Byrd's first election in a special election to fill the seat of the late Senator Matthew Neely.\nDespite his tremendous popularity in the state, Byrd ran unopposed only once, in 1976. On three other occasions\u2014in 1970, 1994 and 2000\u2014he won all 55 of West Virginia's counties. In his re-election bid in 2000, he won all but seven precincts. Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito, the daughter of one of Byrd's longtime foes, former governor Arch Moore Jr., briefly considered a challenge to Byrd in 2006 but decided against it. Capito's district covered much of the territory Byrd had represented in the U.S. House.\nIn the 1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Byrd\u2014a close Senate ally of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2014endorsed and campaigned for Hubert Humphrey over front-runner John F. Kennedy in the state's crucial primary. However, Kennedy won the state's primary and eventually the general election.\nPublic service records.\nByrd was elected to a record ninth consecutive full Senate term in the November 7, 2006, midterm elections. He became the longest-serving senator in American history on June 12, 2006, surpassing Strom Thurmond of South Carolina with 17,327 days of service. On November 18, 2009, Byrd became the longest-serving member in congressional history, with 56 years, 320 days of combined service in the House and Senate, passing Carl Hayden of Arizona. Previously, Byrd had held the record for the longest unbroken tenure in the Senate (Thurmond resigned during his first term and was re-elected seven months later). He is the only senator ever to serve more than 50 years. Including his tenure as a state legislator from 1947 to 1953, Byrd's service on the political front exceeded 60 continuous years. Byrd, who never lost an election, cast his 18,000th vote on June 21, 2007, the most of any senator in history. John Dingell broke Byrd's record as longest-serving member of Congress on June 7, 2013.\nUpon the death of former Florida Senator George Smathers on January 20, 2007, Byrd became the last living United States senator from the 1950s.\nHaving taken part in the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the union, Byrd was the last surviving senator to have voted on a bill granting statehood to a U.S. territory. At the time of Byrd's death, 14 sitting or former members of the Senate had not been born when Byrd's tenure in the Senate began, as well as then-President Barack Obama.\nCommittee assignments.\nThese are the committee assignments for Sen. Byrd's 9th and final term.\nFilibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nByrd was a member of the wing of the Democratic Party that opposed federally-mandated desegregation and civil rights. However, despite his early career in the KKK, Byrd was linked to such senators as John C. Stennis, J. William Fulbright and George Smathers, who based their segregationist positions on their view of states' rights in contrast to senators like James Eastland, who held a reputation as a committed racist.\nByrd joined with Southern Democratic senators to filibuster the Civil Rights Act of 1964, personally filibustering the bill for 14 hours, a move he later said he regretted. Despite an 83-day filibuster in the Senate, both parties in Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Act (Democrats 47\u201316, Republicans 30\u20132) with Byrd voting against, and President Johnson would later sign the bill into law. He did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Byrd voted in favor of the initial House resolution for the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on June 18, 1957, but voted against the Senate amendment to the bill on August 27, 1957. Byrd voted against the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as well as the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968. In 1983, Byrd voted in favor of making Martin Luther King Day a national holiday. In 2005, Byrd told \"The Washington Post\" that his membership in the Baptist church led to a change in his views. In the opinion of one reviewer, Byrd, like other Southern and border-state Democrats, came to realize that he would have to temper \"his blatantly segregationist views\" and move to the Democratic Party mainstream if he wanted to play a role nationally.\nVietnam.\nIn February 1968, Byrd questioned Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Earle Wheeler during the latter's testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. During a White House meeting between President Johnson and congressional Democratic leaders on February 6, Byrd stated his concern for the ongoing Vietnam War, citing the U.S.'s lack of intelligence, preparation, underestimating of the morale and vitality of the Viet Cong, and overestimated how backed Americans would be by South Vietnam.\nPresident Johnson rejected Byrd's observations. \"Anyone can kick a barn down. It takes a good carpenter to build one\".\n1968 presidential election.\nDuring the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Byrd supported the incumbent president Johnson. Of the challenging Robert F. Kennedy, Byrd said, \"Bobby-come-lately has made a mistake. I won't even listen to him. There are many who liked his brother\u2014as Bobby will find out\u2014but who don't like him\". Byrd praised Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's police response to protest activity at that year's Democratic National Convention, stating that the violence that resulted was the fault of the protesters, while the police only tried to restore order. Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the presidential nomination, and Byrd campaigned for him that fall.\nLeadership roles.\nByrd served in the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become Majority Whip, the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, \"Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson\". Byrd himself had told Smathers that \"I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have\u2014believe it or not\u2014never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life. And every time you told me about swimming, I don't know how to swim\".\nIn the 1976 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Byrd was the \"favorite son\" presidential candidate in West Virginia's primary. His easy victory gave him control of the delegation to the Democratic National Convention. Byrd had the inside track as Majority Whip but focused most of his time running for Majority Leader, more so than for re-election to the Senate, as he was virtually unopposed for his fourth term. By the time the vote for Majority Leader came, his lead was so secure that his lone rival, Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, withdrew before the balloting took place. From 1977 to 1989 Byrd was the leader of the Senate Democrats, serving as Majority Leader from 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 1989, and as Minority Leader from 1981 to 1987.\nAppropriations Committee.\nByrd was known for steering federal dollars to West Virginia, one of the country's poorest states. He was called the \"King of Pork\" by Citizens Against Government Waste. After becoming chair of the Appropriations Committee in 1989, Byrd set a goal securing a total of $1 billion for public works in the state. He passed that mark in 1991, and funds for highways, dams, educational institutions, and federal agency offices flowed unabated over the course of his membership. More than 30 existing or pending federal projects bear his name. He commented on his reputation for attaining funds for projects in West Virginia in August 2006, when he called himself \"Big Daddy\" at the dedication for the Robert C. Byrd Biotechnology Science Center. Examples of this ability to claim funds and projects for his state include the Federal Bureau of Investigation's repository for computerized fingerprint records as well as several United States Coast Guard computing and office facilities.\nParliamentary expertise.\nByrd was also known for using his knowledge of parliamentary procedure. Byrd frustrated Republicans with his encyclopedic knowledge of the inner workings of the Senate, particularly prior to the Reagan Era. From 1977 to 1979 he was described as \"performing a procedural tap dance around the minority, outmaneuvering Republicans with his mastery of the Senate's arcane rules\". In 1988, majority leader Byrd moved a call of the Senate, which was adopted by the majority present, in order to have the Sergeant-at-Arms arrest members not in attendance. One member (Robert Packwood, R-Oregon) was carried feet-first back to the chamber by the Sergeant-at-Arms in order to obtain a quorum.\nPresident pro tempore.\nAs the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd served as President pro tempore four times when his party was in the majority: from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and outgoing Vice President Al Gore broke the tie in favor of the Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, as a result of the 2006 Senate elections. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nScholarships and TAH History Grants.\nIn 1969, Byrd launched a Scholastic Recognition Award; he also began to present a savings bond to valedictorians from high schools\u2014public and private\u2014in West Virginia. In 1985 Congress approved the nation's only merit-based scholarship program funded through the U.S. Department of Education, a program which Congress later named in Byrd's honor. The Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program initially comprised a one-year, $1,500 award to students with \"outstanding academic achievement\" who had been accepted at a college or university. In 1993, the program began providing four-year scholarships.\nIn 2002 Byrd secured unanimous approval for a major national initiative to strengthen the teaching of \"traditional American history\" in K-12 public schools. The Department of Education competitively awards $50 to $120 million a year to school districts (in amounts of about $500,000 to $1 million). The money goes to teacher training programs that are geared to improving the knowledge of history teachers. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 eliminated funding for the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program.\nSenate historian.\nTelevision cameras were first introduced to the House of Representatives on March 19, 1979, by C-SPAN. Unsatisfied that Americans only saw Congress as the House of Representatives, Byrd and others pushed to televise Senate proceedings to prevent the Senate from becoming the \"invisible branch\" of government, succeeding in June 1986.\nTo help introduce the public to the inner workings of the legislative process, Byrd launched a series of one hundred speeches based on his examination of the Roman Republic and the intent of the Framers. Byrd published a four-volume series on Senate history: \"The Senate: 1789\u20131989: Addresses on the History of the Senate\". The first volume won the Henry Adams Prize of the Society for History in the Federal Government as \"an outstanding contribution to research in the history of the Federal Government\". He also published \"The Senate of the Roman Republic: Addresses on the History of Roman Constitutionalism\".\nIn 2004, Byrd received the American Historical Association's first Theodore Roosevelt-Woodrow Wilson Award for Civil Service; in 2007, Byrd received the Friend of History Award from the Organization of American Historians. Both awards honor individuals outside the academy who have made a significant contribution to the writing and/or presentation of history. In 2014, The Byrd Center for Legislative Studies (now the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education began assessing the archiving of Senator Byrd's electronic correspondence and floor speeches in order to preserve these documents and make them available to the wider community.\nFinal-term Senate highlights.\nOn July 19, 2007, Byrd gave a 25-minute speech in the Senate against dog fighting in response to the indictment of football player Michael Vick.\nFor 2007, Byrd was deemed the 14th-most powerful senator, as well as the 12th-most powerful Democratic senator.\nOn May 19, 2008, Byrd endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama for president. One week after the 2008 West Virginia Democratic presidential primary, in which Hillary Clinton defeated Obama by 67 to 25 percent, Byrd said, \"Barack Obama is a noble-hearted patriot and humble Christian, and he has my full faith and support\". When asked in October 2008 about the possibility that the issue of race would influence West Virginia voters, as Obama is African American, Byrd replied, \"Those days are gone. Gone!\" Obama lost West Virginia (by 13%) but won the election.\nOn January 26, 2009, Byrd was one of three Democrats to vote against the confirmation of Timothy Geithner as United States Secretary of the Treasury (along with Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Tom Harkin of Iowa).\nOn February 26, 2009, Byrd was one of two Democrats to vote against the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009, which if it had become law would have added a voting seat in the United States House of Representatives for the District of Columbia and add a seat for Utah, explaining that he supported the intent of the legislation, but regarded it as an attempt to solve with legislation an issue which required resolution with a Constitutional amendment. (Democrat Max Baucus of Montana also cast a \"nay\" vote.)\nAlthough his health was poor, Byrd was present for every crucial vote during the December 2009 healthcare debate in the United States Senate; his vote was deemed essential so Democrats could obtain cloture to break a Republican filibuster. At the final vote on December 24, 2009, Byrd referenced recently deceased Senator Ted Kennedy, a devoted proponent, when casting his vote: \"Mr. President, this is for my friend Ted Kennedy! Aye!\"\nPolitical views.\nRace.\nByrd initially compiled a mixed record on the subjects of race relations and desegregation. While he initially voted against civil rights legislation, in 1959 he hired one of the Capitol's first Black congressional aides, and he also took steps to integrate the United States Capitol Police for the first time since the Reconstruction Era. Beginning in the 1970s, Byrd explicitly renounced his earlier support of racial segregation. Byrd said that he regretted filibustering and voting against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would change it if he had the opportunity. Byrd also said that his views changed dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident, which put him in a deep emotional valley. \"The death of my grandson caused me to stop and think,\" said Byrd, adding he came to realize that African Americans love their children and grandchildren as much as he loved his. During debate in 1983 over the passage of the law creating the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, Byrd grasped the symbolism of the day and its significance to his legacy, telling members of his staff \"I'm the only one in the Senate who \"must\" vote for this bill\".\nOf the seven U.S. Senate members to vote on the confirmations of both Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court (the others being Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, Quentin Burdick of North Dakota, Mark Hatfield of Oregon, and Fritz Hollings and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina), Byrd was the only U.S. Senate member to vote against confirming both of the first two African-American nominees to the Court in its history. In Marshall's case, Byrd asked FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to look into the possibility that Marshall had either connections to communists or a communist past. With respect to Thomas, Byrd stated that he was offended by Thomas's use of the phrase \"high-tech lynching of uppity blacks\" in his defense and that he was \"offended by the injection of racism\" into the hearing. He called Thomas's comments a \"diversionary tactic\" and said, \"I thought we were past that stage\". Regarding Anita Hill's sexual harassment charges against Thomas, Byrd supported Hill. Byrd joined 45 other Democrats in voting against confirming Thomas to the Supreme Court.\nOn March 29, 1968, Byrd criticized a Memphis, Tennessee, protest: \"It was a shameful and totally uncalled for outburst of lawlessness undoubtedly encouraged to some considerable degree, at least, by his [Dr. King's] words and actions, and his presence. There is no reason for us to believe that the same destructive rioting and violence cannot, or that it will not, happen here if King attempts his so-called Poor People's March, for what he plans in Washington appears to be something on a far greater scale than what he had indicated he planned to do in Memphis\".\nIn a March 2, 2001, interview with Tony Snow, Byrd said of race relations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They're much, much better than they've ever been in my life-time\u00a0... I think we talk about race too much. I think those problems are largely behind us\u00a0... I just think we talk so much about it that we help to create somewhat of an illusion. I think we try to have good will. My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time, if you want to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.\nByrd's use of the term \"white nigger\" created immediate controversy. When asked about it, Byrd's office provided this in a written response,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I apologize for the characterization I used on this program\u00a0... The phrase dates back to my boyhood and has no place in today's society\u00a0... In my attempt to articulate strongly held feelings, I have offended people that I never intended to offend.\nFor the 2003\u20132004 session, the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) rated Byrd's voting record as being 100% in line with the NAACP's position on the thirty-three Senate bills they evaluated. Sixteen other senators received that rating. In June 2005, Byrd proposed an additional $10,000,000 in federal funding for the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C., remarking that, \"With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his Dream was the American Dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently\". Upon news of his death, the NAACP released a statement praising Byrd, saying that he \"became a champion for civil rights and liberties\" and \"came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda\".\nClinton impeachment.\nByrd initially said that the impeachment proceedings against Clinton should be taken seriously. Although he harshly criticized any attempt to make light of the allegations, he made the motion to dismiss the charges and effectively end the matter. Even though he voted against both articles of impeachment, he was the sole Democrat to vote to censure Clinton.\nLGBT rights.\nByrd strongly opposed Clinton's 1993 efforts to allow homosexuals to serve in the military and supported efforts to limit same-sex marriage. In 1996, before the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act, he said, \"The drive for same-sex marriage is, in effect, an effort to make a sneak attack on society by encoding this aberrant behavior in legal form before society itself has decided it should be legal. [\u2026] Let us defend the oldest institution, the institution of marriage between male and female as set forth in the Holy Bible\".\nDespite his previous position, he later stated his opposition to the Federal Marriage Amendment and argued that it was unnecessary because the states already had the power to ban gay marriages. However, when the amendment came to the Senate floor, he was one of the two Democratic senators who voted in favor of cloture.\nAbortion.\nOn March 11, 1982, Byrd voted against a measure sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch that sought to reverse \"Roe v. Wade\" and allow Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortions. Its passing was the first time a congressional committee supported an anti-abortion amendment.\nIn 1995, Byrd voted against a ban on intact dilation and extraction, a late-term abortion procedure typically referred to by its opponents as \"partial-birth abortion\". In 2003, however, he voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which prohibits intact dilation and extraction. Byrd also voted against the 2004 Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which recognizes a \"child in utero\" as a legal victim if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of a crime of violence.\nRichard Nixon era.\nIn April 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a plan to replace the United States Electoral College with direct elections of presidents. Byrd initially opposed direct elections on the key vote and was one of two senators to switch votes in favor of the proposal during later votes.\nIn April 1970, as the Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Supreme Court nominee Harry Blackmun, Byrd stated that \"no nomination should be voted on within 24 hours after the hearing\" after the previous two Supreme Court nominees had delays and was one of the 17 committee members who went on record of assuring Blackmun's nomination would be reported favorably to the full Senate.\nIn October 1970, Byrd sponsored an amendment protecting members of Congress and those elected that have not yet assumed office. Byrd mentioned the 88 political assassinations in the United States and said state law was not adequate to handle the increase in political violence.\nIn February 1971, after Fred R. Harris and Charles Mathias requested the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration change the rules to permit selection of committee chairmen on a basis aside from seniority, Byrd indicated through his line of questioning that he saw considerable value in the seniority system.\nIn April 1971, after Representative Hale Boggs stated that he had been tapped by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and called on FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to resign, Byrd opined that Boggs' imagination was involved and called on him to reveal any possible \"good, substantial, bona fide evidence\".\nIn April 1971, Byrd met with President Nixon, Hugh Scott, and Robert P. Griffin for a briefing that after which Byrd, Scott, and Griffin asserted they had been told by Nixon of his intent to withdraw American forces from Indochina by a specific date. White House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler disputed their claims by stating that the three had not been told anything by Nixon he had not mentioned in his speech the same day as the meeting.\nIn April 1971, Jacob Javits, Fred R. Harris, and Charles H. Percy circulated letters to their fellow senators in an attempt to gain cosponsors for a resolution to appoint the Senate's first girl pages. Byrd maintained that the Senate was ill-equipped for girl pages and was among those that cited the long hours of work, the carrying of sometimes heavy documents and the high crime rate in the Capitol area as among the reasons against it.\nIn September 1971, Representative Richard H. Poff was under consideration by President Nixon for a Supreme Court nomination, Byrd warning Poff that his nomination could be met with opposition by liberal senators and see a filibuster emerge. Within hours, Poff announced his declining of the nomination.\nIn April 1972, Senate Majority Leader Mansfield announced that he had authorized Byrd to present an amendment to the Senate for a fixed deadline for total troop withdrawal that the Nixon administration would be obligated to meet and that the measure would serve as an amendment to the State Department\u2010United States Information Agency authorization bill.\nIn April 1972, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination of Richard Kleindienst as United States Attorney General, Byrd being one of four Democrats to support the nomination. On June 7, Byrd announced that he would vote against Kleindienst, saying in a news release that this was Nixon's first nomination that he had not voted to confirm and that testimony at hearings investigating Kleindienst's tenure at ITT Inc. displayed \"a show of arrogance and deception and insensitivity to the people's right to know\". During the confirmation hearings of Kleindienst's successor Elliot Richardson, Byrd insisted on the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Watergate scandal as a condition for his appointment, eventually leading to the Archibald Cox investigation.\nIn a May 1972 luncheon speech, Byrd criticized American newspapers for \"an increasing tendency toward shoddy technical production\" and observed that there was \"a greater schism between the Nixon Administration and the media, at least publicly, than at any previous time in our history\".\nIn May 1972, Byrd introduced a proposal supported by the Nixon administration that would make cutting off all funding for American hostilities in Indochina conditional upon agreement on an internationally supervised cease\u2010fire. Byrd and Nixon supporters argued modification would bring the amendment more in line with President Nixon's proposal to withdraw all American forces from Vietnam the previous week and it was approved in the Senate by a vote of 47 to 43.\nIn September 1972, Edward Brooke attempted to reintroduce his war ending amendment that had been defeated earlier in the week as an addendum to a clean drinking water bill when he discovered that Byrd had arranged a unanimous consent free agreement prohibiting amendments that were not relevant to the subject. Brooke charged the Byrd agreements with impairing his senatorial prerogatives to introduce amendments.\nDuring the 1972 general election campaign, Democratic nominee George McGovern advocated for partial amnesty for draft dodges. Byrd responded to the position in a November speech the day before the election without mentioning McGovern by name in saying, \"How could we keep faith with the thousands of Americans we sent to Vietnam by giving a mere tap on the wrist to those who fled to Canada and Sweden?\" Byrd said the welfare proposals were part of \"pernicious doctrine that the Federal Government owes a living to people who don't want to work\" and chastised individuals that had personal trips to Hanoi rather than official missions as \"the Ramsey Clarks in our society who attempt to deal unilaterally with the enemy\".\nIn January 1973, the Senate passed legislation containing an amendment Byrd offered requiring President Nixon to give Congress an accounting of all funds that he had impounded and appropriated by February 5. Byrd stated that President Nixon had been required to submit reports to Congress and that he had not done so since June, leaving Congress in the dark on the matter.\nIn February 1973, the Senate approved legislation requiring confirmation of the director and deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the White House in what was seen as \"another battleground for the dispute between Congress and the White House over cuts in social spending programs in the current Federal budget and in the Nixon Administration's spending request for the fiscal year 1974, which begins next July 1\". The legislation contained an amendment sponsored by Byrd limiting the budget officials to a maximum term of four years before having another confirmation proceeding. Byrd introduced another amendment that required all Cabinet officers be required to undergo reconfirmation by the Senate in the event that they are retained from one administration to another.\nIn March 1973, Byrd led Senate efforts to reject a proposal that would have made most critical committee meetings open to the public, arguing that tampering with \"the rides of the Senate is to tamper with the Senate itself\" and argued against changing \"procedures which, over the long past, have contributed to stability and efficiency in the operation of the Senate\". The Senate voted down the proposal 47 to 38 on March 7.\nOn May 2, 1973, the anniversary of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's death, Byrd called on President Nixon to appoint a permanent successor for Hoover as FBI Director.\nIn June 1973, Byrd sponsored a bill that would impose the first Tuesday in October as the date for all federal elections and mandate that states hold primary elections for federal elections between the first Tuesday in June and the first Tuesday in July. The United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration approved the measure on June 13 and it was sent to the Senate floor for consideration.\nIn June 1973, along with Lloyd Bentsen, Mike Mansfield, John Tower, and Jennings Randolph, Byrd was one of five senators to switch their vote on the foreign military aid authorization bill to assure its passage after previously voting against it.\nIn October 1973, President Nixon vetoed the request of the United States Information Agency for $208 million for fiscal year 1974 on the grounds of a provision forcing the agency to provide any document or information demanded. Byrd introduced a bill identical to the one vetoed by Nixon the following month, differing in not containing the information provision as well as a ban on appropriating or spending more money than the annual budget called for, the Senate approving the legislation on November 13.\nIn November 1973, after the Senate rejected an amendment to the National Energy Emergency Act intending to direct President Nixon to put gasoline rationing into effect on January 15, Byrd indicated the final vote not coming for multiple days.\nIn June 1974, the Senate confirmed John C. Sawhill as Federal Energy Administrator only to rescind the confirmation hours later, the direct result of James Abourezk wanting to speak out and vote against the nomination due to the Nixon administration's refusal to roll back crude oil prices. Abourezk confirmed that he had asked Byrd for notice of when he could assume the Senate floor to deliver his remarks. Byrd was absent when present members passed the nomination as part of their efforts to clear the chamber's executive calendar and rescinded the confirmation.\nNixon resignation.\nIn May 1974, the House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against President Nixon after the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides and the administration became engulfed in the scandal that would come to be known as Watergate. That month, Byrd delivered a speech on the Senate floor opposing Nixon's potential resignation, saying it would serve only to convince the President's supporters that his enemies had driven him out of office: \"The question of guilt or innocence would never be fully resolved. The country would remain polarized \u2014 more so than it is today. And confidence in government would remain unrestored\". Most of the members of the Senate in attendance for the address were conservatives from both parties that shared opposition to Nixon being removed from office. Byrd was among multiple conservative senators who stated that they would not ask Nixon to resign. Later that month, Republican attorney general Elliot L. Richardson termed Nixon \"a law and order President who says subpoenas must be answered by everyone except himself,\" the comment being echoed by Byrd who additionally charged President Nixon with reneging on his public pledge that the independence of the special prosecutor to pursue the Watergate investigation would not be limited without the prior approval of a majority of congressional leaders.\nOn July 29, Byrd met with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, Minority Leader Hugh Scott, and Republican whip Robert P. Griffin in the first formality by Senate leaders on the matter of President Nixon's impeachment. Byrd opposed Nixon being granted immunity. \"The New York Times\" noted that as Chairman of the Republican National Committee George H. W. Bush issued a formal statement indicating no chance for the Nixon administration to be salvaged, Byrd was advocating for President Nixon to face some punishment for the illegal activities of the administration and that former vice president Spiro Agnew should have been imprisoned. The Senate leadership met throughout August 7 to discuss Nixon's fate, the topic of immunity being mentioned in the office of Hugh Scott. Nixon announced his resignation the following day and resigned on August 9. The resignation led to Congress rearranging their intent from an impeachment to the confirmation of a new vice presidential nominee and the Senate scheduled a recess between August 23 to September 14, Byrd opining, \"What the country needs is for all of us to get out of Washington and let the country have a breath of fresh air\". By August 11, Hugh Scott announced he was finding fewer members of Congress from either party committed to criminally prosecuting former president Nixon over \"Watergate\", Byrd and Majority Leader Mansfield both indicating their favoring for Nixon's culpability being left in the consideration of Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski and the \"Watergate\" grand jury.\nGerald Ford era.\nOn November 22, 1974, the Senate Rules Committee voted unanimously to recommend the nomination of Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President of the United States to the full Senate. Byrd admitted that he had preferred sending the nomination with no recommendation but was worried the act would apply prejudice to the nominee.\nIn January 1975, after President Ford requested $300 million in additional military aid for South Vietnam and $222 million more for the Khmer Republic from Congress, Byrd said Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had described the aid as \"imperative\" and that congressional leaders had been told North Vietnam would take over Saigon \"little by little\" if additional ammunition and other aid were not provided by the US to Saigon. In February, along with Mike Mansfield, Hugh Scott, and Robert P. Griffin, Byrd was one of four senators to sponsor a compromise modification of the Senate's filibuster rule where three-fifths of the total Senate membership would be adequate in invoking closure on any measure except a change in the Senate's rules. In March, while the Senate voted on reforming its filibuster rule, James Allen and other senators used their allotted time to speak at length and also force a series of votes. In response, Byrd said the group was engaging in an \"exercise in futility\" and that the chamber had already made up its mind. In April, after President Ford and his administration's lawyers contended that Ford had authority as president to use troops under the War Powers Act, Byrd and Thomas F. Eagleton objected by charging that Ford was establishing a dangerous precedent. Byrd issued a statement on the Senate floor admitting his \"serious reservations\" pertaining to the Ford administration's intent to bring roughly 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees to the United States, citing cultural differences and unemployment as raising \"grave doubts about the wisdom of bringing any sizable number of evacuees here\". In May, after President Ford appealed for Americans to support the resettlement of 130,000 Vietnamese and Cambodians in the US, Byrd told reporters that he believed that President Ford's request for $507 million for refugee transport and resettlement would be reduced, citing its lack of political support in the United States. In September, Byrd sponsored an amendment to the appropriations bill that if enacted would bar the education department from ordering busing to the school nearest to a pupil's home and sought to hold the Senate floor until there was an agreement among colleagues on his proposal. This failed, as the time limit for debating various proposals ran out. On November 10, Byrd met with President Ford for a discussion on the New York loan guarantee bill.\nIn April 1976, Byrd was one of five members of the Senate Select Committee to vote for a requirement that the proposed oversight committee would share Its jurisdiction with four committees that had authority over intelligence operations. In June, after the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to send a bill breaking up 18 large oil companies into separate production, refining and refining\u2010marketing entities to the Senate floor, Byrd announced his opposition to divestiture and joined Republicans Hugh Scott and Charles Mathias in confirming their votes were to report the bill. In September, Congress overrode President Ford's veto of a $56 billion appropriations bill for social services, Ford afterward telling Byrd and House Speaker Carl Albert that he would sign two bills supported by the Democrats.\nByrd was elected majority leader on January 4, 1977. On January 14, President Ford met with congressional leadership to announce his proposals for pay increases of high government officials, Byrd afterward telling reporters that the president had also stated his intent to recommend that the raises be linked to a code of conduct. Days later, after the Senate established a special 15\u2010member committee to draw up a code of ethics for senators, Byrd told reporters that he was supportive of the measure and that it would be composed of eight Democrats and seven Republicans who would have until March 1 to issue a draft code that would then be subject to change by the full Senate.\nJimmy Carter era.\nIn January 1977, after President-elect Carter announced his nomination of Ted Sorensen to be Director of Central Intelligence, Byrd admitted to reporters that there could be difficulty securing a Senate confirmation. Conservative opposition to Sorenson's nomination led Carter to conclude that he could not be confirmed, and Carter withdrawing it without the Senate taking action.\nRole in changes in Senate rules.\nOn January 18, 1977, after the Senate established a special 15\u2010member committee to draw up a code of ethics for senators, Byrd and Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker announced their support for the resolution, Byrd adding that knowledge of the code of ethics being enacted in the Senate would be privy to the public, press, and members of the Senate. While eight of Carter's secretaries were confirmed within the first hours of his presidency, Byrd made an unsuccessful effort to secure a date and time limit for debate on the confirmation of Ray Marshall, Carter's nominee for United States Secretary of Labor.\nBetween January and February 1979, Byrd proposed outlawing tactics frequently used to prevent him from bringing a bill to the floor for consideration. He stated the filibuster tactics gave the Senate a bad reputation and rendered it ineffective. His proposals initially earned the opposition of Republicans and conservative Democrats until there was a compromise for the reform package to be split and have the less objectionable part come up first for consideration. The Senate passed legislation curtailing tactics that had been used in the past to continue filibusters after cloture had been invoked on February 22. In March, Byrd negotiated an agreement that a proposed amendment was referred to the Judiciary Committee and would be reported by April 10. The arrangement stated that Byrd could call up the proposed amendment any time following June 1 and his action would not be subject to a filibuster while the resolution embodying the amendment will.\nDomestic issues.\nIn October 1977, Byrd stated his refusal to authorize the Senate dropping consideration of the natural gas legislation under any circumstances, predicting the matter would be settled in the coming days as a result of conversations with colleagues he had the night before and a growing disillusion with filibusters in place of action on legislation. Byrd added that the deregulation bill would not become law due to it being identical to the Carter administration's proposal and President Carter's prior statement that he would veto deregulation bills.\nIn May 1978, Byrd announced that he would not move to end a filibuster against the Carter administration's labor law revision bill until after the Memorial Day recess. The decision was seen as allowing wavering senators to not be cornered on their votes as lobbying efforts for both business and labor commenced and various opponents of the bill viewed Byrd's call as a sign of weakness toward the Carter administration. Byrd stated that his decision to wait was \"to give ample time for debate on the measure\" and that he was expecting the first petition to end the filibuster to come sometime following the Senate returning in June.\nIn March 1979, after Attorney General Griffin Bell named a special counsel in the Carter warehouse investigation, Byrd stated his dissatisfaction with the move in a Senate floor speech, citing the existence of legislation approved by Congress the previous year that would allow the appointment of a special prosecutor. In June, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch Mark Green stated that President Carter had told him that Majority Leader Byrd had threatened that he would personally lead a filibuster against any attempt to extend controls on domestic oil prices. In response, Byrd's press secretary Mike Willard confirmed that Byrd told President Carter he would not vote for cloture in the event of a filibuster. Days later, after the Senate voted to grant President Carter authority to set energy conservation targets for each of the 50 states and allow Carter to impose mandatory measures on any statfailed to implement a plan to meet the targets he set, Byrd reaffirmed his opposition to attempts aimed at President Carter's decision to remove price controls from crude oil produced within the United States. In November, Byrd stated that the United States did not have an alternative to coal when attempting to meet its energy needs and that the technology needed to turn coal into liquid fuel at a lower cost than that of producing gasoline had already been made available, opining that doing this would solve most environmental problems. Weeks later, Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate F. Nordy Hoffman sent a letter to Byrd warning him to take precautions against possible attacks by religious fanatics and nationalist terrorists and advocating for senators to \"vary their daily routines, take different routes to and from the Senate, exchange their personalized license plates for those that provide anonymity and be generally alert to the possibility of attack\". Byrd distributed the letter to the other members of the chamber of Congress. In December, the Senate voted on a Republican proposal to limit overall Government tax revenue that would also yield an annual tax cut of $39 to $55 billion over the course of the following four years. Republican William Roth sponsored an amendment that Byrd moved to table Senator Roth's request for a budget waiver and won by five votes. The Senate narrowly blocked the proposal. By December, congressional leadership was aiming for President Carter to sign a new synthetic fuels bill before Christmas, with Byrd wanting the bill to contain a $185 billion revenue that was achieved in a minimum tax provision. Later that month, after the Senate approved $1.5 billion in Federal loan guarantees for the Chrysler Corporation tonight after defeating a proposal to provide emergency, Byrd confirmed that he had spoken with United States Secretary of the Treasury G. William Miller about what Byrd called \"excellent\" chances that the Senate would complete work on a federal loans guarantees bill for Chrysler.\nIn August 1980, Byrd stated that Congress was unlikely to pass a tax cut before the November elections despite the Senate being in the mood for passing one.\nTurkey.\nIn July 1978, Byrd introduced and endorsed a proposal by George McGovern for an amendment to repeal the 42\u2010month\u2010old embargo on American military assistance for Turkey that also linked any future aid for that country to progress on a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem. The Senate approved the amendment in a vote of 57 to 42 as part of a $2.9 billion international security assistance bill. Byrd stated that every government in the NATO alliance except Greece favored repeal of the embargo.\nIn May 1979, Byrd stated that giving Turkey a grant should not be construed as retaliation against Greece and that aid for Turkey would improve Turkey's security in addition to that of Greece, NATO, and of American allies in the Middle East. Byrd mentioned his encouragement from the report on the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities agreeing to resume negotiations on the island's future as well as reports that progress was also being made on the reintegration of Greece into NATO. Byrd furthered that American military installations in Turkey were \"of major importance in the monitoring of Soviet strategic activities\" and would have \"obvious significance\" in the goal of verifying compliance by the Soviet Union with the strategic arms treaty. The Senate approved the Turkey grant, to Byrd's wishes, but against that of both President Carter and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nForeign policy.\nOn February 2, 1978, Byrd and Minority Leader Baker invited all other senators to join them in sponsoring two amendments to the Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties, the two party leaders sending copies of amendments recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee the previous week.\nIn January 1979, Byrd met with Deputy Prime Minister of China Deng Xiaoping for assurances by Deng that China hoped to unite Taiwan to the mainland by peaceful means and would fully respect \"the present realities\" on the island. Byrd afterward stated that his concern on the Taiwan question had been allayed. In June, Byrd opined that a decision by President Carter to not proceed with the new missile system would kill the strategic arms limitation treaty in the Senate. Byrd held meetings with Soviet leaders between July 3 to July 4. Following their conclusion, Byrd said he was still undecided on supporting the arms pact and that there had been talks on \"the need on both sides for avoidance of inflammatory rhetoric which can only be counterproductive\". On September 23, Byrd stated that it was possible the Senate could complete the strategic arms limitation treaty that year but a delay until the following year could result in its defeat, adding that senators might have to remain in session during Christmas to ensure the treaty was voted on before 1979's end. Byrd noted that he was opposed to the treaty being \"held hostage to the Cuban situation\" as American interests could be harmed in the event the treaty was defeated solely due to Soviet Armed Forces troops being in Cuba. In November, Byrd admitted to complaining to President Carter about Senate leadership receiving only occasional briefings about the Iranian hostage crisis and that Carter had agreed to daily consultations for Minority Leader Howard Baker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Frank Church, and ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee Jacob Javits. Byrd added that he did not disagree with the move by the Carter administration to admit Mohammad Reza Pahlavi for hospitalization and that the same action would extend to \"Ayatollah Khomeini himself if he were needing medical treatment and had a terminal illness\". On December 3, Byrd told reporters that the Iranian hostage crisis was making the Senate uninhabitable for a debate on the strategic arms treaty, noting that a discussion could still occur before the Senate adjourned on December 21 but that he did not believe he would call up the opportunity even if granted the chance. Days later, Byrd announced there was no chance that the Senate would take up debate on the strategic arms treaty that year while speaking to reporters, adding that he would see no harm in having the discussion on the treaty begin in January of the following year.\n1980 presidential election.\nIn July 1979, Senate members Henry M. Jackson from Washington and George McGovern from South Dakota made comments expressing doubt on President Carter being assured as the Democratic nominee in the 1980 presidential election. When asked about their comments by a reporter, Byrd referred to Jackson and McGovern as \"two very strong voices and not at all to be considered men who have little background in politics\" but stated it was too early to participate in \"writing the political obituary of the President at this point\". Byrd added that the powers of the presidency made it possible that Carter could have a comeback and cited the events in November and December as being telling of his prospects of achieving higher popularity.\nOn May 10, 1980, Byrd called for President Carter to debate Senate member Ted Kennedy, who he complimented as having done a service for the US by raising key issues in his presidential campaign. On August 2, Byrd advocated for an open Democratic National Convention where the delegates were not bound to a single candidate. The endorsement was seen as a break from President Carter.\nIn September, Byrd said that Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan had made comments on the Iran\u2013Iraq War that were a disservice to the United States and that he was exercising \"reckless political posturing\" in foreign policy.\nGeorge H. W. Bush era.\nIn early 1990, Byrd proposed an amendment granting special aid to coal miners who would lose their jobs in the event that Congress passed clean air legislation. Byrd was initially confident in the number of votes he needed to secure its passage being made available but this was prevented by a vote from Democrat Joe Biden who said the measure's passage would mean an assured veto by President Bush. Speaking to reporters after its defeat, Byrd stated his content with the results: \"I made the supreme effort. I did everything I could and, therefore, I don't feel badly about it\". The Senate passed clean air legislation within weeks of the vote on Byrd's amendment with the intent of reduction in acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in the air and meeting the request by President Bush for a measure that was less costly than the initial plan while still performing the same tasks of combating clean air issues. Byrd was one of eleven senators to vote against the bill and said he \"cannot vote for legislation that can bring economic ruin to communities throughout the Appalachian region and the Midwest\".\nIn August 1990, after the Senate passed its first major campaign finance reform bill since the Watergate era that would prevent political action committees from federal campaigns, lend public money into congressional campaigns and bestow candidates vouchers for television advertising, Byrd stated that he believed the bill would \"end the money chase\".\nByrd authored an amendment to the National Endowment for the Arts that would bar the endowment from funding projects considered obscene such as depictions of sadomasochism, homo-eroticism, the sexual exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex acts while also requiring grant recipients to sign a pledge swearing their compliance with the restrictions. The October 1990 measure approved in the Senate was a bipartisan measure loosening government restrictions on art project funding and leaving courts to judge what art could be considered obscene.\nPresident Bush nominated Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. In October 1991, Byrd stated his support in the credibility of Anita Hill: \"I believe what she said. I did not see on that face the knotted brow of satanic revenge. I did not see a face that was contorted with hate. I did not hear a voice that was tremulous with passion. I saw the face of a woman, one of 13 in a family of Southern blacks who grew up on the farm and who belonged to the church\". Byrd questioned how members of the Senate could be convinced that Thomas would serve as an objective judge when he could refuse to watch Hill's testimony against him.\nIn February 1992, the Senate turned down a Republican attempt sponsored by John McCain and Dan Coats to grant President Bush line-item veto authority and thereby be authorized to kill projects that he was opposed to, Byrd delivering an address defending congressional power over spending for eight hours afterward. The speech had been written by Byrd two years prior and he had at this point steered $1.5 billion to his state.\nIn 1992, there was an effort made to pass a constitutional amendment to ensure a balanced federal budget. Byrd called the amendment \"a smokescreen that will allow lawmakers to claim action against the deficit while still postponing hard budgetary decision\" and spoke to reporters on his feelings against the amendment being passed: \"Once members are really informed as to the mischief this amendment could do, and the damage it could do to the country and to the Constitution. I just have faith that enough members will take a courageous stand against the amendment\". The sponsor of the amendment, Paul Simon, admitted that Byrd's prediction was not off and that other senators speak \"when the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee talks\".\nIn a June 1992 debate, Byrd argued in favor of the United States withdrawing accepting immigrants that did not speak English, the comment being a response to a plan from the Bush administration that would enable former Soviet states to receive American assistance and allow immigrants from a variety of countries to receive welfare benefits. Byrd soon afterward apologized for the comment and said they were due to his frustration over the federal government's inability to afford several essential services.\nBill Clinton era.\nIn February 1994, the Senate passed a $10 billion spending bill that would mostly be allocated to the 1994 Northridge earthquake victims and military operations abroad. Senate members Bob Dole, John Kerry, John McCain, and Russ Feingold partnered together to persuade the Senate in favor of cutting back the deficit expense. Byrd raised a procedural point to derail an attempt by Dole that would approve $50 billion in spending cuts over the following five years. McCain proposed killing highway demonstration projects with a $203 million price tag, leading Byrd to produce letters written by McCain that the latter had sent to the Appropriations Committee in 1991 in an attempt to gather highway grants for his home state of Arizona. Byrd said that McCain \"is very considerate of the taxpayers when it comes to financing projects in other states, but he supports such projects in his own state\".\nAlong with U.S. Senate member Chuck Hagel from Nebraska, in July 1997 Byrd sponsored the Byrd\u2013Hagel Resolution, which effectively prohibited the US from ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn May 2000, Byrd and John Warner sponsored a provision threatening to withdraw American troops from Kosovo, the legislation if enacted cutting off funds for troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, without congressional consent. The language would have also withheld 25 percent of the money for Kosovo in the bill unless the assertion that European countries were living up to their promises to provide reconstruction money for the province was certified by President Clinton by July 15. Byrd argued that lawmakers had never approved nor debate whether American troops should be stationed in Kosovo. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the legislation in a vote of 23-to-3 that was said to reflect \"widespread concern among lawmakers about an open-ended deployment of American soldiers\".\nIn November 2000, Congress passed an amendment sponsored by Byrd diverting tariff revenues from the United States Department of the Treasury and instead allocating them to the industry complaining, the amount involved ranging from between $40 million and $200 million a year. The following month, Japan and the European Union led a group of countries in filing a joint complaint with the World Trade Organization to the law.\nGeorge W. Bush era.\nByrd praised the John G. Roberts Supreme Court nominations to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Likewise, Byrd was one of four Democrats who supported the Samuel Alito Supreme Court nomination to replace retiring Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\nLike most Democrats, Byrd opposed the Bush tax cuts and his proposals to change the Social Security program.\nByrd opposed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created the United States Department of Homeland Security, stating that the bill ceded too much authority to the executive branch.\nOn May 2, 2002, Byrd charged the White House with engaging in \"sophomoric political antics\", citing Homeland Security Advisor Tom Ridge's briefing of senators in another location instead of the Senate on how safe he felt the U.S. was.\nHe also led the opposition to Bush's bid to win back the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress cannot amend, but lost overwhelmingly. In the 108th Congress, however, Byrd won his party's top seat on the new Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.\nIn July 2004, Byrd released the \"New York Times\" best-selling book \"Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency\", which criticized the Bush presidency and the war in Iraq.\nIraq War.\nByrd led a filibuster against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 granting President George W. Bush broad power to wage a \"preemptive\" war against Ba'athist Iraq, but he could not get even a majority of his own party to vote against cloture.\nByrd was one of the Senate's most outspoken critics of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nByrd anticipated the difficulty of fighting an insurgency in Iraq, stating on March 13, 2003,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the United States leads the charge to war in the Persian Gulf, we may get lucky and achieve a rapid victory. But then we will face a second war: a war to win the peace in Iraq. This war will last many years and will surely cost hundreds of billions of dollars. In light of this enormous task, it would be a great mistake to expect that this will be a replay of the 1991 war. The stakes are much higher in this conflict.\nOn March 19, 2003, when Bush ordered the invasion after receiving congressional approval, Byrd said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Today I weep for my country. I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned. Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten recrimination. Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to have succeeded in isolating ourselves.\nByrd also criticized Bush for his speech declaring the \"end of major combat operations\" in Iraq, which Bush made on the USS \"Abraham Lincoln\". Byrd stated on the Senate floor,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I do not begrudge his salute to America's warriors aboard the carrier Lincoln, for they have performed bravely and skillfully, as have their countrymen still in Iraq. But I do question the motives of a deskbound president who assumes the garb of a warrior for the purposes of a speech.\nOn October 17, 2003, Byrd delivered a speech expressing his concerns about the future of the nation and his unequivocal antipathy to Bush's policies. Referencing the Hans Christian Andersen children's tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", Byrd said of the president: \"the emperor has no clothes\". Byrd further lamented the \"sheep-like\" behavior of the \"cowed Members of this Senate\" and called on them to oppose the continuation of a \"war based on falsehoods\".\nIn April 2004, Byrd mentioned the possibility of the Bush administration violating law by its failure to inform leadership in Congress midway through 2002 about its use of emergency anti-terror dollars to begin preparations for an invasion of Iraq. Byrd stated that he had never been told of a shift in money, a charge reported in the Bob Woodward book \"Plan of Attack\", and its validation would mean \"the administration failed to abide by the law to consult with and fully inform Congress\".\nByrd accused the Bush administration of stifling dissent:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The right to ask questions, debate, and dissent is under attack. The drums of war are beaten ever louder in an attempt to drown out those who speak of our predicament in stark terms. Even in the Senate, our history and tradition of being the world's greatest deliberative body is being snubbed. This huge spending bill\u2014$87 billion\u2014has been rushed through this chamber in just one month. There were just three open hearings by the Senate Appropriations Committee on $87 billion\u2014$87 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born\u2014$87 billion without a single outside witness called to challenge the administration's line.\nOf the more than 18,000 votes he cast as a senator, Byrd said he was proudest of his vote against the Iraq war resolution. Byrd also voted to tie a timetable for troop withdrawal to war funding.\nGang of 14.\nOn May 23, 2005, Byrd was one of 14 U.S. Senate members (who became known as the \"Gang of 14\") to forge a compromise on the judicial filibuster, thus securing up and down votes for many judicial nominees and ending the threat of the so-called nuclear option that would have eliminated the filibuster entirely. Under the agreement, the senators retained the power to filibuster a judicial nominee in only an \"extraordinary circumstance\". It ensured that the appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Richman and William H Pryor Jr.) would receive votes by the full Senate.\nOther votes.\nIn 1977, Byrd was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of Ray Marshall as United States Secretary of Labor. Marshall was opposed by conservatives in both parties because of his pro-labor positions, including support for repealing right to work laws. Marshall was confirmed and served until the end of Carter's term in 1981.\nIn February 1981, as the Senate voted on giving final approval to the $50 billion increase in the debt limit, Democrats initially opposed the measure as part of an effort to elicit the highest number of Republicans in support of the measure. Byrd proceeded to give a signal for Democrats that saw caucus members switch their votes in support of the increase.\nPresident Reagan was injured during an assassination attempt in March 1981. Following the shooting, Byrd opined that the aftermath of the attempt had proven there were \"holes that need to be plugged\" in the constitution's handling of the presidential line of succession after a president's disability and stated his intent to introduce legislation calling for a mandatory life sentence for anyone attempting to assassinate a president, vice president, or member of Congress.\nIn March 1981, during a Capitol Hill interview, Byrd stated that the Reagan administration was promoting an economic package with assumptions for the national economy that might take a year for the public to see its difficulties and thereby lead to a political backlash. Byrd contented that President Reagan would win approval by Congress of $35 to $40 billion of the $48 billion in proposed budget cuts while having more difficulty in passing his tax-cut package, asserting Democratic opposition and some Republicans having misgivings about the approach as the reason Congress would block the plan and furthering that he would be surprised if a one-year cut in rates lasted more than year. Byrd opined that it was time for \"some tax reform\" that would see loopholes closed for the rich dropped to bring in revenues and expressed belief in the likelihood of the administration dismantling existing energy programs: \"Energy programs are not as catchy now as budget cuts. But if the gas lines begin to form again, or the overseas oil gets cut off, we will have lost the time, the momentum, the money. Basically, they have a wholesale dismantlement of the energy programs we spent several years creating around here\".\nIn March 1981, during a news conference, Byrd stated that the Reagan administration had not established a coherent foreign policy. He credited conflicting statements from administration officials with having contributed to confusion in Western European capitals. Byrd also said, \"We've seen these statements, and backing and filling, and the secretary of state has been kept pretty busy explaining and denying assertions and pronouncements by others, which indeed indicate that the administration has not yet got its foreign policy act together\".\nIn May 1981, Byrd announced his support for the Reagan administration's proposed budget for the fiscal year 1982 during a weekly news conference, citing that the \"people want the President to be given a chance with his budget\". Byrd added that he did not believe a balanced budget would be achieved by 1984, calling the budget \"a balanced budget on paper only, made up of juggled figures produced out of thin air\", and charged the administration with making assumptions, his comments being seen as an indication that little opposition would amount from the Democrats to the Reagan budget.\nIn November 1981, as Senate leaders rejected the request of Senate member Harrison A. Williams from New Jersey to introduce new evidence during the Senate's consideration of whether to expel him for his involvement in the Abscam case, Byrd and Majority Leader Baker informed Williams that he could have a lawyer that would have to remain wordless.\nOn December 2, 1981, Byrd voted in favor of an amendment to President Reagan's MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration.\nIn February 1982, Byrd wrote a letter to President Reagan urging him to \"withdraw the Administration's proposed fiscal 1983 budget, and resubmit a budget that provides for much lower deficits and makes use of more realistic assumptions\", recalling his previous appeal to President Carter in 1980 amid the rise of soaring inflation rates and Carter afterward consulting with Democrats in Congress. Byrd stated that he was in favor of \"a document we in Congress can work with, one based on realistic assumptions, one which shows a much clearer trend toward a balanced budget\". Byrd had cautious praise for a proposal by Democrat Fritz Hollings called for a freeze on all benefit programs with the exception of food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid in addition to a freeze on military spending while eliminating a pay increase for federal employees.\nIn March 1982, Byrd announced he would introduce an amendment to the War Powers Act that would bar the president from being able to send combat troops to the Salvadoran Civil War without the approval of Congress. Byrd described the proposal as only allowing the president to act with independence in the event that Americans needed to evacuate El Salvador or if the United States was attacked. \"It is my view that if Americans are to be asked to shed their blood in the jungles of El Salvador, all Americans should first have an opportunity to debate and carefully evaluate that action\".\nBy March 1982, along with Alan Cranston, Byrd was one of two U.S. Senate members supporting both the measure sponsored by Henry M. Jackson and John Warner calling upon the United States and the Soviet Union to freeze their nuclear arsenals at \"equal and sharply reduced levels\" and the bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy and Mark Hatfield calling upon the two countries first to negotiate a freeze on nuclear forces at existing levels before following atomic arms reduction.\nIn January 1983, after President Reagan said during his 1983 State of the Union Address that he hoped for the same bipartisan support that had produced the Social Security recommendations would lead Congress during the year on other issues, Byrd and House Majority Leader Jim Wright assailed the unfairness of a six-month delay in the cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients during a period of letting the wealthy reap the benefits of the general income tax cut for a third year. Byrd stated that he did not \"want a six-month delay in Social Security while leaving in place the third year of the tax cut for upper-income people\" and stated that Reagan's speech had been \"'rhetorically good, but substantively lacking in measures that would deal now with the crises that millions of people are experiencing\".\nAt the beginning of February 1983, House Democrats committed themselves \"to an emergency economic assistance program that would create public service jobs, provide shelter and soup kitchens for the destitute and avert foreclosures of homes and farms\". Concurrently, Byrd pledged to work with the House Democrats in developing legislation concerning jobs, proposing $5 to $10 billion be spent and introducing legislation intended to form a national investment corporation that would assist with underwriting faltering basic industries and starting new ones in areas of high unemployment.\nIn March 1984, Byrd voted against a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing periods in public school for silent prayer, and in favor of President Reagan's unsuccessful proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized school prayer in public schools.\nIn June 1984, Byrd was one of five Democrats to vote against the Lawton Chiles proposal to cease MX production for a year during study in search of a smaller and single-warhead missile. The 48 to 48 tie was broken by then-Vice President George H. W. Bush.\nIn September 1986, Byrd endorsed the death penalty for some drug pushers in anti-drug legislation that would order President Reagan to end drug trafficking within 45 days through using the military as a means of intercepting smugglers, and imposing the death penalty on those pushers who intentionally cause a death as part of their operations while providing funding for prevention, drug abuse treatment, and anti-drug laws enforcement that was estimated to cost $3 to $4 billion over three years. Byrd admitted that calling for the death penalty seemed harsh, but cautioned that children in some cases had their entire lives destroyed through using drugs and that Congress had been soft for too long without seeing a change in results.\nIn December 1986, Byrd announced that the Senate would convene a Watergate-type select committee to investigate the Iran-Contra affair the following year and that he had reached an agreement with Bob Dole for the committee to have six Democrats and five Republicans. Byrd and Dole disagreed on whether it was a necessity for Congress to be launched into a special session that month for the purpose of getting the investigative process moving. Naming members during December enabled participants to informally move ahead by selecting the staff and be prepared before the 100th United States Congress began.\nIn September 1988, in response to charges by Vice President Bush's presidential campaign that Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis was weak on defense, Byrd delivered a Senate speech in which he said that the Reagan administration \"is living in a glass house when it throws a stone at the Democratic Party for its so-called Disneyland defense policies\" and that the U.S. land-based missiles had grown in vulnerability due to the administration being \"unable to produce an acceptable solution to make our missiles survivable\". Byrd furthered, \"Indeed, the Fantasyland exhibits of this White House's Defense Disneyland are loaded with the rejected systems that have been developed and discarded. If anything deserves the names 'Goofy' and 'Daffy' and 'Mickey Mouse,' it is those' basing proposals\".\nIn October 1990, Byrd and U.S. Senate member Jim McClure from Idaho served as floor managers for the appropriation bill for the National Endowment of the Arts, accepting an amendment by U.S. Senate member Jesse Helms from North Carolina prohibiting NEA support of work denigrating objects or beliefs of religions.\nIn November 1993, when the Senate voted to seek federal court enforcement of a subpoena for the diaries of Bob Packwood, Byrd stated the possibility of Americans becoming convinced that the Senate was delaying taking action to protect one of its own members. Byrd also called for Packwood to resign. \"None of us is without flaws. But when those flaws damage the institution of the Senate, it is time to have the grace to go!\" Packwood resigned in 1995.\nIn October 1999, Byrd was the only senator to vote present on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the Treaty of Versailles.\nByrd opposed the Flag Desecration Amendment, saying that, while he wanted to protect the American flag, he believed that amending the Constitution \"is not the most expeditious way to protect this revered symbol of our Republic\". As an alternative, Byrd cosponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005 (S. 1370), a bill to prohibit destruction or desecration of the flag by anyone trying to incite violence or causing a breach of the peace, or who steals, damages, or destroys a flag on federal property, whether owned by the federal government or a private group or individual\u2014can be imprisoned, fined or both. The bill did not pass.\nIn 2009, Byrd was one of three Democrats to oppose the confirmation of United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. After missing nearly two months while in hospital, Byrd returned to the Senate floor on July 21 to vote against the elimination of funding for the F-22 fighter plane.\nRatings groups.\nByrd received a 65% vote rating from the League of Conservation Voters for his support of environmentally friendly legislation. Additionally, he received a \"liberal\" rating of 65.5% by the \"National Journal\"\u2014higher than six other Democratic senators.\nIn 2010, Byrd received a 70 percent lifetime rating from the American Civil Liberties Union for supporting rights-related legislation.\nHealth issues and death.\nByrd had an essential tremor; he eventually used a wheelchair for mobility. His health declined through 2008, including several hospital admissions. \"The New Yorker\" reported in 2020 that Byrd was \"widely known\" to be \"non compos mentis\" during the final years of his career.\nOn January 20, 2009, U.S. Senate member Ted Kennedy suffered a seizure during Barack Obama's inaugural luncheon and was taken away in an ambulance. Byrd, seated at the same table, became distraught and was himself removed to his office. Byrd's office reported that he was fine. On May 18, Byrd was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fever due to a \"minor infection\", prolonged by a staphylococcus aureus infection. Byrd was released on June 30, 2009.\nOn June 27, 2010, it was reported that Byrd had been admitted to Inova Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax County, Virginia, earlier that weekend; while he was first admitted for suspected heat exhaustion, \"more serious issues\" emerged and he was said to be \"seriously ill\". He died at approximately 3 a.m. EDT the next day at age 92 from natural causes. At the time of his death in office, he was the last living U.S. senator who assumed office in the 1950s, and the last living U.S. senator who served during the Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nVice President and former U.S. Senate member Joe Biden of Delaware recalled Byrd's standing in the rain with him as Biden buried his daughter when Biden had just been elected to the Senate. He called Byrd \"a tough, compassionate, and outspoken leader and dedicated above all else to making life better for the people of the Mountain State\". President of the United States and former U.S. Senate member Barack Obama from Illinois said, \"His profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something I appreciated greatly as a young senator\". Senator Jay Rockefeller, who had served with Byrd since 1985, said, \"I looked up to him, I fought next to him, and I am deeply saddened that he is gone\". Former president Jimmy Carter noted, \"He was my closest and most valuable adviser while I served as president. I respected him and attempted in every way to remain in his good graces. He was a giant among legislators, and was courageous in espousing controversial issues\".\nOn July 1, 2010, Byrd lay in repose on the Lincoln Catafalque in the Senate chamber of the United States Capitol, becoming the first senator to do so since 1957. He was then flown to Charleston, West Virginia, where he lay in repose in the Lower Rotunda of the West Virginia State Capitol.\nA funeral was held on July 2, 2010, on the grounds of the State Capitol where Byrd was eulogized by President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Governor Joe Manchin, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Senate member Jay Rockefeller, U.S. House of Representatives member Nick Rahall, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, and former president Bill Clinton. After the funeral services in Charleston, his body was returned to Arlington County, Virginia, for funeral services on July 6, 2010, at Memorial Baptist Church. After the funeral in Arlington, Byrd was buried next to his wife Erma at Columbia Gardens Cemetery in Arlington, although family members have stated that both the senator and Mrs. Byrd will be reinterred somewhere in West Virginia once a site is determined.\nThe song \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" was played at the end of the funeral in a bluegrass fashion as his casket was being carried back up the stairs and into the West Virginia State Capitol Building.\nOn September 30, 2010, Congress appropriated $193,400 to be paid equally among Byrd's children and grandchildren, representing the salary he would have earned in the next fiscal year, a common practice when members of Congress die in office.\nReaction to death.\nMultiple political figures issued statements following Byrd's death:\nIn popular culture.\nByrd had a prominent role in the 2008 Warner Bros. documentary \"Body of War\" directed by Phil Donahue. The film chronicles the life of Tomas Young, paralyzed from the chest down after a sniper shot him as he was riding in a vehicle in Iraq. Several long clips of Byrd show him passionately arguing against authorizing the use of force in Iraq. Later in the movie, Byrd has a one-on-one interview with Tomas Young in Byrd's Senate office, followed by a shot of Byrd walking beside Young as they leave the Capitol.\nA fictionalized version of Byrd, then the Senate Majority Leader, was a character in the Jeffrey Archer novel \"Shall We Tell the President?\"\nByrd was an avid fiddle player for most of his life, starting in his teens when he played in various square dance bands. Once he entered politics, his fiddling skills attracted attention and won votes. In 1978 when Byrd was majority leader, he recorded an album called \"U.S. Senator Robert Byrd: Mountain Fiddler\" (County, 1978). Byrd was accompanied by Country Gentlemen Doyle Lawson, James Bailey, and Spider Gilliam. Most of the LP consists of bluegrass music. Byrd covers \"Don't Let Your Sweet Love Die\", a Zeke Manners song, and \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\". He had performed at the Kennedy Center, on the Grand Ole Opry and on \"Hee Haw\". He occasionally took a break from Senate business to entertain audiences with his fiddle. He stopped playing in 1982 when the symptoms of a benign essential tremor had begun to affect the use of his hands.\nByrd appeared in the Civil War movie \"Gods and Generals\" in 2003 along with then-Virginia senator George Allen.

{"id": "25409", "revid": "18779361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25409", "title": "Reptile", "text": "Class of animals\nReptiles, as commonly defined, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic metabolism and amniotic development. Living traditional reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines, Crocodilia, Squamata, and Rhynchocephalia. About 12,000 living species of reptiles are listed in the Reptile Database. The study of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.\nReptiles have been subject to several conflicting taxonomic definitions. In evolutionary taxonomy, reptiles are gathered together under the class Reptilia ( ), which corresponds to common usage. Modern cladistic taxonomy regards that group as paraphyletic, since genetic and paleontological evidence has determined that crocodilians are more closely related to birds (class Aves), members of Dinosauria, than to other living reptiles, and thus birds are nested among reptiles from a phylogenetic perspective. Many cladistic systems therefore redefine Reptilia as a clade (monophyletic group) including birds, though the precise definition of this clade varies between authors. A similar concept is clade Sauropsida, which refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals.\nThe earliest known members of the reptile lineage appeared during the late Carboniferous period, having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to life on dry land. Genetic and fossil data argues that the two largest lineages of reptiles, Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds, and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha (lizards, and kin), diverged during the Permian period. In addition to the living reptiles, there are many diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In particular, the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all non-avian dinosaurs alongside many species of crocodyliforms and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs). Modern non-bird reptiles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica.\nReptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are descended from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades \u200a\u2013 the fetus develops within the mother, using a (non-mammalian) placenta rather than contained in an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko, \"Sphaerodactylus ariasae\", which can grow up to to the saltwater crocodile, \"Crocodylus porosus\", which can reach over in length and weigh over .\nClassification.\nClassical taxonomy and research.\nIn the 13th century, the category of \"reptile\" was recognized in Europe as consisting of a miscellany of egg-laying creatures, including \"snakes, various fantastic monsters, lizards, assorted amphibians, and worms\", as recorded by Beauvais in his \"Mirror of Nature\".\nIn the 18th century, the reptiles were, from the outset of classification, grouped with the amphibians. Linnaeus, working from species-poor Sweden, where the common adder and grass snake are often found hunting in water, included all reptiles and amphibians in class \"III \u2013 Amphibia\" in his \"Systema Natur\u00e6\".\nThe terms \"reptile\" and \"amphibian\" were largely interchangeable, \"reptile\" (from Latin \"repere\", 'to creep') being preferred by the French. J.N. Laurenti was the first to formally use the term \"Reptilia\" for an expanded selection of reptiles and amphibians basically similar to that of Linnaeus. Today, the two groups are still commonly treated under the single heading herpetology.\nIt was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in fact, quite different animals, and P.A. Latreille erected the class \"Batracia\" (1825) for the latter, dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The British anatomist T.H. Huxley made Latreille's definition popular and, together with Richard Owen, expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil \"antediluvian monsters\", including dinosaurs and the mammal-like (synapsid) \"Dicynodon\" he helped describe. This was not the only possible classification scheme: In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and amphibians). He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter two groups. In 1866, Haeckel demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their reproductive strategies, and that reptiles, birds, and mammals were united by the amniotic egg.\nThe terms \"Sauropsida\" (\"lizard faces\") and \"Theropsida\" (\"beast faces\") were used again in 1916 by E.S. Goodrich to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on the one hand (Sauropsida) and mammals and their extinct relatives (Theropsida) on the other. Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features, such as the structure of the forebrain. According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, Protosauria (\"first lizards\") in which he included some animals today considered reptile-like amphibians, as well as early reptiles.\nIn 1956, D.M.S. Watson observed that the first two groups diverged very early in reptilian history, so he divided Goodrich's Protosauria between them. He also reinterpreted Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals, respectively. Thus his Sauropsida included Procolophonia, Eosuchia, Millerosauria, Chelonia (turtles), Squamata (lizards and snakes), Rhynchocephalia, Crocodilia, \"thecodonts\" (paraphyletic basal Archosauria), non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and sauropterygians.\nIn the late 19th century, a number of definitions of Reptilia were offered. The biological traits listed by Lydekker in 1896, for example, include a single occipital condyle, a jaw joint formed by the quadrate and articular bones, and certain characteristics of the vertebrae. The animals singled out by these formulations, the amniotes other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.\nThe synapsid/sauropsid division supplemented another approach, one that split the reptiles into four subclasses based on the number and position of temporal fenestrae, openings in the sides of the skull behind the eyes. This classification was initiated by Henry Fairfield Osborn and elaborated and made popular by Romer's classic \"Vertebrate Paleontology\". Those four subclasses were:\nThe composition of Euryapsida was uncertain. Ichthyosaurs were, at times, considered to have arisen independently of the other euryapsids, and given the older name Parapsida. Parapsida was later discarded as a group for the most part (ichthyosaurs being classified as \"incertae sedis\" or with Euryapsida). However, four (or three if Euryapsida is merged into Diapsida) subclasses remained more or less universal for non-specialist work throughout the 20th\u00a0century. It has largely been abandoned by recent researchers: In particular, the anapsid condition has been found to occur so variably among unrelated groups that it is not now considered a useful distinction.\nPhylogenetics and modern definition.\nBy the early 21st century, vertebrate paleontologists were beginning to adopt phylogenetic taxonomy, in which all groups are defined in such a way as to be monophyletic; that is, groups which include all descendants of a particular ancestor. The reptiles as historically defined are paraphyletic, since they exclude both birds and mammals. These respectively evolved from dinosaurs and from early therapsids, both of which were traditionally called \"reptiles\". Birds are more closely related to crocodilians than the latter are to the rest of extant reptiles. Colin Tudge wrote:\nMammals are a clade, and therefore the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just a section of the clade Amniota: The section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.\nDespite the early proposals for replacing the paraphyletic Reptilia with a monophyletic Sauropsida, which includes birds, that term was never adopted widely or, when it was, was not applied consistently.\nWhen Sauropsida was used, it often had the same content or even the same definition as Reptilia. In 1988, Jacques Gauthier proposed a cladistic definition of Reptilia as a monophyletic node-based crown group containing turtles, lizards and snakes, crocodilians, and birds, their common ancestor and all its descendants. While Gauthier's definition was close to the modern consensus, nonetheless, it became considered inadequate because the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time. Major revisions since have included the reassignment of synapsids as non-reptiles, and classification of turtles as diapsids. Gauthier 1994 and Laurin and Reisz 1995's definition of Sauropsida defined the scope of the group as distinct and broader than that of Reptilia, encompassing Mesosauridae as well as Reptilia \"sensu stricto\".\nA variety of other definitions were proposed by other scientists in the years following Gauthier's paper. The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the PhyloCode, was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic. They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to \"Lacerta agilis\" and \"Crocodylus niloticus\" than to \"Homo sapiens\". This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is better known and more frequently used. Unlike most previous definitions of Reptilia, however, Modesto and Anderson's definition includes birds, as they are within the clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.\nTaxonomy.\nGeneral classification of extinct and living reptiles, focusing on major groups.\nPhylogeny.\nThe cladogram presented here illustrates the \"family tree\" of reptiles, and follows a simplified version of the relationships found by M.S. Lee, in 2013. All genetic studies have supported the hypothesis that turtles are diapsids; some have placed turtles within Archosauromorpha, though a few have recovered turtles as Lepidosauromorpha instead. The cladogram below used a combination of genetic (molecular) and fossil (morphological) data to obtain its results.\nThe position of turtles.\nThe placement of turtles has historically been highly variable. Classically, turtles were considered to be related to the primitive anapsid reptiles. Molecular work has usually placed turtles within the diapsids. As of 2013, three turtle genomes have been sequenced. The results place turtles as a sister clade to the archosaurs, the group that includes crocodilians, non-avian dinosaurs, and birds. However, in their comparative analysis of the timing of organogenesis, Werneburg and S\u00e1nchez-Villagra (2009) found support for the hypothesis that turtles belong to a separate clade within Sauropsida, outside the saurian clade altogether.\nEvolutionary history.\nOrigin of the reptiles.\nThe origin of the reptiles lies about 310\u2013320 million years ago, in the steaming swamps of the late Carboniferous period, when the first reptiles evolved from advanced reptiliomorphs.\nThe oldest known animal that may have been an amniote is \"Casineria\" (though it may have been a temnospondyl). A series of footprints from the fossil strata of Nova Scotia dated to show typical reptilian toes and imprints of scales. These tracks are now attributed to \"Hylonomus\", historically widely regarded as the oldest known reptile, but whose placement in the group has been recently questioned. It was a small, lizard-like animal, about long, with numerous sharp teeth indicating an insectivorous diet. Other examples include \"Westlothiana\" (for the moment considered a reptiliomorph rather than a true amniote) and \"Paleothyris\", both of similar build and presumably similar habit.\nHowever, microsaurs have been at times considered true reptiles, so an earlier origin is possible.\nRise of the reptiles.\nThe earliest amniotes, including stem-reptiles (those amniotes closer to modern reptiles than to mammals), were largely overshadowed by larger stem-tetrapods, such as \"Cochleosaurus\", and remained a small, inconspicuous part of the fauna until the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse. This sudden collapse affected several large groups. Primitive tetrapods were particularly devastated, while stem-reptiles fared better, being ecologically adapted to the drier conditions that followed. Primitive tetrapods, like modern amphibians, need to return to water to lay eggs; in contrast, amniotes, like modern reptiles\u00a0\u2013 whose eggs possess a shell that allows them to be laid on land\u00a0\u2013 were better adapted to the new conditions. Amniotes acquired new niches at a faster rate than before the collapse and at a much faster rate than primitive tetrapods. They acquired new feeding strategies including herbivory and carnivory, previously only having been insectivores and piscivores. From this point forward, reptiles dominated communities and had a greater diversity than primitive tetrapods, setting the stage for the Mesozoic (known as the Age of Reptiles). One of the best known early stem-reptiles is \"Mesosaurus\", a genus from the Early Permian that had returned to water, feeding on fish.\nA 2021 examination of reptile diversity in the Carboniferous and the Permian suggests a much higher degree of diversity than previously thought, comparable or even exceeding that of synapsids. Thus, the \"First Age of Reptiles\" was proposed.\nAnapsids, synapsids, diapsids, and sauropsids.\nIt was traditionally assumed that the first reptiles retained an anapsid skull inherited from their ancestors. This type of skull has a skull roof with only holes for the nostrils, eyes and a pineal eye. The discoveries of synapsid-like openings (see below) in the skull roof of the skulls of several members of Parareptilia (the clade containing most of the amniotes traditionally referred to as \"anapsids\"), including lanthanosuchoids, millerettids, bolosaurids, some nycteroleterids, some procolophonoids and at least some mesosaurs made it more ambiguous and it is currently uncertain whether the ancestral amniote had an anapsid-like or synapsid-like skull. These animals are traditionally referred to as \"anapsids\", and form a paraphyletic basic stock from which other groups evolved. Very shortly after the first amniotes appeared, a lineage called Synapsida split off; this group was characterized by a temporal opening in the skull behind each eye giving room for the jaw muscle to move. These are the \"mammal-like amniotes\", or stem-mammals, that later gave rise to the true mammals. Soon after, another group evolved a similar trait, this time with a double opening behind each eye, earning them the name Diapsida (\"two arches\"). The function of the holes in these groups was to lighten the skull and give room for the jaw muscles to move, allowing for a more powerful bite.\nTurtles have been traditionally believed to be surviving parareptiles, on the basis of their anapsid skull structure, which was assumed to be primitive trait. The rationale for this classification has been disputed, with some arguing that turtles are diapsids that evolved anapsid skulls, improving their armor. Later morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within Diapsida. All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids, most commonly as a sister group to extant archosaurs.\nPermian reptiles.\nWith the close of the Carboniferous, the amniotes became the dominant tetrapod fauna. While primitive, terrestrial reptiliomorphs still existed, the synapsid amniotes evolved the first truly terrestrial megafauna (giant animals) in the form of pelycosaurs, such as \"Edaphosaurus\" and the carnivorous \"Dimetrodon\". In the mid-Permian period, the climate became drier, resulting in a change of fauna: The pelycosaurs were replaced by the therapsids.\nMany stem reptile groups continued to flourished throughout the Permian. These included bipedal bolosaurids, semiaquatic mesosaurs, lumbering pareiasaurs, and lizard-like millerettids and neodiapsids.\nIn the Late Permian, the modern reptiles, or crown-group reptiles, evolved and split into two main lineages: the Archosauromorpha (forebears of turtles, crocodilians, and dinosaurs) and the Lepidosauromorpha (predecessors of modern lizards, snakes, and tuataras). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.\nMesozoic reptiles.\nThe close of the Permian saw the greatest mass extinction known (see the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event), an event prolonged by the combination of two or more distinct extinction pulses. Most of the earlier parareptile and synapsid megafauna disappeared, being replaced by the true reptiles, particularly archosauromorphs. These were characterized by elongated hind legs and an erect pose, the early forms looking somewhat like long-legged crocodiles. The archosaurs became the dominant group during the Triassic period, though it took 30 million years before their diversity was as great as the animals that lived in the Permian. Archosaurs developed into the well-known dinosaurs and pterosaurs, as well as the ancestors of crocodilians. Since reptiles, first rauisuchians and then dinosaurs, dominated the Mesozoic era, the interval is popularly known as the \"Age of Reptiles\". The dinosaurs also developed smaller forms, including the feather-bearing smaller theropods. In the Cretaceous period, these gave rise to the first true birds.\nThe sister group to Archosauromorpha is Lepidosauromorpha, containing lizards and tuataras, as well as their fossil relatives. Lepidosauromorpha contained at least one major group of the Mesozoic sea reptiles: the mosasaurs, which lived during the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic placement of other main groups of fossil sea reptiles \u2013 the ichthyopterygians (including ichthyosaurs) and the sauropterygians, which evolved in the early Triassic \u2013 is more controversial. Different authors linked these groups either to lepidosauromorphs or to archosauromorphs, and ichthyopterygians were also argued to be diapsids that did not belong to the least inclusive clade containing lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs.\nCenozoic reptiles.\nThe close of the Cretaceous period saw the demise of the Mesozoic era reptilian megafauna (see the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, also known as K-T\u00a0extinction event). Of the large marine reptiles, only sea turtles were left; and of the non-marine large reptiles, only the semi-aquatic crocodilians and broadly similar choristoderes survived the extinction, with last members of the latter, the lizard-like \"Lazarussuchus\", becoming extinct in the Miocene. Of the great host of dinosaurs dominating the Mesozoic, only the small beaked birds survived. This dramatic extinction pattern at the end of the Mesozoic led into the Cenozoic. Mammals and birds filled the empty niches left behind by the reptilian megafauna and, while reptile diversification slowed, bird and mammal diversification took an exponential turn. However, reptiles were still important components of the megafauna, particularly in the form of large and giant tortoises.\nAfter the extinction of most archosaur and marine reptile lines by the end of the Cretaceous, reptile diversification continued throughout the Cenozoic. Squamates took a massive hit during the K\u2013Pg event, only recovering ten million years after it, but they underwent a great radiation event once they recovered, and today squamates make up the majority of living reptiles (&gt; 95%). Approximately 10,000 extant species of traditional reptiles are known, with birds adding about 10,000 more, almost twice the number of mammals, represented by about 5,700\u00a0living species (excluding domesticated species).\nMorphology and physiology.\nCirculation.\nAll lepidosaurs and turtles have a three-chambered heart consisting of two atria, one variably partitioned ventricle, and two aortas that lead to the systemic circulation. The degree of mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the three-chambered heart varies depending on the species and physiological state. Under different conditions, deoxygenated blood can be shunted back to the body or oxygenated blood can be shunted back to the lungs. This variation in blood flow has been hypothesized to allow more effective thermoregulation and longer diving times for aquatic species, but has not been shown to be a fitness advantage.\nFor example,\u00a0iguana\u00a0hearts, like the majority of the\u00a0squamate\u00a0hearts, are composed of three chambers with two aorta and one ventricle, cardiac involuntary muscles. The main structures of the heart are the\u00a0sinus venosus, the pacemaker, the\u00a0left atrium, the\u00a0right atrium, the\u00a0atrioventricular valve, the cavum venosum, cavum arteriosum, the cavum pulmonale, the muscular ridge, the ventricular ridge,\u00a0pulmonary veins, and paired\u00a0aortic arches.\nSome squamate species (e.g., pythons and monitor lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become functionally four-chambered hearts during contraction. This is made possible by a muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular systole. Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.\nCrocodilians have an anatomically four-chambered heart, similar to birds, but also have two systemic aortas and are therefore capable of bypassing their pulmonary circulation. In turtles, the ventricle is not perfectly divided, so a mix of aerated and nonaerated blood can occur.\nMetabolism.\nModern non-avian reptiles exhibit some form of cold-bloodedness (i.e. some mix of poikilothermy, ectothermy, and bradymetabolism) so that they have limited physiological means of keeping the body temperature constant and often rely on external sources of heat. Due to a less stable core temperature than birds and mammals, reptilian biochemistry requires enzymes capable of maintaining efficiency over a greater range of temperatures than in the case for warm-blooded animals. The optimum body temperature range varies with species, but is typically below that of warm-blooded animals; for many lizards, it falls in the range, while extreme heat-adapted species, like the American desert iguana \"Dipsosaurus dorsalis\", can have optimal physiological temperatures in the mammalian range, between . While the optimum temperature is often encountered when the animal is active, the low basal metabolism makes body temperature drop rapidly when the animal is inactive.\nAs in all animals, reptilian muscle action produces heat. In large reptiles, like leatherback turtles, the low surface-to-volume ratio allows this metabolically produced heat to keep the animals warmer than their environment even though they do not have a warm-blooded metabolism. This form of homeothermy is called gigantothermy; it has been suggested as having been common in large dinosaurs and other extinct large-bodied reptiles.\nThe benefit of a low resting metabolism is that it requires far less fuel to sustain bodily functions. By using temperature variations in their surroundings, or by remaining cold when they do not need to move, reptiles can save considerable amounts of energy compared to endothermic animals of the same size. A crocodile needs from a tenth to a fifth of the food necessary for a lion of the same weight and can live half a year without eating. Lower food requirements and adaptive metabolisms allow reptiles to dominate the animal life in regions where net calorie availability is too low to sustain large-bodied mammals and birds.\nIt is generally assumed that reptiles are unable to produce the sustained high energy output necessary for long distance chases or flying. Higher energetic capacity might have been responsible for the evolution of warm-bloodedness in birds and mammals. However, investigation of correlations between active capacity and thermophysiology show a weak relationship. Most extant reptiles are carnivores with a sit-and-wait feeding strategy; whether reptiles are cold blooded due to their ecology is not clear. Energetic studies on some reptiles have shown active capacities equal to or greater than similar sized warm-blooded animals.\nRespiratory system.\nAll reptiles breathe using lungs. Aquatic turtles have developed more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca to increase the area for gas exchange. Even with these adaptations, breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs. Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, have found a way around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement to their normal \"axial breathing\". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. Tegu lizards are known to possess a proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.\nCrocodilians actually have a muscular diaphragm that is analogous to the mammalian diaphragm. The difference is that the muscles for the crocodilian diaphragm pull the pubis (part of the pelvis, which is movable in crocodilians) back, which brings the liver down, thus freeing space for the lungs to expand. This type of diaphragmatic setup has been referred to as the \"hepatic piston\". The airways form a number of double tubular chambers within each lung. On inhalation and exhalation air moves through the airways in the same direction, thus creating a unidirectional airflow through the lungs. A similar system is found in birds, monitor lizards and iguanas.\nMost reptiles lack a secondary palate, meaning that they must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate that allows them to continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.\nTurtles and tortoises.\nHow turtles breathe has been the subject of much study. To date, only a few species have been studied thoroughly enough to get an idea of how those turtles breathe. The varied results indicate that turtles have found a variety of solutions to this problem.\nThe difficulty is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow for the type of expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (\"Lissemys punctata\"), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).\nBreathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements. This is because they use their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating that there may be mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.\nSound production.\nCompared with frogs, birds, and mammals, reptiles are less vocal. Sound production is usually limited to hissing, which is produced merely by forcing air though a partly closed glottis and is not considered to be a true vocalization. The ability to vocalize exists in crocodilians, some lizards and turtles; and typically involves vibrating fold-like structures in the larynx or glottis. Some geckos and turtles possess true vocal cords, which have elastin-rich connective tissue.\nHearing in snakes.\nHearing in humans relies on 3\u00a0parts of the ear; the outer ear that directs sound waves into the ear canal, the middle ear that transmits incoming sound waves to the inner ear, and the inner ear that helps in hearing and keeping their balance. Unlike humans and other mammals, snakes do not possess an outer ear, a middle ear, and a tympanum but have an inner ear structure with cochleas directly connected to their jawbone. They are able to feel the vibrations generated from the sound waves in their jaw as they move on the ground. This is done by the use of mechanoreceptors, sensory nerves that run along the body of snakes directing the vibrations along the spinal nerves to the brain. Snakes have a sensitive auditory perception and can tell which direction sound being made is coming from so that they can sense the presence of prey or predator but it is still unclear how sensitive snakes are to sound waves traveling through the air.\nSkin.\nReptilian skin is covered in a horny epidermis, making it watertight and enabling reptiles to live on dry land, in contrast to amphibians. Compared to mammalian skin, that of reptiles is rather thin and lacks the thick dermal layer that produces leather in mammals.\nExposed parts of reptiles are protected by scales or scutes, sometimes with a bony base (osteoderms), forming armor. In lepidosaurs, such as lizards and snakes, the whole skin is covered in overlapping epidermal scales. Such scales were once thought to be typical of the class Reptilia as a whole, but are now known to occur only in lepidosaurs. The scales found in turtles and crocodiles are of dermal, rather than epidermal, origin and are properly termed scutes. In turtles, the body is hidden inside a hard shell composed of fused scutes.\nLacking a thick dermis, reptilian leather is not as strong as mammalian leather. It is used in leather-wares for decorative purposes for shoes, belts and handbags, particularly crocodile skin.\nShedding.\nReptiles shed their skin through a process called ecdysis which occurs continuously throughout their lifetime. In particular, younger reptiles tend to shed once every five to six weeks while adults shed three to four times a year. Younger reptiles shed more because of their rapid growth rate. Once full size, the frequency of shedding drastically decreases. The process of ecdysis involves forming a new layer of skin under the old one. Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between the old and new layers of skin. Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing shedding to occur. Snakes will shed from the head to the tail while lizards shed in a \"patchy pattern\". Dysecdysis, a common skin disease in snakes and lizards, will occur when ecdysis, or shedding, fails. There are numerous reasons why shedding fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and traumatic injuries. Nutritional deficiencies decrease proteolytic enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers. Traumatic injuries on the other hand, form scars that will not allow new scales to form and disrupt the process of ecdysis.\nExcretion.\nExcretion is performed mainly by two small kidneys. In diapsids, uric acid is the main nitrogenous waste product; turtles, like mammals, excrete mainly urea. Unlike the kidneys of mammals and birds, reptile kidneys are unable to produce liquid urine more concentrated than their body fluid. This is because they lack a specialized structure called a loop of Henle, which is present in the nephrons of birds and mammals. Because of this, many reptiles use the colon to aid in the reabsorption of water. Some are also able to take up water stored in the bladder. Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual salt glands in some reptiles.\nIn all reptiles, the urinogenital ducts and the rectum both empty into an organ called a cloaca. In some reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca may open into a urinary bladder, but not all. It is present in all turtles and tortoises as well as most lizards, but is lacking in the monitor lizard, the legless lizards. It is absent in the snakes, alligators, and crocodiles.\nMany turtles and lizards have proportionally very large bladders. Charles Darwin noted that the Galapagos tortoise had a bladder which could store up to 20% of its body weight. Such adaptations are the result of environments such as remote islands and deserts where water is very scarce. Other desert-dwelling reptiles have large bladders that can store a long-term reservoir of water for up to several months and aid in osmoregulation.\nTurtles have two or more accessory urinary bladders, located lateral to the neck of the urinary bladder and dorsal to the pubis, occupying a significant portion of their body cavity. Their bladder is also usually bilobed with a left and right section. The right section is located under the liver, which prevents large stones from remaining in that side while the left section is more likely to have calculi.\nDigestion.\nMost reptiles are insectivorous or carnivorous and have simple and comparatively short digestive tracts due to meat being fairly simple to break down and digest. Digestion is slower than in mammals, reflecting their lower resting metabolism and their inability to divide and masticate their food. Their poikilotherm metabolism has very low energy requirements, allowing large reptiles like crocodiles and large constrictors to live from a single large meal for months, digesting it slowly.\nWhile modern reptiles are predominantly carnivorous, during the early history of reptiles several groups produced some herbivorous megafauna: in the Paleozoic, the pareiasaurs; and in the Mesozoic several lines of dinosaurs. Today, turtles are the only predominantly herbivorous reptile group, but several lines of agamas and iguanas have evolved to live wholly or partly on plants.\nHerbivorous reptiles face the same problems of mastication as herbivorous mammals but, lacking the complex teeth of mammals, many species swallow rocks and pebbles (so called gastroliths) to aid in digestion: The rocks are washed around in the stomach, helping to grind up plant matter. Fossil gastroliths have been found associated with both ornithopods and sauropods, though whether they actually functioned as a gastric mill in the latter is disputed. Salt water crocodiles also use gastroliths as ballast, stabilizing them in the water or helping them to dive. A dual function as both stabilizing ballast and digestion aid has been suggested for gastroliths found in plesiosaurs.\nNerves.\nThe reptilian nervous system contains the same basic part of the amphibian brain, but the reptile cerebrum and cerebellum are slightly larger. Most typical sense organs are well developed with certain exceptions, most notably the snake's lack of external ears (middle and inner ears are present). There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves. Due to their short cochlea, reptiles use electrical tuning to expand their range of audible frequencies.\nVision.\nMost reptiles are diurnal animals. The vision is typically adapted to daylight conditions, with color vision and more advanced visual depth perception than in amphibians and most mammals.\nReptiles usually have excellent vision, allowing them to detect shapes and motions at long distances. They often have poor vision in low-light conditions. Birds, crocodiles and turtles have three types of photoreceptor: rods, single cones and double cones, which gives them sharp color vision and enables them to see ultraviolet wavelengths. The lepidosaurs appear to have lost the duplex retina and only have a single class of receptor that is cone-like or rod-like depending on whether the species is diurnal or nocturnal. In many burrowing species, such as blind snakes, vision is reduced.\nMany lepidosaurs have a photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the parietal eye, which are also called third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland. This \"eye\" does not work the same way as a normal eye does as it has only a rudimentary retina and lens and thus, cannot form images. It is, however, sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.\nSome snakes have extra sets of visual organs (in the loosest sense of the word) in the form of pits sensitive to infrared radiation (heat). Such heat-sensitive pits are particularly well developed in the pit vipers, but are also found in boas and pythons. These pits allow the snakes to sense the body heat of birds and mammals, enabling pit vipers to hunt rodents in the dark.\nMost reptiles, as well as birds, possess a nictitating membrane, a translucent third eyelid which is drawn over the eye from the inner corner. In crocodilians, it protects its eyeball surface while allowing a degree of vision underwater. However, many squamates, geckos and snakes in particular, lack eyelids, which are replaced by a transparent scale. This is called the brille, spectacle, or eyecap. The brille is usually not visible, except for when the snake molts, and it protects the eyes from dust and dirt.\nReproduction.\nReptiles generally reproduce sexually, though some are capable of asexual reproduction. All reproductive activity occurs through the cloaca, the single exit/entrance at the base of the tail where waste is also eliminated. Most reptiles have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis, while squamates, including snakes and lizards, possess a pair of hemipenes, only one of which is typically used in each session. Tuatara, however, lack copulatory organs, and so the male and female simply press their cloacas together as the male discharges sperm.\nMost reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion\u00a0(5), chorion\u00a0(6), and allantois\u00a0(8) are present during embryonic life. The eggshell\u00a0(1) protects the crocodile embryo\u00a0(11) and keeps it from drying out, but it is flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion\u00a0(6) aids in gas exchange between the inside and outside of the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin\u00a0(9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois\u00a0(8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac\u00a0(10) contains amniotic fluid\u00a0(12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion\u00a0(5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac\u00a0(2) surrounding the yolk\u00a0(3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels\u00a0(4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space\u00a0(7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in squamates and many extinct clades of reptiles. Among squamates, many species, including all boas and most vipers, use this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that includes pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.\nAsexual reproduction has been identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake. In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called parthenogenesis, occurs in several species of gecko, and is particularly widespread in the teiids (especially \"Aspidocelis\") and lacertids (\"Lacerta\"). In captivity, Komodo dragons (Varanidae) have reproduced by parthenogenesis.\nParthenogenetic species are suspected to occur among chameleons, agamids, xantusiids, and typhlopids.\nSome reptiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TDSD), in which the incubation temperature determines whether a particular egg hatches as male or female. TDSD is most common in turtles and crocodiles, but also occurs in lizards and tuatara. To date, there has been no confirmation of whether TDSD occurs in snakes.\nLongevity.\nGiant tortoises are among the longest-lived vertebrate animals (over 100 years by some estimates) and have been used as a model for studying longevity. DNA analysis of the genomes of Lonesome George, the iconic last member of \"Chelonoidis abingdonii\", and the Aldabra giant tortoise \"Aldabrachelys gigantea\" led to the detection of lineage-specific variants affecting DNA repair genes that might contribute to our understanding of increased lifespan.\nCognition.\nReptiles are generally considered less intelligent than mammals and birds. The size of their brain relative to their body is much less than that of mammals, the encephalization quotient being about one tenth of that of mammals, though larger reptiles can show more complex brain development. Larger lizards, like the monitors, are known to exhibit complex behavior, including cooperation and cognitive abilities allowing them to optimize their foraging and territoriality over time. Crocodiles have relatively larger brains and show a fairly complex social structure. The Komodo dragon is even known to engage in play, as are turtles, which are also considered to be social creatures, and sometimes switch between monogamy and promiscuity in their sexual behavior. One study found that wood turtles were better than white rats at learning to navigate mazes. Another study found that giant tortoises are capable of learning through operant conditioning, visual discrimination and retained learned behaviors with long-term memory. Sea turtles have been regarded as having simple brains, but their flippers are used for a variety of foraging tasks (holding, bracing, corralling) in common with marine mammals.\nThere is evidence that reptiles are sentient and able to feel emotions including anxiety and pleasure.\nDefense mechanisms.\nMany small reptiles, such as snakes and lizards, that live on the ground or in the water are vulnerable to being preyed on by all kinds of carnivorous animals. Thus, avoidance is the most common form of defense in reptiles. At the first sign of danger, most snakes and lizards crawl away into the undergrowth, and turtles and crocodiles will plunge into water and sink out of sight.\nCamouflage and warning.\nReptiles tend to avoid confrontation through camouflage. Two major groups of reptile predators are birds and other reptiles, both of which have well-developed color vision. Thus the skins of many reptiles have cryptic coloration of plain or mottled gray, green, and brown to allow them to blend into the background of their natural environment. Aided by the reptiles' capacity for remaining motionless for long periods, the camouflage of many snakes is so effective that people or domestic animals are most typically bitten because they accidentally step on them.\nWhen camouflage fails to protect them, blue-tongued skinks will try to ward off attackers by displaying their blue tongues, and the frill-necked lizard will display its brightly colored frill. These same displays are used in territorial disputes and during courtship. If danger arises so suddenly that flight is useless, crocodiles, turtles, some lizards, and some snakes hiss loudly when confronted by an enemy. Rattlesnakes rapidly vibrate the tip of the tail, which is composed of a series of nested, hollow beads to ward off approaching danger.\nIn contrast to the normal drab coloration of most reptiles, the lizards of the genus \"Heloderma\" (the Gila monster and the beaded lizard) and many of the coral snakes have high-contrast warning coloration, warning potential predators they are venomous. A number of non-venomous North American snake species have colorful markings similar to those of the coral snake, an oft cited example of Batesian mimicry.\nAlternative defense in snakes.\nCamouflage does not always fool a predator. When caught out, snake species adopt different defensive tactics and use a complicated set of behaviors when attacked. Some species, like cobras or hognose snakes, first elevate their head and spread out the skin of their neck in an effort to look large and threatening. Failure of this strategy may lead to other measures practiced particularly by cobras, vipers, and closely related species, which use venom to attack. The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs from a venom gland. Some non-venomous snakes, such as American hognose snakes or European grass snake, play dead when in danger; some, including the grass snake, exude a foul-smelling liquid to deter attackers.\nDefense in crocodilians.\nWhen a crocodilian is concerned about its safety, it will gape to expose the teeth and tongue. If this does not work, the crocodilian gets a little more agitated and typically begins to make hissing sounds. After this, the crocodilian will start to change its posture dramatically to make itself look more intimidating. The body is inflated to increase apparent size. If absolutely necessary, it may decide to attack an enemy.\nSome species try to bite immediately. Some will use their heads as sledgehammers and literally smash an opponent, some will rush or swim toward the threat from a distance, even chasing the opponent onto land or galloping after it. The main weapon in all crocodiles is the bite, which can generate very high bite force. Many species also possess canine-like teeth. These are used primarily for seizing prey, but are also used in fighting and display.\nShedding and regenerating tails.\nGeckos, skinks, and some other lizards that are captured by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to thrash, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The detached tails of leopard geckos can wiggle for up to 20 minutes. The tail grows back in most species, but some, like crested geckos, lose their tails for the rest of their lives. In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color than the rest of the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first. In the shingleback skink and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the head, so that the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.\nReptiles that are capable of shedding their tails can partially regenerate them over a period of weeks. The new section will however contain cartilage rather than bone, and will never grow to the same length as the original tail. It is often also distinctly discolored compared to the rest of the body and may lack some of the external sculpting features seen in the original tail.\nRelations with humans.\nIn cultures and religions.\nDinosaurs have been widely depicted in culture since the English palaeontologist Richard Owen coined the name \"dinosaur\" in 1842. As soon as 1854, the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs were on display to the public in south London. One dinosaur appeared in literature even earlier, as Charles Dickens placed a \"Megalosaurus\" in the first chapter of his novel \"Bleak House\" in 1852.\nThe dinosaurs featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media have been used for both education and entertainment. The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, to the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe snake or serpent has played a powerful symbolic role in different cultures. In Egyptian history, the Nile cobra adorned the crown of the pharaoh. It was worshipped as one of the gods and was also used for sinister purposes: murder of an adversary and ritual suicide (Cleopatra). In Greek mythology, snakes are associated with deadly antagonists, as a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as \"earthbound\". The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth. Medusa was one of the three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated. Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to stone with her gaze. After killing her, Perseus gave her head to Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis. The Titans are depicted in art with their legs replaced by bodies of snakes for the same reason: They are children of Gaia, so they are bound to the earth. In Hinduism, snakes are worshipped as gods, with many women pouring milk on snake pits. The cobra is seen on the neck of Shiva, while Vishnu is depicted often as sleeping on a seven-headed snake or within the coils of a serpent. There are temples in India solely for cobras sometimes called \"Nagraj\" (King of Snakes), and it is believed that snakes are symbols of fertility. In the annual Hindu festival of Nag Panchami, snakes are venerated and prayed to. In religious terms, the snake and jaguar are arguably the most important animals in ancient Mesoamerica. \"In states of ecstasy, lords dance a serpent dance; great descending snakes adorn and support buildings from Chichen Itza to Tenochtitlan, and the Nahuatl word \"coatl\" meaning serpent or twin, forms part of primary deities such as Mixcoatl, Quetzalcoatl, and Coatlicue.\" In Christianity and Judaism, a serpent appears in Genesis to tempt Adam and Eve with the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\nThe turtle has a prominent position as a symbol of steadfastness and tranquility in religion, mythology, and folklore from around the world. A tortoise's longevity is suggested by its long lifespan and its shell, which was thought to protect it from any foe. In the cosmological myths of several cultures a \"World Turtle\" carries the world upon its back or supports the heavens.\nMedicine.\nDeaths from snakebites are uncommon in many parts of the world, but are still counted in tens of thousands per year in India. Snakebite can be treated with antivenom made from the venom of the snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of different species of snake is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted; the serum is separated, purified and freeze-dried. The cytotoxic effect of snake venom is being researched as a potential treatment for cancers.\nGila monsters produce compounds that reduce plasma glucose; one of these substances is now used in the anti-diabetes drug exenatide (Byetta), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist like semiglutide (Ozempic). Another toxin from Gila monster saliva has been studied for use as an anti-Alzheimer's drug.\nGeckos have also been used as folk medicine, especially in China, without any evidence that they have any active compounds. Turtles have been used in Chinese traditional medicine for thousands of years, with every part of the turtle believed to have medical benefits (again, without scientific evidence). Growing demand for turtle meat has placed pressure on vulnerable wild populations of turtles.\nCommercial farming.\nCrocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, and are farmed commercially. Their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy. The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles. Farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat. Crocodile leather is made into wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes. Crocodile oil has been used for various purposes.\nSnakes are also farmed, primarily in East and Southeast Asia, and their production has become more intensive in the last decade. Snake farming has been troubling for conservation in the past as it can lead to overexploitation of wild snakes and their natural prey to supply the farms. However, farming snakes can limit the hunting of wild snakes, while reducing the slaughter of higher-order vertebrates like cows. The energy efficiency of snakes is higher than expected for carnivores, due to their ectothermy and low metabolism. Waste protein from the poultry and pig industries is used as feed in snake farms. Snake farms produce meat, snake skin, and antivenom.\nTurtle farming is another known but controversial practice. Turtles have been farmed for a variety of reasons, ranging from food to traditional medicine, the pet trade, and scientific conservation. Demand for turtle meat and medicinal products is one of the main threats to turtle conservation in Asia. Though commercial breeding would seem to insulate wild populations, it can stoke the demand for them and increase wild captures. Even the potentially appealing concept of raising turtles at a farm to release into the wild is questioned by some veterinarians who have had some experience with farm operations. They caution that this may introduce into the wild populations infectious diseases that occur on the farm, but have not (yet) been occurring in the wild.\nReptiles in captivity.\nA herpetarium is a zoological exhibition space for reptiles and amphibians.\nIn the Western world, some snakes (especially relatively docile species such as the ball python and corn snake) are sometimes kept as pets. Numerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including bearded dragons, iguanas, anoles, and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko and the crested gecko).\nTurtles and tortoises are increasingly popular pets, but keeping them can be challenging due to their particular requirements, such as temperature control, the need for UV light sources, and a varied diet. The long lifespans of turtles and especially tortoises mean they can potentially outlive their owners. Good hygiene and significant maintenance is necessary when keeping reptiles, due to the risks of \"Salmonella\" and other pathogens. Regular hand-washing after handling is an important measure to prevent infection.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25410", "revid": "36729223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25410", "title": "Rhode Island", "text": "U.S. state\nRhode Island ( ) is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. It borders Connecticut to its west; Massachusetts to its north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to its south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; and shares a small maritime border with New York, east of Long Island. Rhode Island is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly more than 1.1\u00a0million residents as of 2024[ [update]]. The state's population, however, has continually recorded growth in every decennial census since 1790, and it is the second-most densely populated state after New Jersey. The state takes its name from the eponymous island, though most of its land area is on the mainland. Providence is its capital and most populous city.\nNative Americans lived around Narragansett Bay before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century. Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies in having been founded by a refugee, Roger Williams, who fled religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty. He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker \"Rogue's Island\".\nRhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress, in 1774, and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown, on May 4, 1776. After the American Revolution, during which it was heavily occupied and contested, Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, on February 9, 1778. Because its citizens favored a weaker central government, it boycotted the 1787 convention that had drafted the United States Constitution, which it initially refused to ratify; it finally ratified it on May 29, 1790, the last of the original 13 states to do so.\nThe state was officially named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since the colonial era but came to be commonly known as \"Rhode Island\". On November\u00a03, 2020, the state's voters approved an amendment to the state constitution formally dropping \"and Providence Plantations\" from its full name. Its official nickname, found on its welcome sign, is the \"Ocean State\", a reference to its of coastline and the large bays and inlets that make up about 14% of its area.\nName.\nOrigins.\nDespite its name, most of Rhode Island is on the U.S. mainland. Its official name was \"State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations\" from its beginning in 1636 until 2020, and it is referred to in that manner in the United States Constitution. This name was derived from the merger of Colonial settlements around Narragansett Bay, and outside the jurisdiction of Plymouth colony. The settlements of Rhode Island (Newport and Portsmouth) were on Rhode Island, also known as Aquidneck Island. \"Providence Plantations\" referred to settlements on the mainland of Providence and Warwick.\nIt is unclear how the island came to be named \"Rhode Island\", but two historical events may have been influential:\nThe earliest documented use of the name \"Rhode Island\" for Aquidneck was in 1637 by Roger Williams. The name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words: \"Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Isle of Rodes or Rhode-Island.\" The name \"Isle of Rodes\" is used in a legal document as late as 1646. Dutch maps as early as 1659 call the island \"Red Island\" ().\n2020 change.\nThe first English settlement in Rhode Island was the town of Providence, which the Narragansett granted to Roger Williams in 1636. At that time, Williams obtained no permission from the English crown, as he believed the English had no legitimate claim on Narragansett and Wampanoag territory. Williams traveled to London in 1643, during the English Civil War, to obtain legal recognition of the new settlements. A patent was granted to \"the incorporation of Providence Plantations in Narragansett Bay in New England\" by the Parliamentary committee on Foreign Plantations. After the English Civil war, a Royal Charter was granted in 1663, giving the colony an official name of the \"Governor and Company of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, in New England, in America.\" Following the American Revolution, in 1790 the new state incorporated as the \"State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations\". However, as matter of convenience, the state came to be commonly known as simply \"Rhode Island\".\nThe word \"plantation\" in the state's name became a contested issue during the 20th century and the increased awareness of slavery and its role in early Rhode Island history. The General Assembly voted in 2009 to hold a referendum in November 2010 on removing \"and Providence Plantations\" from the official name. Advocates for excising \"plantation\" argued that the word symbolized a legacy of disenfranchisement for many Rhode Islanders, as well as the proliferation of slavery in the colonies and in the post-colonial United States. Advocates for retaining the name argued that \"plantation\" was simply an archaic synonym for \"colony\" and bore no relation to slavery. The people voted overwhelmingly (78% to 22%) to retain the entire original name.\nIn June 2020, state senator Harold Metts introduced a resolution for another ballot referendum on the subject, saying, \"Whatever the meaning of the term 'plantations' in the context of Rhode Island's history, it carries a horrific connotation when considering the tragic and racist history of our nation.\" Governor Gina Raimondo issued an executive order to remove the phrase from a range of official documents and state websites. In July, amidst the George Floyd protests and nationwide calls to address systemic racism, the resolution referring the question to the voters was passed by both houses of the Rhode Island General Assembly: 69\u20131 in the House of Representatives, and 35\u20130 in the Senate. The change was then approved by voters 52.8% to 47.2% as part of the 2020 United States elections, taking effect in November 2020 upon certification of the results.\nHistory.\nColonial era: 1636\u20131770.\nAt the onset of European colonization what is now Rhode Island was inhabited mainly by five Native American tribes \u2014 by far most of the state's territory was inhabited by the Narragansett, eastern borderlands were occupied by the Wampanoag, south-western coast by the Niantic, western borderlands by the Pequot and northern borderlands by the Nipmuc. In 1636, Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious views, and he settled at the top of Narragansett Bay on land sold or given to him by Narragansett sachem Canonicus. He named the site Providence, \"having a sense of God's merciful providence unto me in my distress\", and it became a place of religious freedom where all were welcome.\nIn 1638 (after conferring with Williams), Anne Hutchinson, William Coddington, John Clarke, Philip Sherman, and other religious dissenters were allowed to settle on Aquidneck Island (also known as Rhode Island), by the Narragansett Sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi. They were given a few items in reciprocity for their generosity. However, as Roger Williams made clear in a letter to John Winthrop in June 1638: \"Sir, concerning the islands Prudence and\u2026Aquedenick\u2026neither of them were sold properly, for a thousand fathom would not have bought either, by strangers. The truth is, not a penny was demanded for either, and what was paid was only gratuity, though I chose, for better assurance and form, to call it sale.\" This settlement was first called Pocasset and then changed in 1639 to Portsmouth. The town was governed by the Portsmouth Compact. The island's southern part became the separate settlement of Newport after disagreements among the founders.\nSamuel Gorton purchased lands at Shawomet in 1642 from the Narragansetts, precipitating a dispute with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1644, Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport united for their common independence as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, governed by an elected council and \"president\". Gorton received a separate charter for his settlement in 1648 which he named Warwick after his patron.\nMetacomet was the Wampanoag tribe's war leader, whom the colonists called King Philip. They invaded and burned down several of the towns in the area during King Philip's War (1675\u20131676), including Providence which was attacked twice. A force of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett Indian village in the Great Swamp in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, on December 19, 1675. In one of the final actions of the war, an Indian associated with Benjamin Church killed King Philip in Bristol, Rhode Island.\nThe colony was amalgamated into the Dominion of New England in 1686, as King James II attempted to enforce royal authority over the autonomous colonies in British North America, but the colony regained its independence under the Royal Charter after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Slaves were introduced in Rhode Island at this time, although there is no record of any law legalizing slave-holding. The colony later prospered under the slave trade, distilling rum to sell in Africa as part of a profitable triangular trade in slaves and sugar with the Caribbean. Rhode Island's legislative body passed an act in 1652 abolishing the holding of slaves (the first British colony to do so), but this edict was never enforced and Rhode Island continued to be heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-revolution era. In 1774, the slave population of Rhode Island was 6.3% of the total (nearly twice the ratio of other New England colonies).\nBrown University was founded in 1764 as the college in the British Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. It was one of nine Colonial colleges granted charters before the American Revolution and was the first college in America to accept students regardless of religious affiliation.\nRevolutionary to Civil War period: 1770\u20131860.\nRhode Island's tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution. At approximately 2 a.m. on June 10, 1772, a band of Providence residents attacked the grounded revenue schooner \"HMS Gasp\u00e9e\", burning it to the waterline for enforcing unpopular trade regulations within Narragansett Bay. Rhode Island was the first of the thirteen colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776. It was also the last of the thirteen colonies to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, and only under threat of heavy trade tariffs from the other former colonies and after assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.\nDuring the Revolution, the British occupied Newport in December 1776. A combined Franco-American force fought to drive them off Aquidneck Island. Portsmouth was the site of the first African-American military unit, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, to fight for the U.S. in the unsuccessful Battle of Rhode Island of August 29, 1778. A month earlier, the appearance of a French fleet off Newport caused the British to scuttle some of their own ships in an attempt to block the harbor. The British abandoned Newport in October 1779, concentrating their forces in New York City. An expedition of 5,500 French troops under Count Rochambeau arrived in Newport by sea on July 10, 1780. The celebrated march to Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781 ended with the defeat of the British at the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake.\nRhode Island was also heavily involved in the Industrial Revolution, which began in America in 1787 when Thomas Somers reproduced textile machine plans which he imported from England. He helped to produce the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, in which Moses Brown of Providence took an interest. Moses Brown teamed up with Samuel Slater and helped to create the second cotton mill in America, a water-powered textile mill. The Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities. With the 1663 colonial charter still in effect, voting was restricted to landowners holding at least $134 in property. At the time of the revolution, 80% of White men in Rhode Island could vote; by 1840, only 40% were still eligible. The charter apportioned legislative seats equally among the state's towns, over-representing rural areas and under-representing the growing industrial centers. Additionally, the charter disallowed landless citizens from filing civil suits without endorsement from a landowner. Bills were periodically introduced in the legislature to expand suffrage, but they were invariably defeated.\nIn 1841, activists led by Thomas W. Dorr organized an extralegal convention to draft a state constitution, arguing the charter government violated the Guarantee Clause in Article Four, Section Four of the United States Constitution. In 1842, the charter government and Dorr's supporters held separate elections, and two rival governments claimed sovereignty over the state. Dorr's supporters led an armed rebellion against the charter government, and Dorr was arrested and imprisoned for treason against the state.\nIn response, the legislature drafted a state constitution which replaced property requirements for American-born citizens with a $1 poll tax, . In a heavily boycotted election in November 1842, voters approved the constitution. Voters also declined to limit the change to \"white\" men, thus re-enfranchising Black men\u2014Black men meeting the property requirements had been able to vote in Rhode Island until 1822. The constitution also ended slavery. Immigrants remained subject to the property requirement, effectively disenfranchising many Irish-Americans and maintaining urban under-representation. In 1849, in Luther v. Borden, the US Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutional question raised in Dorr's rebellion, holding that it was a political question outside its jurisdiction.\nIn the early 19th century, Rhode Island was subject to a tuberculosis outbreak which led to public hysteria about vampirism.\nCivil War.\nDuring the American Civil War, Rhode Island was the first Union state to send troops in response to President Lincoln's request for help from the states. Rhode Island furnished 23,700 fighting men, of whom 1,685 died. On the home front, Rhode Island and the other northern states used their industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war. The United States Naval Academy moved to Rhode Island temporarily during the war.\nIn 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation in the public schools throughout the state.\nGilded Age.\nThe 50 years following the Civil War were a time of prosperity and affluence that author William G. McLoughlin calls \"Rhode Island's halcyon era\". Rhode Island was a center of the Gilded Age and provided a home or summer home to many of the country's most prominent industrialists. This was a time of growth in textile mills and manufacturing and brought an influx of immigrants to fill those jobs, bringing population growth and urbanization. In Newport, New York's wealthiest industrialists created a summer haven to socialize and build grand mansions. Thousands of French-Canadian, Italian, Irish, and Portuguese immigrants arrived to fill jobs in the textile and manufacturing mills in Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket.\nWorld War I.\nDuring World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 soldiers, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the Spanish Influenza.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, rural Rhode Island saw a surge in Ku Klux Klan membership, largely in reaction to large waves of immigrants moving to the state. The Klan is believed to be responsible for burning the Watchman Industrial School in Scituate, which was a school for African-American children.\nGrowth in the modern era: 1929\u2013present.\nSince the Great Depression, the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics. Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children and a large social safety net. However, many urban areas still have a high rate of child poverty. Due to an influx of residents from Boston, increasing housing costs have resulted in more homelessness in Rhode Island.\nThe 350th anniversary of the founding of Rhode Island was celebrated with a free concert held on the tarmac of the Quonset State Airport on August 31, 1986. Performers included Chuck Berry, Tommy James, and headliner Bob Hope.\nGeography.\nRhode Island covers an area of within the New England region of the Northeastern United States and is bordered on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the west by Connecticut, and on the south by Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. It shares a narrow maritime border with New York State between Block Island and Long Island. The state's mean elevation is . It is only wide and long, yet the state has a tidal shoreline on Narragansett Bay and the Atlantic Ocean of .\nRhode Island is nicknamed the Ocean State and has a number of oceanfront beaches. It is mostly flat with no real mountains, and the state's highest natural point is Jerimoth Hill, above sea level. The state has two distinct natural regions. Eastern Rhode Island contains the lowlands of the Narragansett Bay, while Western Rhode Island forms part of the New England upland. Rhode Island's forests are part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.\nNarragansett Bay is a major feature of the state's topography. There are more than 30 islands within the bay; the largest is Aquidneck Island, which holds the municipalities of Newport, Middletown, and Portsmouth. The second-largest island is Conanicut, and the third is Prudence. Block Island lies about off the southern coast of the mainland and separates Block Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean proper.\nA rare type of rock called Cumberlandite can be found in Cumberland (the only place within the United States in which it can be found) and is the state rock. There were initially two known deposits of the mineral, but it is an ore of iron, and one of the deposits was extensively mined for its ferrous content.\nClimate.\nRhode Island lies at the broad transition zone from the continental climates to the north and the subtropical climates to the south. The basic climate features warm to hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. Block Island has an oceanic climate. The highest temperature recorded in Rhode Island was , recorded on August 2, 1975, in Providence. The lowest recorded temperature in Rhode Island was on February 5, 1996, in Greene. Monthly average temperatures range from a high of to a low of .\nRhode Island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes due to its location along the East Coast. Hurricanes that have done significant damage in the state include the 1938 New England hurricane, Hurricane Carol (1954), Hurricane Donna (1960), and Hurricane Bob (1991).\nDue to the relatively flat nature of Rhode Island's seashore, the state is vulnerable to storm surge and coastal erosion, especially as sea levels rise.\nCities and towns.\nRhode Island is divided into five counties but it has no county governments. The entire state is divided into 39 municipalities, which handle all local government affairs.\nThere are 8 cities and 31 towns in Rhode Island. Major population centers today result from historical factors; development took place predominantly along the Blackstone, Seekonk, and Providence Rivers with the advent of the water-powered mill. Providence is the base of a large metropolitan area.\nThe state's 19 largest municipalities ranked by population are: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome of Rhode Island's cities and towns are further partitioned into villages, in common with many other New England states. Notable villages include Kingston in the town of South Kingstown, which houses the University of Rhode Island; Wickford in the town of North Kingstown, the site of an annual international art festival; and Wakefield where the Town Hall is for the Town of South Kingstown.\nLandmarks.\nThe state capitol building is made of white Georgian marble. On top is the world's fourth largest self-supported marble dome. It houses the Rhode Island Charter granted by King Charles II in 1663, the Brown University charter, and other state treasures.\nThe First Baptist Church of Providence is the oldest Baptist church in the Americas, founded by Roger Williams in 1638.\nThe first fully automated post office in the country is in Providence. There are many historic mansions in the seaside city of Newport, including The Breakers, Marble House, and Belcourt Castle. Also there is the Touro Synagogue, dedicated on December 2, 1763, considered by locals to be the first synagogue within the United States (see below for information on New York City's claim), and still serving. The synagogue showcases the religious freedoms established by Roger Williams, as well as impressive architecture in a mix of the classic colonial and Sephardic style. The Newport Casino is a National Historic Landmark building complex that houses the International Tennis Hall of Fame and features an active grass-court tennis club.\nScenic Route 1A (known locally as Ocean Road) is in Narragansett. \"The Towers\" is also in Narragansett featuring a large stone arch. It was once the entrance to a famous Narragansett casino that burned down in 1900. The Towers now serve as an event venue and host the local Chamber of Commerce, which operates a tourist information center.\nThe Newport Tower has been hypothesized to be of Viking origin, although most experts believe it was a Colonial-era windmill.\nEnvironment.\nEnvironmental legislation.\nOn May 29, 2014, Governor Lincoln D. Chafee announced that Rhode Island was one of eight states to release a collaborative Action Plan to put 3.3\u00a0million zero-emission vehicles on its roads by 2025. The plan's purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas and smog-causing emissions. The plan promotes zero-emissions vehicles and investments in the infrastructure to support them.\nIn 2014, Rhode Island received grants of $2,711,685 from the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up Brownfield sites in eight locations. The grants provided communities with funding to assess, clean up, and redevelop contaminated properties, boost local economies, and leverage jobs while protecting public health and the environment.\nIn 2013, the \"Lots of Hope\" program was established in the City of Providence to focus on increasing the city's green space and local food production, improve urban neighborhoods, promote healthy lifestyles and improve environmental sustainability. Supported by a $100,000 grant, the program will partner with the City of Providence, the Southside Community Land Trust, and the Rhode Island Foundation to convert city-owned vacant lots into productive urban farms.\nIn 2012, Rhode Island passed bill S2277/H7412, \"An act relating to Health and Safety \u2013 Environmental Cleanup Objectives for Schools\", informally known as the School Siting Bill. Sponsored by Senator Juan Pichardo and Representative Scott Slater, and signed into law by the governor, it made Rhode Island the first US State to prohibit school construction on Brownfield sites where toxic vapors can potentially affect indoor air quality. It also creates a public participation process whenever a city or town considers building a school on any other kind of contaminated site.\nOn April 14, 2021, the 2021 Act on Climate was signed. It specified a set of increasingly stringent emissions mandates for the state for the first year of every decade from 2020 until 2050, with the ultimate goal of the state producing net-zero emissions by 2050.\nEnvironmental monitoring.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Invasive Plant Atlas of New England monitors invasive weeds throughout New England.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 2020 U.S. census, Rhode Island's population was 1,097,379. The center of population of Rhode Island is in Providence County, in the city of Cranston. A corridor of population can be seen from the Providence area, stretching northwest following the Blackstone River to Woonsocket, where 19th-century mills drove industry and development.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 1,577 homeless people in Rhode Island.\nAccording to the 2020 census, 71.3% of the population was White (68.7% non-Hispanic white), 5.7% was Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.6% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 9.4% from some other race, and 9.3% from two or more races. 16.6% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).\nOf the people residing in Rhode Island, 58.7% were born in Rhode Island, 26.6% were born in a different state, 2.0% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas or born abroad to American parent(s), and 12.6% were foreign born.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2015[ [update]], Rhode Island had an estimated population of 1,056,298, which is an increase of 1,125, or 0.10%, from the prior year and an increase of 3,731, or 0.35%, since the year 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 15,220 people (that is 66,973 births minus 51,753 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 14,001 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 18,965 people, and migration within the country produced a net decrease of 4,964 people. In 2018, The top countries of origin for Rhode Island's immigrants were the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Portugal, Cape Verde and India.\nHispanics in the state make up 12.8% of the population, predominantly Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Guatemalan populations. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Dominican Americans in the country at 5.1% according to latest estimates, putting the state at sixth largest Dominican community in the country.\nAccording to the 2000 U.S. census, 84% of the population aged 5 and older spoke only American English, while 8.07% spoke Spanish at home, 3.80% Portuguese, 1.96% French, 1.39% Italian and 0.78% speak other languages at home accordingly.\nThe state's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 96.1% in 1970 to 76.5% in 2011. In 2011, 40.3% of Rhode Island's children under the age of one belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.\n6.1% of Rhode Island's population were reported as under 5, 23.6% under 18, and 14.5% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 52% of the population.\nAccording to the 2010\u20132015 American Community Survey, the largest ancestry groups were Irish (18.3%), Italian (18.0%), English (10.5%), French (10.4%), and Portuguese (9.3%). Rhode Island has some of the highest percentages of Irish Americans and Italian Americans. Italian Americans make up a plurality in central and southern Providence County and French-Canadian Americans form a large part of northern Providence County. Irish Americans have a strong presence in Newport and Kent counties. Americans of English ancestry still have a presence in the state as well, especially in Washington County, and are often referred to as \"Swamp Yankees\".\nRhode Island has a notable Lusophone community, having a higher percentage of Americans of Portuguese ancestry than any other state, including Portuguese Americans and Cape Verdean Americans. Additionally, the state also has the highest percentage of Liberian immigrants, with more than 15,000 residing in the state. African immigrants, including those from Cape Verde and Liberia, form significant and growing communities in Rhode Island. Rhode Island is one of the few states where Black people of recent foreign origin outnumber Black people of multigenerational American origin (African Americans). Rhode Island also has a sizable Asian community. There is one federally recognized tribe in Rhode Island, the Narragansett Indian Tribe.\nAlthough Rhode Island has the smallest land area of all 50 states, it has the second highest population density, second to that of New Jersey.\nReligion.\nA Pew survey of Rhode Island residents' religious self-identification in 2014 showed the following distribution of affiliations: Catholic 42%, Protestant 30%, Jewish 1%, Jehovah's Witnesses 2%, Buddhism 1%, Mormonism 1%, Hinduism 1%, and Non-religious 20%. The largest Christian denominations as of 2010 were the Catholic Church with 456,598 adherents, the Episcopal Church with 19,377, the American Baptist Churches USA with 15,220, and the United Methodist Church with 6,901 adherents.\nRhode Island has had the highest proportion of Catholic residents of any state according to a study in 2000, mainly due to large Irish, Italian, and French-Canadian immigration in the past; recently, significant Portuguese and various Hispanic or Latino communities have also been established in the state. Though it has the highest overall Catholic percentage of any state, none of Rhode Island's individual counties ranks among the 10 most Catholic in the United States, as Catholics are evenly spread throughout the state.\nAccording to the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) in 2020, 67% of the population were Christian, spread among evangelical and mainline Protestantism, and Roman Catholicism. In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute revealed 72% of the population were Christian.\nRhode Island's Jewish community, centered in the Providence area, emerged during a wave of Jewish immigration predominantly from Eastern Europeans shtetls between 1880 and 1920. The presence of the Touro Synagogue in Newport, the oldest existing synagogue in the United States, emphasizes that these second-wave immigrants did not create Rhode Island's first Jewish community; a comparatively smaller wave of Spanish and Portuguese Jews immigrated to Newport during the colonial era. In 2022, they made up 2% of the state's population.\nThe religiously unaffiliated since 2014 were 20% of the population, though the separate study by the Public Religion Research Institute determined the irreligious increased to 29% of the adult population. In 2022, the religiously unaffiliated declined to 24% of the population.\nNative American tribes.\nToday, many inhabitants of Rhode Island identify as being Native American alone (6,058 people in 2010 census and 7,385 in 2020) or Native American in combination with one or more other races (8,336 people in 2010 census and 15,972 in 2020). Many inhabitants of Rhode Island also reported belonging to tribes in 2010 census, the largest of which were the Narragansett (2,820 people), the Cherokee (987), the Wampanoag (559) and the Pequot (424). Other tribes included the Iroquois (278), the Micmac (101), the Abenaki (100), the Nipmuc (99) and more.\nEconomy.\nThe Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing.\nThe Blackstone River Valley was a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. It was in Pawtucket that Samuel Slater set up Slater Mill in 1793, using the waterpower of the Blackstone River to power his cotton mill. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in textiles. With the Great Depression, most textile factories relocated to southern U.S. states. \nThe textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power.\nOther important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial history is the number of abandoned factories, many of which are now condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of Rhode Island's economy is based on services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. \nThe state's nautical history continues in the 21st century in the form of nuclear submarine construction.\nPer the 2013 American Community Survey, Rhode Island has the highest paid elementary school teachers in the country, with an average salary of $75,028 (adjusted to inflation).\nThe headquarters of Citizens Financial Group, the 14th largest bank in the United States, is in Providence. The Fortune 500 companies CVS Caremark and Textron are based in Woonsocket and Providence, respectively. FM Global, GTECH Corporation, Hasbro, American Power Conversion, Nortek, and Amica Mutual Insurance are all Fortune 1000 companies based in Rhode Island.\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Rhode Island's gross state product in 2024 was $82.5 billion, ranking 44th in the nation.\nRhode Island's 2000 total gross state production was $46.18 billion (adjusted to inflation), placing it 45th in the nation. Its 2000 \"per capita\" personal income was $41,484 (adjusted to inflation), 16th in the nation. Rhode Island has the lowest level of energy consumption per capita of any state. \nAdditionally, Rhode Island was rated as the 5th most energy efficient state in the country. In December 2012, the state's unemployment rate was 10.2%. \nThis has gradually reduced to 3.5% in November 2019, however, the coronavirus pandemic brought the unemployment rate to a high of 18.1% in April 2020. This has since reduced to 10.5% in September 2020 and is projected to further decrease to 7% in October 2020.\nHealth services are (as of 2007) Rhode Island's largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism-related sales at $4.56\u00a0billion (adjusted to inflation) in the year 2000. The third-largest industry is manufacturing. \nIts industrial outputs are submarine construction, shipbuilding, costume jewelry, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, machinery, and boatbuilding. Rhode Island's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs. The largest single product is milk, which in 2017 totaled $4,563,000 in sales.\nRhode Island's taxes were appreciably higher than those of neighboring states, because Rhode Island's income tax was based on 25% of the payer's federal income tax payment. \nFormer governor Donald Carcieri claimed the higher tax rate had an inhibitory effect on business growth in the state and called for reductions to increase the competitiveness of the state's business environment. In 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a new state income tax structure that Governor Carcieri signed into law on June 9, 2010. The income tax overhaul has made Rhode Island competitive with other New England states by lowering its maximum tax rate to 5.99% and reducing the number of tax brackets to three. The state's first income tax was enacted in 1971.\nLargest employers.\nAs of March\u00a02011[ [update]], Rhode Island's largest employers (excluding employees of municipalities) were:\nTransportation.\nBus.\nThe Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) operates statewide intra- and intercity bus transport from its hubs at Kennedy Plaza in Providence, Pawtucket, and Newport. RIPTA bus routes serve 38 of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns. (New Shoreham on Block Island is not served). RIPTA operates 58 routes, including daytime trolley service (using trolley-style replica buses) in Providence and Newport.\nFerry.\nFrom 2000 through 2008, RIPTA offered seasonal ferry service linking Providence and Newport (already connected by highway) funded by grant money from the United States Department of Transportation. Though the service was popular with residents and tourists, RIPTA was unable to continue after the federal funding ended. Service was discontinued as of 2010[ [update]]. The service resumed in 2016 and has been successful, and as of 2025, is provided by Seastreak. The privately run Block Island Ferry links Block Island with Newport and Narragansett with traditional and fast-ferry service, while the Prudence Island Ferry connects Bristol with Prudence Island. Private ferry services also link several Rhode Island communities with ports in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.\nRail.\nThe MBTA Commuter Rail's Providence/Stoughton Line links Providence and T. F. Green Airport with Boston's South Station, with an intermediate stop at Pawtucket/Central Falls and several stations in Massachusetts. The line was later extended southward to Wickford Junction, with service beginning April 23, 2012. The state has considered proposals for extending the MBTA line to Kingston and Westerly, as well as explore the possibility of extending Connecticut's Shore Line East to T.F. Green Airport. Other proposals have contemplated a light-rail tram or rapid bus transit through: Cumberland, Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, Cranston, and Warwick as well. The Federal government's Amtrak Acela Express stops at Providence Station (the only Acela stop in Rhode Island), linking Providence to other cities in the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak's Northeast Regional service makes stops at Providence Station, Kingston, and Westerly.\nRhode Island is one of four states to have high-speed Northeast Corridor tracks capable of 165\u00a0mph. This was due to the fact that in the 1990s, Amtrak upgraded the NEC north of New Haven, CT to get it ready for the high-speed \"Acela Express\" trains and to extend electrified Northeast Corridor services to Boston.\nAviation.\nRhode Island's primary airport for passenger and cargo transport is T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, though Rhode Islanders who wish to travel internationally on direct flights and those who seek a greater availability of flights and destinations often fly through Logan International Airport in Boston.\nLimited access highways.\nInterstate 95 (I-95) runs southwest to northeast across the state, linking Rhode Island with other states along the East Coast. I-295 functions as a partial beltway encircling Providence to the west. I-195 provides a limited-access highway connection from Providence (and Connecticut and New York via I-95) to Cape Cod. Initially built as the easternmost link in the (now cancelled) extension of I-84 from Hartford, Connecticut, a portion of U.S. Route 6 (US\u00a06) through northern Rhode Island is limited-access and links I-295 with downtown Providence.\nSeveral Rhode Island highways extend the state's limited-access highway network. Route\u00a04 is a major north\u2013south freeway linking Providence and Warwick (via I-95) with suburban and beach communities along Narragansett Bay. Route\u00a010 is an urban connector linking downtown Providence with Cranston and Johnston. Route\u00a037 is an important east\u2013west freeway through Cranston and Warwick and links I-95 with I-295. Route\u00a099 links Woonsocket with Providence (via Route\u00a0146). Route 146 travels through the Blackstone Valley, linking Providence and I-95 with Worcester, Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Turnpike. Route\u00a0403 links Route\u00a04 with Quonset Point.\nSeveral bridges cross Narragansett Bay connecting Aquidneck Island and Conanicut Island to the mainland, most notably the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge and the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge.\nBicycle paths.\nThe East Bay Bike Path stretches from Providence to Bristol along the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay, while the Blackstone River Bikeway will eventually link Providence and Worcester. In 2011, Rhode Island completed work on a marked on-road bicycle path through Pawtucket and Providence, connecting the East Bay Bike Path with the Blackstone River Bikeway, completing a bicycle route through the eastern side of the state. The William C. O'Neill Bike Path (commonly known as the South County Bike Path) is an path through South Kingstown and Narragansett. The Washington Secondary Bike Path stretches from Cranston to Coventry, and the Ten Mile River Greenway path runs through East Providence and Pawtucket.\nFuture.\nIn late 2019, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority released a draft of the Rhode Island Transit Master Plan, documenting and describing a variety of proposed improvements and additions to be made to the state's public transit network by 2040. Several different proposals were offered and still under consideration as of December 2020, including implementation of a bus rapid transit system, express bus routes, expansion of Amtrak and MBTA services throughout the state, and construction of a new light rail network through downtown Providence.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nRhode Island has several colleges and universities:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nLocal accent.\nSome Rhode Islanders speak with the distinctive, non-rhotic, traditional Rhode Island accent linguists describe as a cross between New York City and Boston accents (e.g., \"water\" sounds like \"watuh\" ). Many Rhode Islanders distinguish a strong \"aw\" sound (i.e., resist the cot\u2013caught merger of Boston) much like one might hear in New Jersey or New York City; for example, the word \"coffee\" is pronounced . Rhode Islanders sometimes refer to drinking fountains as \"bubblers\", milkshakes as \"cabinets\", and overstuffed foot-long sandwiches (of whatever kind) as \"grinders\".\nFood and beverages.\nRhode Island, like the rest of New England, has a tradition of clam chowder. Both the white New England and the red Manhattan varieties are popular, but there is also a unique clear-broth chowder known as \"Rhode Island Clam Chowder\" available in many restaurants. A culinary tradition in Rhode Island is the \"clam cake\" (also known as a clam fritter outside of Rhode Island), a deep fried ball of buttery dough with chopped bits of clam inside. They are sold by the half-dozen or dozen in most seafood restaurants around the state, and the quintessential summer meal in Rhode Island is chowder and clam cakes.\nThe quahog is a large local clam usually used in a chowder. It is also ground and mixed with stuffing or spicy minced sausage, and then baked in its shell to form a \"stuffie\". Calamari (squid) is sliced into rings and fried as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically served Sicilian-style with sliced banana peppers and marinara sauce on the side. (In 2014, calamari became the official state appetizer.) Clams Casino originated in Rhode Island, invented by Julius Keller, the ma\u00eetre d' in the original Casino next to the seaside Towers in Narragansett. Clams Casino resemble the beloved stuffed quahog but are generally made with the smaller littleneck or cherrystone clam and are unique in their use of bacon as a topping.\nThe official state drink of Rhode Island is \"coffee milk\", a beverage created by mixing milk with coffee syrup. This unique syrup was invented in the state and is sold in almost all Rhode Island supermarkets, as well as its bordering states. Johnnycakes have been a Rhode Island staple since Colonial times, made with corn meal and water then pan-fried much like pancakes.\nSubmarine sandwiches are called \"grinders\" throughout Rhode Island, and the Italian grinder, made with cold cuts such as ham, prosciutto, capicola, salami, and Provolone cheese, is especially popular. Lingui\u00e7a or chouri\u00e7o is a spicy Portuguese sausage often served with peppers and eaten with hearty bread.\nIn popular culture.\nJacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy were married at St. Mary's church in Newport. Their reception took place at Hammersmith Farm, the Bouvier summer home in Newport.\nCartoonist Don Bousquet, a state icon, has made a career out of Rhode Island culture, drawing Rhode Island-themed gags in \"The Providence Journal\" and \"Yankee\" magazine. These cartoons have been reprinted in the \"Quahog\" series of paperbacks (\"I Brake for Quahogs\", \"Beware of the Quahog\", and \"The Quahog Walks Among Us\".) Bousquet has also collaborated with humorist and \"Providence Journal\" columnist Mark Patinkin on two books: \"The Rhode Island Dictionary\" and \"The Rhode Island Handbook\".\nFilm and television.\nRhode Island has been the setting or the filming location of many feature films, documentaries, and television series.\nThe Farrelly brothers and Seth MacFarlane depict Rhode Island in popular culture, often making comedic parodies of the state. MacFarlane's television series \"Family Guy\" is based in a fictional Rhode Island city named Quahog, and notable local events and celebrities are regularly lampooned. Peter Griffin is seen working at the Pawtucket brewery, and other state locations are mentioned.\nThe 1956 film \"High Society\" (starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra) was set in Newport, Rhode Island.\nThe 1974 film adaptation of \"The Great Gatsby\" was also filmed in Newport.\nThe 1998 film \"Meet Joe Black\" was filmed at Aldrich Mansion in the Warwick Neck area of Warwick.\nThe TV series \"Brotherhood\" is set in Rhode Island.\nThe first season of the medical drama series \"Body of Proof\" was filmed entirely in Rhode Island. The show premiered on March 29, 2011.\nThe 2007 Steve Carell and Dane Cook film \"Dan in Real Life\" was filmed in various coastal towns in the state. The sunset scene with the entire family on the beach takes place at Napatree Point.\n\"Jersey Shore\" star Pauly D filmed part of his spin-off \"The Pauly D Project\" in his hometown of Johnston.\nThe Comedy Central cable television series \"Another Period\" is set in Newport during the Gilded Age.\nNotable firsts in Rhode Island.\nRhode Island has been the first in a number of initiatives. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations enacted the first law prohibiting slavery in America on May 18, 1652.\nThe first act of armed rebellion in America against the British Crown was the boarding and burning of the Revenue Schooner \"HMS Gasp\u00e9e\" in Narragansett Bay on June 10, 1772. The idea of a Continental Congress was first proposed at a town meeting in Providence on May 17, 1774. Rhode Island elected the first delegates (Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward) to the Continental Congress on June 15, 1774. The Rhode Island General Assembly created the first standing army in the colonies (1,500 men) on April 22, 1775. On June 15, 1775, the first naval engagement took place in the American Revolution between an American sloop commanded by Capt. Abraham Whipple and an armed tender of the British Frigate \"Rose\". The tender was chased aground and captured. Later in June, the General Assembly created the American Navy when it commissioned the sloops \"Katy\" and , armed with 24 guns and commanded by Abraham Whipple who was promoted to Commodore. Rhode Island was the first Colony to declare independence from Britain on May 4, 1776.\nSlater Mill in Pawtucket was the first commercially successful cotton-spinning mill with a fully mechanized power system in America and was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in the US. The oldest Fourth of July parade in the country is still held annually in Bristol, Rhode Island. The first Baptist church in America was founded in Providence in 1638. Ann Smith Franklin of the Newport \"Mercury\" was the first female newspaper editor in America (August 22, 1762). Touro Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in America, founded in Newport in 1763.\nPelham Street in Newport was the first in America to be illuminated by gaslight in 1806. The first strike in the United States in which women participated occurred in Pawtucket in 1824. Watch Hill has the nation's oldest flying horses carousel that has been in continuous operation since 1850. The motion picture machine was patented in Providence on April 23, 1867. The first lunch wagon in America was introduced in Providence in 1872. The first nine-hole golf course in America was completed in Newport in 1890. The first state health laboratory was established in Providence on September 1, 1894. The Rhode Island State House was the first building with an all-marble dome to be built in the United States (1895\u20131901). The first automobile race on a track was held in Cranston on September 7, 1896. The first automobile parade was held in Newport on September 7, 1899, on the grounds of Belcourt Castle.\nMiscellaneous local culture.\nRhode Island is nicknamed \"The Ocean State\", and the nautical nature of Rhode Island's geography pervades its culture. Newport Harbor, in particular, holds many pleasure boats. In the lobby of T. F. Green, the state's main airport, is a large life-sized sailboat, and the state's license plates depict an ocean wave or a sailboat.\nThe large number of beaches in Washington County lures many Rhode Islanders south for summer vacation.\nThe state constitution protects shore access, including swimming and gathering of seaweed. The 1982 Rhode Island Supreme Court decision in \"State v. Ibbison\" defines the end of private land as the mean high tide line, which is difficult to determine in day-to-day activities, and has resulted in beach access conflicts. Underfunding of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has resulted in lax enforcement against encroachment on public access and building of illegal structures.\nThe state was notorious for organized crime activity from the 1950s into the 1990s when the Patriarca crime family held sway over most of New England from its Providence headquarters.\nRhode Islanders developed a unique style of architecture in the 17th century called the stone-ender.\nRhode Island is the only state to still celebrate Victory over Japan Day, which is officially named \"Victory Day\" but is sometimes referred to as \"VJ Day\". It is celebrated on the second Monday in August.\nNibbles Woodaway, more commonly referred to as \"the Big Blue Bug\", is a 58-foot-long termite mascot for a Providence extermination business. Since its construction in 1980, it has been featured in several movies and television shows, and has come to be recognized as a cultural landmark by many locals. In more recent times, the Big Blue Bug has been given a mask to remind locals and visitors to mask-up during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMusic.\nOn September 2, 1977, music icons the Beach Boys performed a concert at Narragansett Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island attended by 40,000 people, the largest concert audience in Rhode Island history. In 2017, music historians Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise were successful in getting the street where the concert stage stood (510 Narragansett Park Drive in Pawtucket, RI) officially renamed as \"Beach Boys Way\".\nIn April 1986, the music charity Bandwagon was established in Rhode Island. On May 11, 1986, a 150-person celebrity chorus consisting of musicians, journalists (including MTV Networks executive producer Bill Flanagan), TV broadcasters, politicians (including members of the United States Congress), and the heads of human service agencies joined at the recording studio Normandy Sound in Warren, RI to record the charity single \"A Piece of Our Hearts\". Bandwagon's goal was to raise money for American agencies that aid the hungry and homeless and elevate awareness of the plight of the poor in America. Because of its efforts, the project received national recognition when Bandwagon went on to win the coveted Jefferson Award from the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foundation for Outstanding Public Service, joining fellow recipients Oprah Winfrey, President Jimmy Carter, Paul Newman, and Harry Belafonte.\nSports.\nProfessional.\nRhode Island is currently home to two professional minor league teams one whom is affiliated with a major league sports team in nearby Boston; the largest city in the New England region, one being the Providence Bruins ice hockey team of the American Hockey League, who are a top-level minor league affiliate of the Boston Bruins. They play in the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence and won the AHL's Calder Cup during the 1998\u201399 AHL season. The other is Rhode Island FC, a soccer team that began competing in the second tier USL Championship in 2024 at Beirne Stadium located within Bryant University, awaiting the completion of the soccer-specific Tidewater Landing Stadium in Pawtucket in time for the 2025 season.\nThe Pawtucket Red Sox baseball team was a Triple-A International League affiliate of the nearby Boston Red Sox from 1973 to 2020. They played at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket and had won four league titles, the Governors' Cup, in 1973, 1984, 2012, and 2014. McCoy Stadium also has the distinction of being home to the longest professional baseball game ever played \u2013 33 innings.\nThe Providence Reds were a hockey team that played in the Canadian-American Hockey League (CAHL) from 1926 to 1936, and the American Hockey League (AHL) from 1936 to 1977, the last season of which they played as the Rhode Island Reds. The team won the Calder Cup in 1938, 1940, 1949, and 1956. The Reds played at the Rhode Island Auditorium, on North Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island from 1926 through 1972, when the team affiliated with the New York Rangers and moved into the newly built Providence Civic Center. The team name came from the state bird, a rooster known as the Rhode Island Red. They moved to New York in 1977, then to Connecticut in 1997, and are now called the Hartford Wolf Pack.\nThe Reds are the oldest continuously operating minor-league hockey franchise in North America, having fielded a team in one form or another since 1926 in the CAHL. It is also the only AHL franchise to have never missed a season. The AHL returned to Providence in 1992 in the form of the Providence Bruins.\nBefore the great expansion of athletic teams all over the country, Providence and Rhode Island in general played a great role in supporting teams. The Providence Grays won the first World Championship in baseball history in 1884. The team played their home games at the old Messer Street Field in Providence. The Grays played in the National League from 1878 to 1885. They defeated the New York Metropolitans of the American Association in a best of five-game series at the Polo Grounds in New York. Providence won three straight games to become the first champions in major league baseball history. Babe Ruth played for the minor league Providence Grays of 1914 and hit his only official minor league home run for them before the Grays' parent club, the Boston Red Stockings, recalled him.\nRhode Island has deep history with the sport of soccer where the sport was played as early as 1886 when the state's first organized league would be founded, known as the Rhode Island Football Association (RIFA). One of their teams, the Pawtucket Free Wanderers, would establish themselves as a regional power and win the American Cup in 1893. The first championship game of the U.S. Open Cup was also held in 1914 in Pawtucket's Coates Field to a crowd of 10,000. Later, a team known as Pawtucket Rangers F.C. would win the 1941 edition of the U.S. Open Cup (then National Challenge Cup). The Rhode Island Oceaneers would later be founded, and went on to win the 1974 American Soccer League championship. Other former semiprofessional soccer teams of the modern era include the Rhode Island Stingrays of the USL Premier Development League, and the Rhode Island Reds of the National Premier Soccer League, with both leagues regarded as the fourth tier of American soccer.\nThe now-defunct professional football team known as the Providence Steamrollers won the 1928 NFL title. They played in a 10,000 person stadium called the Cycledrome. An unrelated basketball team also known as the Providence Steamrollers played in the Basketball Association of America, which would become the National Basketball Association.\nRhode Island's only rugby league team was the Rhode Island Rebellion, a semi-professional team that was a founding member of the USA Rugby League, which was at the time the top competition in the United States for the sport of rugby league. The Rebellion played their home games at Classical High School in Providence.\nCollegiate and amateur sports.\nThere are four NCAA Division I schools in Rhode Island. All four schools compete in different conferences. The Brown University Bears compete in the Ivy League, the Bryant University Bulldogs compete in the America East Conference, the Providence College Friars compete in the Big East Conference, and the University of Rhode Island Rams compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference. Three of the schools' football teams compete in the Football Championship Subdivision, the second-highest level of college football in the United States. Brown plays FCS football in the Ivy League, Bryant plays FCS football in the Big South Conference before that league merges its football operations with those of the Ohio Valley Conference in 2023, and Rhode Island plays FCS football in CAA Football, the technically separate football league of the Colonial Athletic Association. All four Division I schools in the state compete in an intrastate all-sports competition known as the Ocean State Cup, with Bryant winning the most recent cup in 2011\u201312 academic year.\nFrom 1930 to 1983, America's Cup races were sailed off Newport, and the extreme-sport X Games and Gravity Games were founded and hosted in the state's capital city.\nThe International Tennis Hall of Fame is in Newport at the Newport Casino, site of the first U.S. National Championships in 1881. The Hall of Fame and Museum were established in 1954 by Jimmy Van Alen as \"a shrine to the ideals of the game\".\nRhode Island is also home to the headquarters of the governing body for youth rugby league in the United States, the American Youth Rugby League Association or AYRLA. The AYRLA has started the first-ever rugby league youth competition in Providence Middle Schools, a program at the RI Training School, in addition to starting the first high school competition in the US in Providence Public High School.\nGovernment.\nThe capital of Rhode Island is Providence. The state's governor is Daniel McKee (D), and the lieutenant governor is Sabina Matos (D). Gina Raimondo became Rhode Island's first female governor with a plurality of the vote in the November 2014 state elections. Its United States senators are Jack Reed (D) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D). Rhode Island's two United States representatives are Gabe Amo (D-1) and Seth Magaziner (D-2). \"See congressional districts map.\" Rhode Island is one of a few states that do not have an official governor's residence. \"See List of Rhode Island Governors.\"\nThe state legislature is the Rhode Island General Assembly, consisting of the 75-member House of Representatives and the 38-member Senate. The Democratic Party dominates both houses of the bicameral body; the Republican Party's presence is minor in the state government, with Republicans holding a handful of seats in both the Senate and House of Representatives.\nElections.\nRhode Island's population barely crosses the threshold beyond the minimum of three for additional votes in both the federal House of Representatives and Electoral College; it is well represented relative to its population, with the eighth-highest number of electoral votes and second-highest number of House Representatives per resident. Based on its area, Rhode Island has the highest density of electoral votes of any state.\nFederally, Rhode Island is a reliably Democratic state during presidential elections, usually supporting the Democratic presidential nominee. The state voted for the Republican presidential candidate until 1908. Since then, it has voted for the Republican nominee for president seven times, and the Democratic nominee 17 times. The last 16 presidential elections in Rhode Island have resulted in the Democratic Party winning the Ocean State's Electoral College votes 12 times. In the 1980 presidential election, Rhode Island was one of six states to vote against Republican Ronald Reagan. Reagan was the last Republican to win any of the state's counties in a Presidential election until Donald Trump won Kent County in 2016. In 1988, George H. W. Bush won over 40% of the state's popular vote, something no Republican did until 2024, when Donald Trump won nearly 42% of the vote.\nRhode Island was the Democrats' leading state in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1988 and 2000, and second-best in 1968, 1972, 1996, and 2004. Rhode Island's most one-sided Presidential election result was in 1964, with over 80% of Rhode Island's votes going for Lyndon B. Johnson. In 2004, Rhode Island gave John Kerry more than a 20-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 59.4% of its vote. All but three of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate. The exceptions were East Greenwich, West Greenwich, and Scituate. In 2008, Rhode Island gave Barack Obama a 28-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 63% of its vote. All but one of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate (the exception being Scituate).\nIn a 2020 study, Rhode Island was ranked as the 19th easiest state for citizens to vote in.\nLegislation and taxes.\nRhode Island is one of 21 states that have abolished capital punishment; it was second to do so, just after Michigan, and carried out its last execution in the 1840s. Rhode Island was the second to last state to make prostitution illegal. Until November 2009 Rhode Island law made prostitution legal provided it took place indoors. In a 2009 study Rhode Island was listed as the 9th safest state in the country.\nIn 2011, Rhode Island became the third state in the United States to pass legislation to allow the use of medical marijuana. On May 25, 2022, Rhode Island fully legalized recreational use of marijuana, becoming the nineteenth state to do so. Additionally, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed legislation that allowed civil unions which Governor Lincoln Chafee signed into law on July 2, 2011. Rhode Island became the eighth state to fully recognize either same-sex marriage or civil unions. Same-sex marriage became legal on May 2, 2013, and took effect August 1.\nRhode Island has some of the highest taxes in the country, particularly its property taxes, ranking seventh in local and state taxes, and sixth in real estate taxes.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral bibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25412", "revid": "4967956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25412", "title": "Rock and roll", "text": "Genre of popular music\nRock and roll (often written as rock &amp; roll, rock-n-roll, and rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The origins of rock and roll include a mix of styles, mainly rhythm and blues and country music, with influence from gospel, jazz, boogie-woogie, electric blues, jump blues, swing, and folk music. While rock and roll's early elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.\nBy the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into \"the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll\". For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\nIn the earliest \"rock and roll\" styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by the electric guitar in the mid-to-late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Minimal blues chord progressions such as the twelve-bar blues are commonly used. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or more electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) and a double bass (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars (\"Fender bass\") and drum kits became popular in classic rock.\nRock and roll had a profound influence on contemporary American lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language, and is often portrayed in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Some people believe that the music had a positive influence on the civil rights movement, because of its widespread appeal to both Black American and White American teenagers.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"rock and roll\" is defined by Greg Kot in \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" as the music that originated in the mid-1950s and later developed \"into the more encompassing international style known as rock music\". The term is sometimes also used as synonymous with \"rock music\" and is defined as such in some dictionaries.\nThe phrase \"rocking and rolling\" originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but by the early 20th century was used both to describe the spiritual fervor of black church rituals and as a sexual analogy. A retired Welsh seaman named William Fender can be heard singing the phrase \"rock and roll\" when describing a sexual encounter in his performance of the traditional song \"The Baffled Knight\" to the folklorist James Madison Carpenter in the early 1930s, which he would have learned at sea in the 1800s; the recording can be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website.\nVarious gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became widely popular. \"Bosom of Abraham\", an African-American spiritual that was documented no later than 1867 (just after the Civil War), uses the phrase \"rock my soul\" frequently in a religious sense; this song was later recorded by musicians from various genres, including various gospel musicians and groups (including The Jordanaires), Louis Armstrong (jazz/swing), Lonnie Donegan (skiffle), and Elvis Presley (rock and roll/pop/country). Blues singer Trixie Smith recorded \"My Man Rocks Me with One Steady Roll\" in 1922. It was used in 1940s recordings and reviews of what became known as \"rhythm and blues\" music aimed at a black audience. Huey \"Piano\" Smith credits Cha Cha Hogan, a jump-blues shouter and comic in New Orleans, with popularizing the term in his 1950 song \"My Walking Baby\".\nIn 1934, the song \"Rock and Roll\" by the Boswell Sisters appeared in the film \"Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round\". In 1942, before the concept of rock and roll had been defined, \"Billboard\" magazine columnist Maurie Orodenker started to use the term to describe upbeat recordings such as \"Rock Me\" by Sister Rosetta Tharpe; her style on that recording was described as \"rock-and-roll spiritual singing\". By 1943, the \"Rock and Roll Inn\" in South Merchantville, New Jersey, was established as a music venue. In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio, disc jockey Alan Freed began playing this music style, and referring to it as \"rock and roll\" on his mainstream radio program, which popularized the phrase.\nSeveral sources suggest that Freed found the term, used as a synonym for sexual intercourse, on the record \"Sixty Minute Man\" by Billy Ward and his Dominoes. The lyrics include the line, \"I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long\". Freed did not acknowledge the suggestion about that source in interviews, and explained the term as follows: \"Rock 'n roll is really swing with a modern name. It began on the levees and plantations, took in folk songs, and features blues and rhythm\".\nIn discussing Alan Freed's contribution to the genre, two significant sources emphasized the importance of African-American rhythm and blues. Greg Harris, then the executive director of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, offered this comment to CNN: \"Freed's role in breaking down racial barriers in American pop culture in the 1950s, by leading white and black kids to listen to the same music, put the radio personality 'at the vanguard' and made him 'a really important figure'\". After Freed was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the organization's Web site offered this comment: \"He became internationally known for promoting African-American rhythm and blues music on the radio in the United States and Europe under the name of rock and roll\".\nNot often acknowledged in the history of rock and roll, Todd Storz, the owner of radio station KOWH in Omaha, Nebraska, was the first to adopt the Top 40 format (in 1953), playing only the most popular records in rotation. His station, and the numerous others which adopted the concept, helped to promote the genre: by the mid 50s, the playlist included artists such as \"Presley, Lewis, Haley, Berry and Domino\".\nEarly rock and roll.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of rock and roll have been fiercely debated by commentators and historians of music. There is general agreement that it arose in the Southern United States \u2013 a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts \u2013 through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the African musical tradition with European instrumentation. The migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis, New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo meant that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever before, and as a result heard each other's music and even began to emulate each other's fashions. Radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both groups, the development and spread of the gramophone record, and African-American musical styles such as jazz and swing which were taken up by white musicians, aided this process of \"cultural collision\".\nThe immediate roots of rock and roll lay in the rhythm and blues, then called \"race music\", in combination with either boogie-woogie and shouting gospel or with country music of the 1940s and 1950s. Particularly significant influences were jazz, blues, gospel, country, and folk. Commentators differ in their views of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new music was a re-branding of African-American rhythm and blues for a white market, or a new hybrid of black and white forms.\nIn the 1930s, jazz, and particularly swing, both in urban-based dance bands and blues-influenced country swing (Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican and other similar singers), were among the first music to present African-American sounds for a predominantly white audience. One particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with recognizably rock and roll elements is Big Joe Turner with pianist Pete Johnson's 1938 single \"Roll 'Em Pete\", which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll. The 1940s saw the increased use of blaring horns (including saxophones), shouted lyrics and boogie-woogie beats in jazz-based music. During and immediately after World War II, with shortages of fuel and limitations on audiences and available personnel, large jazz bands were less economical and tended to be replaced by smaller combos, using guitars, bass and drums. In the same period, particularly on the West Coast and in the Midwest, the development of jump blues, with its guitar riffs, prominent beats and shouted lyrics, prefigured many later developments. In the documentary film \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll\", Keith Richards proposes that Chuck Berry developed his brand of rock and roll by transposing the familiar two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar, creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar. This proposal by Richards neglects the black guitarists who did the same thing before Berry, such as Goree Carter, Gatemouth Brown, and the originator of the style, T-Bone Walker. Country boogie and Chicago electric blues supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and roll. Inspired by electric blues, Chuck Berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll, and established the electric guitar as its centerpiece, adapting his rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar, second chord instrument, bass and drums. In 2017, Robert Christgau declared that \"Chuck Berry did in fact invent rock 'n' roll\", explaining that this artist \"came the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together\".\nRock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change, soon after the development of the electric guitar, amplifier, 45 rpm record and modern condenser microphones. There were also changes in the record industry, with the rise of independent labels like Atlantic, Sun and Chess servicing niche audiences and a similar rise of radio stations that played their music. It was the realization that relatively affluent white teenagers were listening to this music that led to the development of what was to be defined as rock and roll as a distinct genre. Because the development of rock and roll was an evolutionary process, no single record can be identified as unambiguously \"the first\" rock and roll record. Contenders for the title of \"first rock and roll record\" include Sister Rosetta Tharpe's \"Strange Things Happening Every Day\" (1944), \"That's All Right\" by Arthur Crudup (1946), \"Move It On Over\" by Hank Williams (1947), \"The Fat Man\" by Fats Domino (1949), Goree Carter's \"Rock Awhile\" (1949), and Jimmy Preston's \"Rock the Joint\" (1949) (later covered by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets in 1952).\n\"Rocket 88\" by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (Ike Turner and his band The Kings of Rhythm and sung by Brenston), was recorded by Sam Phillips in March 1951. This is often cited as the first rock n' roll record. In an interview however, Ike Turner offered this comment: \"I don't think that 'Rocket 88' is rock 'n' roll. I think that 'Rocket 88' is R&amp;B, but I think 'Rocket 88' is the cause of rock and roll existing\".\nIn terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the US and elsewhere, Bill Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\", recorded in April 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly discerned.\nJournalist Alexis Petridis argued that neither Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" nor Presley's version of \"That's Alright Mama\" heralded a new genre: \"They were simply the first white artists' interpretations of a sound already well-established by black musicians almost a decade before. It was a raucous, driving, unnamed variant of rhythm and blues that came complete with lyrics that talked about rocking\".\nOther artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Gene Vincent. Chuck Berry's 1955 classic \"Maybellene\" in particular features a distorted electric guitar solo with warm overtones created by his small valve amplifier. However, the use of distortion was predated by electric blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Guitar Slim, Willie Johnson of Howlin' Wolf's band, and Pat Hare; the latter two also made use of distorted power chords in the early 1950s. Also in 1955, Bo Diddley introduced the \"Bo Diddley beat\" and a unique electric guitar style, influenced by African and Afro-Cuban music and in turn influencing many later artists.\nRhythm and blues.\nRock and roll was strongly influenced by R&amp;B, according to many sources, including an article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" in 1985, titled, \"Rock! It's Still Rhythm and Blues\". In fact, the author stated that the \"two terms were used interchangeably\", until about 1957. The other sources quoted in the article said that rock and roll combined R&amp;B with pop and country music.\nFats Domino was one of the biggest stars of rock and roll in the early 1950s and he was not convinced that this was a new genre. In 1957, he said: \"What they call rock 'n' roll now is rhythm and blues. I've been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans\". According to \"Rolling Stone\", \"this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city-bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&amp;B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties\". Further, Little Richard built his ground-breaking sound of the same era with an uptempo blend of boogie-woogie, New Orleans rhythm and blues, and the soul and fervor of gospel music vocalization.\nLess frequently cited as an influencer, LaVern Baker was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. The Hall remarked that her \"fiery fusion of blues, jazz and R&amp;B showcased her alluring vocals and set the stage for the rock and roll surge of the Fifties\".\nRockabilly.\n\"Rockabilly\" usually (but not exclusively) refers to the type of rock and roll music which was played and recorded in the mid-1950s primarily by white singers such as Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, who drew mainly on the country roots of the music. Presley was greatly influenced by and incorporated his style of music with that of some of the greatest Black musicians like BB King, Arthur Crudup and Fats Domino. His style of music combined with black influences created controversy during a turbulent time in history. Many other popular rock and roll singers of the time, such as Fats Domino and Little Richard, came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition, making the music attractive to white audiences, and are not usually classed as \"rockabilly\".\nPresley popularized rock and roll on a wider scale than any other single performer and by 1956, he had emerged as the singing sensation of the nation.\nBill Flagg who is a Connecticut resident, began referring to his mix of hillbilly and rock 'n' roll music as rockabilly around 1953.\nIn July 1954, Presley recorded the regional hit \"That's All Right\" at Sam Phillips' Sun Studio in Memphis. Three months earlier, on April 12, 1954, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets recorded \"Rock Around the Clock\". Although only a minor hit when first released, when used in the opening sequence of the movie \"Blackboard Jungle\" a year later, it set the rock and roll boom in motion. The song became one of the biggest hits in history, and frenzied teens flocked to see Haley and the Comets perform it, causing riots in some cities. \"Rock Around the Clock\" was a breakthrough success for the group; traditionally, the song has been seen as the major breakthrough for the rock and roll genre, as its immense popularity introduced the music to a global audience. Haley and the Comets' earlier hit, \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" is recognized as the first rock and roll song to hit the mainstream charts, peaking at No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart in May 1953, and notably features guitar fills in place of piano or saxophone. \nIn 1956, the arrival of rockabilly was underlined by the success of songs like \"Folsom Prison Blues\" by Johnny Cash, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" by Perkins, and the No. 1 hit \"Heartbreak Hotel\" by Presley. For a few years it became the most commercially successful form of rock and roll. Later rockabilly acts, particularly performing songwriters like Buddy Holly, would be a major influence on British Invasion acts and particularly on the song writing of the Beatles and through them on the nature of later rock music.\nCover versions.\nMany of the earliest white rock and roll hits were covers or partial re-writes of earlier black rhythm and blues or blues songs. Through the late 1940s and early 1950s, R&amp;B music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style, with artists such as Fats Domino and Johnny Otis speeding up the tempos and increasing the backbeat to great popularity on the juke joint circuit. Before the efforts of Freed and others, black music was taboo on many white-owned radio outlets, but artists and producers quickly recognized the potential of rock and roll. Some of Presley's early recordings were covers of black rhythm and blues or blues songs, such as \"That's All Right\" (a countrified arrangement of a blues number), \"Baby Let's Play House\", \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\", and \"Hound Dog\". The racial lines, however, are rather more clouded by the fact that some of these R&amp;B songs originally recorded by black artists had been written by white songwriters, such as the team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Songwriting credits were often unreliable; many publishers, record executives, and even managers (both white and black) would insert their name as a composer in order to collect royalty checks.\nCovers were customary in the music industry at the time; it was made particularly easy by the compulsory license provision of United States copyright law (still in effect). One of the first relevant successful covers was Wynonie Harris's transformation of Roy Brown's 1947 original jump blues hit \"Good Rocking Tonight\" into a more showy rocker and the Louis Prima rocker \"Oh Babe\" in 1950, as well as Amos Milburn's cover of what may have been the first white rock and roll record, Hardrock Gunter's \"Birmingham Bounce\" in 1949. The most notable trend, however, was white pop covers of black R&amp;B numbers. The more familiar sound of these covers may have been more palatable to white audiences, there may have been an element of prejudice, but labels aimed at the white market also had much better distribution networks and were generally much more profitable. Famously, Pat Boone recorded sanitized versions of songs recorded by the likes of Fats Domino, Little Richard, the Flamingos and Ivory Joe Hunter. Later, as those songs became popular, the original artists' recordings received radio play as well.\nThe cover versions were not necessarily straightforward imitations. For example, Bill Haley's incompletely bowdlerized cover of \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" transformed Big Joe Turner's humorous and racy tale of adult love into an energetic teen dance number, while Georgia Gibbs replaced Etta James' tough, sarcastic vocal in \"Roll With Me, Henry\" (covered as \"Dance With Me, Henry\") with a perkier vocal more appropriate for an audience unfamiliar with the song to which James's song was an answer, Hank Ballard's \"Work With Me, Annie\". Presley's rock and roll version of \"Hound Dog\", taken mainly from a version recorded by the pop band Freddie Bell and the Bellboys, was very different from the blues shouter that Big Mama Thornton had recorded four years earlier. Other white artists who recorded cover versions of rhythm and blues songs included Gale Storm (Smiley Lewis' \"I Hear You Knockin'\"), the Diamonds (The Gladiolas' \"Little Darlin'\" and Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers' \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\"), the Crew Cuts (the Chords' \"Sh-Boom\" and Nappy Brown's \"Don't Be Angry\"), the Fountain Sisters (The Jewels' \"Hearts of Stone\") and the Maguire Sisters (The Moonglows' \"Sincerely\").\nDecline and later developments.\nSome commentators have suggested a decline of rock and roll starting in 1958. The retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher (October 1957), the departure of Presley for service in the United States Army (March 1958), the scandal surrounding Jerry Lee Lewis' marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin (May 1958), riots caused by Bill Haley's ill-fated tour of Europe (October 1958), the deaths of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash (February 1959), the breaking of the Payola scandal implicating major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs (November 1959), the arrest of Chuck Berry (December 1959), and the death of Eddie Cochran in a car crash (April 1960) gave a sense that the initial phase of rock and roll had come to an end.\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, the rawer sounds of Presley, Gene Vincent, Jerry Lee Lewis and Buddy Holly were commercially superseded by a more polished, commercial style of rock and roll influenced pop music. Marketing frequently emphasized the physical looks of the artist rather than the music, contributing to the successful careers of Ricky Nelson, Tommy Sands, Bobby Vee, Jimmy Clanton, and the Philadelphia trio of Bobby Rydell, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian, who all became \"teen idols\".\nSome music historians have also pointed to important and innovative developments that built on rock and roll in this period, including multitrack recording, developed by Les Paul, the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek, and the \"Wall of Sound\" productions of Phil Spector, continued desegregation of the charts, the rise of surf music, garage rock and the Twist dance craze. Surf rock in particular, noted for the use of reverb-drenched guitars, became one of the most popular forms of American rock of the early 1960s.\nWhile the sounds of the British Invasion would become the superseding forms of rock music during the mid-1960s, a few American artists were nonetheless able to achieve chart successes with rock and roll recordings during this time. The most notable of these was Johnny Rivers, who with hits such as \"Memphis\" (1964), popularized a \"Go-go\" style of club-oriented, danceable rock and roll that enjoyed significant success in spite of the ongoing British Invasion. Another example was Bobby Fuller and his group The Bobby Fuller Four, who were especially inspired by Buddy Holly and stuck with a rock and roll style, scoring their most notable hit with \"I Fought the Law\" (1965).\nBritish rock and roll.\nIn the 1950s, Britain was well placed to receive American rock and roll music and culture. It shared a common language, had been exposed to American culture through the stationing of troops in the country, and shared many social developments, including the emergence of distinct youth sub-cultures, which in Britain included the Teddy Boys and the rockers. Trad jazz became popular in the UK, and many of its musicians were influenced by related American styles, including boogie woogie and the blues. The skiffle craze, led by Lonnie Donegan, used amateurish versions of American folk songs and encouraged many of the subsequent generation of rock and roll, folk, R&amp;B and beat musicians to start performing. At the same time British audiences were beginning to encounter American rock and roll, initially through films including \"Blackboard Jungle\" (1955) and \"Rock Around the Clock\" (1956). Both movies featured the Bill Haley &amp; His Comets hit \"Rock Around the Clock\", which first entered the British charts in early 1955 \u2013 four months before it reached the US pop charts \u2013 topped the British charts later that year and again in 1956 and helped identify rock and roll with teenage delinquency.\nThe initial response of the British music industry was to attempt to produce copies of American records, recorded with session musicians and often fronted by teen idols. More grass roots British rock and rollers soon began to appear, including Wee Willie Harris and Tommy Steele. During this period American Rock and Roll remained dominant but in 1958 Britain produced its first \"authentic\" rock and roll song and star, when Cliff Richard reached number 2 in the charts with \"Move It\". At the same time, TV shows such as \"Six-Five Special\" and \"Oh Boy!\" promoted the careers of British rock and rollers like Marty Wilde and Adam Faith. Cliff Richard and his backing band, the Shadows, were the most successful home grown rock and roll based acts of the era. Other leading acts included Billy Fury, Joe Brown, and Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates, whose 1960 hit song \"Shakin' All Over\" became a rock and roll standard.\nAs interest in rock and roll was beginning to subside in America in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was taken up by groups in British cities like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and London. About the same time, a British blues scene developed, initially led by purist blues followers such as Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies who were inspired by American musicians such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Many groups moved towards the beat music of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from skiffle, like the Quarrymen who became the Beatles, producing a form of rock and roll revivalism that carried them and many other groups to national success from about 1963 and to international success from 1964, known in America as the British Invasion. Groups that followed the Beatles included the beat-influenced Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clark Five. Early British rhythm and blues groups with more blues influences include the Animals, the Rolling Stones, and the Yardbirds.\nCultural influence.\nG. C. Altschuler notes that rock and roll influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language, possibly even contributing to the civil rights movement since both African-American and European-American teens enjoyed the music.\nWilliam J. Schafer states that the lyrics of rock and roll songs, dealing with issues such as cars, school, dating, and clothing, described events and conflicts to which most listeners could relate through personal experience. Topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics. This led to the music breaking boundaries and expressing emotions that people were actually feeling but had not discussed openly, leading to an awakening in American youth culture.\nRace.\nIn the crossover of African-American \"race music\" to a growing white youth audience, the popularization of rock and roll involved both black performers reaching a white audience and white musicians performing African-American music. Rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the United States were entering a new phase, with the beginnings of the civil rights movement for desegregation, leading to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that abolished the policy of \"separate but equal\" in 1954, but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the United States. The coming together of white youth audiences and black music in rock and roll inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the US, with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color. According to M. T. Bertrand, many observers saw rock and roll as heralding the way for desegregation in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience. Mina Carson argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves.\nTeen culture.\nRuth Padel claimed that rock and roll was one of the first music genres to define an age group. It gave teenagers a sense of belonging, even when they were alone. Rock and roll emerged with teen culture among the first baby boomer generation, who had greater relative affluence and leisure time and adopted rock and roll as part of a distinct subculture. This involved not just music, absorbed via radio, record buying, jukeboxes and TV programs like \"American Bandstand\", but also extended to film, clothes, hair, cars and motorcycles, and distinctive language. The youth culture exemplified by rock and roll was a recurring source of concern for older generations, who worried about juvenile delinquency and social rebellion, particularly because, to a large extent, rock and roll culture was shared by different racial and social groups.\nIn America, that concern was conveyed even in youth cultural artifacts such as comic books. In \"There's No Romance in Rock and Roll\" from \"True Life Romance\" (1956), a defiant teen dates a rock and roll-loving boy but drops him for one who likes traditional adult music\u2014to her parents' relief. In Britain, where postwar prosperity was more limited, rock and roll culture became attached to the pre-existing Teddy Boy movement, largely working class in origin, and eventually to the rockers. \"On the white side of the deeply segregated music market\", rock and roll became marketed for teenagers, as in Dion and the Belmonts' \"A Teenager in Love\" (1959).\nDance styles.\nFrom its early 1950s beginnings through the early 1960s, rock and roll spawned new dance crazes including the twist. Teenagers found the syncopated backbeat rhythm especially suited to reviving Big Band-era jitterbug dancing. Sock hops, school and church gym dances, and home basement dance parties became the rage, and American teens watched Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand\" to keep up on the latest dance and fashion styles. From the mid-1960s on, as \"rock and roll\" was rebranded as \"rock\", later dance genres followed, leading to funk, disco, house, techno, and hip hop.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an essentially contested concept. Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacredness, faith, and a supernatural being or beings.\nThe origin of religious belief is an open question, with possible explanations including awareness of individual death, a sense of community, and dreams. Religions have sacred histories, narratives, and mythologies, preserved in oral traditions, sacred texts, symbols, and holy places, that may attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena. Religious practice may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, matrimonial and funerary services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, or public service.\nThere are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide, though nearly all of them have regionally based, relatively small followings. Four religions\u2014Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism\u2014account for over 77% of the world's population, and 92% of the world either follows one of those four religions or identifies as nonreligious, meaning that the vast majority of remaining religions account for only 8% of the population combined. The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion, atheists, and agnostics, although many in the demographic still have various religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=\"Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many world religions are also organized religions, most definitively including the Abrahamic religions Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, while others are arguably less so, in particular folk religions, indigenous religions, and some Eastern religions. A portion of the world's population are members of new religious movements. Scholars have indicated that global religiosity may be increasing due to religious countries having generally higher birth rates.\nThe study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, philosophy of religion, comparative religion, and social scientific studies. Theories about religion offer various explanations for its origins and workings, including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief.\nEtymology and history of the concept of \"religion\".\nEtymology.\nThe term \"religion\" comes from both Old French and Anglo-Norman (1200s CE) and means respect for sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity, what is sacred, reverence for the gods. It is ultimately derived from the Latin word . According to Roman philosopher Cicero, comes from : (meaning 'again') + (meaning 'read'), where is in the sense of 'go over', 'choose', or 'consider carefully'. Contrarily, some modern scholars such as Tom Harpur and Joseph Campbell have argued that is derived from : (meaning 'again') + ('bind' or 'connect'), which was made prominent by St. Augustine following the interpretation given by Lactantius in , IV, 28. The medieval usage alternates with \"order\" in designating bonded communities like those of monastic orders: \"we hear of the 'religion' of the Golden Fleece, of a knight 'of the religion of Avys'.\"\nIn classic antiquity, broadly meant conscientiousness, sense of right, moral obligation, or duty to anything. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts; never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge. In general, referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family, neighbors, rulers, and even towards God. was most often used by the ancient Romans not in the context of a relation towards gods, but as a range of general emotions which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context such as hesitation, caution, anxiety, or fear, as well as feelings of being bound, restricted, or inhibited. The term was also closely related to other terms like (which meant \"very precisely\"), and some Roman authors related the term (which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame) to at times. When came into English around the 1200s as religion, it took the meaning of \"life bound by monastic vows\" or monastic orders. The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious and worldly things were separated, was not used before the 1500s. The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities; the Peace of Augsburg marks such an instance, which has been described by Christian Reus-Smit as \"the first step on the road toward a European system of sovereign states.\"\nRoman general Julius Caesar used to mean 'obligation of an oath' when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder used the term to describe the apparent respect given by elephants to the night sky. Cicero used as being related to (worship of the gods).\nIn Ancient Greece, the Greek term () was loosely translated into Latin as in late antiquity. was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the 1st century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others, to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word , which meant too much fear.\nHistory of the concept of \"religion\".\nReligion is a modern concept and not a universal concept across history, cultures or languages. The concept was invented recently in the English language and is found in texts from the 17th century due to events such as the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the Age of Exploration, which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages. Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures, while some followers of various faiths rebuke using the word to describe their own belief system.\nThe concept of \"ancient religion\" stems from modern interpretations of a range of practices that conform to a modern concept of religion, influenced by early modern and 19th century Christian discourse. The concept of religion was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries, despite the fact that ancient sacred texts like the Bible, the Quran, and others did not have a word or even a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written. For example, there is no precise equivalent of religion in Hebrew, and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities. One of its central concepts is , meaning the walk or path sometimes translated as law, which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life. Even though the beliefs and traditions of Judaism are found in the ancient world, ancient Jews saw Jewish identity as being about an ethnic or national identity and did not entail a compulsory belief system or regulated rituals. In the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term (Judaism) as an ethnic term and was not linked to modern abstract concepts of religion or a set of beliefs. The very concept of \"Judaism\" was invented by the Christian Church, and it was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity. The Greek word , which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. is sometimes translated as \"religion\" in today's translations, but the term was understood as generic \"worship\" well into the medieval period. In the Quran, the Arabic word is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed as \"law.\"\nThe Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical South Asia, the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between imperial law and universal or Buddha law, but these later became independent sources of power.\nThough traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with Western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and world religions first entered the English language. Native Americans were also thought of as not having religions and also had no word for religion in their languages either. No one self-identified as a Hindu or Buddhist or other similar terms before the 1800s. \"Hindu\" has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of religion since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this idea.\nAccording to the philologist Max M\u00fcller in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the Latin , was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, piety (which Cicero further derived to mean diligence). M\u00fcller characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called law.\nHistory of \"nonreligion\" and \"secular\".\nAccordingly, other concepts like the \"secular\", \"nonreligion\", and \"atheism\" have been called into question since they are, like religion, not universal concepts as they are not found in many other cultures. Anthropoligically, this is also the case where Western terms and concepts like \"religion\" and \"secular\" do not exist in other cultures. Sociologists and demographers have noted that outside the West, concepts of \"religion\" or \"the secular\" are not always rooted in local culture and may not even be present. Other studies indicate that religion and nonreligion are not necessarily mutually exclusive experiences since there is overlap in individuals regular lives.\nDefinition.\nScholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are, however, two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.\nModern Western.\nThe concept of religion originated in the modern era in the West. Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages. Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition. Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.\nAn increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion. They observe that the way the concept today is used is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the Peace of Westphalia). The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.\nThe anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined religion as a:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.\nAlluding perhaps to Tylor's \"deeper motive\", Geertz remarked that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.\nThe theologian Antoine Vergote took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPeter Mandaville and Paul James intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is \"lived\" as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.\nAccording to the \"MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions\", there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences ... toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience\u2014varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.\nAnthropologists Lyle Steadman and Craig T. Palmer emphasized the communication of supernatural beliefs, defining religion as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... the communicated acceptance by individuals of another individual's \"supernatural\" claim, a claim whose accuracy is not verifiable by the senses.\nClassical.\nFriedrich Schleiermacher in the late 18th century defined religion as \"das schlechthinnige Abh\u00e4ngigkeitsgef\u00fchl\", commonly translated as \"the feeling of absolute dependence\".\nHis contemporary Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as \"the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit.\"\nEdward Burnett Tylor defined religion in 1871 as \"the belief in spiritual beings\". He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or idolatry and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus \"has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them.\" He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.\nIn his book \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\", the psychologist William James defined religion as \"the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine.\" By the term divine James meant \"any object that is god\"like\", whether it be a concrete deity or not\" to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.\nSociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim, in his seminal book \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\", defined religion as a \"unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things\". By sacred things he meant things \"set apart and forbidden\u2014beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.\" Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits. On the contrary, a sacred thing can be \"a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred.\" Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.\nEchoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, Frederick Ferr\u00e9 who defined religion as \"one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively\". Similarly, for the theologian Paul Tillich, faith is \"the state of being ultimately concerned\", which \"is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life.\"\nWhen religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by Richard Dawkins) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.\nAspects.\nBeliefs.\nThe origin of religious belief is an open question, with possible explanations including awareness of individual death, a sense of community, and dreams. Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.\nMythology.\nThe word \"myth\" has several meanings:\nAncient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are usually categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. Joseph Campbell remarked, \"Mythology is often thought of as \"other people's\" religions, and religion can be defined as misinterpreted mythology.\"\nIn sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group, whether or not it is objectively or provably true. Examples include the resurrection of their real-life founder Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the symbolism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.\nPractices.\nThe practices of a religion may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration of a deity (god or goddess), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, religious music, religious art, sacred dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture.\nSocial organisation.\nReligions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized clergy, and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.\nAcademic study.\nA number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: theology, comparative religion, history of religion, evolutionary origin of religions, anthropology of religion, psychology of religion (including neuroscience of religion and evolutionary psychology of religion), law and religion, and sociology of religion.\nDaniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: animism and magic, by E.B. Tylor and J.G. Frazer; the psycho-analytic approach of Sigmund Freud; and further \u00c9mile Durkheim, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Mircea Eliade, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, and Clifford Geertz.\nMichael Stausberg gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including cognitive and biological approaches.\nTheories.\nSociological and anthropological theories of religion generally attempt to explain the origin and function of religion. These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of religious belief and practice.\nOrigins and development.\nThe origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.\nAccording to anthropologists John Monaghan and Peter Just, \"Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success\u2014and many movements come and go with little long-term effect\u2014has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement.\"\nThe development of religion has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their laws and cosmology to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places, religion has been associated with public institutions such as education, hospitals, the family, government, and political hierarchies.\nAnthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, \"it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune.\"\nCultural system.\nWhile religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in religious studies courses, was proposed by Clifford Geertz, who simply called it a \"cultural system\". A critique of Geertz's model by Talal Asad categorized religion as \"an anthropological category\". Richard Niebuhr's (1894\u20131962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though with some interplay.\nSocial constructionism.\nOne modern academic theory of religion, social constructionism, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings. Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, Talal Asad, and Jason \u0100nanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.\nCognitive science.\nCognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, cognitive anthropology, artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, neurobiology, zoology, and ethology. Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.\nHallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with schizophrenia. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomena and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible. Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.\nReligious content is also common in temporal lobe epilepsy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.\nComparativism.\nComparative religion is the branch of the study of religions concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general, the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as ethics, metaphysics, and the nature and form of salvation. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the sacred, numinous, spiritual and divine.\nIn the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification of the main world religions includes Middle Eastern religions (including Zoroastrianism and Iranian religions), Indian religions, East Asian religions, African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.\nClassification.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of comparative religion divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories:\nSome recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited. The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).\nMorphological classification.\nSome religion scholars classify religions as either \"universal religions\" that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, such as the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Jainism, while \"ethnic religions\" are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts. Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.\nDemographic classification.\nThe five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of syncretism), and traditional folk religions.\nA global poll in 2012 surveyed 57 countries and reported that 59% of the world's population identified as religious, 23% as not religious, 13% as convinced atheists, and also a 9% decrease in identification as religious when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries. A follow-up poll in 2015 found that 63% of the globe identified as religious, 22% as not religious, and 11% as convinced atheists. On average, women are more religious than men. Some people follow multiple religions or multiple religious principles at the same time, regardless of whether or not the religious principles they follow traditionally allow for syncretism. Unaffiliated populations are projected to drop, even when taking disaffiliation rates into account, due to differences in birth rates.\nScholars have indicated that global religiosity may be increasing due to religious countries having higher birth rates in general.\nSpecific religions.\nAbrahamic.\nAbrahamic religions are monotheistic religions which believe they descend from Abraham.\nJudaism.\nJudaism is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of ancient Israel and Judah. The Torah is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The Jewish people were scattered after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States. The largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism), Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism.\nChristianity.\nChristianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth (1st century) as presented in the New Testament. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, and as Savior and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the Trinity, which teaches the unity of Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead. Most Christians can describe their faith with the Nicene Creed. As the religion of Byzantine Empire in the first millennium and of Western Europe during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world via missionary work. It is the world's largest religion, with about 2.3 billion followers as of 2015. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:\nThere are also smaller groups, including:\nIslam.\nIslam is a monotheistic religion based on the Quran, one of the holy books considered by Muslims to be revealed by God, and on the teachings (hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the Abrahamic prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before Muhammad. It is the most widely practiced religion of Southeast Asia, North Africa, Western Asia, and Central Asia, while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Europe. There are also several Islamic republics, including Iran, Pakistan, Mauritania, and Afghanistan. With about 1.8 billion followers (2015), almost a quarter of earth's population are Muslims.\nOther denominations of Islam include Nation of Islam, Ibadi, Sufism, Quranism, Mahdavia, Ahmadiyya and non-denominational Muslims. Wahhabism is the dominant Muslim schools of thought in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nOther.\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam are the three most popular Abrahamic faiths, however there are smaller and newer traditions that lay claim to the designation of Abrahamic as well.\nFor example, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, though often called a new religious movement, claims to be a world religion from the line of major Abrahamic religions, while recognizing the Indo-Iranian traditions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism). Founded in 19th-century Iran, it teaches the unity of all great religious traditions as the progressive unfolding of one religion and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets (Krishna, Buddha, Zoroaster), including its founder Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. Its initial phase as B\u00e1bism forms an integral part of its history.\nEven smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including Samaritanism (primarily in Israel and the State of Palestine), the Rastafari movement (primarily in Jamaica), and Druze (primarily in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel).\nThe Druze faith originally developed out of Isma'ilism, and it has sometimes been considered an Islamic school by some Islamic authorities, but Druze themselves do not identify as Muslims. Scholars classify the Druze faith as an independent Abrahamic religion because it developed its own unique doctrines and eventually separated from both Isma'ilism and Islam altogether. One of these doctrines includes the belief that Al-\u1e24\u0101kim bi-Amr All\u0101h was an incarnation of God.\nMandaeism, sometimes also known as Sabianism (after the mysterious Sabians mentioned in the Quran, a name historically claimed by several religious groups), is a Gnostic, monotheistic and ethnic religion. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, consider John the Baptist to be their chief prophet. Mandaeans are the last surviving Gnostics from antiquity.\nEast Asian.\nEast Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese), D\u014d (in Japanese or Korean) or \u0110\u1ea1o (in Vietnamese). They include:\nFolk religions.\nChinese folk religion: the indigenous religions of the Han Chinese, or, by metonymy, of all the populations of the Chinese cultural sphere. It includes the syncretism of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, Wuism, as well as many new religious movements such as Chen Tao, Falun Gong and Yiguandao.\nOther folk and new religions of East Asia and Southeast Asia such as Korean shamanism, Chondogyo, and Jeung San Do in Korea; indigenous Philippine folk religions in the Philippines; Shinto, Shugendo, Ryukyuan religion, and Japanese new religions in Japan; Satsana Phi in Laos; Vietnamese folk religion, and Cao \u0110\u00e0i, H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o in Vietnam.\nIndian religions.\nIndian religions are practiced or were founded in the Indian subcontinent. They are sometimes classified as the \"dharmic religions\", as they all feature dharma, the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.\nHinduism.\nHinduism is also called \"Vaidika Dharma\", the \"dharma\" of the Vedas, although many practitioners refer to their religion as \"San\u0101tana Dharma\" (\"the Eternal Dharma\") which refers to the idea that its origins lie beyond human history. \"Vaidika Dharma\" is a synecdoche describing the similar philosophies of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and related groups practiced or founded in the Indian subcontinent. Concepts most of them share in common include karma, caste, reincarnation, mantras, yantras, and dar\u015bana. Deities in Hinduism are referred to as Deva (masculine) and Devi (feminine). Major deities include Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva, Parvati, Brahma and Saraswati. These deities have distinct and complex personalities yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman. Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religious belief systems, with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times. Therefore, Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world.\nJainism.\nJainism, taught primarily by Rishabhanatha (the founder of ahimsa) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence, truth and anekantavada for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the Karmas, and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra), that is, achieving nirvana. Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the Mahavira as about contemporaneous with the Buddha in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical Parshvanatha, based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama in the 5th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help sentient beings end their suffering (dukkha) by understanding the true nature of phenomena, thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra), that is, achieving nirvana.\nSikhism.\nSikhism is a panentheistic religion founded on the teachings of Guru Nanak and ten successive Sikh gurus in 15th-century Punjab. It is the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, with approximately 30 million Sikhs. Sikhs are expected to embody the qualities of a \"Sant-Sip\u0101h\u012b\"\u2014a saint-soldier, have control over one's internal vices and be able to be constantly immersed in virtues clarified in the Guru Granth Sahib. The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in \"Waheguru\"\u2014represented by the phrase \"ik \u014da\u1e45k\u0101r\", one cosmic divine actioner (God), who prevails in everything, along with a praxis in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.\nIndigenous and folk.\nIndigenous religions or folk religions refers to a broad category of traditional religions that can be characterised by shamanism, animism and ancestor worship, where traditional means \"indigenous, that which is aboriginal or foundational, handed down from generation to generation...\". These are religions that are closely associated with a particular group of people, ethnicity or tribe; they often have no formal creeds or sacred texts. Some religions are syncretic, fusing diverse religious beliefs and practices.\nFolk religions are often omitted as a category in surveys even in countries where they are widely practiced, e.g., in China.\nTraditional African.\nAfrican traditional religion encompasses the traditional religious beliefs of people in Africa. In West Africa, these religions include the Akan religion, Dahomey (Fon) mythology, Efik mythology, Odinani, Serer religion (A \u01adat Roog), and Yoruba religion, while Bushongo mythology, Mbuti (Pygmy) mythology, Lugbara mythology, Dinka religion, and Lotuko mythology come from central Africa. Southern African traditions include Akamba mythology, Masai mythology, Malagasy mythology, San religion, Lozi mythology, Tumbuka mythology, and Zulu mythology. Bantu mythology is found throughout central, southeast, and southern Africa. In north Africa, these traditions include Berber and ancient Egyptian.\nThere are also notable African diasporic religions practiced in the Americas, such as Santeria, Candomble, Vodun, Lucumi, Umbanda, and Macumba.\nIranian.\nIranian religions are ancient religions whose roots predate the Islamization of Greater Iran. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.\nZoroastrianism is based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster in the 6th century BCE. Zoroastrians worship the creator Ahura Mazda. In Zoroastrianism, good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.\nKurdish religions include the traditional beliefs of the Yazidi, Alevi, and Ahl-e Haqq. Sometimes these are labeled Yazd\u00e2nism.\nRelated aspects.\nLaw.\nThe study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980. Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective. Specialists have explored themes in Western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, and discipline and love. Common topics of interest include marriage and the family and human rights. Outside of Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East and pagan Rome.\nStudies have focused on secularization. In particular, the issue of wearing religious symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.\nScience.\nScience acknowledges reason and empirical evidence; and religions include revelation, faith and sacredness whilst also acknowledging philosophical and metaphysical explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.\nThe concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation. The term science emerged in the 19th century out of natural philosophy in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature (natural science), and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts. It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (\"scientia\") and religion (\"religio\") were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.\nIn general, the scientific method gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop theories through elucidation of facts or evaluation by experiments and thus only answers cosmological questions about the universe that can be observed and measured. It develops theories of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as \"de facto\" verities in general parlance, such as the theories of general relativity and natural selection to explain respectively the mechanisms of gravity and evolution.\nReligion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.\nRegarding religion and science, Albert Einstein states (1940): \"For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts...Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up.\"\nMorality.\nMany religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the Five Vows of Jainism, Judaism's halakha, Islam's sharia, Catholicism's canon law, Buddhism's Noble Eightfold Path, and Zoroastrianism's good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.\nReligion and morality are not synonymous. While it is often assumed in Christian thought that morality is ultimately based in religion, it can also have a secular basis.\nThe study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.\nPolitics.\nImpact.\nReligion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of sharia, the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as The Islamic Republic of Iran. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57\u00a0billion people who are Muslims. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the United States, 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely. Christians made up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (in 2014). At the same time, while 23% of US adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one former member of Congress (Kyrsten Sinema, Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation. In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics although it used to be much more important. For instance, same-sex marriage and abortion were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually Catholic) doctrine. Several European leaders are atheists (e.g., France's former president Francois Hollande or Greece's prime minister Alexis Tsipras). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, India is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes. By contrast, countries such as China or Japan are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.\nSecularism.\nSecularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and secular institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the population's religious diversity.\nEconomics.\nOne study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations. In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).\nSociologist and political economist Max Weber has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their Protestant work ethic. According to a study from 2015, Christians hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by Muslims (5.8%), Hindus (3.3%) and Jews (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification Irreligion or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth (while making up only about 20% of the world population, see section on classification).\nHealth.\nMayo Clinic researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: \"Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide.\"\nThe authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature. According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered \"positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity.\"\nAn analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested \"that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.\nViolence.\nCritics such as Hector Avalos, Regina Schwartz, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.\nAnthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing \"religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical.\" He asserts that \"violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion\" and that \"virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.\"\nAnimal sacrifice.\nSome (but not all) religions practise animal sacrifice, the ritual killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a deity. It has been banned in India.\nSuperstition.\nGreek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (\"deisidaimonia\"), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods \"superstitio\". Ancient Greek historian Polybius described superstition in ancient Rome as an \"instrumentum regni\", an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the Empire.\nSuperstition has been described as the non-rational establishment of cause and effect. Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition. Some atheists, deists, and skeptics regard religious belief as superstition.\nThe Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that superstition \"in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion\" (para. #2110). \"Superstition\", it says, \"is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16\u201322\" (para. #2111)\nAgnosticism and atheism.\nThe terms atheist (lack of belief in gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g., Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. Irreligion describes an absence of any religion; antireligion describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general. There are religions (including Buddhism and Taoism) that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or nontheistic. For example, in ancient India, there were large atheistic movements and traditions (Nir\u012b\u015bvarav\u0101da) that rejected the Vedas, such as the atheistic \u0100j\u012bvika and the Aj\u00f1ana which taught agnosticism.\nInterfaith cooperation.\nBecause religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse, many religious practitioners have aimed to band together in interfaith dialogue, cooperation, and religious peacebuilding. The first major dialogue was the Parliament of the World's Religions at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with Christian\u2013Jewish reconciliation representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.\nRecent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together, the \"C1 World Dialogue\", the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism, and a United Nations sponsored \"World Interfaith Harmony Week\".\nCulture.\nCulture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. Paul Tillich looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion. In his own words:\nReligion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.\nErnst Troeltsch, similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion. Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.\nCriticism.\nCriticism of religion is criticism of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of religion, including its political and social implications.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25417", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25417", "title": "Reed College", "text": "Private liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon\nReed College is a private liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon, United States. Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus in the Eastmoreland neighborhood, Tudor-Gothic style architecture, and a forested canyon nature preserve at its center. Reed alumni include 123 Fulbright Scholars, 73 Watson Fellows, and three Churchill Scholars.\nHistory.\nThe Reed Institute (the legal name of the college) was founded in 1908 and held its first classes in 1911. Reed is named for Oregon pioneers Simeon Gannett Reed (1830\u20131895) and Amanda Reed (died 1904). Simeon was an entrepreneur involved in several enterprises, including trade on the Willamette and Columbia Rivers with his close friend and associate, former Portland Mayor William S. Ladd. Unitarian minister Thomas Lamb Eliot, who knew the Reeds from the church choir, is credited with convincing Reed of the need for the school. Reed's will provided for the gift, and Ladd's son, William Mead Ladd, donated 40 acres from the Ladd Estate Company to build the new college. Reed's first president (1910\u20131919) was William Trufant Foster, a former professor at Bates College and Bowdoin College.\nReed was founded explicitly as a reaction against the \"prevailing model of East Coast, Ivy League education\", its lack of varsity athletics, fraternities, and exclusive social clubs \u2013 as well as its coeducational, nonsectarian, and egalitarian status \u2013 intended to foster an intensely academic and intellectual college.\nDuring the 1930s, President Dexter Keezer was concerned about the fraternization among male and female students and the consumption of alcohol by students. A large portion of the Student Council took the position that Oregon's liquor laws did not apply to Reed's campus. Policies restricting the ability of students from visiting the dormitories of the opposite sex were fiercely resisted.\nAfter World War II the college saw its enrollment numbers dramatically increase as veterans began enrolling in the college.\nThe college has developed a reputation for the political progressivism of its student body.\nDistinguishing features.\nAccording to sociologist Burton Clark, Reed is one of the most unusual institutions of higher learning in the United States, featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum. It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110, an intensive introduction to multidisciplinary inquiry, covering ancient Greece and Rome, the Hebrew Bible and ancient Jewish history, and as of 2019, Ancient Mesoamerica and the Harlem Renaissance. Reed also has a TRIGA research reactor on campus, making it the only school in the United States to have a nuclear reactor operated primarily by undergraduates. Reed also requires all students to complete a thesis (a two-semester-long research project conducted under the guidance of professors) during the senior year as a prerequisite of graduation. Upon completion of the senior thesis, students must also pass an oral defense of ninety minutes related to the thesis topic and how the thesis relates to the larger context of the student's studies.\nReed maintains a 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio.\nAlthough letter grades are given to students, grades are de-emphasized at Reed and focus is placed on a narrative evaluation. According to the school, \"a conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student, but the registrar's office does not distribute grades to students, provided that work continues at satisfactory (C or higher) levels. Unsatisfactory grades are reported directly to the student and the student's adviser. Papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed.\" Students can request copies of their official transcript from the registrar. There is no dean's list or honor roll \"per se\", but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an academic year receive academic commendations at the end of the spring semester which are noted on their transcripts. Reed is singled out as having little to no grade inflation over the years; only ten students graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA in the period from 1983 to 2012. (Transcripts are accompanied by a card contextualizing Reed's grading approach so as not to penalize students' graduate school applications.) Although Reed does not award Latin honors to graduates, it confers several awards for academic achievement at commencement, including naming students to Phi Beta Kappa.\nReed has no fraternities or sororities and few NCAA sports teams although physical education classes (which range from kayaking to juggling to capoeira) are required for graduation. Reed also has several intercollegiate athletic clubs, notably the basketball, rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, and soccer teams.\nAcademics.\nReed categorizes its academic program into five Divisions and the Humanities program. Overall, Reed offers five Humanities courses, twenty-six department majors, twelve interdisciplinary majors, six dual-degree programs with other colleges and universities, and programs for pre-medical and pre-veterinary students. Its three most popular majors, based on 2023 graduates, were Psychology, Biology/Biological Sciences, and Computer and Information Sciences.\nHumanities program.\nReed President Richard Scholz in 1922 called the educational program as a whole \"an honest effort to disregard old historic rivalries and hostilities between the sciences and the arts, between professional and cultural subjects, and... the formal chronological cleavage between the graduate and the undergraduate attitude of mind\". The Humanities program, which came into being in 1943 (as the union of two year-long courses, one in \"world\" literature, the other in \"world\" history) is one manifestation of this effort. One change to the program was the addition of a course in Chinese Civilization in 1995. The faculty has also recently approved several significant changes to the introductory syllabus. These changes include expanding the parameters of the course to include more material regarding urban and cultural environments.\nReed's Humanities program includes the mandatory freshman course \"Introduction to Western Humanities\" covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take \"Early Modern Europe\" covering Renaissance thought and literature; \"Modern Humanities\" covering the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and Modernism, and/or \"Foundations of Chinese Civilization\". There is also a Humanities Senior Symposium.\nInterdisciplinary and dual-degree programs.\nReed also offers interdisciplinary programs in American studies, Environmental Studies, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry-Physics, Classics-Religion, Dance/Theatre, History-Literature, International and Comparative Policy Studies (ICPS), Literature-Theatre, Mathematics-Economics, and Mathematics-Physics.\nReed offers dual-degree programs in Computer Science (with University of Washington), Engineering (with Caltech, Columbia University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Forestry or Environmental Management (with Duke University), and Fine Art (with the Pacific Northwest College of Art).\nRankings.\nIn 1995, Reed College refused to participate in the \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" \"best colleges\" rankings, making it the first educational institution in the United States to refuse to participate in college rankings. According to Reed's Office of Admissions the school's refusal to participate is based in 1994 disclosures by \"The Wall Street Journal\" about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in \"U.S. News\" and other popular college guides. \"U.S. News\" maintains that their rankings are \"a very legitimate tool for getting at a certain level of knowledge about colleges.\" In 2019, a team of statistics students recreated the formula used by \"U.S. News\" and were able to identify and quantify the penalty imposed on Reed. The students found the college to be ranked an estimated 52 places below an unbiased application of the U.S. News scoring rubric.\n\"Money\" magazine ranked Reed 512th in the U.S. out of 623 schools evaluated for its 2022 \"Best Colleges for Your Money\" edition.\nReed is ranked as tied for the 63rd best liberal arts college by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" in its 2025 rankings, and tied for 23rd in \"Best Undergraduate Teaching\", tied for 23rd in \"Most Innovative Schools\", and tied for 174th in \"Top Performers on Social Mobility\".\nIn 2006, \"Newsweek\" magazine named Reed as one of twenty-five \"New Ivies\", listing it among \"the nation's elite colleges\". In 2012, \"Newsweek\" ranked Reed the 15th \"most rigorous\" college in the nation.\nReed College ranked in the bottom 6% of four year colleges nationwide in the Brookings Institution's rating of U.S. colleges by incremental impact on alumni earnings 10 years post-enrollment.\nAn episode of Canadian writer Malcolm Gladwell's podcast Revisionist History examines the flaws in the U.S. News system of university rankings. The episode features a project done by a Reed professor of statistics and her students to investigate the mechanics of the ranking algorithm, attempting to see if Reed's ranking had been purposefully devalued because the school refused to submit its information to U.S. News. Previous investigations by Reed students to re-create U.S. News's statistical ranking algorithm found that Reed's correct 2019 rank was #38 instead of its assigned rank of #90.\nAdmissions.\nUndergraduate.\nThe entering class in 2024 was drawn from 9,023 applicants, with 2321 accepted, and 303 students admitted. Median SAT scores were 690 math and 730 reading. Since 2018, to increase student enrollment from historically underrepresented minorities, Reed encourages application to the college's \"Discover Reed Fly-In Program\", an all-inclusive, all-expenses-paid, multi-day campus tour and open to all high school seniors who are US citizens or permanent residents, regardless of race or ethnicity.\nTuition and finances.\nThe total direct cost for the 2022\u201323 academic year, including tuition, fees and room-and-board, was $80,710. Indirect costs (books, supplies, transportation, personal expenses) could be another $3,950. For the 2022\u201323 academic year, the average financial aid package was $52,284. In 2022\u201323 over half of students received financial aid from the college. In 2004, 1.4% of Reed graduates defaulted on their student loans \u2013 below the national Cohort Default Rate average of 5.1%.\nReed's endowment as of June 30, 2023, was $764 million. In the economic downturn that began in late 2007, Reed's total endowment had declined from $455 million in June 2007 to $311 million in June 2009. By the end of 2013, however, the endowment surpassed the $500 million mark.\nAcademic honors.\nReed College administrators claim that the college has the second-highest number of Rhodes scholars among its alumni for any liberal arts college\u201432\u2014as well as over one hundred Fulbright Scholars, over seventy Watson Fellows, and three MacArthur (\"Genius\") Award winners. A very high proportion of Reed graduates go on to earn PhDs, particularly in the natural sciences, history, political science, and philosophy. Reed is ranked third in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn PhDs in all disciplines, after only Caltech and Harvey Mudd. In 1961, \"Scientific American\" declared that second only to Caltech, \"This small college in Oregon has been far and away more productive of future scientists than any other institution in the U.S.\" Reed is ranked first in producing PhDs in biology, second in chemistry and humanities, third in history, foreign languages, and political science, fourth in science and mathematics, fifth in physics and social sciences, sixth in anthropology, seventh in area and ethnic studies and linguistics, and eighth in English literature and medicine.\nLoren Pope, former education editor for \"The New York Times,\" wrote about Reed in her 1996 book \"Colleges That Change Lives,\" saying, \"If you're a genuine intellectual, love the life of the mind, and want to learn for the sake of learning, the place most likely to empower you is not Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago, or Stanford. It is the most intellectual college in the country \u2014 Reed in Portland, Oregon.\"\nDrug use.\nSince the 1960s, Reed has had a reputation for tolerating open drug use among its students. \"The Insider's Guide to the Colleges\", written by the staff of \"Yale Daily News\", notes an impression among students of institutional permissiveness: \"According to students, the school does not bust students for drug or alcohol use unless they cause harm or embarrassment to another student.\"\nIn April 2008, student Alex Lluch died of a heroin overdose in his on-campus dorm room. His death prompted revelations of several previous incidents, including the near-death heroin overdose of another student only months earlier. College president Colin Diver said \"I don't honestly know\" whether the drug death was an isolated incident or part of a larger problem. \"When you say Reed,\" Diver said, \"two words often come to mind. One is brains. One is drugs.\" Local reporter James Pitkin of the newspaper \"Willamette Week\" editorialized that \"Reed College, a private school with one of the most prestigious academic programs in the U.S., is one of the last schools in the country where students enjoy almost unlimited freedom to experiment openly with drugs, with little or no hassles from authorities\", though \"Willamette Week\" stated the following week concerning Pitkin's editorial: \"As of press time, almost 500 responses, many expressing harsh criticism of \"Willamette Week\", had been posted on our website.\"\nIn March 2010, another student died of drug-related causes in his off-campus residence. This led \"The New York Times\" to conclude that \"Reed... has long been known almost as much for its unusually permissive atmosphere as for its impressively rigorous academics.\" Law enforcement authorities promised to take action, including sending undercover agents to Reed's annual Renn Fayre celebration.\nIn February 2012, the Reed administration chose to call the police following the discovery of \"two to three pounds of marijuana and a small amount of ecstasy and LSD in the on-campus apartment of two juniors.\" Following campus debate, Reed's president at the time, Colin Diver, issued a letter to students and staff, saying the college would not tolerate illegal drug use on campus: \"Such behavior endangers the health and welfare of the entire community, attracts potentially dangerous criminal activity on campus, undermines the academic mission of the college, and violates the college's obligations under state and federal law.\"\nPolitical and social activism.\nReed has a reputation for being politically left-of-center.\nDuring the McCarthy era of the 1950s, then-president Duncan Ballantine fired Marxist philosopher Stanley Moore, a tenured professor, for his failure to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigation. According to an article in the college's alumni magazine, \"because of the decisive support expressed by Reed's faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College's experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities. Elsewhere in the academic world both tenured and nontenured professors with alleged or admitted communist party ties were fired with relatively little fuss or protest. At Reed, however, opposition to the political interrogations of the teachers was so strong that some believed the campus was in danger of closure.\" A statement of \"regret\" by the Reed administration and board of trustees was published in 1981, formally revising the judgment of the 1954 trustees. In 1993, then-President Steve Koblik invited Moore to visit the college, and in 1995 the last surviving member of the Board that fired Moore expressed his regret and apologized to him.\nReedies Against Racism.\nOn September 26, 2016, students organized a boycott of all college operations in participation with the National Day of Boycott, a national day of protest which was proposed by actor Isaiah Washington on Twitter in response to the issue of police brutality against African-Americans. Following the boycott, students created an activist group called Reedies Against Racism (RAR) and presented a list of demands for the college they described as being on behalf of students from marginalized backgrounds. The primary demand concerned Reed's mandatory freshman humanities course, proposing that the course either be changed to be more inclusive of world literature and classics or to be made not mandatory. One element of the class deemed racist by the protestors was the use of the 1978 Steve Martin song \"King Tut\" in a discussion about cultural appropriation. Students began a protest campaign against the curriculum by sitting in during lectures with signs with quotations from various African-American and non-white academics. Other protests separate from the humanities course also included efforts to shout down speakers, including Kimberly Peirce after she was accused of profiting from transphobia while making the film \"Boys Don't Cry\". The group eventually focused on Reed's banking relationship with Wells Fargo, based on allegations that the bank had invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline project and the private prison industry, and staged an occupation of Reed's Eliot Hall.\nThere was some opposition to the lecture protests, notably by Reed professor of English Luc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez Valdivia, who stated that a protest during her lecture on Sappho would amplify her pre-existing case of PTSD. In November 2017, Chris Bodenner of \"The Atlantic\" wrote about growing student resentment toward the tactics of RAR. In response to protests the faculty decided to undergo the decennial review process a year early, as well as to complete the process in three months instead of the usual year. In January 2018, Humanities 110 chair professor Libby Drumm announced in a campus-wide email that the course curriculum would be restructured after years of faculty discussion and in response to student feedback as well as input from an external review committee composed of humanities faculty from other institutes, adopting a \"four-module structure\" that would include texts from the Americas and allow greater flexibility in the curriculum which would be integrated beginning fall 2018. The external review had not in fact been completed nor reviewed at the time of the announcement.\nFollowing \"a contentious year of protests, including an anti-racism sit-in in Kroger's office\", college president John Kroger resigned, effective June 2018.\nCampus.\nThe Reed College campus was established on a tract of land in southeast Portland known in 1910 as Crystal Springs Farm, a part of the Ladd Estate, formed in the 1870s from original land claims. The college's grounds include of contiguous land, including a wooded wetland known as Reed Canyon.\nPortland architect A. E. Doyle developed a plan, never implemented in full, modeled on the University of Oxford's St. John's College. The original campus buildings (including the Library, the Old Dorm Block, and what is now the primary administration building, Eliot Hall) are brick Tudor Gothic buildings in a style similar to Ivy League campuses. In contrast, the science section of campus, including the physics, biology, and psychology (originally chemistry) buildings, were designed in the Modernist style. The Psychology Building, completed in 1949, was designed by Modernist architect Pietro Belluschi at the same time as his celebrated Equitable Building in downtown Portland.\nThe campus and buildings have undergone several phases of growth and there are now 21 academic and administrative buildings and 18 residence halls. Since 2004, Reed's campus has expanded to include adjacent properties beyond its historic boundaries, such as the Birchwood Apartments complex and former medical administrative offices on either side of SE 28th Avenue, and the Parker House, across SE Woodstock from Prexy. At the same time the Willard House (donated to Reed in 1964), across from the college's main entrance at SE Woodstock and SE Reed College Place, was converted from faculty housing to administrative use. Reed announced on July 13, 2007, that it had purchased the Rivelli farm, a tract of land south of the Garden House and west of Botsford Drive. Reed's \"immediate plans for the acquired property include housing a small number of students in the former Rivelli home during the 2007\u201308 academic year. Longer term, the college anticipates that it may seek to develop the northern portion of the property for additional student housing\".\nResidence halls.\nReed houses 945 students in 18 residence halls on campus and several college-owned houses and apartment buildings on or adjacent to campus. Residence halls on campus range from the traditional (i.e., Gothic Old Dorm Block, referred to as \"ODB\") to the eclectic (e.g., Anna Mann, a Tudor-style cottage built in the 1920s by Reed's founding architect A. E. Doyle, originally used as a women's hall), language houses (Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Chinese), \"temporary\" housing, built in the 1960s (Cross Canyon \u2013 Chittick, Woodbridge, McKinley, Griffin), to more recently built dorms (Bragdon, Naito, Sullivan). There are also theme residence halls including everything from substance-free living to Japanese culture to music to a dorm for students interested in outdoors activities (hiking, climbing, bicycling, kayaking, skiing, etc.). The college's least-loved complex (as measured by applications to the college's housing lottery), MacNaughton and Foster-Scholz, is known on campus as \"Asylum Block\" because of its post-World War II modernist architecture and interior spaces dominated by long, straight corridors lined with identical doors, said by students to resemble that of an insane asylum. Until 2006, it was thought that these residence halls had been designed by architect Pietro Belluschi.\nUnder the 10-year campus master plan adopted in 2006, Foster-Scholz is scheduled to be demolished and replaced and MacNaughton to be remodeled. According to the master plan, \"The College's goal is to provide housing on or adjacent to the campus that accommodates 75% of the [full-time] student population. At present, the College provides on-campus housing for 838 students\".\nIn Spring 2007, the college broke ground on the construction of a new quadrangle called the Grove, with four new Leed certified residence halls (Aspen, Sequoia, Sitka, Bidwell). They opened on the northwest side of campus in Fall 2008. A new Spanish House residence was completed. Together, the five new residences added 142 new beds.\nReed also has off-campus housing. Many houses in the Woodstock and Eastmoreland Portland neighborhoods are traditionally rented to Reed students.\nOn February 21, 2018, Reed announced the construction of the \"largest residence hall in its history\". Completed in Fall 2019, Trillium houses an additional 180 students, boosting Reed's housing capacity to nearly 80% of the student body, up from 68%. The addition of Trillium guarantees housing for both freshman and sophomores, as students were formerly subjected to a housing lottery after freshman year. The new building is also designed to meet \"LEED Platinum standards\", and Reed is currently evaluating proposals to put solar panels on the roof.\nReed Canyon.\nThe Reed College Canyon, a natural area and national wildlife preserve, bisects the campus, separating the academic buildings from many of the residence halls (the so-called \"cross-canyon halls\"). The canyon is filled by Crystal Creek Springs, a natural spring that drains into Johnson Creek.\nCanyon Day, a tradition dating back to 1915, is held twice a year. On Canyon Day students and Reed neighbors join canyon crew workers to spend a day helping with restoration efforts.\nA landmark of the campus, the Blue Bridge, spans the canyon. This bridge replaced the unique cantilevered bridge that served in that spot between 1959 and 1991, which \"featured stressed plywood girders \u2013 the first time this construction had been used on a span of this size: a straight bridge long and high. It attracted great architectural interest during its lifetime\".\nA new pedestrian and bicycle bridge spanning the canyon was opened in fall 2008. This bridge, dubbed the \"Bouncy Bridge\", \"Orange Bridge\", and in some cases the \"Amber Bridge\" by students, is long, about a third longer than the Blue Bridge, and \"connect[s] the new north campus quad to Gray Campus Center, the student union, the library, and academic buildings on the south side of campus\".\nDouglas F. Cooley Gallery.\nReed's Cooley Gallery is an internationally recognized contemporary art space located at the entrance to the Eric V. Hauser Memorial Library. It was established in 1988 as the result of a gift from Susan and Edward Cooley in honor of their late son. The Cooley Gallery has exhibited international artists such as Mona Hatoum, Al Held, David Reed and Gregory Crewdson as well as the contemporary art collection of Michael Ovitz. In pursuit of its mission to support the curriculum of the art, art history, and humanities programs at Reed, the gallery produces three or four exhibitions each year, along with lectures, colloquia, and artist visits. The gallery is currently under the directorship of Stephanie Snyder, who succeeded founding director Susan Fillin-Yeh in 2004.\nFood services.\nThe cafeteria, known simply as \"Commons\", has a reputation for ecologically sustainable food services. The commons dining hall is operated by Bon App\u00e9tit and food is purchased on an item-by-item basis. Suiting the student body, vegan and vegetarian dishes feature heavily on the menu. It is currently the only cafeteria on the small campus, with the exception of Canyon Cafe (formerly Caffe Circo and Caffe Paradiso), a small cafe on the other side of campus which also operated by board points. Scrounging is a long tradition at Reed College allowing students to offer unfinished Commons' food to students without board points from their trays as they are returned to be washed.\nThe Reed College Co-ops are a theme community that reside in the Farm and Garden Houses, after many years on the first floor of MacNaughton Hall. These are the only campus dorms that are independent of the school's board plan. They traditionally throw an alternative \"Thanksgiving\" celebration that has sometimes included a square-dance. The Co-ops house students who purchase and prepare food together, sharing chores and conducting weekly, consensus-based meetings. It is a close community valuing sustainability, organic food, consensus-based decisions, self-government, music, and plants.\nThe Paradox (\"Est. in the 80s\") is a student-run coffee shop located on campus. In 2003 the Paradox opened a second coffee shop, dubbing it the \"Paradox Lost\" (an allusion to John Milton's \"Paradise Lost,\") at the southern end of the biology building, in the space commonly called the \"Bio Fishbowl\". The new north-campus dorms, which opened in fall 2008, feature yet another small cafe, originally dubbed \"Cafe Paradiso\", thereby providing three coffee shops within a campus. The recent addition of a circus-themed mural to the cafe prompted a name change, and it now operates as Caffe Circo. This third shop is not student-run but is operated by Bon App\u00e9tit. Bon App\u00e9tit has a monopoly on the food services at Reed as they are the only ones who accept board points; written into their contract is the prohibition of food carts on campus.\n2021 collapse of the Aubrey R. Watzek Sports Center.\nOn February 15, 2021, the Aubrey R. Watzek Sports Center, collapsed during Winter Storm Uri. Both gyms that were part of the sports center collapsed. The collapse was attributed to excess snow piling up on the roof of the building causing a support truss to fracture and strain several others, causing the roof to collapse. The sports center was serving as a COVID-19 testing center, and the destruction of the testing center resulted in the loss of testing kits and other medical supplies needed for COVID-19 testing.\nIcons and student life.\nGriffin.\nThe official mascot of Reed is the griffin. In mythology, the griffin often pulled the chariot of the sun; in canto 32 of Dante's \"Commedia\" the griffin is associated with the Tree of Knowledge. The griffin was featured on the coat-of-arms of founder Simeon Reed and is now on the official seal of Reed College. Though the school does not have varsity sports, the mascot features prominently throughout campus iconography outside of an athletic context.\nSchool color.\nThe official school color of Reed is Richmond Rose. Over the years, institutional memory of this fact has faded and the color appearing on the school's publications and merchandise has darkened to a shade of maroon. The most common examples of \"Richmond Rose\" are the satin tapes securing the degree certificate inside a Reed College diploma.\nSchool song.\nThe school song, \"Fair Reed\", is sung to the tune of the 1912 popular song \"Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms\". It may be imitative of the Harvard anthem \"Fair Harvard\", which is also sung to the same tune. It was composed by former president William Trufant Foster shortly after Reed's founding and is rarely heard today.\nAn unofficial alma mater, \"Epistemology Forever\", sung to the tune of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", has been sung by Reed students since the 1950s.\nStudents' nicknames.\nReed students and alumni referred to themselves as \"Reedites\" in the early years of the college. This term faded out in favor of the now ubiquitous \"Reedie\" after World War II. Around campus, prospective students are called \"prospies\".\nUnofficial mottos and folklore.\nAn unofficial motto of Reed is \"Communism, Atheism, Free Love\", and can be found in the Reed College Bookstore on sweaters, T-shirts, etc. It was a label that the Reed community claimed from critics during the 1920s as a \"tongue-in-cheek slogan\" in reference to Reed's nonconformism. Reed's founding president William T. Foster's outspoken opposition against the entrance of the United States into World War I, as well as the college's support for feminism, its adherence to academic freedom (i.e., inviting a leader of the Socialist Party of America to speak on campus about the Russian Revolution\u2019s potential effect on militarism, emancipation of women, and ending the persecution of Jews), and its nonsectarian status made the college a natural target for what was originally meant to be a pejorative slur.\nThe faux Reed Seal has changed over the years. In its original form the griffin was holding a hammer and sickle in its paws. Later versions had the griffin wearing boxing gloves.\nOne of the unofficial symbols of Reed is the Doyle Owl, a roughly concrete statue that has been continuously stolen and re-stolen since about 1919. The original Doyle Owl (originally \"House F Owl\" after the dormitory named House F that later became Doyle dormitory) was a garden sculpture from the neighborhood stolen by House F residents as a prank (there is a photo of House F residents around the original owl that has been made into a T-shirt). The on-campus folklore of events surrounding the Doyle Owl is sufficiently large that, in 1983, a senior thesis was written on the topic of the Owl's oral history. The original Doyle Owl was destroyed many years ago; the current avatar is Doyle Owl number 13, plus or minus 11. At the present time only one Owl is being shown.\nPaideia.\nEach January, before the beginning of second-semester classes, the campus holds an interim period called Paideia (drawn from the Greek, meaning 'education'). Originally conceived and approved by the faculty in 1968 for unstructured independent study, or \"UIS\", Paideia ran for the full month of January from 1969 to 1981, supervised by a committee of faculty, staff and students. This festival of learning takes the form of classes and seminars put on by anyone who wishes to teach, including students, professors, staff members, and outside educators invited on-campus by members of the Reed Community. The classes are intended to be informal, yet intellectual activities free of the usual academic pressure endemic to Reed. Many such classes are explicitly trivial (one long-running tradition is to hold an underwater basket weaving class), while others are trivially academic (such as \"Giant Concrete Gnome Construction\", a class that, incidental to building monolithic gnomes, includes some content relating to the construction of pre-Christian monoliths). More structured classes (such as martial arts seminars and mini-classes on obscure academic topics), tournaments, and film festivals round out the schedule, which is different every year. The objective of Paideia is not only to learn new (possibly non-useful) things, but to turn the tables on students and encourage them to teach.\nIn his 2005 Stanford commencement lecture, Apple Inc. founder and Reed dropout Steve Jobs credited a Reed calligraphy class taught by Robert Palladino for his focus on choosing quality typefaces for the Macintosh. While the full calligraphy course is no longer taught at Reed, Paideia usually features a short course on the subject in addition to the informal, weekly gatherings (currently held every Thursday night) of aspiring calligraphy enthusiasts.\nRenn Fayre.\nRenn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration with a different theme each year. Born in the 1960s as an actual renaissance fair, it has long since lost all connection to anachronism and the Renaissance, although its name has persisted. The event is initiated by a procession of seniors throwing their thesis notes in a large bonfire after the completed theses are submitted.\nReed Arts Week.\nReed Arts Week is a celebration of the arts at Reed College. It includes music, dance, theater, films, creative writing and the visual arts. In addition to student performances, major artists perform original works and participate in master class work with members of the Reed College community.\nStudent organizations.\nAccording to Reed's website, each semester, a $130 student body fee \"is collected from each full-time student by the business office, acting as agent for the student senate. The fee underwrites publication of the student newspaper and extracurricular activities, and partially supports the student union and ski cabin.\"\nStudent body funds (totaling roughly $370,000 annually) are distributed each semester to groups that place among the top 40 organizations in the semester's funding poll. The funding poll uses a voting system in which each organization provides a description that is ranked by each member of the student body with either 'top six,' 'approve,' 'no opinion,' 'disapprove.' A former 'deep six' was eliminated from the system in 2019. These ranks are then tabulated by assigning numbers to each rank and summing across all voters. Afterwards, the top forty organizations present their budgets to the student body senate during Funding Circus. The following day the senate makes decisions about each budget in a process called Funding Hell.\nThe school's student-run newspaper, \"The Reed College Quest \"or simply the \"Quest,\" has been published since 1913, and its radio station KRRC had been broadcasting, with a few interruptions, from 1955 The station now broadcasts online only at krrc.fm.\nAlthough some student organizations partnered with outside groups such as Oxfam or Planned Parenthood are more structured, most student organizations are highly informal. There is no formal process for forming a student organization at Reed; a group of students (or a single student) announcing themselves as or just considering themselves a student organization is enough, but groups that desire funding from the school's Student Activities office or Student Body Fees must register with Student Activities or through the Student Senate. The Reed archive of comic books and graphic novels, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various beer gardens throughout the year and during Renn Fayre, has existed for many years. Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective\u2014dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture\u2014have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.\nReed has ample recreational facilities on campus, a ski cabin on Mount Hood, recreational clubs such as the Reed Outing Club (ROC), and Club Sports (with college-paid coaches), including ultimate frisbee, co-ed soccer, rugby, basketball, and squash.\nCrime.\nAccording to a \"Washington Post\" analysis of federal campus safety data from 2014, Reed College had 12.9 reports of rape per 1,000 students, the \"highest total of reports of rape\" per 1,000 students of any college in the nation on its main campus.\nIn 2012, Reed College had the third highest reported sexual assault rate among U.S. colleges and universities. It is unclear whether this high reporting rate arises from the college and student body fostering an environment that is more supportive of reporting sexual assault or due to a higher offending pattern by students. in 2013 there were 19 reported forcible sexual offenses among the approximately 1,400 students at the college. In 2011, a student member of Reed's Judicial Board resigned over the college's handling of sexual assault cases. An investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that those found responsible in cases of sexual assault frequently faced few consequences, while the lives of the victims were left in turmoil.\nNotable people.\nNotable Reed alumni include Tektronix co-founder Howard Vollum (1936), physicist James J.

It is an error by the trier of law (judge), or the trier of fact (the jury, or the judge if it is a bench trial), or malfeasance by one of the trying attorneys, which results in an unfair trial. It is to be distinguished from harmless errors which do not rise to a level which brings the validity of the judgment into question and thus do not lead to a reversal upon appeal.\nReversible error criteria.\nA finding of reversible error requires that one or more of the appellant's \"substantial rights\" be affected, or the evidence in question be of such character as to have affected the outcome of the trial. (See e.g., \"https://\", 174 P.3d 948 (Mont. 2008).) The criteria for determining what constitutes a \"substantial right\" is somewhat vague, however, being that it varies from case to case, each presenting a slightly different interpretation of which rights are essential, or significant enough to warrant this sort of legal protection. Therefore, reversible errors resulting from the violation of an individual's \"substantial right(s)\" must be considered on an individual basis.\nExamples of reversible errors.\nReversible errors include:\nIf an appellate court determines that reversible error occurred, it may reverse the judgement of the lower court and order a new trial on such terms and conditions as are found to be just.\nTechnically, attorney misconduct is not reversible error. Failure of the judge to remedy it during the trial is reversible error. In cases such as unfairly or illegally concealing evidence, there is no error on the part of the court but the court's decision may still be vacated and the matter returned for a new trial, because there is no other way for justice to be granted."}
{"id": "25421", "revid": "35410883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25421", "title": "Rapping", "text": "Type of musical delivery involving rhythmic speech\nRapping (also dropping, rhyming, flowing, spitting, emceeing, or MCing) is an artistic form of vocal delivery and emotive expression that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and [commonly] street vernacular\". It is usually performed over a backing beat or musical accompaniment. The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said, e.g., lyrics), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed off-time to musical accompaniment. It also differs from singing, which varies in pitch and does not always include words. Because they do not rely on pitch inflection, some rap artists may play with timbre or other vocal qualities. Rap is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, and so commonly associated with the genre that it is sometimes called \"rap music\". \nPrecursors to modern rap music include the West African griot tradition, certain vocal styles of blues and jazz, an African-American insult game called playing the dozens (see Battle rap and Diss), and 1960s African-American poetry. Stemming from the hip-hop cultural movement, rap music originated in the Bronx, New York City, in the early 1970s and became part of popular music later that decade. Rapping developed from the announcements made over the microphone at parties by DJs and MCs, evolving into more complex lyrical performances.\nRap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, or beatboxer when performing live. Much less commonly a rapper can decide to perform a cappella. When a rap or hip-hop artist is creating a song, \"track\", or record, done primarily in a production studio, most frequently a producer provides the beat(s) for the MC to flow over. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant \"to lightly strike\", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word has been used in the English language since the 16th century. In the 1960s the word became a slang term meaning \"to converse\" in African American vernacular, and very soon after that came to denote the musical style.\nRap music has played a significant role in expressing social and political issues, addressing topics such as racism, poverty, and political oppression. By the 21st century, rap had become a global phenomenon, influencing music, fashion, and culture worldwide.\nHistory.\nEtymology and usage.\nThe English verb \"rap\" has various meanings; these include \"to strike, especially with a quick, smart, or light blow\", as well \"to utter sharply or vigorously: to rap out a command\". The \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" gives a date of 1541 for the first recorded use of the word with the meaning \"to utter (esp. an oath) sharply, vigorously, or suddenly\". Wentworth and Flexner's \"Dictionary of American Slang\" gives the meaning \"to speak to, recognize, or acknowledge acquaintance with someone\", dated 1932, and a later meaning of \"to converse, esp. in an open and frank manner\". It is these meanings from which the musical form of \"rapping\" derives, and this definition may be from a shortening of repartee. A \"rapper\" refers to a performer who \"raps\". By the late 1960s, when Hubert G. Brown changed his name to H. Rap Brown, \"rap\" was a slang term referring to an oration or speech, such as was common among the \"hip\" crowd in the protest movements, but it did not come to be associated with a musical style for another decade.\n\"Rap\" was used to describe talking on records as early as 1970 on Isaac Hayes' album \"...To Be Continued\" with the track name \"Monologue: Ike's Rap I\". Hayes' \"husky-voiced sexy spoken 'raps' became key components in his signature sound\". Del the Funky Homosapien similarly states that \"rap\" was used to refer to talking in a stylistic manner in the early 1970s: \"I was born in '72 ... back then what rapping meant, basically, was you trying to convey something\u2014you're trying to convince somebody. That's what rapping is, it's in the way you talk.\"\nIt is sometimes claimed that \u201crap\" is an acronym for '\"R\"hythm \"A\"nd \"P\"oetry', but this does not reflect the history of the word and thus is best seen as a backronym.\nRoots and origin.\nSimilarities to rapping can be observed in West African chanting folk traditions. Centuries before hip-hop music existed, the griots of West Africans were delivering stories rhythmically, over drums and sparse instrumentation. Such resemblances have been noted by many modern artists, modern day \"griots\", spoken word artists, mainstream news sources, and academics. Rap lyrics and music are part of the \"Black rhetorical continuum\", continuing past traditions of expanding upon them through \"creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies\".\nBlues, rooted in the work songs and spirituals of slavery, was first played by black Americans around the time of the Emancipation Proclamation. This way of preaching, unique to African-Americans, called the Black sermonic tradition influenced singers and musicians such as 1940s African-American gospel group The Jubalaires. The Jubalaire's songs \"The Preacher and the Bear\" (1941) and \"Noah\" (1946) are precursors to the genre of rap music. The Jubalaires and other African-American singing groups during the blues, jazz, and gospel era are examples of the origins and development of rap music. Grammy-winning blues musician/historian Elijah Wald and others have argued that the blues were being rapped as early as the 1920s. Wald went so far as to call hip hop \"the living blues\". A notable recorded example of rapping in blues was the 1950 song \"Gotta Let You Go\" by Joe Hill Louis.\nJazz, which developed from the blues and other African-American and European musical traditions and originated around the beginning of the 20th century, has also influenced hip hop and has been cited as a precursor of hip hop. Not just jazz music and lyrics but also jazz poetry. According to John Sobol, the jazz musician and poet who wrote \"Digitopia Blues\", rap \"bears a striking resemblance to the evolution of jazz both stylistically and formally\". Boxer Muhammad Ali anticipated elements of rap, often using rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, both for when he was trash talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism outside of boxing, paving the way for The Last Poets in 1968, Gil Scott-Heron in 1970, and the emergence of rap music in the 1970s. An editor of the newspaper, The Fayetteville Observer interviewed Bill Curtis of the disco-funk music group the Fatback Band in 2020. Curtis noted that when he moved to the Bronx in the 1970s he heard people rapping over scratched records throughout the neighborhoods and radio DJs were rapping before the genre was released on retail recordings. The Fatback Band released the first rap recording, \"King Tim III (Personality Jock)\", a few weeks before the Sugarhill Gang in 1979. In another interview Curtis said: \"There was rapping in the Bronx and the cats there had been doing it for a while...Fatback certainly didn't invent rap or anything. I was just interested in it and I guess years later we were the first to record it. At the time you could already see cats rapping everywhere in the streets and doing stuff.\"\nWith the decline of disco in the early 1980s rap became a new form of expression. Rap arose from musical experimentation with rhyming, rhythmic speech. Rap was a departure from disco. Sherley Anne Williams refers to the development of rap as \"anti-Disco\" in style and means of reproduction. The early productions of Rap after Disco sought a more simplified manner of producing the tracks they were to sing over. Williams explains how Rap composers and DJ's opposed the heavily orchestrated and ritzy multi-tracks of Disco for \"break beats\" which were created from compiling different records from numerous genres and did not require the equipment from professional recording studios. Professional studios were not necessary therefore opening the production of rap to the youth who as Williams explains felt \"locked out\" because of the capital needed to produce Disco records.\nMore directly related to the African-American community were items like schoolyard chants and taunts, clapping games, jump-rope rhymes, some with unwritten folk histories going back hundreds of years across many nationalities. Sometimes these items contain racially offensive lyrics.\nProto-rap.\nIn his narration between the tracks on George Russell's 1958 jazz album \"New York, N.Y.\", the singer Jon Hendricks recorded something close to modern rap, since it all rhymed and was delivered in a hip, rhythm-conscious manner. Art forms such as spoken word jazz poetry and comedy records had an influence on the first rappers. Coke La Rock, often credited as hip-hop's first MC cites the Last Poets among his influences, as well as comedians such as Wild Man Steve and Richard Pryor. Comedian Rudy Ray Moore released under the counter albums in the 1960s and 1970s such as \"This Pussy Belongs to Me\" (1970), which contained \"raunchy, sexually explicit rhymes that often had to do with pimps, prostitutes, players, and hustlers\", and which later led to him being called \"The Godfather of Rap\".\nGil Scott-Heron, a jazz poet/musician, has been cited as an influence on rappers such as Chuck D and KRS-One. Scott-Heron himself was influenced by Melvin Van Peebles, whose first album was 1968's \"Brer Soul\". Van Peebles describes his vocal style as \"the old Southern style\", which was influenced by singers he had heard growing up in South Chicago. Van Peebles also said that he was influenced by older forms of African-American music: \"... people like Blind Lemon Jefferson and the field hollers. I was also influenced by spoken word song styles from Germany that I encountered when I lived in France.\"\nDuring the mid-20th century, the musical culture of the Caribbean was constantly influenced by the concurrent changes in American music. As early as 1956, deejays were toasting over dubbed Jamaican beats. It was called \"rap\", expanding the word's earlier meaning in the African-American community\u2014\"to discuss or debate informally.\"\nThe early rapping of hip-hop developed out of DJ and master of ceremonies' announcements made over the microphone at parties, and later into more complex raps. Grandmaster Caz stated: \"The microphone was just used for making announcements, like when the next party was gonna be, or people's moms would come to the party looking for them, and you have to announce it on the mic. Different DJs started embellishing what they were saying. I would make an announcement this way, and somebody would hear that and they add a little bit to it. I'd hear it again and take it a little step further 'til it turned from lines to sentences to paragraphs to verses to rhymes.\"\nOne of the first rappers at the beginning of the hip hop period, at the end of the 1970s, was also hip hop's first DJ, DJ Kool Herc. Herc, a Jamaican immigrant, started delivering simple raps at his parties, which some claim were inspired by the Jamaican tradition of toasting. However, Kool Herc himself denies this link (in the 1984 book \"Hip Hop\"), saying, \"Jamaican toasting? Naw, naw. No connection there. I couldn't play reggae in the Bronx. People wouldn't accept it. The inspiration for rap is James Brown and the album \"Hustler's Convention\"\". Herc also suggests he was too young while in Jamaica to get into sound system parties: \"I couldn't get in. Couldn't get in. I was ten, eleven years old,\" and that while in Jamaica, he was listening to James Brown: \"I was listening to American music in Jamaica and my favorite artist was James Brown. That's who inspired me. A lot of the records I played were by James Brown.\"\nHowever, in terms of what was identified in the 2010s as \"rap\", the source came from Manhattan. Pete DJ Jones said the first person he heard rap was DJ Hollywood, a Harlem (not Bronx) native who was the house DJ at the Apollo Theater. Kurtis Blow also said the first person he heard rhyme was DJ Hollywood. In a 2014 interview, Hollywood said: \"I used to like the way Frankie Crocker would ride a track, but he wasn't syncopated to the track though. I liked [WWRL DJ] Hank Spann too, but he wasn't on the one. Guys back then weren't concerned with being musical. I wanted to flow with the record\". And in 1975, he ushered in what became known as the \"hip hop\" style by rhyming syncopated to the beat of an existing record uninterruptedly for nearly a minute. He adapted the lyrics of Isaac Hayes' \"Good Love 6-9969\" and rhymed it to the breakdown part of \"Love Is the Message\". His partner Kevin Smith, better known as Lovebug Starski, took this new style and introduced it to the Bronx hip hop set that until then was composed of DJing and b-boying (or beatboxing), with traditional \"shout out\" style rapping.\nThe style that Hollywood created and his partner introduced to the hip hop set quickly became the standard. Before that time, most MC rhymes, based on radio DJs, consisted of short patters that were disconnected thematically; they were separate unto themselves. But by using song lyrics, Hollywood gave his rhyme an inherent flow and theme. This was quickly noticed, and the style spread. By the end of the 1970s, artists such as Kurtis Blow and the Sugarhill Gang were starting to receive radio airplay and make an impact far outside of New York City, on a national scale. Blondie's 1981 single, \"Rapture\", was the first number-one single on the United States \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart to feature rap vocals.\nOld-school hip hop.\nOld school rap (1979\u201384) was \"easily identified by its relatively simple raps\" according to AllMusic, \"the emphasis was not on lyrical technique, but simply on good times\", one notable exception being Melle Mel, who set the way for future rappers through his socio-political content and creative wordplay.\nGolden age.\nGolden age hip hop (the mid-1980s to early '90s) was the time period where hip-hop lyricism went through its most drastic transformation \u2013 writer William Jelani Cobb says \"in these golden years, a critical mass of mic prodigies were literally creating themselves and their art form at the same time\" and Allmusic writes, \"rhymers like PE's Chuck D, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and Rakim basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop\". The golden age is considered to have ended around 1993\u201394, marking the end of rap lyricism's most innovative period.\nFlow.\n\"Flow\" is defined as \"the rhythms and rhymes\" of a hip-hop song's lyrics and how they interact \u2013 the book \"How to Rap\" breaks flow down into rhyme, rhyme schemes, and rhythm (also known as cadence). 'Flow' is also sometimes used to refer to elements of the delivery (pitch, timbre, volume) as well, though often a distinction is made between the flow and the delivery.\nStaying on the beat is central to rap's flow \u2013 many MCs note the importance of staying on-beat in \"How to Rap\" including Sean Price, Mighty Casey, Zion I, Vinnie Paz, Fredro Starr, Del the Funky Homosapien, Tech N9ne, People Under the Stairs, Twista, B-Real, Mr Lif, 2Mex, and Cage.\nMCs stay on beat by stressing syllables in time to the four beats of the musical backdrop. Poetry scholar Derek Attridge describes how this works in his book \"Poetic Rhythm\" \u2013 \"rap lyrics are written to be performed to an accompaniment that emphasizes the metrical structure of the verse\". He says rap lyrics are made up of, \"lines with four stressed beats, separated by other syllables that may vary in number and may include other stressed syllables. The strong beat of the accompaniment coincides with the stressed beats of the verse, and the rapper organizes the rhythms of the intervening syllables to provide variety and surprise\".\nThe same technique is also noted in the book \"How to Rap\", where diagrams are used to show how the lyrics line up with the beat \u2013 \"stressing a syllable on each of the four beats gives the lyrics the same underlying rhythmic pulse as the music and keeps them in rhythm ... other syllables in the song may still be stressed, but the ones that fall in time with the four beats of a bar are the only ones that need to be emphasized in order to keep the lyrics in time with the music\".\nIn rap terminology, 16-bars is the amount of time that rappers are generally given to perform a guest verse on another artist's song; one bar is typically equal to four beats of music.\nHistory.\nOld school flows were relatively basic and used only few syllables per bar, simple rhythmic patterns, and basic rhyming techniques and rhyme schemes.\nMelle Mel is cited as an MC who epitomizes the old school flow \u2013 Kool Moe Dee says, \"from 1970 to 1978 we rhymed one way [then] Melle Mel, in 1978, gave us the new cadence we would use from 1978 to 1986\". \"He's the first emcee to explode in a new rhyme cadence, and change the way every emcee rhymed forever. Rakim, The Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem have flipped the flow, but Melle Mel's downbeat on the two, four, kick to snare cadence is still the rhyme foundation all emcees are building on\".\nArtists and critics often credit Rakim with creating the overall shift from the more simplistic old school flows to more complex flows near the beginning of hip hop's new school \u2013 Kool Moe Dee says, \"any emcee that came after 1986 had to study Rakim just to know what to be able to do. Rakim, in 1986, gave us flow and that was the rhyme style from 1986 to 1994. From that point on, anybody emceeing was forced to focus on their flow\". Kool Moe Dee explains that before Rakim, the term 'flow' was not widely used \u2013 \"Rakim is basically the inventor of flow. We were not even using the word flow until Rakim came along. It was called rhyming, it was called cadence, but it wasn't called flow. Rakim created flow!\" He adds that while Rakim upgraded and popularized the focus on flow, \"he didn't invent the word\".\nKool Moe Dee states that Biggie introduced a newer flow which \"dominated from 1994 to 2002\", and also says that Method Man was \"one of the emcees from the early to mid-'90s that ushered in the era of flow ... Rakim invented it, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and Kool G Rap expanded it, but Biggie and Method Man made flow the single most important aspect of an emcee's game\". He also cites Craig Mack as an artist who contributed to developing flow in the '90s.\nMusic scholar Adam Krims says, \"the flow of MCs is one of the profoundest changes that separates out new-sounding from older-sounding music ... it is widely recognized and remarked that rhythmic styles of many commercially successful MCs since roughly the beginning of the 1990s have progressively become faster and more 'complex'\". He cites \"members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, AZ, Big Pun, and Ras Kass, just to name a few\" as artists who exemplify this progression.\nKool Moe Dee adds, \"in 2002 Eminem created the song that got the first Oscar in Hip-Hop history [Lose Yourself] ... and I would have to say that his flow is the most dominant right now (2003)\".\nStyles.\nThere are many different styles of flow, with different terminology used by different people \u2013 stic.man of Dead Prez uses the following terms \u2013\nAlternatively, music scholar Adam Krims uses the following terms \u2013\nRhyme.\nMCs use many different rhyming techniques, including complex rhyme schemes, as Adam Krims points out \u2013 \"the complexity ... involves multiple rhymes in the same rhyme complex (i.e. section with consistently rhyming words), internal rhymes, [and] offbeat rhymes\". There is also widespread use of multisyllabic rhymes.\nIt has been noted that rap's use of rhyme is some of the most advanced in all forms of poetry \u2013 music scholar Adam Bradley notes, \"rap rhymes so much and with such variety that it is now the largest and richest contemporary archive of rhymed words. It has done more than any other art form in recent history to expand rhyme's formal range and expressive possibilities\".\nIn the book \"How to Rap\", Masta Ace explains how Rakim and Big Daddy Kane caused a shift in the way MCs rhymed: \"Up until Rakim, everybody who you heard rhyme, the last word in the sentence was the rhyming [word], the connection word. Then Rakim showed us that you could put rhymes within a rhyme ... now here comes Big Daddy Kane \u2014 instead of going three words, he's going multiple\". \"How to Rap\" explains that \"rhyme is often thought to be the most important factor in rap writing ... rhyme is what gives rap lyrics their musicality.\nRhythm.\nMany of the rhythmic techniques used in rapping come from percussive techniques and many rappers compare themselves to percussionists. \"How to Rap 2\" identifies all the rhythmic techniques used in rapping such as triplets, flams, 16th notes, 32nd notes, syncopation, extensive use of rests, and rhythmic techniques unique to rapping such as West Coast \"lazy tails\", coined by Shock G. Rapping has also been done in various time signatures, such as 3/4 time.\nSince the 2000s, rapping has evolved into a style of rap that spills over the boundaries of the beat, closely resembling spoken English. Rappers like MF Doom and Eminem have exhibited this style, and since then, rapping has been difficult to notate. The American hip-hop group Crime Mob exhibited a new rap flow in songs such as \"Knuck If You Buck\", heavily dependent on triplets. Rappers including Drake, Kanye West, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy and more have included this influence in their music. In 2014, an American hip-hop collective from Atlanta, Migos, popularized this flow, and is commonly referred to as the \"Migos Flow\" (a term that is contentious within the hip-hop community).\nGroove classes.\nMitchell Ohriner in \"Flow: The Rhythmic Voice in Rap Music\" describes seven \"groove classes\" consisting of archetypal sixteen-step accent patterns generated by grouping notes in clusters of two and/or three. These groove classes are further distinguished from one another as \"duple\" and \"nonduple\". Groove classes without internal repetition can occur in any of sixteen rhythmic rotations, whereas groove classes with internal repetition have fewer meaningful rotations. \nRap notation and flow diagrams.\nThe standard form of rap notation is the flow diagram, where rappers line-up their lyrics underneath \"beat numbers\". Different rappers have slightly different forms of flow diagram that they use: Del the Funky Homosapien says, \"I'm just writing out the rhythm of the flow, basically. Even if it's just slashes to represent the beats, that's enough to give me a visual path.\", Vinnie Paz states, \"I've created my own sort of writing technique, like little marks and asterisks to show like a pause or emphasis on words in certain places.\", and Aesop Rock says, \"I have a system of maybe 10 little symbols that I use on paper that tell me to do something when I'm recording.\"\nHip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams: the books \"How to Rap\" and \"How to Rap 2\" use the diagrams to explain rap's triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques. Similar systems are used by PhD musicologists Adam Krims in his book \"Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity\" and Kyle Adams in his academic work on flow.\nBecause rap revolves around a strong 4/4 beat, with certain syllables said in time to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have the same 4 beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat numbers. This allows devices such as rests, \"lazy tails\", flams, and other rhythmic techniques to be shown, as well as illustrating where different rhyming words fall in relation to the music.\nPerformance.\nTo successfully deliver a rap, a rapper must also develop vocal presence, enunciation, and breath control. Vocal presence is the distinctiveness of a rapper's voice on record. Enunciation is essential to a flowing rap; some rappers choose also to exaggerate it for comic and artistic effect. Breath control, taking in air without interrupting one's delivery, is an important skill for a rapper to master, and a must for any MC. An MC with poor breath control cannot deliver difficult verses without making unintentional pauses.\nRaps are sometimes delivered with melody. West Coast rapper Egyptian Lover was the first notable MC to deliver \"sing-raps\". Popular rappers such as 50 Cent and Ja Rule add a slight melody to their otherwise purely percussive raps whereas some rappers such as Cee-Lo Green are able to harmonize their raps with the beat. The Midwestern group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony was one of the first groups to achieve nationwide recognition for using the fast-paced, melodic and harmonic raps that are also practiced by Do or Die, another Midwestern group. Another rapper that harmonized his rhymes was Nate Dogg, a rapper part of the group 213. Rakim experimented not only with following the beat, but also with complementing the song's melody with his own voice, making his flow sound like that of an instrument (a saxophone in particular).\nThe ability to rap quickly and clearly is sometimes regarded as an important sign of skill. In certain hip-hop subgenres such as chopped and screwed, slow-paced rapping is often considered optimal. The current record for fastest rapper is held by Spanish rapper Domingo Edjang Moreno, known by his alias Chojin, who rapped 921 syllables in one minute on December 23, 2008.\nEmcees.\nIn the late 1970s, the term emcee, MC or M.C., derived from \"master of ceremonies\", became an alternative title for a rapper, and for their role within hip-hop music and culture. An MC uses rhyming verses, pre-written or ad lib ('freestyled'), to introduce the DJ with whom they work, to keep the crowd entertained or to glorify themselves. As hip hop progressed, the title MC acquired backronyms such as 'mike chanter' 'microphone controller', 'microphone checker', 'music commentator', and one who 'moves the crowd'. Some use this word interchangeably with the term \"rapper\", while for others the term denotes a superior level of skill and connection to the wider culture.\nMC can often be used as a term of distinction; referring to an artist with good performance skills. As Kool G Rap notes, \"masters of ceremony, where the word 'M.C.' comes from, means just keeping the party alive\" \"[sic]\". Many people in hip hop including DJ Premier and KRS-One feel that James Brown was the first MC. James Brown had the lyrics, moves, and soul that greatly influenced a lot of rappers in hip hop, and arguably even started the first MC rhyme.\nFor some rappers, there was a distinction to the term, such as for MC Hammer who acquired the nickname \"MC\" for being a \"Master of Ceremonies\" which he used when he began performing at various clubs while on the road with the Oakland As and eventually in the military (United States Navy). It was within the lyrics of a rap song called \"This Wall\" that Hammer first identified himself as M.C. Hammer and later marketed it on his debut album \"Feel My Power\". The term MC has also been used in the genre of grime music to refer to a rapid style of rapping. Grime artist JME released an album titled \"Grime MC\" in 2019 which peaked at 29 on the UK Albums Chart.\nUncertainty over the acronym's expansion may be considered evidence for its ubiquity: the full term \"Master of Ceremonies\" is very rarely used in the hip-hop scene. This confusion prompted the hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest to include this statement in the liner notes to their 1993 album \"Midnight Marauders\":\nThe use of the term MC when referring to a rhyming wordsmith originates from the dance halls of Jamaica. At each event, there would be a master of ceremonies who would introduce the different musical acts and would say a toast in style of a rhyme, directed at the audience and to the performers. He would also make announcements such as the schedule of other events or advertisements from local sponsors. The term MC continued to be used by the children of women who moved to New York City to work as maids in the 1970s. These MCs eventually created a new style of music called hip-hop based on the rhyming they used to do in Jamaica and the breakbeats used in records. MC has also recently been accepted to refer to all who engineer music.\nFemale rappers.\nFemale rappers with mainstream success have included Lauryn Hill, Nicki Minaj, MC Lyte, Jean Grae, Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Queen Latifah, Da Brat, Trina, Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B, M.I.A., CL from 2NE1, Iggy Azalea, Eve, and Lisa Lopes from TLC.\nSubject matter.\n\"Party rhymes\", meant to excite the crowd at a party, were nearly the exclusive focus of old school hip hop, and they remain a staple of hip-hop music to this day. In addition to party raps, rappers also tend to make references to love and sex. Love raps were first popularized by Spoonie Gee of the Treacherous Three, and later, in the golden age of hip hop, Big Daddy Kane, Heavy D, and LL Cool J would continue this tradition.\nHip-hop artists such as KRS-One, Hopsin, Public Enemy, Lupe Fiasco, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Jay-Z, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G. (Biggie), and dead prez are known for their sociopolitical subject matter. Their West Coast counterparts include The Coup, Paris, and Michael Franti. Tupac Shakur was also known for rapping about social issues such as police brutality, teenage pregnancy, and racism.\nOther rappers take a less critical approach to urbanity, sometimes even embracing such aspects as crime. Schoolly D was the first notable MC to rap about crime. Early on KRS-One was accused of celebrating crime and a hedonistic lifestyle, but after the death of his DJ, Scott La Rock, KRS-One went on to speak out against violence in hip hop and has spent the majority of his career condemning violence and writing on issues of race and class. Ice-T was one of the first rappers to call himself a \"playa\" and discuss guns on record, but his theme tune to the 1988 film \"Colors\" contained warnings against joining gangs. Gangsta rap, made popular largely because of N.W.A, brought rapping about crime and the gangster lifestyle into the musical mainstream.\nMaterialism has also been a popular topic in hip-hop since at least the early 1990s, with rappers boasting about their own wealth and possessions, and name-dropping specific brands: liquor brands Cristal and R\u00e9my Martin, car manufacturers Bentley and Mercedes-Benz and clothing brands Gucci and Versace have all been popular subjects for rappers.\nVarious politicians, journalists, and religious leaders have accused rappers of fostering a culture of violence and hedonism among hip-hop listeners through their lyrics. However, there are also rappers whose messages may not be in line with these views, for example Christian hip hop. Others have praised the \"political critique, innuendo and sarcasm\" of hip-hop music.\nIn contrast to the more hedonistic approach of gangsta rappers, some rappers have a spiritual or religious focus. Christian rap is currently the most commercially successful form of religious rap. With Christian rappers like Lecrae, Thi'sl and Hostyle Gospel winning national awards and making regular appearances on television, Christian hip hop seem to have found its way in the hip-hop family. Aside from Christianity, the Five Percent Nation, an Islamic esotericist religious/spiritual group, has been represented more than any religious group in popular hip hop. Artists such as Rakim, the members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Brand Nubian, X-Clan and Busta Rhymes have had success in spreading the theology of the Five Percenters.\nLiterary technique.\nRappers use the literary techniques of double entendres, alliteration, and forms of wordplay that are found in classical poetry. Similes and metaphors are used extensively in rap lyrics; rappers such as Fabolous and Lloyd Banks have written entire songs in which every line contains similes, whereas MCs like Rakim, GZA, and Jay-Z are known for the metaphorical content of their raps. Rappers such as Lupe Fiasco are known for the complexity of their songs that contain metaphors within extended metaphors.\nDiction and dialect.\nMany hip-hop listeners believe that a rapper's lyrics are enhanced by a complex vocabulary. Kool Moe Dee claims that he appealed to older audiences by using a complex vocabulary in his raps. Rap is famous, however, for having its own vocabulary\u2014from international hip-hop slang to regional slang. Some artists, like the Wu-Tang Clan, develop an entire lexicon among their clique. African-American English has always had a significant effect on hip-hop slang and vice versa. Certain regions have introduced their unique regional slang to hip-hop culture, such as the Bay Area (Mac Dre, E-40), Houston (Chamillionaire, Paul Wall), Atlanta (Ludacris, Lil Jon, T.I.), and Kentucky (Cunninlynguists, Nappy Roots). The Nation of Gods and Earths, aka The Five Percenters, has influenced mainstream hip-hop slang with the introduction of phrases such as \"word is bond\" that have since lost much of their original spiritual meaning. Preference toward one or the other has much to do with the individual; GZA, for example, prides himself on being very visual and metaphorical but also succinct, whereas underground rapper MF DOOM is known for heaping similes upon similes. In still another variation, 2Pac was known for saying exactly what he meant, literally and clearly.\nRap music's development into popular culture began in the 1990s. The 1990s marked the beginning of an era of popular culture guided by the musical influences of hip-hop and rap itself, moving away from the influences of rock music. As rap continued to develop and further disseminate, it went on to influence clothing brands, movies, sports, and dancing through popular culture. As rap has developed to become more of a presence in popular culture, it has focused itself on a particular demographic, adolescent and young adults. As such, it has had a significant impact on the modern vernacular of this portion of the population, which has diffused throughout society.\nThe effects of rap music on modern vernacular can be explored through the study of semiotics. Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols, or the study of language as a system. French literary theorist Roland Barthes furthers this study with this own theory of myth. He maintains that the first order of signification is language and that the second is \"myth\", arguing that a word has both its literal meaning, and its mythical meaning, which is heavily dependent on socio-cultural context. To illustrate, Barthes uses the example of a rat: it has a literal meaning (a physical, objective description) and it has a greater socio-cultural understanding. This contextual meaning is subjective and is dynamic within society.\nThrough Barthes' semiotic theory of language and myth, it can be shown that rap music has culturally influenced the language of its listeners, as they influence the connotative message to words that already exist. As more people listen to rap, the words that are used in the lyrics become culturally bound to the song, and then are disseminated through the conversations that people have using these words.\nMost often, the terms that rappers use are pre-established words that have been prescribed new meaning through their music, that are eventually disseminated through social spheres. This newly contextualized word is called a neosemanticism. Neosemanticisms are forgotten words that are often brought forward from subcultures that attract the attention of members of the reigning culture of their time, then they are brought forward by the influential voices in society \u2013 in this case, these figures are rappers. To illustrate, the acronym YOLO was popularized by rapper, actor and RnB singer Drake in 2012 when he featured it in his own song, \"The Motto\". That year the term YOLO was so popular that it was printed on t-shirts, became a trending hashtag on Twitter, and was even considered as the inspiration for several tattoos. However, although the rapper may have come up with the acronym, the motto itself was in no way first established by Drake. Similar messages can be seen in many well-known sayings, or as early as 1896, in the English translation of \"La Com\u00e9die Humaine\", by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac where one of his free-spirited characters tells another, \"You Only Live Once!\". Another example of a neosemanticism is the word \"broccoli\". Rapper E-40 initially uses the word \"broccoli\" to refer to marijuana, on his hit track \"Broccoli\" in 1993. In contemporary society, artists D.R.A.M. and Lil Yachty are often accredited for this slang on for \"their\" hit song, also titled \"Broccoli\".\nWith the rise in technology and mass media, the dissemination of subcultural terms has only become easier. Dick Hebdige, author of \"\", merits that subcultures often use music to vocalize the struggles of their experiences. As rap is also the culmination of a prevalent sub-culture in African-American social spheres, often their own personal cultures are disseminated through rap lyrics.\nIt is here that lyrics can be categorized as either historically influenced or (more commonly) considered as slang. Vernon Andrews, the professor of the course \"American Studies 111: Hip-Hop Culture\", suggests that many words, such as \"hood\", \"homie\", and \"dope\", are historically influenced. Most importantly, this also brings forward the anarchistic culture of rap music. Common themes from rap are anti-establishment and instead, promote black excellence and diversity. It is here that rap can be seen to reclaim words, namely, \"nigga\", a historical term used to subjugate and oppress Black people in America. This word has been reclaimed by Black Americans and is heavily used in rap music. Niggaz With Attitude embodies this notion by using it as the first word of their influential rap group name.\nFreestyle and battle.\nThere are two kinds of freestyle rap: one is scripted (recitation), but having no particular overriding subject matter, and has yet evolved since the late 2000s to become the most commonly referred to style when the term \"freestyle\" is being used. Its primary focus has morphed from making up a rap on the spot, to being able to recite memorized or \"written\" lyrics over an \"undisclosed\" beat, not revealed until the performance actually begins. A variation is when a DJ or host will use multiple beats and will rotate them dynamically; it is the freestyler's job to keep their flow and not appear to trip up when the beat switches. Alternatively, keeping the rhythm or flow going can be substituted by \"switching styles\". This involves the rapper doing a variation of changing one's voice or tone, and/or the rhythm or flow, and potentially much more. However, this must be done smoothly, else any notoriety or respect gained can very quickly be lost all together. Some rappers have multiple characters, egos, or styles in their repertoire.\nThe second, more difficult and respected style, has adapted the terms \"off the dome\", or \"off (the) top\" in addition to relatively less common older references like \"spitting\", \"on the spot\" and \"unscripted\". Often times these terms are followed by \"freestyle\" e.g. Killer \"Off top Freestyle\" by (Artist X)! This type of rapping requires the artist to both spit their lyrics over undisclosed and possibly rotating beats, but additionally primarily completely improvise the session's rapped lyrics. Many \"off top\" rappers inadvertently reuse old lines, or even \"cheat\" by preparing segments or entire verses in advance. Therefore, \"off the dome\" freestyles with proven spontaneity are valued above generic, always usable, or rehearsed lines or \"bars\". Rappers will often reference places or objects in their immediate setting, or specific (usually demeaning) characteristics of opponents, to prove their authenticity and originality.\nBattle rapping, which can be freestyled, is the competition between two or more rappers in front of an audience. The tradition of insulting one's friends or acquaintances in rhyme goes back to the dozens, and was employed famously by Muhammad Ali in his boxing matches. The winner of a battle is decided by the crowd and/or preselected judges. According to Kool Moe Dee, a successful battle rap focuses on an opponent's weaknesses, rather than one's own strengths. Television shows such as MTV's \"DFX\" and BET's \"106 and Park\" host weekly freestyle battles live on the air. Battle rapping gained widespread public recognition outside of the African-American community with rapper Eminem's movie \"8 Mile\".\nThe strongest battle rappers will generally perform their rap fully freestyled. This is the most effective form in a battle as the rapper can comment on the other person, whether it be what they look like, how they talk, or what they wear. It also allows the rapper to reverse a line used to \"diss\" him or her if they are the second rapper to battle. This is known as a \"flip\". MC Jin was considered \"World Champion\" battle rapper in the mid-2000s.\nDerivatives and influence.\nThroughout hip hop's history, new musical styles and genres have developed that contain rapping. Entire genres, such as rap rock and its derivatives rapcore and rap metal (rock/metal/punk with rapped vocals), or hip house have resulted from the fusion of rap and other styles. Many popular music genres with a focus on percussion have contained rapping at some point; be it disco (DJ Hollywood), jazz (Gang Starr), new wave (Blondie), funk (Fatback Band), contemporary R&amp;B (Mary J. Blige), reggaeton (Daddy Yankee), or even Japanese dance music (Soul'd Out). UK garage music has begun to focus increasingly on rappers in a new subgenre called grime which emerged in London in the early 2000s and was pioneered and popularized by the MC Dizzee Rascal. Increased popularity with the music has shown more UK rappers going to America as well as tour there, such as Sway DaSafo possibly signing with Akon's label Konvict. Hyphy is the latest of these spin-offs. It is typified by slowed-down atonal vocals with instrumentals that borrow heavily from the hip-hop scene and lyrics centered on illegal street racing and car culture. Another Oakland, California group, Beltaine's Fire, has recently gained attention for their Celtic fusion sound which blends hip-hop beats with Celtic melodies. Unlike the majority of hip-hop artists, all their music is performed live without samples, synths, or drum machines, drawing comparisons to The Roots and Rage Against the Machine.\nBhangra, a widely popular style of music from Punjab, India has been mixed numerous times with reggae and hip-hop music. The most popular song in this genre in the United States was \"Mundian to Bach Ke\" or \"Beware the Boys\" by Panjabi MC and Jay-Z. Although \"Mundian To Bach Ke\" had been released previously, the mixing with Jay-Z popularized the genre further.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
