{"id": "28722", "revid": "332841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28722", "title": "Salman Rushdie", "text": "Indian-British-American novelist (born 1947)\nSir Ahmed Salman Rushdie (born 19 June 1947) is an Indian-born British and American novelist. His work often combines magical realism with historical fiction and primarily deals with connections, disruptions, and migrations between Eastern and Western civilizations, typically set on the Indian subcontinent. Rushdie's second novel, \"Midnight's Children\" (1981), won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was deemed to be \"the best novel of all winners\" on two occasions, marking the 25th and the 40th anniversary of the prize.\nAfter his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses\" (1988), Rushdie became the subject of several assassination attempts and death threats because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depiction of Muhammad. This included a \"fatwa\" calling for his death issued by Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran. The book was banned in 20 countries. Numerous killings and bombings have been carried out by extremists who cite the book as motivation, sparking a debate about censorship and religiously motivated violence. In 2022, Rushdie survived a stabbing at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, that led to loss of his right eye and damage to his liver and hands.\nRushdie was educated at King's College at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated with a degree in history in 1968. In 1983, Rushdie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was appointed a of France in 1999. Rushdie was knighted in 2007 for his services to literature. In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked him 13th on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. Since 2000, Rushdie has lived in the United States. He was named Distinguished Writer in Residence at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University in 2015. Earlier, he taught at Emory University. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2012, he published \"\", an account of his life in the wake of the events following \"The Satanic Verses\". Rushdie was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by \"Time\" magazine in April 2023.\nRushdie has been married five times. From 2004 to 2007, he was married to Padma Lakshmi, a television personality and activist.\nEarly life and education.\nRushdie was born in Bombay on 19 June 1947 in British India, into a Kashmiri Muslim family. He is the son of Anis Ahmed Rushdie, a Cambridge-educated lawyer-turned-businessman, and Negin Bhatt, a teacher. Rushdie's father was dismissed from the Indian Civil Services (ICS) after it emerged that the birth certificate submitted by him had changes to make him appear younger than he was. Rushdie has three sisters. He wrote in his memoir, \"Joseph Anton,\" that his father adopted the name Rushdie in honour of Averroes (Ibn Rushd). He recalls his \"first literary influence:\" \"When I first saw \"The Wizard of Oz\" it made a writer of me.\" He recalls \"Every child in India in my day (and probably still) was obsessed with P. G. Wodehouse and Agatha Christie. I read mountains of books by both.\"\nHe also recalls that \"Alice captured my imagination as few other books did: both the books, not just \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" but \"Through the Looking-Glass\" as well, and I can still recite the whole of \"Jabberwocky\" and \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" from memory. I also loved the \"Swallows and Amazons\" series by Arthur Ransome because of the unimaginable freedom those young people sailing in the Lake District were given by their families ... When I was 16, I read \"The Lord Of The Rings\" and became obsessed, and can still recite the inscription on the Ruling Ring ('One ring to rule them all...') in the dark language of Mordor. I read an astonishing amount of Golden Age science fiction, not just Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke and Kurt Vonnegut but more arcane writers like Clifford D. Simak, James Blish, Zenna Henderson and L. Sprague de Camp.\" He has written about his family following the Indian custom of kissing holy books if they were dropped on the floor. \"But we kissed everything. We kissed dictionaries and atlases. We kissed Enid Blyton novels and \"Superman\" comics. If I'd ever dropped the telephone directory I'd probably have kissed that, too.\"\nRushdie grew up in Bombay and was educated at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Fort in South Bombay, before moving to England in 1961 to attend Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire. He then attended the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate student at King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1968.\nCareer.\nCopywriter.\nRushdie worked as a copywriter for the advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, where he came up with \"irresistibubble\" for Aero and \"Naughty but Nice\" for cream cakes, and for the agency Ayer Barker (until 1982), for whom he wrote the line \"That'll do nicely\" for American Express. Collaborating with musician Ronnie Bond, Rushdie wrote the words for an advertising record on behalf of the now defunct Burnley Building Society that was recorded at Good Earth Studios, London. The song was called \"The Best Dreams\" and was sung by George Chandler. It was while at Ogilvy that Rushdie wrote \"Midnight's Children\", before becoming a full-time writer. Rushdie was a personal friend of Angela Carter's, calling her \"the first great writer I ever met\".\nLiterary works.\nRushdie's works are often categorized as postmodern, particularly within the tradition of Magic Realism. However, they also reveal early signs of a literary and cultural shift beyond postmodernism. In our contemporary world \u2013 saturated with reality TV, talk shows and other forms of pure entertainment \u2013 apathy, passivity and inaction have become defining features. Jeffrey T. Nealon identifies this prevailing sense of disengagement as a hallmark of the post-postmodern condition, which is sometimes referred to as metamodernism: \"we post-postmodern capitalists are trained by our media masters to watch rather than act, consume rather than do.\" The overt political tensions of the Cold War era have been replaced by a more insidious, media-driven culture of distraction and spectacle. In response, Rushdie's works blend fantasy with realism to jolt readers out of this stupor, challenging delusions and encouraging renewed critical awareness.\nEarly works and literary breakthrough, 1975\u20131987.\nRushdie's debut, the science fiction tale \"Grimus\" (1975), was generally ignored by the public and literary critics. His next novel, \"Midnight's Children\" (1981), put him on the map. It follows the life of Saleem Sinai, born at the stroke of midnight as India gained its independence, who is endowed with special powers and a connection to other children born at the birth of the modern nation of India. Sinai has been compared to Rushdie. However, Rushdie refuted the idea of having written any of his characters as autobiographical, stating, \"People assume that because certain things in the character are drawn from your own experience, it just becomes you. In that sense, I've never felt that I've written an autobiographical character.\" Rushdie writes of his \"debt to the oral narrative traditions of India and also to the great novelists Jane Austen and Charles Dickens\u2014Austen for her portraits of brilliant women caged by the social convention of their time, women whose Indian counterparts I knew well; Dickens for his great, rotting, Bombay-like city, and his ability to root his larger-than-life characters and surrealist imagery in a sharply observed, almost hyperrealistic background.\"\nShortly after its publication, V. S. Pritchett wrote: \"In Salman Rushdie, the author of \"Midnight's Children\", India has produced a glittering novelist\u2014one with startling imaginative and intellectual resources, a master of perpetual storytelling. Like Garc\u00eda Marquez in \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", he weaves a whole people's capacity for carrying its inherited myths\u2014and new ones that it goes on generating\u2014into a kind of magic carpet. The human swarm swarms in every man and woman as they make their bid for life and vanish into the passion or hallucination that hangs about them like the smell of India itself. Yet at the same time there are strange Western echoes, of the irony of Sterne in \"Tristram Shandy\"\u2014that early nonlinear writer\u2014in Rushdie's readiness to tease by breaking off or digressing at the gravest moments. This is very odd in an Indian novel! The book is really about the mystery of being born and the puzzle of who one is.\" \"Midnight's Children\" won the 1981 Booker Prize and, in 1993 and 2008, the Best of the Bookers and Booker of Bookers special prizes.\nAfter \"Midnight's Children\", Rushdie depicted the political turmoil in Pakistan with \"Shame\" (1983), basing his characters on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. \"Shame\" won France's \"Prix du Meilleur Livre \u00c9tranger\" (Best Foreign Book) and was a close runner-up for the Booker Prize. Both these works of postcolonial literature are characterised by a style of magic realism and the immigrant outlook that Rushdie is very conscious of as a member of the Kashmiri diaspora.\nRushdie wrote a non-fiction book about Nicaragua in 1987 called \"The Jaguar Smile\". This book has a political focus and is based on his first-hand experiences and research at the scene of Sandinista political experiments. He became interested in Nicaragua after he had been a neighbour of Madame Somoza, wife of the former Nicaraguan dictator, and his son Zafar was born around the time of the Nicaraguan revolution.\n\"The Satanic Verses\" and \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\", 1988\u20131990.\nHis most controversial work, \"The Satanic Verses\", was published in 1988 and won the Whitbread Award. It was followed by \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\" (1990). Written in the shadow of the fatwa, it is about the magic of story-telling and an allegorical defence of the power of stories over silence.\nFurther works, 1990s\u20132000s.\nIn 1990, Rushdie reviewed Thomas Pynchon's \"Vineland\" in \"The New York Times\", and offered some droll musings on the author's reclusiveness: \"So he wants a private life and no photographs and nobody to know his home address. I can dig it, I can relate to that (but, like, he should try it when it's compulsory instead of a free-choice option).\" Rushdie recalls: \"I was able to meet the famously invisible man. I had dinner with him at Sonny Mehta's apartment in Manhattan and found him very satisfyingly Pynchonesque. At the end of dinner I thought, well, now we're friends, and maybe we'll see each other from time to time. He never called again.\"\nRushdie has published many short stories, including those collected in \"East, West\" (1994). His 1995 novel \"The Moor's Last Sigh\", a family saga spanning some 100 years of India's history, won the Whitbread Award. \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\" (1999) is a riff on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, casting Orpheus and Eurydice as rock stars. The book features many original song lyrics; one was the basis for the U2 song \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\". Rushdie is credited as the lyricist.\nFollowing \"Fury\" (2001), set mainly in New York and avoiding the previous sprawling narrative style that spans generations, periods and places, Rushdie's novel \"Shalimar the Clown\" (2005), a story about love and betrayal set in Kashmir and Los Angeles, was hailed as a return to form by a number of critics.\nIn his 2002 non-fiction collection \"Step Across This Line\", he professes his admiration for Italo Calvino and Pynchon, among others. His early influences included Jorge Luis Borges, Mikhail Bulgakov, Lewis Carroll and G\u00fcnter Grass. When asked who his favorite novelist is, he says: \"There are days when it's Kafka, in whose world we all live; others when it's Dickens, for the sheer fecundity of his imagination and the beauty of his prose. But it's probably Joyce on more days than anyone else.\"\n2008 saw the publication of \"The Enchantress of Florence\", one of Rushdie's most challenging works that focuses on the past. It tells the story of a European's visit to Akbar's court, and his revelation that he is a lost relative of the Mughal emperor. The novel was praised by Ursula Le Guin in a review in \"The Guardian\" as a \"sumptuous mixture of history with fable\". \"Luka and the Fire of Life\", a sequel to \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\", was published in November 2010 to critical acclaim. Earlier that year, he announced that he was writing his memoir, \"\", which was published in September 2012.\nIn 2012, Rushdie became one of the first major authors to embrace Booktrack (a company that synchronises ebooks with customised soundtracks), when he published his short story \"In the South\" on the platform.\nLater works, novels, and essays, 2015\u20132025.\n2015 saw the publication of \"Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights\", a modern take on the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Based on the conflict of scholar Ibn Rushd (from whom Rushdie's family name derives), Rushdie explores themes of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism by depicting a war of the universe with a supernatural world of jinns. Ursula K. Le Guin wrote: \"Rushdie is our Scheherazade, inexhaustibly enfolding story within story and unfolding tale after tale with such irrepressible delight that it comes as a shock to remember that, like her, he has lived the life of a storyteller in immediate peril. Scheherazade told her 1,001 tales to put off a stupid, cruel threat of death; Rushdie found himself under similar threat for telling an unwelcome tale. So far, like her, he has succeeded in escaping. May he continue to do so.\"\nIn 2017, \"The Golden House\", a satirical novel set in contemporary America, was published. 2019 saw the publication of \"Quichotte\", a modern retelling of \"Don Quixote\". In 2021 \"Languages of Truth\", a collection of essays written between 2003 and 2020, was published. Rushdie's fifteenth novel \"Victory City\", described as an epic tale of a woman who breathes a fantastical empire into existence, was published in February 2023. The book was Rushdie's first released work after he was attacked and severely injured as he was about to give a public lecture in New York in 2022. In April 2024, his autobiographical book \"\", in which Rushdie writes about the attack and his recovery, was published; \"Knife\" was a finalist for the 2024 National Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\"The Eleventh Hour\", a collection of five stories, was released in late 2025.\nCritical reception.\nRushdie has had a string of commercially successful and critically acclaimed novels. His works have been shortlisted for the Booker Prize five times, in 1981 for \"Midnight's Children\", 1983 for \"Shame\", 1988 for \"The Satanic Verses\", 1995 for \"The Moor's Last Sigh\", and in 2019 for \"Quichotte\". In 1981, he was awarded the prize. His 2005 novel \"Shalimar the Clown\" received the prestigious Hutch Crossword Book Award, and, in the UK, was a finalist for the Whitbread Book Awards. It was shortlisted for the 2007 International Dublin Literary Award. Rushdie's works have spawned 30 book-length studies and more than 700 articles on his writing. He is frequently mentioned a favourite to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nAcademic and other activities.\nRushdie has mentored younger Indian (and ethnic-Indian) writers, influenced an entire generation of Indo-Anglian writers, and is an influential writer in postcolonial literature in general. He opposed the British government's introduction of the \"Racial and Religious Hatred Act\", something he writes about in his contribution to \"Free Expression Is No Offence\", a collection of essays by several writers, published by Penguin in November 2005.\nRushdie was the President of PEN American Center from 2004 to 2006 and founder of the PEN World Voices Festival. In 2007, he began a five-year term as Distinguished Writer in Residence at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where he has also deposited his archives. In May 2008, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2014, he taught a seminar on British Literature and served as the 2015 keynote speaker In September 2015, he joined the New York University Journalism Faculty as a Distinguished Writer in Residence.\nRushdie is a member of the advisory board of The Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organisation that provides daily meals to students of township schools in Soweto of South Africa. He is a member of the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America, an advocacy group representing the interests of atheistic and humanistic Americans in Washington, D.C., and a patron of Humanists UK (formerly the British Humanist Association). He is a laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. In November 2010 he became a founding patron of Ralston College, a new liberal arts college that has adopted as its motto a Latin translation of a phrase (\"free speech is life itself\") from an address he gave at Columbia University in 1991 to mark the 200th anniversary of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nFilm and television.\nThough he enjoys writing, Rushdie says he would have become an actor if his writing career had not been successful. From early childhood, he dreamed of appearing in Hollywood films (which he later realised in his frequent cameo appearances).\nRushdie includes fictional television and movie characters in some of his writings. He had a cameo appearance in the film \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" based on the book of the same name, which is itself full of literary in-jokes. On 12 May 2006, Rushdie was a guest host on \"The Charlie Rose Show\", where he interviewed Indo-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta, whose 2005 film \"Water\" faced violent protests. He appears in the role of Helen Hunt's obstetrician-gynaecologist in the film adaptation (Hunt's directorial debut) of Elinor Lipman's novel \"Then She Found Me\". In September 2008, and again in March 2009, he appeared as a panellist on the HBO programme \"Real Time with Bill Maher\". Rushdie has said that he was approached for a cameo in \"Talladega Nights\": \"They had this idea, just one shot in which three very, very unlikely people were seen as NASCAR drivers. And I think they approached Julian Schnabel, Lou Reed, and me. We were all supposed to be wearing the uniforms and the helmet, walking in slow motion with the heat haze.\" In the end, their schedules did not allow for it.\nIn 2009, Rushdie signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.\nRushdie collaborated on the screenplay for the cinematic adaptation of his novel \"Midnight's Children\" with director Deepa Mehta. The film was also called \"Midnight's Children\". Seema Biswas, Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das, and Irrfan Khan participated in the film. Production began in September 2010; the film was released in 2012.\nRushdie announced in June 2011 that he had written the first draft of a script for a new television series for the US cable network Showtime, a project on which he will also serve as an executive producer. The new series, to be called \"The Next People\", will be, according to Rushdie, \"a sort of paranoid science-fiction series, people disappearing and being replaced by other people.\" The idea of a television series was suggested by his US agents, said Rushdie, who felt that television would allow him more creative control than feature film. \"The Next People\" is being made by the British film production company Working Title, the firm behind projects including \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" and \"Shaun of the Dead\".\nIn 2017, Rushdie appeared as himself in episode 3 of season 9 of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", sharing scenes with Larry David to offer advice on how Larry should deal with the \"fatwa\" that has been ordered against him.\n\"The Satanic Verses\" and the \"fatwa\".\nThe publication of \"The Satanic Verses\" by Viking Penguin Publishing in September 1988 caused immediate controversy in the Islamic world because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depiction of prophet Muhammad. The title refers to a disputed Muslim tradition that is referenced in the book. According to this tradition, prophet Muhammad (Mahound in the book) added verses (\"Ayah\") to the Quran accepting three Arabian pagan goddesses who were worshiped in Mecca as divine beings. According to the legend, Muhammad later revoked the verses, saying the devil tempted him to utter these lines to appease the Meccans (hence the \"Satanic\" verses). However, the narrator reveals to the reader that these disputed verses were actually from the mouth of the Archangel Gabriel. The book was banned in many countries with large Muslim communities, including India, Iran, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, Singapore, Venezuela, and Pakistan. In total, 20 countries banned the book.\nIn response to the protests, on 22 January 1989, Rushdie published a column in \"The Observer\" that called Muhammad \"one of the great geniuses of world history,\" but noted that Islamic doctrine holds Muhammad to be human, and in no way perfect. He held that the novel is not \"an anti-religious novel. It is, however, an attempt to write about migration, its stresses and transformations.\"\nOn 14 February 1989\u2014Valentine's Day, and also the day of his close friend Bruce Chatwin's funeral\u2014a \"fatwa\" ordering Rushdie's execution was proclaimed on Radio Tehran by Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme leader of Iran at the time, calling the book \"blasphemous against Islam\". Chapter IV of the book depicts the character of an Imam in exile who returns to incite revolt from the people of his country with no regard for their safety. According to Khomeini's son, his father never read the book. A bounty was offered for Rushdie's death, and he was thus forced to live under police protection for several years. On 7 March 1989, the United Kingdom and Iran broke diplomatic relations over the Rushdie controversy.\nIn 1989, \"The New York Times\" published \"Words For Salman Rushdie\": \"28 distinguished writers born in 21 countries speak to him from their common land \u2013 the country of literature. For expressing their ideas publicly in the past many of these writers have suffered censorship, exile \u2013 forced or self-imposed \u2013 and imprisonment.\" Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz wrote: \"I have particular reasons to defend your rights, Mr. Rushdie. My books have been forbidden in many countries or have had whole passages censored out. I'm grateful to people who stood then by the principle of free expression, and I back you now in my turn.\" Ralph Ellison: \"You deserve the full and passionate solidarity of any man of dignity, but I am afraid this is too little. This story of a man alone against worldwide intolerance, and of a book alone against the craziness of the media, can become the story of many others. The bell tolls for all of us.\" Umberto Eco: \"Keep to your convictions. Try to protect yourself. A death sentence is a rather harsh review.\" Anita Desai: \"Silence, exile and cunning, yes. And courage.\"\nChristopher Hitchens recalled: \"When the \"Washington Post\" telephoned me on Valentine's Day 1989 to ask for my opinion about the Ayatollah Khomeini's \"fatwah\", I felt at once here was something that completely committed me. It was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying, and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humour, the individual, and the defense of free expression. Plus, of course, friendship\u2013although I'd like to think my response would have been the same even if I hadn't known Salman at all. To re-state the premise of the argument again: the theocratic head of a foreign despotism offers money in his own name in order to suborn the murder of a civilian of another country, for the offense of writing a work of fiction. No more root-and-branch challenge to the values of the Enlightenment (on the bicentennial of the fall of the Bastille), or to the First Amendment to the Constitution, could be imagined.\" Rushdie wrote: \"I have often been asked if Christopher defended me because he was my close friend. The truth is that he became my close friend because he wanted to defend me ... He and I found ourselves describing our ideas, without conferring, in almost identical terms. I began to understand that while I had not chosen the battle it was at least the right battle, because in it everything that I loved and valued (literature, freedom, irreverence, freedom, irreligion, freedom) was ranged against everything I detested (fanaticism, violence, bigotry, humorlessness, philistinism, and the new offense culture of the age). Then I read Christopher using exactly the same everything-he-loved-versus-everything-he-hated trope, and felt \u2026 understood.\"\nIn 1993, 100 writers and intellectuals from the Muslim world, including Adonis, Mohammed Arkoun, Mahmoud Darwish, Amin Maalouf and Edward Said expressed solidarity in the collection \"For Rushdie\". Naguib Mahfouz wrote: \"The veritable terrorism of which he is a target is unjustifiable, indefensible. One idea can only be opposed by other ideas. Even if the punishment is carried out, the idea as well as the book will remain.\" Tahar Ben Jelloun wrote that the fatwa was \"intolerable, inadmissible and has nothing to do with the tolerant Islam that I was taught\" and threatened \"the ability to create characters and develop them in the space and time chosen by the writer.\" Rabah Belamri wrote \"A society that refuses to question itself, that denies artists and thinkers the right to raise doubts, that dares not laugh at itself, has no hope of prospering.\" The composer Ahmed Essyad wrote a piece of music dedicated \"To Salman Rushdie, so that, as an artist, he can write what I disagree with.\" Rushdie expressed gratitude for \"anthology of blows struck in the fight against obscurantism and fanaticism\" by \"the most gifted, the most learned, the most important voices of the Muslim and Arab world, gathered together to subject my work and the furor surrounding it to so brilliant, so many-sided, so judicious an examination.\"\nWhen, on BBC Radio 4, he was asked for a response to the threat, Rushdie said, \"Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book,\" and \"I'm very sad that it should have happened. It's not true that this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much that Khomeini or anyone else in Iran has read the book or more than selected extracts out of context.\" Later, he wrote that he was \"proud, then and always\", of that statement; while he did not feel his book was especially critical of Islam, \"a religion whose leaders behaved in this way could probably use a little criticism.\"\nThe publication of the book and the \"fatwa\" sparked violence around the world, with bookstores firebombed. Muslim communities in several nations in the West held public rallies, burning copies of the book. Several people associated with translating or publishing the book were attacked, seriously injured, and even killed. Many more people died in riots in some countries. Despite the danger posed by the fatwa, Rushdie made a public appearance at London's Wembley Stadium on 11 August 1993, during a concert by U2. In 2010, U2 bassist Adam Clayton recalled that \"lead vocalist Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from [drummer] Larry Mullen, Jr.'s face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man who was supposed to be in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place.\"\nOn 24 September 1998, as a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic relations with the UK, the Iranian government, then headed by Mohammad Khatami, gave a public commitment that it would \"neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie.\"\nHardliners in Iran have continued to reaffirm the death sentence. In early 2005, Khomeini's \"fatwa\" was reaffirmed by Iran's current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a message to Muslim pilgrims making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Additionally, the Revolutionary Guards declared that the death sentence on him is still valid.\nRushdie has reported that he still receives a \"sort of Valentine's card\" from Iran each year on 14 February letting him know the country has not forgotten the vow to kill him and has jokingly referred to it as \"my unfunny Valentine\". He said: \"It's reached the point where it's a piece of rhetoric rather than a real threat.\" Despite the threats on Rushdie personally, he said that his family has never been threatened, and that his mother, who lived in Pakistan during the later years of her life, even received outpourings of support. Rushdie himself has been prevented from entering Pakistan, however.\nA former bodyguard to Rushdie, Ron Evans, planned to publish a book recounting the behaviour of the author during the time he was in hiding. Evans said Rushdie tried to profit financially from the \"fatwa\" and was suicidal, but Rushdie dismissed the book as a \"bunch of lies\" and took legal action against Evans, his co-author and their publisher. On 26 August 2008, Rushdie received an apology at the High Court in London from all three parties. A memoir of his years of hiding, \"Joseph Anton\", was released on 18 September 2012; \"Joseph Anton\" was Rushdie's secret alias during the height of the controversy.\nIn February 1997, Ayatollah Hasan Sane'i, leader of the \"bonyad panzdah-e khordad\" (Fifteenth of Khordad Foundation),\nreported that the blood money offered by the foundation for the assassination of Rushdie would be increased from $2\u00a0million to $2.5\u00a0million. Then a semi-official religious foundation in Iran increased the reward it had offered for the killing of Rushdie from $2.8\u00a0million to $3.3\u00a0million.\nIn November 2015, former Indian minister P. Chidambaram acknowledged that banning \"The Satanic Verses\" was wrong. In 1998, Iran's former president Mohammad Khatami proclaimed the fatwa \"finished\"; but it has never been officially lifted, and in fact has been reiterated several times by Ali Khamenei and other religious officials. Yet more money was added to the bounty in February 2016.\nFailed assassination attempt (1989).\nOn 3 August 1989, while a man using the alias Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh was priming a book bomb loaded with RDX explosives in a hotel in Paddington, Central London, the bomb exploded prematurely, destroying two floors of the hotel and killing Mazeh. A previously unknown Lebanese group, the Organization of the Mujahidin of Islam, said he died preparing an attack \"on the apostate Rushdie\". There is a shrine in Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery for Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh that says he was \"Martyred in London, 3 August 1989. The first martyr to die on a mission to kill Salman Rushdie.\" Mazeh's mother was invited to relocate to Iran, and the Islamic World Movement of Martyrs' Commemoration built his shrine in the cemetery that holds thousands of Iranian soldiers slain in the Iran\u2013Iraq War.\nTranslators attacked.\nIn 1991 an Italian translator of the book was stabbed but survived. Days later Hitoshi Igarashi, its Japanese translator, was stabbed to death. Two years later its Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times but survived.\nHezbollah's comments (2006).\nDuring the 2006 \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah declared that \"If there had been a Muslim to carry out Imam Khomeini's \"fatwa\" against the renegade Salman Rushdie, this rabble who insult our Prophet Mohammed in Denmark, Norway and France would not have dared to do so. I am sure there are millions of Muslims who are ready to give their lives to defend our prophet's honour and we have to be ready to do anything for that.\"\n\"International Guerillas\" (1990).\nIn 1990, soon after the publication of \"The Satanic Verses\", a Pakistani film entitled \"International Gorillay\" (\"International Guerillas\") was released that depicted Rushdie as a \"James Bond-style villain\" plotting to cause the downfall of Pakistan by opening a chain of casinos and discos in the country; he is ultimately killed at the end of the movie. The film was popular with Pakistani audiences, and it \"presents Rushdie as a Rambo-like figure pursued by four Pakistani guerrillas\". The British Board of Film Classification refused to allow it a certificate; \"it was felt that the portrayal of Rushdie might qualify as criminal libel, causing a breach of the peace as opposed to merely tarnishing his reputation.\" This effectively prevented the release of the film in the UK. Two months later, however, Rushdie himself wrote to the board, saying that while he thought the film \"a distorted, incompetent piece of trash\", he would not sue if it were released. He later said, \"If that film had been banned, it would have become the hottest video in town: everyone would have seen it\". While the film was a great hit in Pakistan, it went virtually unnoticed elsewhere.\nAl-Qaeda hit list (2010).\nIn 2010, Anwar al-Awlaki published an Al-Qaeda hit list in \"Inspire\" magazine, including Rushdie along with other figures claimed to have insulted Islam, including Ayaan Hirsi Ali, cartoonist Lars Vilks, and three \"Jyllands-Posten\" staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose. The list was later expanded to include St\u00e9phane \"Charb\" Charbonnier, who was murdered in a terror attack on \"Charlie Hebdo\" in Paris, along with 11 other people. After the attack, Al-Qaeda called for more killings.\nRushdie expressed his support for \"Charlie Hebdo\", saying \"I stand with \"Charlie Hebdo\", as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity\u00a0... religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today.\" In response to the attack, Rushdie commented on what he perceived as victim-blaming in the media, stating: \"You can dislike \"Charlie Hebdo\"... But the fact that you dislike them has nothing to do with their right to speak. The fact you dislike them certainly doesn't in any way excuse their murder.\"\nJaipur Literature Festival (2012).\nRushdie was due to appear at the Jaipur Literature Festival in January 2012 in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. However, he later cancelled his event appearance, and a further tour of India at the time, citing a possible threat to his life as the primary reason. Several days after, he indicated that state police agencies had lied, to keep him away, when they informed him that paid assassins were being sent to Jaipur to kill him. Police contended that they were afraid Rushdie would read from the banned \"The Satanic Verses\", and that the threat was real, considering imminent protests by Muslim organizations.\nMeanwhile, Indian authors Ruchir Joshi, Jeet Thayil, Hari Kunzru and Amitava Kumar abruptly left the festival, and Jaipur, after reading excerpts from Rushdie's banned novel at the festival. The four were urged to leave by organizers as there was a real possibility they would be arrested.\nA proposed video link session between Rushdie and the Jaipur Literature Festival was also cancelled at the last minute after the government pressured the festival to stop it. Rushdie returned to India to address a conference in New Delhi on 16 March 2012.\n2022 murder attempt.\nOn 12 August 2022, while about to start a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, Rushdie was attacked by a man who rushed onto the stage and stabbed him repeatedly, including in the face, neck and abdomen. The attacker was pulled away before being taken into custody by a state trooper; Rushdie was airlifted to UPMC Hamot, a tertiary trauma center in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he underwent surgery before being put on a ventilator.\nSecurity measures at UPMC Hamot were increased due to the potential threat of further attempts on his life. This included 24-hour protection with a security officer outside his room and searches being performed upon entry into the hospital. The suspect was identified as 24-year-old Hadi Matar of Fairview, New Jersey. Later in the day, Rushdie's agent, Andrew Wylie, confirmed that Rushdie had received stab injuries to the liver and hand, and that he might lose an eye. A day later, Rushdie was taken off the ventilator and was able to speak.\nOn 23 October 2022, Wylie reported that Rushdie had lost sight in one eye and the use of one hand but survived the murder attempt. Rushdie's memoir about the attack, \"\", was published in April 2024. It hit number one in the Sunday Times Bestsellers List in the General hardbacks category. In the memoir, Rushdie engages in fictional conversations with the assailant, who is referred to as 'A.'\nThe jury selection for the trial was originally scheduled to begin on 8 January 2024. However, Matar's lawyer successfully petitioned to delay the trial, arguing that they are entitled to see the memoir and any related materials before Matar stands trial, as the documents constitute evidence.\nRushdie recalled experiencing a vivid dream of being stabbed in an ancient Roman amphitheatre two days before the actual stabbing occurred. The intensity of the dream caused him to consider canceling the event until he eventually decided on attending.\nIn February 2025, the attacker, Hadi Matar, was found guilty of attempted murder and assault in connection with the stabbing. In May 2025, Matar was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the attack.\nAwards, honours, and recognition.\nSalman Rushdie has received many plaudits for his writings, including the European Union's Aristeion Prize for Literature, the Premio Grinzane Cavour (Italy), and the Writer of the Year Award in Germany, and many of literature's highest honours.\nAwards and honours include:\nKnighthood.\nRushdie was knighted for services to literature in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 16 June 2007. He remarked: \"I am thrilled and humbled to receive this great honour, and am very grateful that my work has been recognised in this way.\" In response to his knighthood, many nations with Muslim majorities protested. Parliamentarians of several of these countries condemned the action, and Iran and Pakistan called in their British envoys to protest formally. Controversial condemnation issued by Pakistan's Religious Affairs Minister Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq was in turn rebuffed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Several called publicly for his death. Some non-Muslims expressed disappointment at Rushdie's knighthood, claiming that the writer did not merit such an honour and there were several other writers who deserved the knighthood more than Rushdie.\nAl-Qaeda condemned the Rushdie honour. The group's then-leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was quoted as saying in an audio recording that the UK's award for Rushdie was \"an insult to Islam\", and it was planning \"a very precise response\".\nWhen asked if the knighthood was an insult to Muslims, Christopher Hitchens answered: \"\"Midnight's Children\" did not just win the Booker, and Salman did not just later win the Booker of Bookers, \"Midnight's Children\" won the main literary award in Iran, people tend to forget. When the fatwa was issued against him by a senile theocratic dictator who had run his own country into beggary and bankruptcy and misery, every Arab and Muslim writer worthy of the name, all signed, and wrote in a book for Salman, we identify our cause with you, and your struggle with free expression in our culture. If you say that Muslims are being offended by this, and you lump them all together, you immediately grant that they are in fact represented by the most extreme, homicidal, fanatical, illiterate, intolerant people who not only haven't read this book, but couldn't read it. And that's an insult to Islam!\"\nRushdie was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to literature.\nReligious and political beliefs.\nReligious background.\nRushdie came from a liberal Muslim family, but he is an atheist. In a 2006 interview with PBS, Rushdie called himself a \"hardline atheist\".\nIn 1989, in an interview following the \"fatwa\", Rushdie said that he was in a sense a lapsed Muslim, though \"shaped by Muslim culture more than any other,\" and a student of Islam. In another interview the same year, he said: \"My point of view is that of a secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities, whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu.\"\nIn December 1990, Rushdie issued a statement reaffirming his Muslim faith, distancing himself from statements made by characters in \"Satanic Verses\" that cast aspersions on Islam or Prophet Mohammad, and opposing the release of the paperback edition of the novel. Later, in 1992, he cited the release of the statement as perhaps his lowest point, regretting its language, which he said he had not written.\nRushdie advocates the application of higher criticism, pioneered during the late 19th century. In a guest opinion piece printed in \"The Washington Post\" and \"The Times\" in mid-August 2005, Rushdie called for a reform in Islam.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is needed is a move beyond tradition, nothing less than a reform movement to bring the core concepts of Islam into the modern age, a Muslim Reformation to combat not only the jihadist ideologues but also the dusty, stifling seminaries of the traditionalists, throwing open the windows to let in much-needed fresh air. ... It is high time, for starters, that Muslims were able to study the revelation of their religion as an event inside history, not supernaturally above it. ... Broad-mindedness is related to tolerance; open-mindedness is the sibling of peace.\u2014\u200a\nRushdie is a critic of moral and cultural relativism. In an interview with Point of Inquiry in 2006, he described his view as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We need all of us, whatever our background, to constantly examine the stories inside which and with which we live. We all live in stories, so called grand narratives. Nation is a story. Family is a story. Religion is a story. Community is a story. We all live within and with these narratives. And it seems to me that a definition of any living vibrant society is that you constantly question those stories. That you constantly argue about the stories. In fact the arguing never stops. The argument itself is freedom. It's not that you come to a conclusion about it. And through that argument you change your mind sometimes.\u2026 And that's how societies grow. When you can't retell for yourself the stories of your life then you live in a prison.\u2026 Somebody else controls the story.\u2026 Now it seems to me that we have to say that a problem in contemporary Islam is the inability to re-examine the ground narrative of the religion.\u2026 The fact that in Islam it is very difficult to do this, makes it difficult to think new thoughts.\nRushdie is an advocate of religious satire. He condemned the Charlie Hebdo shooting and defended comedic criticism of religions in a comment originally posted on English PEN where he called religions a medieval form of unreason. Rushdie called the attack a consequence of \"religious totalitarianism\", which according to him had caused \"a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam\". He said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Religion, a medieval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today. I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. 'Respect for religion' has become a code phrase meaning 'fear of religion.' Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect.\nWhen asked about reading and writing as a human right, Rushdie states: \"...there are the larger stories, the grand narratives that we live in, which are things like nation, and family, and clan, and so on. Those stories are considered to be treated reverentially. They need to be part of the way in which we conduct the discourse of our lives and to prevent people from doing something very damaging to human nature.\" Though Rushdie believes the freedoms of literature to be universal, the bulk of his fictions portrays the struggles of the marginally underrepresented. This can be seen in his portrayal of the role of women in his 1983 novel \"Shame\". In this novel, Rushdie, \"suggests that it is women who suffer most from the injustices of the Pakistani social order.\" His support of feminism can also be seen in a 2015 interview with \"New York\" magazine's \"The Cut\".\nPolitical background.\nUK politics.\nIn 2006, Rushdie stated that he supported comments by Jack Straw, then-Leader of the House of Commons from Labour, who criticized the wearing of the niqab (a veil that covers all of the face except the eyes). Rushdie stated that his three sisters would never wear the veil. He said: \"I think the battle against the veil has been a long and continuing battle against the limitation of women, so in that sense I'm completely on Straw's side.\"\nUS politics.\nRushdie supported the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, leading historian Tariq Ali to label Rushdie part of what he considered to be \"warrior writers\" as \"the belligerati\". He was supportive of the US-led campaign to remove the Taliban in Afghanistan, which began in 2001 but was a vocal critic of the 2003 war in Iraq. He stated that while there was a \"case to be made for the removal of Saddam Hussein\", US unilateral military intervention was unjustifiable. Terry Eagleton, a former admirer of Rushdie's work and Marxist literary critic, criticized him, saying he \"cheered on the Pentagon's criminal ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" Eagleton subsequently apologized for having misrepresented Rushdie's views.\nRushdie supported the election of Barack Obama for the US presidency and has often criticized the Republican Party. He was involved in the Occupy Movement, both as a presence at Occupy Boston and as a founding member of Occupy Writers. Rushdie is a supporter of gun control, blaming a shooting at a Colorado cinema in July 2012 on the American right to keep and bear arms. He acquired American citizenship in 2016 and voted for Hillary Clinton in that year's election.\nNoting the rise of \"populist authoritarian demagoguery\" around the world, Rushdie said there was \"a willingness amongst at least some part of the [US] population to cease to value the democratic values enshrined in the first amendment. So I think the problem is, I would now say, political more than primarily religious\".\nAgainst religious extremism.\nIn the wake of the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy in March 2006 Rushdie signed the manifesto \"Together Facing the New Totalitarianism\", a statement warning of the dangers of religious extremism. The Manifesto was published in the left-leaning French weekly \"Charlie Hebdo\" in March 2006. When Amnesty International suspended human rights activist Gita Sahgal for saying to the press that she thought the organization should distance itself from Moazzam Begg and his organization, Rushdie said: Amnesty\u2026has done its reputation incalculable damage by allying itself with Moazzam Begg and his group Cageprisoners, and holding them up as human rights advocates. It looks very much as if Amnesty's leadership is suffering from a kind of moral bankruptcy, and has lost the ability to distinguish right from wrong. It has greatly compounded its error by suspending the redoubtable Gita Sahgal for the crime of going public with her concerns. Gita Sahgal is a woman of immense integrity and distinction. ... It is people like Gita Sahgal who are the true voices of the human rights movement; Amnesty and Begg have revealed, by their statements and actions, that they deserve our contempt.\nIn July 2020, Rushdie was one of the 153 signers of the \"Harper's Letter\", also known as \"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate\", that expressed concern that \"the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.\" In October 2023, Rushdie expressed his \"horror\" at both Hamas' attack on Israel and Israel's retaliation in the Gaza Strip and called for a \"cessation in hostilities\".\nIn May 2024, Rushdie argued that if a Palestinian state ever came into being, it would resemble a \"Taliban-like state\" and become a client state of Iran. He further stated, \"There's an emotional reaction to the death in Gaza, and that's absolutely right. But when it slides over towards antisemitism and sometimes to actual support of Hamas, then it's very problematic.\" He voiced his puzzlement regarding the current support of progressive students for what he described as a \"fascist terrorist group\".\nSouth Asian politics and Kashmir.\nRushdie has been critical of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan after Khan took personal jabs at him in a 2012 interview. Khan had called Rushdie \"unbalanced\", saying he has the \"mindset of a small man\", claiming they had \"never met\" and he would never \"want to meet him ever\", despite the two being spotted together in public numerous times.\nRushdie has expressed his preference for India over Pakistan on numerous occasions in writing and on live television interviews. In one such interview in 2003, Rushdie said \"Pakistan sucks\" after being asked about why he felt more like an outsider there than in India or England. He cited India's diversity, openness, and \"richness of life experience\" as his preference over Pakistan's \"airlessness\", resulting from a lack of personal freedom, widespread public corruption, and inter-ethnic tension.\nIn Indian politics, Rushdie has criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party and its chairperson, the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nIn a 2006 interview about his novel \"Shalimar the Clown\", Rushdie laments the division of Kashmir into zones of Indian and Pakistani administration as having cut his family down the middle. In August 2019, he criticized the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, tweeting: \"Even from seven thousand miles away it's clear that what's happening in Kashmir is an atrocity. Not much to celebrate this August 15th.\" He has previously referred to crackdowns in Indian-administered Kashmir as pretexts for the rise of jihadism in the region:The phrase of \"crackdown\" that the Indian army uses really is a euphemism of mass destruction. And rape. And brutalisation. That happens all the time. It's still happening now. ... The decision to treat all Kashmiris as if they're potential terrorists is what has unleashed this, the kind of \"holocaust\" against the Kashmiri people. And we know ourselves, from most recent events in Europe, how important it is to resist treating all Muslims as if they're terrorists, but the Indian army has taken the decision to do the opposite of that, to actually decide that everybody is a potential combatant to treat them in that way. And the level of brutality is quite spectacular. And, frankly, without that the jihadists would have had very little response from the Kashmiri people who were not really traditionally interested in radical Islam. So now they're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, and that's the tragedy of the place. ... And really what I was trying to do was say exactly that the attraction of the jihad in Kashmir arose out of the activities of the Indian army. \nPersonal life.\nRushdie has been married five times and has two children; his first four marriages ended in divorce. He was first married to Clarissa Luard, literature officer of the Arts Council of England, from 1976 to 1987. The couple had a son. He left Clarissa Luard in the mid-1980s for the Australian writer Robyn Davidson, to whom he was introduced by their mutual friend Bruce Chatwin. Rushdie and Davidson never married, and they had split up by the time his divorce from Clarissa came through in 1987. Rushdie's second wife was the American novelist Marianne Wiggins; they were married in 1988 and divorced in 1993. His third wife, from 1997 to 2004, was British editor and author Elizabeth West; they have a son. After a miscarriage, the couple ended their relationship in 2004.\nIn 2004, very shortly after his third divorce, Rushdie married Padma Lakshmi, an Indian-born actress, model, television personality, producer, author, businessperson, and activist. At the time of their first meeting in 1999, Lakshmi was 28, while Rushdie was 51. Rushdie stated that Lakshmi had asked for a divorce in January 2007, and later that year, in July, the couple filed it. Padma Lakshmi criticized Rushdie as insecure and spoiled, stating he constantly craved praise and demanded \"frequent sex.\" She claimed he referred to her as a \"bad investment.\" Lakshmi also said that Rushdie was insensitive to her painful endometriosis.\nIn 2021, Rushdie married American poet and novelist Rachel Eliza Griffiths.\nIn 1999, Rushdie had an operation to correct ptosis, a problem with the levator palpebrae superioris muscle that causes drooping of the upper eyelid. According to Rushdie, this condition made it increasingly difficult for him to open his eyes. He said: \"If I hadn't had an operation, in a couple of years from now I wouldn't have been able to open my eyes at all.\"\nSince 2000, Rushdie has lived in the United States, mostly near Union Square in Lower Manhattan, New York City. He is a fan of the English football club Tottenham Hotspur. He has been a holder of the Person of Indian Origin Card, which grants certain rights to people of the Indian diaspora short of full citizenship.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before serving two terms as Berkeley's Mayor, Dean served on the Berkeley City Council for 15 years (1975\u201394) and was a leader of the Berkeley Democratic Club.\nShirley Dean grew up in a single parent family and graduated from Berkeley High School (1952). She was selected as a Distinguished Graduate in the Berkeley High School Hall of Fame and was the first in her family to attend college. She graduated with honors from UC Berkeley with a BA in Social Welfare in 1956.\nDuring part of the time she served as Mayor, she worked half-time for UC Berkeley Undergraduate Admission and Relations with Schools and the Office of Admissions. Her responsibilities included writing the plan and supervising field work for the recruitment of minority students to the UC Berkeley campus and visiting high schools throughout California. She received two Distinguished Service Awards from UC Berkeley for her work before she retired in March 2000.\nMayor.\nShirley Dean was first elected Mayor of Berkeley in 1994 after a close run-off race. Dean actually trailed in the November 1994 general election, with fellow council member Don Jelinek capturing 49.2% of the vote against Dean\u2019s 45.5%. Under city law, that forced a runoff in December, which Dean won due to lower turnout in the college town.\nShe was re-elected by more than 56% of the vote in 1998. A month before her 1998 victory, her opponent, Don Jelinek, accused her of disguising her identity while visiting Wilmington College, the college attended by rival Council member and Jelinek supporter Kriss Worthington. Dean stated that she visited the school to read about Worthington in the college newspaper, a public record. She also stated she did not ask for non-public records and that upon the request of the college showed her California Driver License bearing her full name and address. There is no record that she used any material from the college newspaper.\nDuring most of her two-term tenure as Mayor, she worked with divided City Council that had a 5-4 progressive majority. The position of mayor in the city of Berkeley is largely a symbolic post, carrying no more power than other council members. Dean compensated by working relentlessly on programs she thought were best for the city. For much of her career, Dean's political base was the very active network of Berkeley neighborhood organizations; however, many of her critics and rivals found her to be too conservative. Dean and other members of the City Council were openly mocked at a city-sponsored art festival where a satirical mock City Council meeting was staged in which actors took over the Council Chambers and ridiculed Berkeley's elected officials.\nAfter September 11, when the progressive City Council majority voted to condemn the war in Afghanistan, Dean went on Fox News and reported that the Council\u2019s actions were prompting a flood of letters and e-mails threatening an economic boycott of the City. On a television show regarding the issue, she called her Council colleagues who had voted for the measure \u201cpatriots\u201d who had every right to protest.\nDean lost her bid for re-election in 2002 to fellow Democrat Tom Bates. The day before the election Tom Bates stole 1,000 copies of The Daily Californian because the paper had endorsed Dean. Bates was charged with the theft, pleaded guilty, was fined, and ordered to pay the paper restitution. Dean ran for Mayor against Bates once more in 2008, but was soundly defeated.\nDean's accomplishments as Mayor include:\nEarly political career.\nDean started her political career by organizing the Bonita-Berryman Neighborhood Association, which led to her appointment in 1971 to the city's Planning Commission. In the early 70s, she worked with Urban Care to stop the development of a large shopping center on the waterfront. She also worked with Urban Care to achieve Council approval for what is recognized as one of the best Landmarks Preservation Ordinances in the Nation. In 1976, she was elected from a caucus in her congressional district as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in New York City pledged to Senator Frank Church.\nDean served on the Berkeley City Council for 15 years between 1975 and 1994. She was first elected to the City Council in 1975 as an at large member, she served on the council until 1982. When district elections were adopted in Berkeley in 1986 Dean was the first elected council member from District 5, she held the seat until 1994 when she was elected Mayor.\nRecent Community Involvement.\nSince leaving the Mayor\u2019s Office in 2002, Dean has been involved in several community and environmental organizations, serving on the boards of:\nIn 2003, Dean was named Woman of the year by the Zonta Club of Berkeley/North Bay.\nIn 2009, Dean appeared in the documentary film \"\" about the controversial greening of Berkeley after the passage of Berkeley Proposition G.\nDean made headlines in 2007 when she, at age 71, city council member Betty Olds, 86, and noted environmentalist and co-founder of Save the Bay, Sylvia McLaughlin, 90, climbed a ladder to briefly join a tree-sit aimed at saving the Memorial Oak Grove outside the stadium of the University of California, Berkeley.\n After a 21-month protest, the oak trees were cut down.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28728", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28728", "title": "Superconducting magnetic energy storage", "text": "Energy storage technique\nSuperconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil that has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. This use of superconducting coils to store magnetic energy was invented by M. Ferrier in 1970.\nA typical SMES system includes three parts: superconducting coil, power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is energized, the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely.\nThe stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil. The power conditioning system uses an inverter/rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power. The inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2\u20133% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95%.\nDue to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the high cost of superconducting wire, SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage. Therefore, SMES is most commonly devoted to improving power quality.\nAdvantages over other energy storage methods.\nThere are several reasons for using superconducting magnetic energy storage instead of other energy storage methods. The most important advantage of SMES is that the time delay during charge and discharge is quite short. Power is available almost instantaneously and very high power output can be provided for a brief period of time. Other energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro or compressed air, have a substantial time delay associated with the energy conversion of stored mechanical energy back into electricity. Thus if demand is immediate, SMES is a viable option. Another advantage is that the loss of power is less than other storage methods because electric currents encounter almost no resistance. Additionally the main parts in a SMES are motionless, which results in high reliability.\nCurrent use.\nThere are several small SMES units available for commercial use and several larger test bed projects. Several 1\u00a0MW\u00b7h units are used for power quality control in installations around the world, especially to provide power quality at manufacturing plants requiring ultra-clean power, such as microchip fabrication facilities.\nThese facilities have also been used to provide grid stability in distribution systems. SMES is also used in utility applications. In northern Wisconsin, a string of distributed SMES units were deployed to enhance stability of a transmission loop. The transmission line is subject to large, sudden load changes due to the operation of a paper mill, with the potential for uncontrolled fluctuations and voltage collapse.\nThe Engineering Test Model is a large SMES with a capacity of approximately 20\u00a0MW\u00b7h, capable of providing 40\u00a0MW of power for 30 minutes or 10\u00a0MW of power for 2 hours.\nSystem architecture.\nA SMES system typically consists of four parts\nThis system includes the superconducting coil, a magnet and the coil protection. Here the energy is stored by disconnecting the coil from the larger system and then using electromagnetic induction from the magnet to induce a current in the superconducting coil. This coil then preserves the current until the coil is reconnected to the larger system, after which the coil partly or fully discharges.\nThe refrigeration system maintains the superconducting state of the coil by cooling the coil to the operating temperature.\nThe power conditioning system typically contains a power conversion system that converts DC to AC current and the other way around.\nThe control system monitors the power demand of the grid and controls the power flow from and to the coil. The control system also manages the condition of the SMES coil by controlling the refrigerator.\nWorking principle.\nAs a consequence of Faraday's law of induction, any loop of wire that generates a changing magnetic field in time, also generates an electric field. This process takes energy out of the wire through the electromotive force (EMF). EMF is defined as electromagnetic work done on a unit charge when it has traveled one round of a conductive loop. The energy could now be seen as stored in the electric field. This process uses energy from the wire with power equal to the electric potential times the total charge divided by time. Where \u2130 is the voltage or EMF. By defining the power we can calculate the work that is needed to create such an electric field. Due to energy conservation this amount of work also has to be equal to the energy stored in the field.\n formula_1\nThis formula can be rewritten in the easier to measure variable of electric current by the substitution.\n formula_2\nwhere \"I\" is the electric current in Ampere. The EMF \u2130 is an inductance and can thus be rewritten as:\n formula_3\nSubstitution now gives:\n formula_4\nwhere \"L\" is just a linearity constant called the inductance measured in Henry. Now that the power is found, all that is left to do is fill in the work equation to find the work.\n formula_5\nAs said earlier the work has to be equal to the energy stored in the field. This entire calculation is based on a single looped wire. For wires that are looped multiple times the inductance \"L\" increases, as \"L\" is simply defined as the ratio between the voltage and rate of change of the current. In conclusion the stored energy in the coil is equal to:\n formula_6\nwhere\nConsider a cylindrical coil with conductors of a rectangular cross section. The mean radius of coil is \"R\". \"a\" and \"b\" are width and depth of the conductor. \"f\" is called form function, which is different for different shapes of coil. \"\u03be\" (xi) and \"\u03b4\" (delta) are two parameters to characterize the dimensions of the coil. We can therefore write the magnetic energy stored in such a cylindrical coil as shown below. This energy is a function of coil dimensions, number of turns and carrying current.\n formula_7\nwhere\nSolenoid versus toroid.\nBesides the properties of the wire, the configuration of the coil itself is an important issue from a mechanical engineering aspect. There are three factors that affect the design and the shape of the coil \u2013 they are: Inferior strain tolerance, thermal contraction upon cooling and Lorentz forces in an energized coil. Among them, the strain tolerance is crucial not because of any electrical effect, but because it determines how much structural material is needed to keep the SMES from breaking. For small SMES systems, the optimistic value of 0.3% strain tolerance is selected. Toroidal geometry can help to lessen the external magnetic forces and therefore reduces the size of mechanical support needed. Also, due to the low external magnetic field, toroidal SMES can be located near a utility or customer load.\nFor small SMES, solenoids are usually used because they are easy to coil and no pre-compression is needed. In toroidal SMES, the coil is always under compression by the outer hoops and two disks, one of which is on the top and the other is on the bottom to avoid breakage. Currently, there is little need for toroidal geometry for small SMES, but as the size increases, mechanical forces become more important and the toroidal coil is needed.\nThe older large SMES concepts usually featured a low aspect ratio solenoid approximately 100\u00a0m in diameter buried in earth. At the low extreme of size is the concept of micro-SMES solenoids, for energy storage range near 1\u00a0MJ.\nLow-temperature versus high-temperature superconductors.\nUnder steady state conditions and in the superconducting state, the coil resistance is negligible. However, the refrigerator necessary to keep the superconductor cool requires electric power and this refrigeration energy must be considered when evaluating the efficiency of SMES as an energy storage device.\nAlthough high-temperature superconductors (HTS) have higher critical temperature, flux lattice melting takes place in moderate magnetic fields around a temperature lower than this critical temperature. The heat loads that must be removed by the cooling system include conduction through the support system, radiation from warmer to colder surfaces, AC losses in the conductor (during charge and discharge), and losses from the cold\u2013to-warm power leads that connect the cold coil to the power conditioning system. Conduction and radiation losses are minimized by proper design of thermal surfaces. Lead losses can be minimized by good design of the leads. AC losses depend on the design of the conductor, the duty cycle of the device and the power rating.\nThe refrigeration requirements for HTSC and low-temperature superconductor (LTSC) toroidal coils for the baseline temperatures of 77\u00a0K, 20\u00a0K, and 4.2\u00a0K, increases in that order. The refrigeration requirements here is defined as electrical power to operate the refrigeration system. As the stored energy increases by a factor of 100, refrigeration cost only goes up by a factor of 20. Also, the savings in refrigeration for an HTSC system is larger (by 60% to 70%) than for an LTSC systems.\nCost.\nWhether HTSC or LTSC systems are more economical depends because there are other major components determining the cost of SMES: Conductor consisting of superconductor and copper stabilizer and cold support are major costs in themselves. They must be judged with the overall efficiency and cost of the device. Other components, such as vacuum vessel insulation, has been shown to be a small part compared to the large coil cost. The combined costs of conductors, structure and refrigerator for toroidal coils are dominated by the cost of the superconductor. The same trend is true for solenoid coils. HTSC coils cost more than LTSC coils by a factor of 2 to 4. HTSC was expected to be cheaper due to lower refrigeration requirements but this is not the case.\nTo gain some insight into costs consider a breakdown by major components of both HTSC and LTSC coils corresponding to three typical stored energy levels, 2, 20 and 200 MW\u00b7h. The conductor cost dominates the three costs for all HTSC cases and is particularly important at small sizes. The principal reason lies in the comparative current density of LTSC and HTSC materials. The critical current of HTSC wire is lower than LTSC wire generally in the operating magnetic field, about 5 to 10 teslas (T). Assume the wire costs are the same by weight. Because HTSC wire has lower (\"J\"c) value than LTSC wire, it will take much more wire to create the same inductance. Therefore, the cost of wire is much higher than LTSC wire. Also, as the SMES size goes up from 2 to 20 to 200\u00a0MW\u00b7h, the LTSC conductor cost also goes up about a factor of 10 at each step. The HTSC conductor cost rises a little slower but is still by far the costliest item.\nThe structure costs of either HTSC or LTSC go up uniformly (a factor of 10) with each step from 2 to 20 to 200\u00a0MW\u00b7h. But HTSC structure cost is higher because the strain tolerance of the HTSC (ceramics cannot carry much tensile load) is less than LTSC, such as Nb3Ti or Nb3Sn, which demands more structure materials. Thus, in the very large cases, the HTSC cost can not be offset by simply reducing the coil size at a higher magnetic field.\nIt is worth noting here that the refrigerator cost in all cases is so small that there is very little percentage savings associated with reduced refrigeration demands at high temperature. This means that if a HTSC, BSCCO for instance, works better at a low temperature, say 20K, it will certainly be operated there. For very small SMES, the reduced refrigerator cost will have a more significant positive impact. \nClearly, the volume of superconducting coils increases with the stored energy. Also, we can see that the LTSC torus maximum diameter is always smaller for a HTSC magnet than LTSC due to higher magnetic field operation. In the case of solenoid coils, the height or length is also smaller for HTSC coils, but still much higher than in a toroidal geometry (due to low external magnetic field).\nAn increase in peak magnetic field yields a reduction in both volume (higher energy density) and cost (reduced conductor length). Smaller volume means higher energy density and cost is reduced due to the decrease of the conductor length. There is an optimum value of the peak magnetic field, about 7\u00a0T in this case. If the field is increased past the optimum, further volume reductions are possible with minimal increase in cost. The limit to which the field can be increased is usually not economic but physical and it relates to the impossibility of bringing the inner legs of the toroid any closer together and still leave room for the bucking cylinder.\nThe superconductor material is a key issue for SMES. Superconductor development efforts focus on increasing Jc and strain range and on reducing the wire manufacturing cost.\nApplications.\nThe energy density, efficiency and the high discharge rate make SMES useful systems to incorporate into modern energy grids and green energy initiatives. The SMES system's uses can be categorized into three categories: power supply systems, control systems and emergency/contingency systems.\nFACTS (flexible AC transmission system) devices are static devices that can be installed in electricity grids. These devices are used to enhance the controllability and power transfer capability of an electric power grid. The application of SMES in FACTS devices was the first application of SMES systems. The first realization of SMES using FACTS devices were installed by the Bonneville power authority in 1980. This system uses SMES systems to damp the low frequencies, which contributes to the stabilization of the power grid. In 2000, SMES based FACTS systems were introduced at key points in the northern Winston power grid to enhance the stability of the grid.\nThe use of electric power requires a stable energy supply that delivers a constant power. This stability is dependent on the amount of power used and the amount of power created. The power usage varies throughout the day, and also varies during the seasons. SMES systems can be used to store energy when the generated power is higher than the demand/Load, and release power when the load is higher than the generated power. Thereby compensating for power fluctuations. Using these systems makes it possible for conventional generating units to operate at a constant output that is more efficient and convenient. However, when the power imbalance between supply and demand lasts for a long time, the SMES may get completely discharged.\nWhen the load does not meet the generated power output, due to a load perturbation, this can cause the load to be larger than the rated power output of the generators. This for example can happen when wind generators don't spin due to a sudden lack of wind. This load perturbation can cause a load-frequency control problem. This problem can be amplified in DFIG-based wind power generators. This load disparity can be compensated by power output from SMES systems that store energy when the generation is larger than the load. SMES based load frequency control systems have the advantage of a fast response when compared to contemporary control systems.\nUninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) are used to protect against power surges and shortfalls by supplying a continuous power supply. This compensation is done by switching from the failing power supply to a SMES systems that can almost instantaneously supply the necessary power to continue the operation of essential systems. The SMES based UPS are most useful in systems that need to be kept at certain critical loads.\nWhen the power angle difference across a circuit breaker is too large, protective relays prevent the reclosing of the circuit breakers. SMES systems can be used in these situations to reduce the power angle difference across the circuit breaker. Thereby allowing the reclosing of the circuit breaker. These systems allow the quick restoration of system power after major transmission line outages.\nSpinning reserve is the extra generating capacity that is available by increasing the power generation of systems that are connected to the grid. This capacity reserved by the system operator for the compensation of disruptions in the power grid. Due to the fast recharge times and fast alternating current to direct current conversion process of SMES systems, these systems can be used as a spinning reserve when a major grid of transmission line is out of service.\nSuperconducting fault current limiters (SFCL) are used to limit current under a fault in the grid. In this system a superconductor is quenched (raised in temperature) when a fault in the gridline is detected. By quenching the superconductor the resistance rises and the current is diverted to other grid lines. This is done without interrupting the larger grid. Once the fault is cleared, the SFCL temperature is lowered and becomes invisible to the larger grid.\nElectromagnetic launchers are electric projectile weapons that use a magnetic field to accelerate projectiles to a very high velocity. These launchers require high power pulse sources in order to work. These launchers can be realised by the use of the quick release capability and the high power density of the SMES system.\nFuture developments for SMES systems.\nFuture developments in the components of SMES systems could make them more viable for other applications; specifically, superconductors with higher critical temperatures and critical current densities. These limits are the same faced in other industrial usage of superconductors. Recent development of HTS wire made of YBCO with a superconducting transition temperature of around 90\u00a0K shows promise.Typically, the higher the superconducting transition temperature, the higher the maximum current density the superconductor can sustain before Cooper pair breakdown. A substance with a high critical temperature will generally have a higher critical current at low temperature than a superconductor with a lower critical temperature. This higher critical current will raise the energy storage quadratically, which may make SMES and other industrial applications of superconductors cost-effective.\nTechnical challenges.\nThe energy content of current SMES systems is usually quite small. Methods to increase the energy stored in SMES often resort to large-scale storage units. As with other superconducting applications, cryogenics are a necessity. A robust mechanical structure is usually required to contain the very large Lorentz forces generated by and on the magnet coils. The dominant cost for SMES is the superconductor, followed by the cooling system and the rest of the mechanical structure.\nNeeded because of large Lorentz forces generated by the strong magnetic field acting on the coil, and the strong magnetic field generated by the coil on the larger structure. \nTo achieve commercially useful levels of storage, around 5 GW\u00b7h (18 TJ), a SMES installation would need a loop of around 800\u00a0m. This is traditionally pictured as a circle, though in practice it could be more like a rounded rectangle. In either case it would require access to a significant amount of land to house the installation.\nhere are two manufacturing issues around SMES. The first is the fabrication of bulk cable suitable to carry the current. The HTSC superconducting materials found to date are relatively delicate ceramics, making it difficult to use established techniques to draw extended lengths of superconducting wire. Much research has focused on layer deposit techniques, applying a thin film of material onto a stable substrate, but this is currently only suitable for small-scale electrical circuits.\nThe second problem is the infrastructure required for an installation. Until room-temperature superconductors are found, the 800\u00a0m loop of wire would have to be contained within a vacuum flask of liquid nitrogen. This in turn would require stable support, most commonly envisioned by burying the installation.\nAbove a certain field strength, known as the critical field, the superconducting state is destroyed. This means that there exists a maximum charging rate for the superconducting material, given that the magnitude of the magnetic field determines the flux captured by the superconducting coil.\nIn general power systems look to maximize the current they are able to handle. This makes any losses due to inefficiencies in the system relatively insignificant. Unfortunately, large currents may generate magnetic fields greater than the critical field due to Ampere's Law. Current materials struggle, therefore, to carry sufficient current to make a commercial storage facility economically viable.\nSeveral issues at the onset of the technology have hindered its proliferation:\nThese still pose problems for superconducting applications but are improving over time. Advances have been made in the performance of superconducting materials. Furthermore, the reliability and efficiency of refrigeration systems has improved significantly.\nAt the moment it takes four months to cool the coil from room temperature to its operating temperature. This also means that the SMES takes equally long to return to operating temperature after maintenance and when restarting after operating failures.\nDue to the large amount of energy stored, certain measures need to be taken to protect the coils from damage in the case of coil failure. The rapid release of energy in case of coil failure might damage surrounding systems. Some conceptual designs propose to incorporate a superconducting cable into the design with as goal the absorption of energy after coil failure. The system also needs to be kept in excellent electric isolation in order to prevent loss of energy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When, as is often but not necessarily the case, the sum of the mole fractions of solutes is small compared with unity, the solution is called a dilute solution. A superscript attached to the \u221e symbol for a property of a solution denotes the property in the limit of infinite dilution.\" One parameter of a solution is the concentration, which is a measure of the amount of solute in a given amount of solution or solvent. The term \"aqueous solution\" is used when one of the solvents is water.\nTypes.\n\"Homogeneous\" means that the components of the mixture form a single phase. \"Heterogeneous\" means that the components of the mixture are of different phase. The properties of the mixture (such as concentration, temperature, and density) can be uniformly distributed through the volume but only in absence of diffusion phenomena or after their completion. Usually, the substance present in the greatest amount is considered the solvent. Solvents can be gases, liquids, or solids. One or more components present in the solution other than the solvent are called solutes. The solution has the same physical state as the solvent.\nGaseous mixtures.\nIf the solvent is a gas, only gases (non-condensable) or vapors (condensable) are dissolved under a given set of conditions. An example of a gaseous solution is air (oxygen and other gases dissolved in nitrogen). Since interactions between gaseous molecules play almost no role, non-condensable gases form rather trivial solutions. In the literature, they are not even classified as solutions, but simply addressed as homogeneous mixtures of gases. The Brownian motion and the permanent molecular agitation of gas molecules guarantee the homogeneity of the gaseous systems. Non-condensable gaseous mixtures (e.g., air/CO2, or air/xenon) do not spontaneously demix, nor sediment, as distinctly stratified and separate gas layers as a function of their relative density. Diffusion forces efficiently counteract gravitation forces under normal conditions prevailing on Earth. The case of condensable vapors is different: once the saturation vapor pressure at a given temperature is reached, vapor excess condenses into the liquid state.\nLiquid solutions.\nLiquids dissolve gases, other liquids, and solids. An example of a dissolved gas is oxygen in water, which allows fish to breathe under water. An examples of a dissolved liquid is ethanol in water, as found in alcoholic beverages. An example of a dissolved solid is sugar water, which contains dissolved sucrose.\nSolid solutions.\nIf the solvent is a solid, then gases, liquids, and solids can be dissolved.\nSolubility.\nThe ability of one compound to dissolve in another compound is called solubility. When a liquid can completely dissolve in another liquid the two liquids are \"miscible\". Two substances that can never mix to form a solution are said to be \"immiscible\".\nAll solutions have a positive entropy of mixing. The interactions between different molecules or ions may be energetically favored or not. If interactions are unfavorable, then the free energy decreases with increasing solute concentration. At some point, the energy loss outweighs the entropy gain, and no more solute particles can be dissolved; the solution is said to be saturated. However, the point at which a solution can become saturated can change significantly with different environmental factors, such as temperature, pressure, and contamination. For some solute-solvent combinations, a supersaturated solution can be prepared by raising the solubility (for example by increasing the temperature) to dissolve more solute and then lowering it (for example by cooling).\nUsually, the greater the temperature of the solvent, the more of a given solid solute it can dissolve. However, most gases and some compounds exhibit solubilities that decrease with increased temperature. Such behavior is a result of an exothermic enthalpy of solution. Some surfactants exhibit this behaviour. The solubility of liquids in liquids is generally less temperature-sensitive than that of solids or gases.\nProperties.\nThe physical properties of compounds such as melting point and boiling point change when other compounds are added. Together they are called colligative properties. There are several ways to quantify the amount of one compound dissolved in the other compounds collectively called concentration. Examples include molarity, volume fraction, and mole fraction.\nThe properties of ideal solutions can be calculated by the linear combination of the properties of its components. If both solute and solvent exist in equal quantities (such as in a 50% ethanol, 50% water solution), the concepts of \"solute\" and \"solvent\" become less relevant, but the substance that is more often used as a solvent is normally designated as the solvent (in this example, water).\nLiquid solution characteristics.\nIn principle, all types of liquids can behave as solvents: liquid noble gases, molten metals, molten salts, molten covalent networks, and molecular liquids. In the practice of chemistry and biochemistry, most solvents are molecular liquids. They can be classified into polar and non-polar, according to whether their molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment. Another distinction is whether their molecules can form hydrogen bonds (protic and aprotic solvents). Water, the most commonly used solvent, is both polar and sustains hydrogen bonds.\nSalts dissolve in polar solvents, forming positive and negative ions that are attracted to the negative and positive ends of the solvent molecule, respectively. If the solvent is water, hydration occurs when the charged solute ions become surrounded by water molecules. A standard example is aqueous saltwater. Such solutions are called electrolytes. Whenever salt dissolves in water ion association has to be taken into account.\nPolar solutes dissolve in polar solvents, forming polar bonds or hydrogen bonds. As an example, all alcoholic beverages are aqueous solutions of ethanol. On the other hand, non-polar solutes dissolve better in non-polar solvents. Examples are hydrocarbons such as oil and grease that easily mix, while being incompatible with water.\nAn example of the immiscibility of oil and water is a leak of petroleum from a damaged tanker, that does not dissolve in the ocean water but rather floats on the surface.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is similar to other systems engineering activities in that its primary motivation is to support the delivery of engineering solutions that satisfy pre-defined functional and user requirements, but it has the added dimension of preventing misuse and malicious behavior. Those constraints and restrictions are often asserted as a security policy.\nIn one form or another, security engineering has existed as an informal field of study for several centuries. For example, the fields of locksmithing and security printing have been around for many years. The concerns for modern security engineering and computer systems were first solidified in a RAND paper from 1967, \"Security and Privacy in Computer Systems\" by Willis H. Ware. This paper, later expanded in 1979, provided many of the fundamental information security concepts, labelled today as Cybersecurity, that impact modern computer systems, from cloud implementations to embedded IoT.\nRecent catastrophic events, most notably 9/11, have made security engineering quickly become a rapidly-growing field. In fact, in a report completed in 2006, it was estimated that the global security industry was valued at US $150 billion.\nSecurity engineering involves aspects of social science, psychology (such as designing a system to \"fail well\", instead of trying to eliminate all sources of error), and economics as well as physics, chemistry, mathematics, criminology architecture, and landscaping.\nSome of the techniques used, such as fault tree analysis, are derived from safety engineering.\nOther techniques such as cryptography were previously restricted to military applications. One of the pioneers of establishing security engineering as a formal field of study is Ross Anderson.\nQualifications.\nNo single qualification exists to become a security engineer.\nHowever, an undergraduate and/or graduate degree, often in computer science, computer engineering, or physical protection focused degrees such as Security Science, in combination with practical work experience (systems, network engineering, software development, physical protection system modelling etc.) most qualifies an individual to succeed in the field. Other degree qualifications with a security focus exist. Multiple certifications, such as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional, or Certified Physical Security Professional are available that may demonstrate expertise in the field. Regardless of the qualification, the course must include a knowledge base to diagnose the security system drivers, security theory and principles including defense in depth, protection in depth, situational crime prevention and crime prevention through environmental design to set the protection strategy (professional inference), and technical knowledge including physics and mathematics to design and commission the engineering treatment solution. A security engineer can also benefit from having knowledge in cyber security and information security. Any previous work experience related to privacy and computer science is also valued. \nAll of this knowledge must be braced by professional attributes including strong communication skills and high levels of literacy for engineering report writing.

Because modern systems cut across many areas of human endeavor, security engineers not only need consider the mathematical and physical properties of systems; they also need to consider attacks on the people who use and form parts of those systems using social engineering attacks. Secure systems have to resist not only technical attacks, but also coercion, fraud, and deception by confidence tricksters.\nWeb applications.\nAccording to the \"Microsoft Developer Network\" the patterns and practices of security engineering consist of the following activities:\nThese activities are designed to help meet security objectives in the software life cycle.\nProduct.\nProduct security engineering is security engineering applied specifically to the products that an organization creates, distributes, and/or sells.

The town was founded by Norman lords to absorb trade from the roads converging there. Fairs have been held by royal charter since 1330; a horse fair is still held on the edge of town nearest to Oddington in May and October each year.\nHistory.\nEarly.\nStow-on-the-Wold, originally called Stow St Edward or Edwardstow after the town's patron saint Edward, probably Edward the Martyr, is said to have originated as an Iron Age fort on this defensive position on a hill. There are other sites of similar forts in the area, and Stone Age and Bronze Age burial mounds are common throughout the area. It is likely that Maugersbury was the primary settlement of the parish before Stow was built as a marketplace on the hilltop nearer to the crossroads, to take advantage of passing trade. The name Stow derives from the Old English \"st\u014dw\" meaning 'place'. Originally the small settlement was controlled by abbots from the local abbey, and when the first weekly market was set up in 1107 by Henry I, he decreed that the proceeds go to Evesham Abbey.\nIn 1330, a royal charter by Edward III set up an annual 7-day market to be held in August. The royal charter granted a fair where sheep and horses were allowed to be sold. In 1476, Edward IV replaced that with two 5-day fairs, two days before and two days after the feast of St Philip and St James in May, and similarly in October on the feast of Edward the Confessor (the saint associated with the town). The aim of the annual charter fairs was to establish Stow as a place to trade and alleviate the unpredictability of the passing trade. These fairs were located in the square, which is still the town centre.\nCivil war.\nStow played a role in the English Civil War. A number of engagements took place in the area, the local church of St Edward being damaged in one skirmish. On 21 March 1646, the Royalists, commanded by Sir Jacob Astley, were defeated at the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, with hundreds of prisoners being confined for some time in St Edwards. This battle took place one mile north of Stow-on-the-Wold. After initial royalist success, the superiority of the parliamentary forces overwhelmed and routed the royalist forces. Fleeing the field, the royalists fought a running fight back into the streets of Stow, where the final action took place, culminating in surrender in the market square.\nModern.\nAs the fairs grew in fame and importance, so did the town. Traders dealing in livestock added many handmade goods, and the wool trade was always prominent. Daniel Defoe reported in the 18th century that 20,000 sheep were sold in one day. Many alleys known as 'tures' that run between buildings into the market square were used in herding sheep to be sold. From the mid-19th century, the Talbot Hotel was the venue for corn merchants carrying out their trade.\nMost of the buildings around the market square dated from the 18th to 19th century including St Edward's Hall (the present-day library).\nAs the wool trade declined, people began to trade in horses. The practice continues, although the fair has been moved from the square to a large field near the village of Maugersbury every May and October. It remains popular, with roads around Stow blocked by the extra traffic for many hours.\nHowever, there has been controversy surrounding Stow Fair. The many visitors and traders have attracted more vendors not dealing in horses. Local businesses used to profit from the increased custom, but in recent years most pubs and shops close for 2\u20133 miles around due to the risks of theft or vandalism.\nGovernance.\nThe town belongs to the Stow electoral ward, which covers the parishes of Stow-on-the-Wold, Maugersbury and Swell. In 2010 these parishes had a total population of 2,594. Stow ward is represented on Cotswold District Council by the Liberal Democrat Councillor Dilys Neill, who was first elected in the 2016 local elections. The Stow Division is represented on Gloucestershire County Council by the Conservative Councillor Mark Mackenzie-Charrington.\nStow-on-the-Wold also has a Parish Council with 10 members.\nEconomy.\nScotts of Stow, a mail order company, also has two shops in the town.\nMedia.\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford and local relay transmitters.\nLocal radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and Cotswolds Radio, community based radio station \nThe town is served by the local newspaper, Cotswold Journal.\nPopular culture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Stow-on-the-Wold, Where the wind blows cold.\nWhere horses young and old are sold,\nWhere farmers come to spend their gold,\nWhere men are fools and women are bold,\nAnd many a wicked tale is told.\nHigh on the freezing Cotswold.\nTransport.\nThe following roads pass through the town:\nFrom 1881 until 1962, the town was served by Stow-on-the-Wold railway station on the Great Western Railway's Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway.

The practice of structured programming was envisioned to eliminate the need for and use of the goto statement as one way to avoid the production of spaghetti code.\nEnsuring the creation of high-quality software, instead of spaghetti code, often involves aspects such as using better tools, training developers and improving software development processes.\nSpaghetti code can also describe an anti-pattern in which object-oriented code is written in a procedural style, such as by creating classes whose methods are overly long and messy, or forsaking object-oriented concepts like polymorphism. The presence of this form of spaghetti code can significantly reduce the comprehensibility of a system.\nHistory.\nIt is unclear when the phrase \"spaghetti code\" was coined; however, a reference appeared in 1972: \"The principal motivation behind eliminating the goto statement is the hope that the resulting programs will not look like a bowl of spaghetti.\" by Martin Hopkins. In the 1978 book \"A primer on disciplined programming using PL/I, PL/CS, and PL/CT\", Richard Conway described programs that \"have the same clean logical structure as a plate of spaghetti\", a phrase repeated in the 1979 book \"An Introduction to Programming\" he co-authored with David Gries. In the 1988 paper \"A spiral model of software development and enhancement\", the term is used to describe the older practice of the \"code and fix model\", which lacked planning and eventually led to the development of the waterfall model. In the 1979 book \"Structured programming for the COBOL programmer\", author Paul Noll uses the phrases \"spaghetti code\" and \"rat's nest\" as synonyms to describe poorly structured source code.\nIn the \"Ada \u2013 Europe '93\" conference, Ada was described as forcing the programmer to \"produce understandable, instead of spaghetti code\", because of its restrictive exception propagation mechanism.\nIn a 1980 publication by the United States National Bureau of Standards, the phrase \"spaghetti program\" was used to describe older programs having \"fragmented and scattered files\".\nIn a 1981 computer languages spoof in \"The Michigan Technic\" titled \"BASICally speaking...FORTRAN bytes!!\", the author described FORTRAN stating that \"it consists entirely of spaghetti code\".\nRichard Hamming described in his lectures the etymology of the term in the context of early programming in binary codes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If, in fixing up an error, you wanted to insert some omitted instructions then you took the immediately preceding instruction and replaced it by a transfer to some empty space. There you put in the instruction you just wrote over, added the instructions you wanted to insert, and then followed by a transfer back to the main program. Thus the program soon became a sequence of jumps of the control to strange places. When, as almost always happens, there were errors in the corrections you then used the same trick again, using some other available space. As a result \"the control path of the program through storage soon took on the appearance of a can of spaghetti.\" Why not simply insert them in the run of instructions? Because then you would have to go over the entire program and change all the addresses which referred to any of the moved instructions! Anything but that!\nExamples.\nSimple.\nThe following BASIC code, a program that prints 1 to 100, is a relatively simple example of code that can be more easily understood with structured control flow instead of using goto. The use of for looping and lack of indentation leads to less than clear logic flow.\n1 i=0\n2 i=i+1\n3 PRINT i\n4 IF i&gt;=100 THEN GOTO 6\n5 GOTO 2\n6 END\nThe following code produces the same result, but uses a structured loop statement and indentation to improve readability.\n1 FOR i=1 TO 100\n2 PRINT i\n3 NEXT i\n4 END\nMore representative.\nThe following code implements a numeric sorting algorithm. The use of goto statements results in a spaghetti-like nature to the control flow.\n INPUT \"How many numbers should be sorted? \"; T\n DIM n(T)\n FOR i = 1 TO T\n PRINT \"NUMBER:\"; i\n INPUT n(i)\n NEXT i\n 'Calculations:\n C = T\nE180:\n C = INT(C / 2)\n IF C = 0 THEN GOTO C330\n D = T - C\n E = 1\nI220:\n f = E\nF230:\n g = f + C\n IF n(f) &gt; n(g) THEN SWAP n(f), n(g)\n f = f - C\n IF f &gt; 0 THEN GOTO F230\n E = E + 1\n IF E &gt; D THEN GOTO E180\n GOTO I220\nC330:\n PRINT \"The sorted list is\"\n FOR i = 1 TO T\n PRINT n(i)\n NEXT i\nRelated.\nBig ball of mud.\nA big ball of mud is a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. Although undesirable from a software engineering point of view, such systems are common in practice due to business pressures, developer turnover and software entropy.

{"id": "28733", "revid": "140154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28733", "title": "Steganography", "text": "Hiding messages in other messages\nSteganography ( ) is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the concealed information would not be evident to an unsuspecting person's examination. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a formal shared secret are forms of security through obscurity, while key-dependent steganographic schemes try to adhere to Kerckhoffs's principle.\nThe word \"steganography\" comes from Greek \"steganographia\", which combines the words \"stegan\u00f3s\" (), meaning \"covered or concealed\", and \"-graphia\" () meaning \"writing\". The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his \"Steganographia\", a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. \nThe advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal. Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing both the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.\nSteganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program, or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded uses of steganography can be traced back to 440 BC in Greece, when Herodotus mentions two examples in his \"Histories\". Histiaeus sent a message to his vassal, Aristagoras, by shaving the head of his most trusted servant, \"marking\" the message onto his scalp, then sending him on his way once his hair had regrown, with the instruction, \"When thou art come to Miletus, bid Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon.\" Additionally, Demaratus sent a warning about a forthcoming attack to Greece by writing it directly on the wooden backing of a wax tablet before applying its beeswax surface. Wax tablets were in common use then as reusable writing surfaces, sometimes used for shorthand.\nIn his work \"Polygraphiae,\" Johannes Trithemius developed his \"Ave Maria\" cipher that can hide information in a Latin praise of God. \"\", for example, contains the concealed word \"VICIPEDIA\".\nTechniques.\nNumerous techniques throughout history have been developed to embed a message within another medium.\nPhysical.\nPlacing the message in a physical item has been widely used for centuries. Some notable examples include invisible ink on paper, writing a message in Morse code on yarn worn by a courier, microdots, or using a music cipher to hide messages as musical notes in sheet music.\nSocial steganography.\nIn communities with social or government taboos or censorship, people use cultural steganography\u2014hiding messages in idiom, pop culture references, and other messages they share publicly and assume are monitored. This relies on social context to make the underlying messages visible only to certain readers. Examples include:\nDigital messages.\nSince the dawn of computers, techniques have been developed to embed messages in digital cover mediums. The message to conceal is often encrypted, then used to overwrite part of a much larger block of encrypted data or a block of random data (an unbreakable cipher like the one-time pad generates ciphertexts that look perfectly random without the private key).\nExamples of this include changing pixels in image or sound files, properties of digital text such as spacing and font choice, chaffing and winnowing, mimic functions, modifying the echo of a sound file (echo steganography)., and including data in ignored sections of a file.\nSteganography in streaming media.\nSince the era of evolving network applications, steganography research has shifted from image steganography to steganography in streaming media such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).\nIn 2003, Giannoula et al. developed a data hiding technique leading to compressed forms of source video signals on a frame-by-frame basis.\nIn 2005, Dittmann et al. studied steganography and watermarking of multimedia contents such as VoIP.\nIn 2008, Yongfeng Huang and Shanyu Tang presented a novel approach to information hiding in low bit-rate VoIP speech stream, and their published work on steganography is the first-ever effort to improve the codebook partition by using Graph theory along with Quantization Index Modulation in low bit-rate streaming media.\nIn 2011 and 2012, Yongfeng Huang and Shanyu Tang devised new steganographic algorithms that use codec parameters as cover object to realise real-time covert VoIP steganography. Their findings were published in \"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security\".\nIn 2024, Cheddad &amp; Cheddad proposed a new framework for reconstructing lost or corrupted audio signals using a combination of machine learning techniques and latent information. The main idea of their paper is to enhance audio signal reconstruction by fusing steganography, halftoning (dithering), and state-of-the-art shallow and deep learning methods (e.g., RF, LSTM). This combination of steganography, halftoning, and machine learning for audio signal reconstruction may inspire further research in optimizing this approach or applying it to other domains, such as image reconstruction (i.e., inpainting).\nAdaptive steganography.\nAdaptive steganography is a technique for concealing information within digital media by tailoring the embedding process to the specific features of the cover medium. An example of this approach is demonstrated in the work. Their method develops a skin tone detection algorithm, capable of identifying facial features, which is then applied to adaptive steganography. By incorporating face rotation into their approach, the technique aims to enhance its adaptivity to conceal information in a manner that is both less detectable and more robust across various facial orientations within images. This strategy can potentially improve the efficacy of information hiding in both static images and video content.\nCyber-physical systems/Internet of Things.\nAcademic work since 2012 demonstrated the feasibility of steganography for cyber-physical systems (CPS)/the Internet of Things (IoT). Some techniques of CPS/IoT steganography overlap with network steganography, i.e. hiding data in communication protocols used in CPS/the IoT. However, specific techniques hide data in CPS components. For instance, data can be stored in unused registers of IoT/CPS components and in the states of IoT/CPS actuators.\nPrinted.\nDigital steganography output may be in the form of printed documents. A message, the \"plaintext\", may be first encrypted by traditional means, producing a \"ciphertext\". Then, an innocuous \"cover text\" is modified in some way so as to contain the ciphertext, resulting in the \"stegotext\". For example, the letter size, spacing, typeface, or other characteristics of a cover text can be manipulated to carry the hidden message. Only a recipient who knows the technique used can recover the message and then decrypt it. Francis Bacon developed Bacon's cipher as such a technique.\nThe ciphertext produced by most digital steganography methods, however, is not printable. Traditional digital methods rely on perturbing noise in the channel file to hide the message, and as such, the channel file must be transmitted to the recipient with no additional noise from the transmission. Printing introduces much noise in the ciphertext, generally rendering the message unrecoverable. There are techniques that address this limitation, one notable example being ASCII Art Steganography.\nAlthough not classic steganography, some types of modern color laser printers integrate the model, serial number, and timestamps on each printout for traceability reasons using a dot-matrix code made of small, yellow dots not recognizable to the naked eye &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nNetwork.\nIn 2015, a taxonomy of 109 network hiding methods was presented by Steffen Wendzel, Sebastian Zander et al. that summarized core concepts used in network steganography research. The taxonomy was developed further in recent years by several publications and authors and adjusted to new domains, such as CPS steganography.\nIn 1977, Kent concisely described the potential for covert channel signaling in general network communication protocols, even if the traffic is encrypted (in a footnote) in \"Encryption-Based Protection for Interactive User/Computer Communication,\" Proceedings of the Fifth Data Communications Symposium, September 1977.\nIn 1987, Girling first studied covert channels on a local area network (LAN), identified and realised three obvious covert channels (two storage channels and one timing channel), and his research paper entitled \u201cCovert channels in LAN\u2019s\u201d published in \"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering\", vol. SE-13 of 2, in February 1987.\nIn 1989, Wolf implemented covert channels in LAN protocols, e.g. using the reserved fields, pad fields, and undefined fields in the TCP/IP protocol.\nIn 1997, Rowland used the IP identification field, the TCP initial sequence number and acknowledge sequence number fields in TCP/IP headers to build covert channels.\nIn 2002, Kamran Ahsan made an excellent summary of research on network steganography.\nIn 2005, Steven J. Murdoch and Stephen Lewis contributed a chapter entitled \"Embedding Covert Channels into TCP/IP\" in the \"Information Hiding\" book published by Springer.\nAll information hiding techniques that may be used to exchange steganograms in telecommunication networks can be classified under the general term of network steganography. This nomenclature was originally introduced by Krzysztof Szczypiorski in 2003. Contrary to typical steganographic methods that use digital media (images, audio and video files) to hide data, network steganography uses communication protocols' control elements and their intrinsic functionality. As a result, such methods can be harder to detect and eliminate.\nTypical network steganography methods involve modification of the properties of a single network protocol. Such modification can be applied to the protocol data unit (PDU), to the time relations between the exchanged PDUs, or both (hybrid methods).\nMoreover, it is feasible to utilize the relation between two or more different network protocols to enable secret communication. These applications fall under the term inter-protocol steganography. Alternatively, multiple network protocols can be used simultaneously to transfer hidden information and so-called control protocols can be embedded into steganographic communications to extend their capabilities, e.g. to allow dynamic overlay routing or the switching of utilized hiding methods and network protocols.\nNetwork steganography covers a broad spectrum of techniques, which include, among others:\nAdditional terminology.\nDiscussions of steganography generally use terminology analogous to and consistent with conventional radio and communications technology. However, some terms appear specifically in software and are easily confused. These are the most relevant ones to digital steganographic systems:\nThe \"payload\" is the data covertly communicated. The \"carrier\" is the signal, stream, or data file that hides the payload, which differs from the \"channel\", which typically means the type of input, such as a JPEG image. The resulting signal, stream, or data file with the encoded payload is sometimes called the \"package\", \"stego file\", or \"covert message\". The proportion of bytes, samples, or other signal elements modified to encode the payload is called the \"encoding density\" and is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1.\nIn a set of files, the files that are considered likely to contain a payload are \"suspects\". A \"suspect\" identified through some type of statistical analysis can be referred to as a \"candidate\".\nCountermeasures and detection.\nDetecting physical steganography requires a careful physical examination, including the use of magnification, developer chemicals, and ultraviolet light. It is a time-consuming process with obvious resource implications, even in countries that employ many people to spy on other citizens. However, it is feasible to screen mail of certain suspected individuals or institutions, such as prisons or prisoner-of-war (POW) camps.\nDuring World War II, prisoner of war camps gave prisoners specially-treated paper that would reveal invisible ink. An article in the 24 June 1948 issue of \"Paper Trade Journal\" by the Technical Director of the United States Government Printing Office had Morris S. Kantrowitz describe in general terms the development of this paper. Three prototype papers (\"Sensicoat\", \"Anilith\", and \"Coatalith\") were used to manufacture postcards and stationery provided to German prisoners of war in the US and Canada. If POWs tried to write a hidden message, the special paper rendered it visible. The US granted at least two patents related to the technology, one to Kantrowitz, https://, \"Water-Detecting paper and Water-Detecting Coating Composition Therefor,\" patented 18 July 1950, and an earlier one, \"Moisture-Sensitive Paper and the Manufacture Thereof,\" https://, patented 20 July 1948. A similar strategy issues prisoners with writing paper ruled with a water-soluble ink that runs in contact with water-based invisible ink.\nIn computing, steganographically encoded package detection is called steganalysis. The simplest method to detect modified files, however, is to compare them to known originals. For example, to detect information being moved through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then compare them against the current contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors provide a hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload, raising the encoding density, which facilitates easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).\nThere are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step. The most basic approaches of steganalysis are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical attacks. These approaches attempt to detect the steganographic algorithms that were used. These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated, with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover object also plays a factor as well. If the cover object is small and the message is large, this can distort the statistics and make it easier to detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of going unnoticed.\nSteganalysis that targets a particular algorithm has much better success as it is able to key in on the anomalies that are left behind. This is because the analysis can perform a targeted search to discover known tendencies since it is aware of the behaviors that it commonly exhibits. When analyzing an image the least significant bits of many images are actually not random. The camera sensor, especially lower-end sensors are not the best quality and can introduce some random bits. This can also be affected by the file compression done on the image. Secret messages can be introduced into the least significant bits in an image and then hidden. A steganography tool can be used to camouflage the secret message in the least significant bits but it can introduce a random area that is too perfect. This area of perfect randomization stands out and can be detected by comparing the least significant bits to the next-to-least significant bits on an image that hasn't been compressed.\nGenerally, though, there are many techniques known to be able to hide messages in data using steganographic techniques. None are, by definition, obvious when users employ standard applications, but some can be detected by specialist tools. Others, however, are resistant to detection\u2014or rather it is not possible to reliably distinguish data containing a hidden message from data containing just noise\u2014even when the most sophisticated analysis is performed. Steganography is being used to conceal and deliver more effective cyber attacks, referred to as \"Stegware\". The term Stegware was first introduced in 2017 to describe any malicious operation involving steganography as a vehicle to conceal an attack. Detection of steganography is challenging, and because of that, not an adequate defence. Therefore, the only way of defeating the threat is to transform data in a way that destroys any hidden messages, a process called Content Threat Removal.\nApplications.\nUse in modern printers.\nSome modern computer printers use steganography, including Hewlett-Packard and Xerox brand color laser printers. The printers add tiny yellow dots to each page. The barely-visible dots contain encoded printer serial numbers and date and time stamps.\nExample from modern practice.\nThe larger the cover message (in binary data, the number of bits) relative to the hidden message, the easier it is to hide the hidden message (as an analogy, the larger the \"haystack\", the easier it is to hide a \"needle\"). So digital pictures, which contain much data, are sometimes used to hide messages on the Internet and on other digital communication media. It is not clear how common this practice actually is.\nFor example, a 24-bit bitmap uses eight bits to represent each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) of each pixel. The blue alone has 28 different levels of blue intensity. The difference between 111111112 and 111111102 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye. Therefore, the least significant bit can be used more or less undetectably for something else other than color information. If that is repeated for the green and the red elements of each pixel as well, it is possible to encode one letter of ASCII text for every three pixels.\nStated somewhat more formally, the objective for making steganographic encoding difficult to detect is to ensure that the changes to the carrier (the original signal) because of the injection of the payload (the signal to covertly embed) are visually (and ideally, statistically) negligible. The changes are indistinguishable from the noise floor of the carrier. All media can be a carrier, but media with a large amount of redundant or compressible information is better suited.\nFrom an information theoretical point of view, that means that the channel must have more capacity than the \"surface\" signal requires. There must be redundancy. For a digital image, it may be noise from the imaging element; for digital audio, it may be noise from recording techniques or amplification equipment. In general, electronics that digitize an analog signal suffer from several noise sources, such as thermal noise, flicker noise, and shot noise. The noise provides enough variation in the captured digital information that it can be exploited as a noise cover for hidden data. In addition, lossy compression schemes (such as JPEG) always introduce some error to the decompressed data, and it is possible to exploit that for steganographic use, as well.\nAlthough steganography and digital watermarking seem similar, they are not. In steganography, the hidden message should remain intact until it reaches its destination. Steganography can be used for digital watermarking in which a message (being simply an identifier) is hidden in an image so that its source can be tracked or verified (for example, Coded Anti-Piracy) or even just to identify an image (as in the EURion constellation). In such a case, the technique of hiding the message (here, the watermark) must be robust to prevent tampering. However, digital watermarking sometimes requires a brittle watermark, which can be modified easily, to check whether the image has been tampered with. That is the key difference between steganography and digital watermarking.\nAlleged use by intelligence services.\nIn 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation alleged that the Russian foreign intelligence service uses customized steganography software for embedding encrypted text messages inside image files for certain communications with \"illegal agents\" (agents without diplomatic cover) stationed abroad.\nOn 23 April 2019 the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging Xiaoqing Zheng, a Chinese businessman and former Principal Engineer at General Electric, with 14 counts of conspiring to steal intellectual property and trade secrets from General Electric. Zheng had allegedly used steganography to exfiltrate 20,000 documents from General Electric to Tianyi Aviation Technology Co. in Nanjing, China, a company the FBI accused him of starting with backing from the Chinese government.\nDistributed steganography.\nThere are distributed steganography methods, including methodologies that distribute the payload through multiple carrier files in diverse locations to make detection more difficult. For example, https:// by cryptographer William Easttom (Chuck Easttom).\nOnline challenge.\nThe puzzles that are presented by Cicada 3301 incorporate steganography with cryptography and other solving techniques since 2012. Puzzles involving steganography have also been featured in other alternative reality games.\nThe communications of The May Day mystery incorporate steganography and other solving techniques since 1981.\nComputer malware.\nIt is possible to steganographically hide computer malware into digital images, videos, audio and various other files in order to evade detection by antivirus software. This type of malware is called stegomalware. It can be activated by external code, which can be malicious or even non-malicious if some vulnerability in the software reading the file is exploited.\nStegomalware can be removed from certain files without knowing whether they contain stegomalware or not. This is done through content disarm and reconstruction (CDR) software, and it involves reprocessing the entire file or removing parts from it. Various methods can be employed within CDR software to counter stegomalware with varying levels of mitigation relative to visual integrity disruption. Actually detecting stegomalware in a file can be difficult and may involve testing the file behaviour in virtual environments or deep learning analysis of the file.\nSteganalysis.\nStegoanalytical algorithms.\nStegoanalytical algorithms can be cataloged in different ways, highlighting: according to the available information and according to the purpose sought.\nAccording to the information available.\nThere is the possibility of cataloging these algorithms based on the information held by the stegoanalyst in terms of clear and encrypted messages. It is a technique similar to cryptography, however, they have several differences:\nAccording to the purpose sought.\nThe principal purpose of steganography is to transfer information unnoticed, however, it is possible for an attacker to have two different pretensions:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28736", "revid": "14764907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28736", "title": "Speed of light", "text": "Speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum\nThe speed of light in vacuum, often called simply speed of light and commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant exactly equal to ). It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20441 second. The speed of light is the same for all observers, no matter their relative velocity. It is the upper limit for the speed at which information, matter, or energy can travel through space. \nAll forms of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, travel in vacuum at the speed \"c\". For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. Much starlight viewed on Earth is from the distant past, allowing humans to study the history of the universe by viewing distant objects. When communicating with distant space probes, it can take hours for signals to travel. In computing, the speed of light fixes the ultimate minimum communication delay. The speed of light can be used in time of flight measurements to measure large distances to extremely high precision.\nOle R\u00f8mer first demonstrated that light does not travel instantaneously by studying the apparent motion of Jupiter's moon Io. In an 1865 paper, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave and, therefore, travelled at speed c. Albert Einstein postulated that the speed of light c with respect to any inertial frame of reference is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source. He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of relativity, and so showed that the parameter c had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.\nMassless particles and field perturbations, such as gravitational waves, also travel at speed c in vacuum. Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer. Particles with nonzero rest mass can be accelerated to approach c but can never reach it, regardless of the frame of reference in which their speed is measured. In the theory of relativity, c interrelates space and time and appears in the famous mass\u2013energy equivalence, E = mc2.\nIn some cases, objects or waves may appear to travel faster than light. The expansion of the universe is understood to exceed the speed of light beyond a certain boundary. \nThe speed at which light propagates through transparent materials, such as glass or air, is less than c; similarly, the speed of electromagnetic waves around wire cables (the speed of electricity) is slower than c. The ratio between c and the speed v at which light travels in a material is called the refractive index n of the material (n =). For example, for visible light, the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at \u2248; the refractive index of air for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about slower than c.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNumerical value, notation, and units.\nThe speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercase \"c\". The origin of the letter choice is unclear, with guesses including \"c\" for \"constant\" or the Latin (meaning 'swiftness, celerity'). The \"c\" was used for \"celerity\" meaning a velocity in books by Leonhard Euler and others, but this velocity was not specifically for light; Isaac Asimov wrote a popular science article, \"C for Celeritas\", but did not explain the origin. In 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch had used \"c\" for a different constant that was later shown to equal \u221a2 times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbol V was used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865. In 1903, Max Abraham used \"c\" with its modern meaning in a widely read textbook on electromagnetism. Einstein used V in his original German-language papers on special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he switched to \"c\", which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.\nSometimes \"c\" is used for the speed of waves in any material medium, and \"c\"0 for the speed of light in vacuum. This subscripted notation, which is endorsed in official SI literature, has the same form as related electromagnetic constants: namely, \"\u03bc\"0 for the vacuum permeability or magnetic constant, \"\u03b5\"0 for the vacuum permittivity or electric constant, and \"Z\"0 for the impedance of free space. This article uses \"c\" exclusively for the speed of light in vacuum.\nUse in unit systems.\nSince 1983, the constant \"c\" has been defined in the International System of Units (SI) as exactly ; this relationship is used to define the metre as exactly the distance that light travels in vacuum in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20441 of a second. The second is, in turn, defined to be the length of time occupied by of the radiation emitted by a caesium-133 atom in a transition between two specified energy states. By using the value of \"c\", as well as an accurate measurement of the second, one can establish a standard for the metre. \nThe particular value chosen for the speed of light provided a more accurate definition of the metre that still agreed as much as possible with the definition used before 1983.\nAs a dimensional physical constant, the numerical value of \"c\" is different for different unit systems. For example, in imperial units, the speed of light is approximately miles per second, or roughly 1 foot per nanosecond.\nIn branches of physics in which \"c\" appears often, such as in relativity, it is common to use systems of natural units of measurement or the geometrized unit system where . Using these units, \"c\" does not appear explicitly because multiplication or division by1 does not affect the result. Its unit of light-second per second is still relevant, even if omitted.\nFundamental role in physics.\nThe speed at which light waves propagate in vacuum is independent both of the motion of the wave source and of the inertial frame of reference of the observer. This invariance of the speed of light was postulated by Einstein in 1905, after being motivated by Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for motion against the luminiferous aether. Experiments such as the Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment and the Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment have shown this postulate to match experimental observations.\nThe special theory of relativity explores the consequences of this invariance of c with the assumption that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. One consequence is that c is the speed at which all massless particles and waves, including light, must travel in vacuum.\nSpecial relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy (E = mc2), length contraction (moving objects shorten), Terrell rotation (apparent rotation), and time dilation (moving clocks run more slowly). The factor\u00a0\u03b3 by which lengths contract and times dilate is known as the Lorentz factor and is given by \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 v2/c2)\u22121/2, where v is the speed of the object. The difference of \u03b3 from1 is negligible for speeds much slower than\u00a0c, such as most everyday speeds\u00a0\u2013 in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity\u00a0\u2013 but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. For example, a time dilation factor of \u03b3 = 2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v = 0.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor of \u03b3 = 10 occurs at 99.5% the speed of light (v = 0.995c).\nThe results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (with\u00a0c relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameter\u00a0c. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameter\u00a0c is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts that\u00a0c is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves, and observations of gravitational waves have been consistent with this prediction. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal to\u00a0c, but the speed of light can differ from\u00a0c when measured from a remote frame of reference, depending on how measurements are extrapolated to the region.\nIt is generally assumed that fundamental constants such as\u00a0c have the same value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the speed of light may have changed over time. No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.\nIt is generally assumed that the two-way speed of light is isotropic, meaning that it has the same value regardless of the direction in which it is measured. Observations of the emissions from nuclear energy levels as a function of the orientation of the emitting nuclei in a magnetic field (see Hughes\u2013Drever experiment), and of rotating optical resonators (see Resonator experiments) have put stringent limits on the possible two-way anisotropy.\nUpper limit on speeds.\nAn object with rest mass m and speed v relative to a laboratory has kinetic energy with respect to that lab, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor defined above. The \u03b3 factor approaches infinity as v approaches\u00a0c, and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light.13.3 The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass. Analysis of individual photons confirm that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This is experimentally established in many tests of relativistic energy and momentum.\nMore generally, it is impossible for signals or energy to travel faster than\u00a0c. One argument for this is known as causality. If the spatial distance between two events\u00a0A and\u00a0B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied by\u00a0c then there are frames of reference in which\u00a0A precedes\u00a0B, others in which\u00a0B precedes\u00a0A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster than\u00a0c relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and causality would be violated. In such a frame of reference, an \"effect\" could be observed before its \"cause\". Such a violation of causality has never been recorded, and would lead to paradoxes such as the tachyonic antitelephone.\nIn some theoretical treatments, the Scharnhorst effect allows signals to travel faster than\u00a0c, by one part in 1036. However other approaches to the same physical set up show no such effect. and it appears the special conditions in which this effect might occur would prevent one from using it to violate causality.\nOne-way speed of light.\nIt is only possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent, because it is impossible to measure the one-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a distant detector) without some convention as to how clocks at the source and at the detector should be synchronized. By adopting Einstein synchronization for the clocks, the one-way speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light by definition.\nFaster-than-light observations and experiments.\nThere are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information-carrying signal travels at speeds greater than\u00a0c, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed\u00a0c. The phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.\nIf a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster than\u00a0c, although the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at the speed\u00a0c. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed\u00a0c from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster than\u00a0c, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.\nThe rate of change in the distance between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (their closing speed) may have a value in excess of\u00a0c. However, this does not represent the speed of any single object as measured in a single inertial frame.\nCertain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously. However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.\nAnother quantum effect that predicts the occurrence of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect: under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of the thickness of the barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster than light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.\nSo-called superluminal motion is seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the relativistic jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.\nA 2011 experiment where neutrinos were observed to travel faster than light turned out to be due to experimental error.\nIn models of the expanding universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. For example, galaxies far away from Earth are inferred to be moving away from the Earth with speeds proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light. These recession rates, defined as the increase in proper distance per cosmological time, are not velocities in a relativistic sense. Faster-than-light cosmological recession speeds are only a coordinate artifact.\nPropagation of light.\nIn classical physics, light is described as a type of electromagnetic wave. The classical behaviour of the electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell's equations, which predict that the speed\u00a0c with which electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate in vacuum is related to the distributed capacitance and inductance of vacuum, otherwise respectively known as the electric constant \"\u03b5\"0 and the magnetic constant \"\u03bc\"0, by the equation\nformula_1\nIn modern quantum physics, the electromagnetic field is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the electromagnetic field, called photons. In QED, photons are massless particles and thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed of light in vacuum.\nExtensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant speed\u00a0c of special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of light in vacuum. No variation of the speed of light with frequency has been observed in rigorous testing, putting stringent limits on the mass of the photon. The limit obtained depends on the model used: if the massive photon is described by Proca theory, the experimental upper bound for its mass is about \u00d710-57\u00a0grams; if photon mass is generated by a Higgs mechanism, the experimental upper limit is less sharp, (roughly ).\nAnother reason for the speed of light to vary with its frequency would be the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as predicted by some proposed theories of quantum gravity. In 2009, the observation of gamma-ray burst GRB\u00a0090510 found no evidence for a dependence of photon speed on energy, supporting tight constraints in specific models of spacetime quantization on how this speed is affected by photon energy for energies approaching the Planck scale.\nIn a medium.\nIn a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocity\u00a0\"v\"p. A physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The overall envelope of the pulse travels at the group velocity\u00a0\"v\"g, and its earliest part travels at the front velocity\u00a0\"v\"f.\nThe phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a \"refractive index\". The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of c to the phase velocity\u00a0\"v\"p in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as water, glass, and diamond, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light.\nIn exotic materials like Bose\u2013Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-c speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light \"slowing\" in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of the element rubidium. The popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\", it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which \"slow\" the speed of light.\nIn transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, it is possible for the refractive index to become smaller than1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the wave will be absorbed quickly.\nA pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light.\nThe opposite, group velocities exceeding c, was proposed theoretically in 1993 and achieved experimentally in 2000. It should even be possible for the group velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or backwards in time.\nNone of these options allow information to be transmitted faster than c. It is impossible to transmit information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front velocity). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal to c. \nIt is possible for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than \"c\"). When a charged particle does that in a dielectric material, the electromagnetic equivalent of a shock wave, known as Cherenkov radiation, is emitted.\nPractical effects of finiteness.\nThe speed of light is of relevance to telecommunications: the one-way and round-trip delay time are greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.\nSmall scales.\nIn computers, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between processors. If a processor operates at , a signal can travel only a maximum of about in a single clock cycle\u00a0\u2013 in practice, this distance is even shorter since the printed circuit board refracts and slows down signals. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other, as well as memory chips, to minimize communication latencies, and care must be exercised when routing wires between them to ensure signal integrity. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light may eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single chips.\nLarge distances on Earth.\nGiven that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about and that c is about , the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is traveling in optical fibre (a transparent material) the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in optical fibre with an refractive index n around 1.52. Straight lines are rare in global communications and the travel time increases when signals pass through electronic switches or signal regenerators.\nAlthough this distance is largely irrelevant for most applications, latency becomes important in fields such as high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which radio waves travelling at near to the speed of light through air have over comparatively slower fibre optic signals.\nSpaceflight and astronomy.\nSimilarly, communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications between ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first crewed spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three\u00a0seconds for the answer to arrive.\nThe communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until approximately 4\u201324 minutes later. It would then take a further 4\u201324 minutes for commands to travel from Earth to Mars.\nReceiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources takes much longer. For example, it takes 13\u00a0billion (13\u00d7109) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13\u00a0billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.\nAstronomical distances are sometimes expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one Julian year, around 9461\u00a0billion kilometres, 5879\u00a0billion miles, or 0.3066\u00a0parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10\u00a0trillion kilometres or nearly 6\u00a0trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.\nDistance measurement.\nRadar systems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-trip transit time multiplied by the speed of light. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about () in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. The Lunar Laser Ranging experiment, radar astronomy and the Deep Space Network determine distances to the Moon, planets and spacecraft, respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.\nDetermination.\nThere are different ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure directly the speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and Earth-based setups. It is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants \"\u03b5\"0 and \"\u03bc\"0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c. This is described in more detail in the \"Interferometry\" section below.\nIn 1983 the metre was defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20441 of a second\", fixing the value of the speed of light at by definition, as described below. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of c.\nAstronomical measurements.\nOuter space is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the Solar System, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units.\nOle R\u00f8mer used an astronomical measurement to make the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light in the year 1676. When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The difference is small, but the cumulative time becomes significant when measured over months. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. R\u00f8mer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost major moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.\nAnother method is to use the aberration of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8\u00a0minutes 12\u00a0seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.\nAstronomical unit.\nHistorically the speed of light was used together with timing measurements to determine a value for the astronomical unit (AU). The astronomical unit was redefined in 2012 as exactly . This redefinition is analogous to that of the metre and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an exact value in astronomical units per second (via the exact speed of light in metres per second).\nTime of flight techniques.\nA method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind experiments by Hippolyte Fizeau and L\u00e9on Foucault.\nThe setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.\nThe method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel with a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated. Foucault used this apparatus to measure the speed of light in air versus water, based on a suggestion by Fran\u00e7ois Arago.\nToday, using oscilloscopes with time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.\nElectromagnetic constants.\nAn option for deriving c that does not directly depend on a measurement of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use the relation between c and the vacuum permittivity \"\u03b5\"0 and vacuum permeability \"\u03bc\"0 established by Maxwell's theory: c2 = 1/(\"\u03b5\"0\"\u03bc\"0). The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring the capacitance and dimensions of a capacitor, whereas the value of the vacuum permeability was historically fixed at exactly through the definition of the ampere. Rosa and Dorsey used this method in 1907 to find a value of . Their method depended upon having a standard unit of electrical resistance, the \"international ohm\", and so its accuracy was limited by how this standard was defined.\nCavity resonance.\nAnother way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the frequency f and wavelength \u03bb of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation \"c\" = \"\u03bbf\". One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A. C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about \u00b10.8\u00a0\u03bcm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.\nThe Essen\u2013Gordon-Smith result, , was substantially more precise than those found by optical techniques. By 1950, repeated measurements by Essen established a result of .\nA household demonstration of this technique is possible, using a microwave oven and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the antinodes (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically ), the value of c can be calculated, \"often with less than 5% error\".\nInterferometry.\nInterferometry is another method to find the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency f, is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light \u03bb can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equation \"c\" = \"\u03bbf\".\nBefore the advent of laser technology, coherent radio sources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light. Interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light.\nOne way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry. This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (which later became the National Institute of Standards and Technology). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a fractional uncertainty of .\nHistory.\nUntil the early modern period, it was not known whether light travelled instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Arabic scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until R\u00f8mer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein's theory of special relativity postulates that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.\nEarly history.\nEmpedocles (c. 490\u2013430 BCE) was the first to propose a theory of light and claimed that light has a finite speed. He maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore must take some time to travel. Aristotle argued, to the contrary, that \"light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement\". Euclid and Ptolemy advanced Empedocles' emission theory of vision, where light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory, Heron of Alexandria argued that the speed of light must be infinite because distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes.\nEarly Islamic philosophers initially agreed with the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the \"Book of Optics\", in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that the speed of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from the senses. Also in the 11th century, Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.\nIn the 13th century, Roger Bacon argued that the speed of light in air was not infinite, using philosophical arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle. In the 1270s, Witelo considered the possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing down in denser bodies.\nIn the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler believed that the speed of light was infinite since empty space presents no obstacle to it. Ren\u00e9 Descartes argued that if the speed of light were to be finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during a lunar eclipse. Although this argument fails when aberration of light is taken into account, the latter was not recognized until the following century. Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished. Despite this, in his derivation of Snell's law, Descartes assumed that some kind of motion associated with light was faster in denser media. Pierre de Fermat derived Snell's law using the opposing assumption, the denser the medium the slower light travelled. Fermat also argued in support of a finite speed of light.\nFirst measurement attempts.\nIn 1629, Isaac Beeckman proposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6\u00a0km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. According to Galileo, the lanterns he used were \"at a short distance, less than a mile\". Assuming the distance was not too much shorter than a mile, and that \"about a thirtieth of a second is the minimum time interval distinguishable by the unaided eye\", Boyer notes that Galileo's experiment could at best be said to have established a lower limit of about 60 miles per second for the velocity of light. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about one\u00a0mile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.\nThe first quantitative estimate of the speed of light was made in 1676 by Ole R\u00f8mer. From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , which is 27% lower than the actual value.\nIn his 1704 book \"Opticks\", Isaac Newton reported R\u00f8mer's calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of \"seven or eight minutes\" for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8\u00a0minutes 19\u00a0seconds). Newton queried whether R\u00f8mer's eclipse shadows were coloured. Hearing that they were not, he concluded the different colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729, James Bradley discovered stellar aberration. From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8\u00a0minutes 12\u00a0seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.\nConnections with electromagnetism.\nIn the 19th century Hippolyte Fizeau developed a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of . His method was improved upon by L\u00e9on Foucault who obtained a value of in 1862. In the year 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/\u221a, by discharging a Leyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year Gustav Kirchhoff calculated that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at this speed.\nIn the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohlrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell backed up his claim with his own experiment published in the 1868 Philosophical Transactions which determined the ratio of the electrostatic and electromagnetic units of electricity.\n\"Luminiferous aether\".\nThe wave properties of light were well known since Thomas Young. In the 19th century, physicists believed light was propagating in a medium called aether (or ether). After Maxwell's theory unified light and electric and magnetic waves, it was favored that both light and electric magnetic waves propagate in the same aether medium (or called the luminiferous aether).\nSome physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was found to always be nil (within observational error). Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.\nBecause of Michelson-Morley experiment Hendrik Lorentz proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly (\"local time\"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in \"v\"/\"c\") is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincar\u00e9 brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity.\nSpecial relativity.\nIn 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.\nIncreased accuracy of c and redefinition of the metre and second.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, Louis Essen determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.\nIn 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the US National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado determined the speed of light in vacuum to be c =. This was 100 times less uncertain than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre. As similar experiments found comparable results for c, the 15th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1975 recommended using the value for the speed of light.\nDefined as an explicit constant.\nIn 1983 the 17th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are more reproducible than the previous standard. They kept the 1967 definition of second, so the caesium hyperfine frequency would now determine both the second and the metre. To do this, they redefined the metre as \"the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/ of a second\".\nAs a result of this definition, the value of the speed of light in vacuum is exactly and has become a defined constant in the SI system of units. Improved experimental techniques that, prior to 1983, would have measured the speed of light no longer affect the known value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of krypton-86 and other light sources.\nIn 2011, the CGPM stated its intention to redefine all seven SI base units using what it calls \"the explicit-constant formulation\", where each \"unit is defined indirectly by specifying explicitly an exact value for a well-recognized fundamental constant\", as was done for the speed of light. It proposed a new, but completely equivalent, wording of the metre's definition: \"The metre, symbol m, is the unit of length; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be equal to exactly when it is expressed in the SI unit m s\u22121.\" This was one of the changes that was incorporated in the 2019 revision of the SI, also termed the \"New SI\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nHistorical references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, the conductor of an orchestra keeps the orchestra synchronized or \"in time\". Systems that operate with all parts in synchrony are said to be synchronous or \"in sync\"\u2014and those that are not are \"asynchronous\".\nToday, time synchronization can occur between systems around the world through satellite navigation signals and other time and frequency transfer techniques.\nNavigation and railways.\nTime-keeping and synchronization of clocks is a critical problem in long-distance ocean navigation. Before radio navigation and satellite-based navigation, navigators required accurate time in conjunction with astronomical observations to determine how far east or west their vessel traveled. The invention of an accurate marine chronometer revolutionized marine navigation. By the end of the 19th century, important ports provided time signals in the form of a signal gun, flag, or dropping time ball so that mariners could check and correct their chronometers for error.\nSynchronization was important in the operation of 19th-century railways, these being the first major means of transport fast enough for differences in local mean time between nearby towns to be noticeable. Each line handled the problem by synchronizing all its stations to headquarters as a standard railway time. In some territories, companies shared a single railroad track and needed to avoid collisions. The need for strict timekeeping led the companies to settle on one standard, and civil authorities eventually abandoned local mean time in favor of railway time.\nCommunication.\nIn electrical engineering terms, for digital logic and data transfer, a synchronous circuit requires a clock signal. A clock signal simply signals the start or end of some time period, often measured in microseconds or nanoseconds, that has an arbitrary relationship to any other system of measurement of the passage of minutes, hours, and days.\nIn a different sense, electronic systems are sometimes synchronized to make events at points far apart appear simultaneous or near-simultaneous from a certain perspective. Timekeeping technologies such as the GPS satellites and Network Time Protocol (NTP) provide real-time access to a close approximation to the UTC timescale and are used for many terrestrial synchronization applications of this kind.\nIn computer science (especially parallel computing), synchronization is the coordination of simultaneous threads or processes to complete a task with correct runtime order and no unexpected race conditions; see synchronization (computer science) for details.\nSynchronization is also an important concept in the following fields:\nDynamical systems.\nSynchronization of multiple interacting dynamical systems can occur when the systems are autonomous oscillators. Poincar\u00e9 phase oscillators are model systems that can interact and partially synchronize within random or regular networks. In the case of global synchronization of phase oscillators, an abrupt transition from unsynchronized to full synchronization takes place when the coupling strength exceeds a critical threshold. This is known as the Kuramoto model phase transition. Synchronization is an emergent property that occurs in a broad range of dynamical systems, including neural signaling, the beating of the heart and the synchronization of fire-fly light waves . A unified approach that quantifies synchronization in chaotic systems can be derived from the statistical analysis of measured data.\nApplications.\nNetwork physiology.\nSynchronization and global synchronization phenomena play essential role in the field of Network Physiology with focus on whole-body research to understand the mechanisms through which physiological systems and sub-systems \u2014 from sub-cellular, metabolic and genomic scale to cellular and neuronal networks, to organs and the organism level \u2014 synchronize their dynamics to coordinate functions and generate distinct physiological states in health and disease. Amplitude, frequency, and phase synchronization, as forms of coupling and interaction, underlie biological/physiological network mechanisms through which global states, functions and behaviors emerge at the system and organism level . Synchronization has been reported across physiological systems and levels of integration, including cardio-respiratory coupling ; maternal-fetal cardiac phase-synchronization ; brain blood flow velocity vs. peripheral blood pressure in stroke ; synchronization in neuron synaptic function ; organ networks ; EEG-synchronization and EEG-desynchronization in NREM and REM sleep ; brain waves synchronization and anti-synchronization during rest, exercise, cognitive tasks, sleep and wake ; cortio-muscular synchronization ; synchronization in pancreatic cells and metabolism ; inter-muscular muscle fibers synchronization in exercise and fatigue ; neuromodulation and Parkinson's, dystonia and epilepsy ; circadian synchrony of sleep, nutrition and physical activity . \nNeuroscience.\nIn cognitive neuroscience, (stimulus-dependent) (phase-)synchronous oscillations of neuron populations serve to solve the general binding problem. According to the so-called Binding-By-Synchrony (BBS) Hypothesis a precise temporal correlation between the impulses of neurons (\"cross-correlation analysis\") and thus a stimulus-dependent temporal synchronization of the coherent activity of subpopulations of neurons emerges. Moreover, this synchronization mechanism circumvents the \"superposition problem\" by more effectively identifying the signature of synchronous neuronal signals as belonging together for subsequent (sub-)cortical information processing areas.\nCognitive science.\nIn cognitive science, integrative (phase) synchronization mechanisms in cognitive neuroarchitectures of modern connectionism that include coupled oscillators (e.g.\"Oscillatory Networks\") are used to solve the binding problem of cognitive neuroscience in perceptual cognition (\"feature binding\") and in language cognition (\"variable binding\").\nBiological networks.\nThere is a concept that the synchronization of biochemical reactions determines biological homeostasis. According to this theory, all reactions occurring in a living cell are synchronized in terms of quantities and timescales to maintain biological network functional.\nHuman movement.\nSynchronization of movement is defined as similar movements between two or more people who are temporally aligned. This is different from mimicry, which occurs after a short delay. Line dance and military step are examples.\nMuscular bonding is the idea that moving in time evokes particular emotions. This sparked some of the first research into movement synchronization and its effects on human emotion. In groups, synchronization of movement has been shown to increase conformity, cooperation and trust.\nIn dyads, groups of two people, synchronization has been demonstrated to increase affiliation, self-esteem, compassion and altruistic behaviour and increase rapport. During arguments, synchrony between the arguing pair has been noted to decrease; however, it is not clear whether this is due to the change in emotion or other factors. There is evidence to show that movement synchronization requires other people to cause its beneficial effects, as the effect on affiliation does not occur when one of the dyad is synchronizing their movements to something outside the dyad. This is known as interpersonal synchrony.\nThere has been dispute regarding the true effect of synchrony in these studies. Research in this area detailing the positive effects of synchrony, have attributed this to synchrony alone; however, many of the experiments incorporate a shared intention to achieve synchrony. Indeed, the Reinforcement of Cooperation Model suggests that perception of synchrony leads to reinforcement that cooperation is occurring, which leads to the pro-social effects of synchrony. More research is required to separate the effect of intentionality from the beneficial effect of synchrony.\nUses.\nSynchronization is important in digital telephony, video and digital audio where streams of sampled data are manipulated. Synchronization of image and sound was an important technical problem in sound film. More sophisticated film, video, and audio applications use time code to synchronize audio and video. In movie and television production it is necessary to synchronize video frames from multiple cameras. In addition to enabling basic editing, synchronization can also be used for 3D reconstruction\nIn electric power systems, alternator synchronization is required when multiple generators are connected to an electrical grid.\nArbiters are needed in digital electronic systems such as microprocessors to deal with asynchronous inputs. There are also electronic digital circuits called \"synchronizers\" that attempt to perform arbitration in one clock cycle. Synchronizers, unlike arbiters, are prone to failure. (See metastability in electronics).\nEncryption systems usually require some synchronization mechanism to ensure that the receiving cipher is decoding the right bits at the right time.\nAutomotive transmissions contain synchronizers that bring the toothed rotating parts (gears and splined shaft) to the same rotational velocity before engaging the teeth.\nFlash synchronization synchronizes the flash with the shutter.\nSome systems may be only approximately synchronized, or plesiochronous. Some applications require that relative offsets between events be determined. For others, only the order of the event is important.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is associated with the legend of Robin Hood. The forest was proclaimed by William the Conqueror and mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086. The reserve has the highest concentration of ancient trees in Europe.\nToday, Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve encompasses , surrounding the village of Edwinstowe and the site of Thoresby Hall. The reserve contains more than a thousand ancient oaks which are known to be more than 500 years old, with the Major Oak being twice that age. Sherwood Forest is within an area which used to be called \"Birch Lund\", which is Viking in origin, now known as Birklands. The oak trees from Sherwood Forest were used to build the roof of St Paul's Cathedral in London and 1st Viscount Nelson's naval fleet.\nEtymology.\nSherwood originally was named Sciryuda in 958 AD, meaning the \"woodland belonging to the shire\". Its name is derived from its status as the shire (or sher) wood of Nottinghamshire, which extended into several neighbouring counties (shires), bordered to the west by the River Erewash and the Forest of East Derbyshire.\nPrehistory.\nThe area has been wooded since the end of the Last Glacial Period (as attested by pollen sampling cores). This was about 10,000 years ago.\nEvidence of flint tools have shown use in Sherwood Forest by prehistoric hunter gatherers. During the Iron Age and Roman periods human habitation and farming was common. In the 9th century farming made an impact on Sherwood's landscape.\nHistory.\nDuring Roman Britain various camps were discovered in parts of Sherwood Forest. It is to this that two remains of Roman villas were identified in nearby Mansfield Woodhouse by Major Hayman Rooke in 1787.\nSherwood Forest was first recorded as being named Sciryuda in 958 AD.\nKing Edwin of Northumbria in 633 AD was killed at Hatfield Chase in a battle against his Mercian rival King Penda of Mercia and his body was carried into the forest and buried/hidden in St Mary's Church, Edwinstowe. His head was later buried in York and his body in Whitby. The village of Edwinstowe takes its name from King Edwin of Northumbria.\nIn 1066, in the invasion of England, William the Conqueror made Sherwood Forest a Royal Hunting Forest. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, the forest covered perhaps a quarter of Nottinghamshire (approximately 19,000 acres or 7,800 hectares) in woodland and heath subject to the forest laws.\nThe earliest notice of the forest at Sherwood was at the time of Henry II when William Peverel the Younger answered the plea of the forest, to which he profited and controlled the area.\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries Christian Monastic Orders had established large estates within Sherwood Forest. Three Abbeys were founded Rufford Abbey, Newstead Abbey and Thurgarton Priory.\nSherwood Forest was frequently visited by the Mercian Kings.The forest became popular with King John and Edward I. The remains of a hunting lodge can be found at Kings Clipstone named King John's Palace. Prior to King John reluctantly signing the Magna Carta at Runnymede in 1215, the Forest Laws came with much displeasure to the ruling classes of the forest.\nAfter the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII in 1536, the land of Sherwood was sold and granted into private ownership which was converted into house estates. James I in the 1600s visited the forest, as did Charles I and Charles II brought back under control the management of Sherwood Forest. \nSherwood Forest in 1623 had a narrow escape from a fire which broke out. The only record of this occurrence is written in a letter which is preserved in the British Museum.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries Charles II and then Queen Anne sold large areas of Sherwood Crown Land to private owners who built the estates of Thoresby Hall, The former Clumber House, Welbeck Abbey and Worksop Manor. These estates became known as the Dukeries. Newstead Abbey was converted into a country House and Rufford Abbey was partially demolished and converted into a country House.\nMansfield anciently became the pre-eminent in importance among the towns of the forest.\nGeology.\nSherwood Forest is established over an area underlain by the Permian and Triassic age New Red Sandstone. The larger part of the Forest is found across the outcrop of pebbly sandstones known as the Chester Formation. The regional dip is a gentle one to the east, hence younger rocks are found in that direction and older ones exposed to the west. The local stratigraphy is (uppermost/youngest at top):\nThe sandstone is an aquifer providing a local water supply. Quaternary deposits include river sands and gravels, river terrace deposits and some scattered mid-Pleistocene glacial till. There are 41 local geodiversity sites within the Sherwood NCA; these are largely quarries and river sections.\nManagement and conservation.\nThe Sherwood Forest Trust is a small charity that covers the ancient royal boundary and current national character area of Sherwood Forest. Its aims are based on conservation, heritage and communities but also include tourism and the economy.\nNottinghamshire County Council and Forestry England jointly manage the ancient remnant of forest north of the village of Edwinstowe, providing walks, footpaths and a host of other activities.\nThis central core of ancient Sherwood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Birklands and Bilhaugh, NNR and Special Area of Conservation (SAC). It is a very important site for ancient oaks, wood pasture, invertebrates and fungi, as well as being linked to the legends of Robin Hood.\nDuring the Second World War parts of Sherwood Forest were used extensively by the military for ammunition stores, POW camps and training areas. Oil was produced at Eakring. After the war large ammunition dumps were abandoned in the forest and were not cleared until 1952, with at least 46,000 tons of ammunition in them.\nPart of the forest was opened to the public as a country park in 1969 by Nottinghamshire County Council, which manages a small part of the forest under lease from the Thoresby Estate. In 2002 a portion of Sherwood Forest was designated a national nature reserve by English Nature. In 2007 Natural England officially incorporated the Budby South Forest, Nottinghamshire's largest area of dry lowland heath, into the Nature Reserve, nearly doubling its size from .\nA new Sherwood Forest Visitor Centre was authorised in 2015. In August 2018 the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) opened the new development with a shop and caf\u00e9, having been granted permission to manage the woods in 2015. Part of an agreement with Natural England was that the land where the existing 1970s visitor centre was located would be restored to wood pasture.\nSome portions of the forest retain many very old oaks, especially in the portion known as the Dukeries, south of the town of Worksop, which was so called because it used to contain four ducal residences, as well as a number of other country estates.\nThe River Idle, a tributary of the Trent, is formed in Sherwood Forest from the confluence of several minor streams.\nTourism.\nSherwood attracts around 350,000 tourists annually, many from other countries. Each August the nature reserve hosts a week-long Robin Hood Festival. This event recreates a medieval atmosphere and features the major characters from the Robin Hood legend. The week's entertainment includes jousters and strolling players dressed in medieval attire, in addition to a medieval encampment complete with jesters, musicians, rat-catchers, alchemists and fire eaters.\nThe Sherwood Forest Art and Craft Centre is in the former coach house and stables of Edwinstowe Hall. The centre contains art studios and a cafe and hosts special events, including craft demonstrations and exhibitions.\nMajor Oak.\nSherwood Forest is home to the Major Oak, an oak tree between 800 and 1,000 years old, and since the Victorian era, its limbs have been partially supported by scaffolding. The Major Oak was identified by Major Hayman Rooke in 1790. It is believed that the Major Oak took the name of Major Hayman Rooke. The Major Oak used to be named the Cockpen Tree, after the cockfighting that once took place beneath it.\nSamplings of the Major Oak have been planted in the US ambassadors' Winfield House in London.\nThe Major Oak was featured on the 2005 BBC TV programme \"Seven Natural Wonders\" as one of the natural wonders of the Midlands.\nParliament Oak.\nThe Parliament Oak is situated in Sherwood Forest near Market Warsop. It is reputed that King John in 1212 and King Edward I in 1290 had impromptu parliaments at the tree.\nThynghowe.\nThynghowe, an important Danelaw meeting place where people came to resolve disputes and settle issues, was lost to history until its rediscovery in 2005\u201306 by local history enthusiasts amidst the old oaks of an area known as the Birklands. Experts believe it may also yield clues about the boundary of the ancient Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria.\nEnglish Heritage inspected the site, confirming that it was known as 'Thynghowe' in 1334 and 1609.\nPolitics.\nThe forest gives its name to the Parliamentary constituency of Sherwood Forest (formerly Sherwood before the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies). This is current represented by one member of parliament.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's 11th-largest island, it is situated east of Borneo, west of the Maluku Islands, and south of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo, and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra are more populous.\nThe landmass of Sulawesi includes four peninsulas: the northern Minahasa Peninsula, the East Peninsula, the South Peninsula, and the Southeast Peninsula. Three gulfs separate these peninsulas: the Gulf of Tomini between the northern Minahasa and East peninsulas, the Tolo Gulf between the East and Southeast peninsulas, and the Gulf of Boni between the South and Southeast peninsulas. The Strait of Makassar runs along the western side of the island and separates the island from Borneo.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Sulawesi\" possibly comes from the words \"sula\" (\"island\") and \"besi\" (\"iron\") and may refer to the historical export of iron from the rich Lake Matano iron deposits. The name came into common use in English following Indonesian independence.\nThe name \"Celebes\" was originally given to the island by Portuguese explorers. While its direct translation is unclear, it might be considered a Portuguese rendering of the native name \"Sulawesi\".\nGeography.\nSulawesi is the world's eleventh-largest island, covering an area of (including minor islands administered as part of Sulawesi). The central part of the island is ruggedly mountainous, such that the island's peninsulas have traditionally been remote from each other, with better connections by sea than by road. The three bays that divide Sulawesi's peninsulas are, from north to south, the Tomini, the Tolo and the Boni. These separate the Minahasa or Northern Peninsula, the East Peninsula, the Southeast Peninsula and the South Peninsula.\nThe Strait of Makassar runs along the western side of the island. The island is surrounded by Borneo to the west, by the Philippines to the north, by Maluku to the east, and by Flores and Timor to the south.\nMinor islands.\nThe Selayar Islands make up a chain stretching southwards from Southwest Sulawesi into the Flores Sea are administratively part of Sulawesi. The Sangihe Islands and Talaud Islands stretch northward from the northeastern tip of Sulawesi, while Buton and Muna Islands and their neighbors lie off its southeast peninsula, the Togian Islands are in the Gulf of Tomini, and Peleng Island and the Banggai Islands form a cluster between Sulawesi and Maluku. All the above-mentioned islands and many smaller ones off the coasts of Sulawesi are administratively part of Sulawesi's six provinces.\nGeology.\nThe island slopes up from the shores of the deep seas surrounding the island to a high, mostly non-volcanic, mountainous interior. Active volcanoes are found in the northern Minahasa Peninsula, stretching north to the Sangihe Islands. The northern peninsula contains several active volcanoes such as Mount Lokon, Mount Awu, Soputan and Karangetang.\nAccording to plate reconstructions, the island is believed to have been formed by the collision of terranes from the Asian Plate (forming the west and southwest) and from the Australian Plate (forming the southeast and Banggai), with island arcs previously in the Pacific (forming the north and east peninsulas). Because of its several tectonic origins, various faults scar the land and as a result the island is prone to earthquakes, including the deadly 2018 and 2021 quakes.\nOff the eastern coast of Sulawesi, the North Banda Sea was created through subduction rollback during the early Miocene. Evidence for this tectonic event lies with the extensive interconnected fault network found in the area, a volcanic seamount with its surrounding ridges, and an accretionary wedge. Off the coast of east Selawesti and Banggai is an accumulation of carbonate rocks from the late Miocene. These carbonates are likely pinnacle reefs and the carbonate platform has a total thickness of around 180\u2013770 meters.\nSulawesi, in contrast to most of the other islands in the biogeographical region of Wallacea, is not truly oceanic, but a composite island at the centre of the Asia-Australia collision zone. Parts of the island were formerly attached to either the Asian or Australian continental margin and became separated from these areas by vicariant processes. In the west, the opening of the Makassar Strait separated West Sulawesi from Sundaland in the Eocene c. 45 Mya. In the east, the traditional view of collisions of multiple micro-continental fragments sliced from New Guinea with an active volcanic margin in West Sulawesi at different times since the Early Miocene c. 20 Mya has recently been replaced by the hypothesis that extensional fragmentation has followed a single Miocene collision of West Sulawesi with the Sula Spur, the western end of an ancient folded belt of Variscan origin in the Late Paleozoic.\nBone Basin.\nThe Bone Basin lies between the south-eastern and southern arms of Sulawesi. According to recent studies, the basin has been opened up due to extensional forces. The basin is bounded by normal faults on each side of the basin with each side of the basin surrounded by uplifted basement rock with young sediments found in the middle. The past geological history has allowed for a large accumulation of carbonates which could lead to a higher potential of oil and gas occurrences. However, the faults present in the basin makes it a very complicated system.\nPrehistory.\nThe oldest evidence for humans on Sulawesi are stone tools produced by archaic humans, dating to at least 1.04 million years ago and possibly as old as 1.48 million years ago, found at the Calio site near the village of Ujung in Lilirilau district of Soppeng Regency, southwestern Sulawesi. Other archaic human produced stone tools, dating to over 200,000 to 100,000 years ago, have been found at the Talepu site near Cabenge village, which is also located in the Lilirilau district.\nBefore October 2014, the settlement of South Sulawesi by modern humans had been dated to c. 30,000 BC on the basis of radiocarbon dates obtained from rock shelters in Maros. No earlier evidence of human occupation had at that point been found, but the island almost certainly formed part of the land bridge used for the settlement of Australia and New Guinea by at least 40,000 BC. There is no evidence of \"Homo erectus\" having reached Sulawesi; crude stone tools first discovered in 1947 on the right bank of the Walanae River at Barru (now part of Bone Regency), which were thought to date to the Pleistocene on the basis of their association with vertebrate fossils, are now thought to date to perhaps 50,000 BC.\nFollowing Peter Bellwood's model of a southward migration of Austronesian-speaking farmers (AN), radiocarbon dates from caves in Maros suggest a date in the mid-second millennium BC for the arrival of a group from east Borneo speaking a Proto-South Sulawesi language (PSS). Initial settlement was probably around the mouth of the Sa'dan river, on the northwest coast of the peninsula, although the south coast has also been suggested.\nSubsequent migrations across the mountainous landscape resulted in the geographical isolation of PSS speakers and the evolution of their languages into the eight families of the South Sulawesi language group. If each group can be said to have a homeland, that of the Bugis \u2013 today the most numerous group \u2013 was around lakes T\u00e9mp\u00e9 and Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng in the Walenna\u00e9 depression. Here for some 2,000 years lived the linguistic group that would become the modern Bugis; the archaic name of this group (which is preserved in other local languages) was Ugiq. Despite the fact that today they are closely linked with the Makassarese, the closest linguistic neighbors of the Bugis are the Torajans.\nPre-1200 Bugis society was most likely organized into chiefdoms. Some anthropologists have speculated these chiefdoms would have warred and, in times of peace, interbred. Further, they have speculated that personal security would have been negligible and head-hunting an established cultural practice. The political economy would have been a mixture of hunting and gathering and swidden or shifting agriculture. Speculative planting of wet rice may have taken place along the margins of the lakes and rivers.\nIn Central Sulawesi, there are more than 400 granite megaliths (Behoa Valley Pokekea Megalithic Site, Bada and Napu valleys within the Lore Lindu National Park), which various archaeological studies have dated to be from 3000 BC to AD 1300. They vary in size from a few centimeters to approximately . The original purpose of the megaliths is unknown. Approximately 30 of the megaliths represent human forms. Other megaliths are in form of large pots (\"Kalamba\") and stone plates (\"Tutu'na\").\nA burial of a woman associated with the hunter-gatherer Toalean culture dating to 7,000 years ago has yielded DNA that has provided rare insight into early migrations in and through the region.\nCave art.\nIn October 2014, it was announced that cave paintings in Maros had been dated as being approximately 40,000 years old. One of a hand was 39,900 years old, which brings it among the oldest known hand stencils in the world (the record is detained so far by a 64,000 years-old stencil hand made by a Neanderthal in Maltravieso cave, C\u00e1ceres, Spain).\nDr. Maxime Aubert, of Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, said that was the minimum age for the outline in Pettakere Cave in Maros, and added: \"Next to it is a pig that has a minimum age of 35,400 years old, and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one.\"\nOn 11 December 2019, a team of researchers led by Dr. Maxime Aubert announced the discovery of the oldest hunting scenes in prehistoric art in the world that is more than 44,000 years old from the limestone cave of Leang Bulu' Sipong 4. Archaeologists determined the age of the depiction of hunting a pig and buffalo thanks to the calcite 'popcorn', different isotope levels of radioactive uranium and thorium.\nIn March 2020, two small stone 'plaquettes' were found by Griffith University archaeologists in the Leang Bulu Bettue cave, dated to a time between 26,000 and 14,000 years ago. While one of the stones contained an anoa (water buffalo) and what may be a flower, star, or eye, another depicted astronomic rays of light.\nIn January 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of cave art that is at least 45,500 years old in a Leang Tedongnge cave. According to the journal \"Science Advances\", the cave painting of a warty pig is the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region. An adult male pig, measuring 136\u00a0cm x 54\u00a0cm and what is likely a Sulawesi or Celebes warty pig (Sus celebensis), was depicted with horn-like facial warts and two hand prints above its hindquarters. According to co-author Adam Brumm, there are two other pigs that are partly preserved and it appears the warty pig was observing a fight between the two other pigs.\nHistory.\nHindu-Buddhist era.\nA bronze Amaravathi statue was discovered at Sikendeng, South Sulawesi near Karama river in 1921 which was dated to 2nd\u20137th century AD by Bosch (1933). In 1975, small locally made Buddhist statues from 10th-11th century were also discovered in Bontoharu, on the island of Selayar, South Sulawesi.\nStarting in the 13th century, access to prestige trade goods and to sources of iron started to alter long-standing cultural patterns and to permit ambitious individuals to build larger political units. It is not known why these two ingredients appeared together; one was perhaps the product of the other.\nIn 1367, several identified polities located on the island were mentioned in the Javanese manuscript Nagarakretagama dated from the Majapahit period. Canto 14 mentioned polities including Gowa, Makassar, Luwu and Banggai. It seems that by the 14th century, polities in the island were connected in an archipelagic maritime trading network, centered in the Majapahit port in East Java. By 1400, a number of nascent agricultural principalities had arisen in the western Cenrana valley, as well as on the south coast and on the west coast near modern Parepare.\nChristian colonial era.\nThe first Europeans to visit the island (which they believed to be an archipelago due to its contorted shape) were the Portuguese sailors Sim\u00e3o de Abreu in 1523, and Gomes de Sequeira (among others) in 1525, sent from the Moluccas in search of gold, which the islands had the reputation of producing. A Portuguese base was installed in Makassar in the first decades of the 16th century, lasting until 1665, when it was taken by the Dutch. The Dutch had arrived in Sulawesi in 1605 and were quickly followed by the English, who established a factory in Makassar. From 1660, the Dutch were at war with Gowa, the major Makassar west coast power. In 1669, Admiral Speelman forced the ruler, Sultan Hasanuddin, to sign the Treaty of Bongaya, which handed control of trade to the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch were aided in their conquest by the Bugis warlord Arung Palakka, ruler of the Bugis kingdom of Bone. The Dutch built a fort at Ujung Pandang, while Arung Palakka became the regional overlord and Bone the dominant kingdom. Political and cultural development seems to have slowed as a result of the status quo.\nIn 1905, the entire island became part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies until Japanese occupation in the Second World War. During the Indonesian National Revolution, the Dutch Captain 'Turk' Westerling led campaigns in which hundreds, maybe thousands died during the South Sulawesi Campaign. Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, Sulawesi became part of the federal United States of Indonesia, which in 1950 became absorbed into the unitary Republic of Indonesia.\nCentral Sulawesi.\nThe Portuguese were rumoured to have a fort in Parigi in 1555. The Kaili were an important group based in the Palu valley and related to the Toraja. Scholars relate that their control swayed under Ternate and Makassar, but this might have been a decision by the Dutch to give their vassals a chance to govern a difficult group. Padbruge commented that in the 1700s the Kaili population was significantly high and were a highly militant society. In the 1850s, a civil war erupted between the Kaili groups, including the Banawa, in which the Dutch colonial government decided to intervene.\nIn the late 19th century, the Sarasins journeyed through the Palu valley as part of a major initiative to bring the Kaili under Dutch rule. Some very surprising and interesting photographs were taken of shamans called Tadulako. Further Christian religious missions entered the area to make one of the most detailed ethnographic studies in the early 20th century. A Swede by the name of Walter Kaudern later studied much of the literature and produced a synthesis. Erskine Downs in the 1950s produced a summary of Kruyts and Andrianis work: \"The religion of the Bare'e-Speaking Toradja of Central Celebes,\" which is invaluable for English-speaking researchers. One of the most recent publications is \"When the bones are left,\" a study of the material culture of central Sulawesi, offering extensive analysis. Also worthy of study are the brilliant works of Monnig Atkinson on the Wana shamans who live in the Mori area.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 2000 census, the population of the provinces of Sulawesi was 14,946,488, about 7.25% of Indonesia's total population. By the 2010 Census, the total had reached 17,371,782, and the 2020 Census recorded a total of 19,896,951. The official estimate for mid-2023 was 20,568,411. The largest city on Sulawesi is Makassar.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIslam is the majority religion in Sulawesi. The conversion of the lowlands of the south western peninsula (South Sulawesi) to Islam occurred in the early 17th century. The kingdom of Luwu in the Gulf of Bone was the first to embrace Islam in February 1605; the Makassar kingdom of Gowa-Talloq, centred on the modern-day city of Makassar, followed suit in September. However, the Gorontalo and the Mongondow peoples of the northern peninsula largely converted to Islam only in the 19th century. Most Muslims are Sunnis.\nChristians form a substantial minority on the island. According to the demographer Toby Alice Volkman, 17% of Sulawesi's population is Protestant and less than 2% is Catholic. Christians are concentrated on the tip of the northern peninsula around the city of Manado, which is inhabited by the Minahasa, a predominantly Protestant people, and the northernmost Sangir and Talaud Islands. The Toraja people of Tana Toraja in South Sulawesi have largely converted to Christianity since Indonesia's independence. There are also substantial numbers of Christians around Lake Poso in Central Sulawesi, among the Pamona speaking peoples of Central Sulawesi, and near Mamasa.\nThough most people identify themselves as Muslims or Christians, they often subscribe to local beliefs and deities as well.\nSmaller communities of Buddhists and Hindus are also found on Sulawesi, usually among the Chinese, Balinese, and Indian communities.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Sulawesi is heavily centered around agriculture, fishing, mining, and forestry.\nAdministration.\nThe island was administered as one province between 1945 and 1960. In 1960 it was divided into two provinces \u2013 North and Central Sulawesi, and South and Southeast Sulawesi. In 1964 both of these were again divided, the former into North Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi, and the latter into South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi. Today, it is subdivided into six provinces: Gorontalo, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, and North Sulawesi. Among these, the newest provinces are Gorontalo, established in 2000 from part of North Sulawesi, and West Sulawesi, established in 2004 from part of South Sulawesi.\nThe largest cities on the island are the provincial capitals of Makassar, Manado, Palu, Kendari, and Gorontalo (the provincial capital of West Sulawesi \u2013 the town of Mamuju \u2013 is not a city); there are six other cities \u2013 Bitung, Palopo, Bau-Bau, Parepare, Kotamobagu and Tomohun.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFlora and fauna.\nSulawesi is part of Wallacea, meaning that it has a mix of both Indomalayan and Australasian species that reached the island by crossing deep-water oceanic barriers. The flora includes one native eucalypt, \"E. deglupta\". There are 8 national parks on the island, of which 4 are mostly marine. The parks with the largest terrestrial area are Bogani Nani Wartabone with 2,871\u00a0km2 and Lore Lindu National Park with 2,290\u00a0km2. Bunaken National Park, which protects a rich coral ecosystem, has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The coast of northern tip of Sulawesi is identified as a site of highest marine biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle.\nMammals.\nEarly in the Pleistocene, Sulawesi had a dwarf elephant and a dwarf form of \"Stegodon\", (an elephant relative, \"S. sompoensis\"); later both were replaced by larger forms. A giant suid, \"Celebochoerus\", was also formerly present. It is thought that many of the migrants to Sulawesi arrived via the Philippines, while Sulawesi in turn served as a way station for migrants to Flores. A Pleistocene faunal turnover is recognized, with the competitive displacement of several indigenous tarsiers by more recently arriving ones and of \"Celebochoerus\" by other medium-sized herbivores like the babirusa, anoa and Celebes warty pig.\nThere are 127 known extant native mammalian species in Sulawesi. A large percentage, 62% (79 species) are endemic, meaning that they are found nowhere else in the world. The largest of these are the two species of anoa or dwarf buffalo. Other artiodactyl species inhabiting Sulawesi are the warty pig and the babirusas, which are aberrant pigs. The only native carnivoran is the Sulawesi palm civet (Asian palm and Malayan civets have been introduced). Primates present include a number of nocturnal tarsiers (\"T. fuscus\", Dian's, Gursky's, Jatna's, Wallace's, the Lariang and pygmy tarsiers) as well as diurnal macaques (Heck's, the booted, crested black, Gorontalo, moor, and Tonkean macaques). While most of Sulawesi's mammals are placental and have Asian relatives, several species of cuscus, arboreal marsupials of Australasian origin, are also present (\"Ailurops ursinus\" and \"Strigocuscus celebensis\", which are diurnal and nocturnal, respectively).\nSulawesi is home to a large number of endemic rodent genera. Murid rodent genera endemic to Sulawesi and immediately adjacent islands (such as the Togian Islands, Buton Island, and Muna Island) are \"Bunomys\", \"Echiothrix\", \"Margaretamys\", \"Taeromys\" and \"Tateomys\" as well as the single-species genera \"Eropeplus\", \"Hyorhinomys\", \"Melasmothrix\", \"Paucidentomys\", \"Paruromys\", \"Sommeromys\" and the semiaquatic \"Waiomys\". All nine sciurids are from three endemic genera, \"Hyosciurus\", \"Prosciurillus\" and \"Rubrisciurus\".\nWhile over 20 bat species are present on Sulawesi, only a portion of these are endemic: \"Rhinolophus tatar\", \"Scotophilus celebensis\" and the megabats \"Acerodon celebensis\", \"Boneia bidens\", \"Dobsonia exoleta\", \"Harpyionycteris celebensis\", \"Neopteryx frosti\", \"Rousettus celebensis\" and \"Styloctenium wallacei\".\nSeveral endemic shrews, the Sulawesi shrew, Sulawesi tiny shrew and the Sulawesi white-handed shrew, are found on the island.\nSulawesi has no gliding mammals, being situated between Borneo with its colugos and flying squirrels, and Halmahera with its sugar gliders.\nBirds.\nBy contrast, Sulawesian bird species tend to be found on other nearby islands as well, such as Borneo; 31% of Sulawesi's birds are found nowhere else. One endemic (also found on small neighboring islands) is the largely ground-dwelling, chicken-sized maleo, a megapode which sometimes uses hot sand close to the island's volcanic vents to incubate its eggs. An international partnership of conservationists, donors, and local people have formed the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation, in an effort to raise awareness and protect the nesting grounds of these birds on the central-eastern arm of the island. Other endemic birds include the flightless snoring rail, the fiery-browed starling, the Sulawesi masked owl, the Sulawesi myna, the satanic nightjar and the grosbeak starling. There are around 350 known bird species in Sulawesi.\nReptiles.\nThe larger reptiles of Sulawesi are not endemic and include reticulated and Burmese pythons, the Pacific ground boa, king cobras, water monitors, sailfin lizards, saltwater crocodiles and green sea turtles. An extinct giant tortoise, \"Megalochelys atlas\", was formerly present, but disappeared by 840,000 years ago, possibly because of the arrival of Homo erectus. Similarly, komodo dragons or similar lizards appear to have inhabited the island, being among its apex predators. The smaller snakes of Sulawesi include nonendemic forms such as the gliding species \"Chrysopelea paradisi\" and endemic forms such as \"Calamaria boesemani\", \"Calamaria muelleri\", \"Calamaria nuchalis\", \"Cyclotyphlops\", \"Enhydris matannensis\", \"Ptyas dipsas\", \"Rabdion grovesi\", \"Tropidolaemus laticinctus\" and \"Typhlops conradi\". Similarly, the smaller lizards of Sulawesi include nonendemic species such as \"Bronchocela jubata\", \"Dibamus novaeguineae\" and \"Gekko smithii\", as well as endemic species such as \"Lipinia infralineolata\" and \"Gekko iskandari\".\nSulawesi also harbours several species of freshwater chelonians, two of which are endemic. They include the Forsten's tortoise and the Sulawesi forest turtle, both of which likely attribute their respective origins to the dispersal of the mainland Asian elongated tortoise and Malayan flat-shelled turtle from the then-exposed subcontinent of Sundaland during the Pleistocene epoch.\nThe remaining two species consist of the non-endemic Malayan box turtle of the Wallacean subspecies, and the Asiatic softshell turtle.\nAmphibians.\nThe amphibians of Sulawesi include the endemic frogs \"Hylarana celebensis\", \"H. macrops\", \"H. mocquardi\", \"Ingerophrynus celebensis\", \"Limnonectes arathooni\", \"L. larvaepartus\", \"L. microtympanum\", \"Occidozyga celebensis\", \"O. semipalmata\" and \"O. tompotika\" as well as the endemic \"flying frogs\" \"Rhacophorus edentulus\" and \"R. georgii\".\nFreshwater fish.\nSulawesi is home to more than 70 freshwater fish species, including more than 55 endemics. Among these are the genus \"Nomorhamphus\", a species flock of viviparous halfbeaks containing 12 species that only are found on Sulawesi (others are from the Philippines). In addition to \"Nomorhamphus\", the majority of Sulawesi's freshwater fish species are ricefishes, gobies (\"Glossogobius\" and \"Mugilogobius\") and Telmatherinid sail-fin silversides. The last family is almost entirely restricted to Sulawesi, especially the Malili Lake system, consisting of Matano and Towuti, and the small Lontoa (Wawantoa), Mahalona and Masapi. Another unusual endemic is \"Lagusia micracanthus\" from rivers in South Sulawesi, which is the sole member of its genus and among the smallest grunters. The gudgeon \"Bostrychus microphthalmus\" from the Maros Karst is the only described species of cave-adapted fish from Sulawesi, but an apparently undescribed species from the same region and genus also exists.\nFreshwater crustaceans and snails.\nMany species of \"Caridina\" freshwater shrimp and parathelphusid freshwater crabs (\"Migmathelphusa\", \"Nautilothelphusa\", \"Parathelphusa\", \"Sundathelphusa\" and \"Syntripsa\") are endemic to Sulawesi. Several of these species have become very popular in the aquarium hobby, and since most are restricted to a single lake system, they are potentially vulnerable to habitat loss and overexploitation. There are also several endemic cave-adapted shrimp and crabs, especially in the Maros Karst. This includes \"Cancrocaeca xenomorpha\", which has been called the \"most highly cave-adapted species of crab known in the world\".\nThe genus \"Tylomelania\" of freshwater snails is also endemic to Sulawesi, with the majority of the species restricted to Lake Poso and the Malili Lake system.\nInsects.\nThe \"Trigonopterus selayarensis\" is a flightless weevil endemic to Sulawesi.\nMiscellaneous.\nThe Indonesian coelacanth and the mimic octopus are present in the waters off Sulawesi's coast.\nConservation.\nSulawesi island was recently the subject of an Ecoregional Conservation Assessment, coordinated by The Nature Conservancy. Detailed reports about the vegetation of the island are available. The assessment produced a detailed and annotated list of 'conservation portfolio' sites. This information was widely distributed to local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Detailed conservation priorities have also been outlined in a recent publication.\nThe lowland forests on the island have mostly been removed. Because of the relative geological youth of the island and its dramatic and sharp topography, the lowland areas are naturally limited in their extent. The past decade has seen dramatic conversion of this rare and endangered habitat. The island also possesses one of the largest outcrops of serpentine soil in the world, which support an unusual and large community of specialized plant species. Overall, the flora and fauna of this unique center of global biodiversity is very poorly documented and understood and remains critically threatened.\nThe islands of Pepaya, Mas, and Raja islands, located in Sumalata Village \u2013 North Gorontalo Regency (about 30\u00a0km from Saronde Island), have been named a nature reserve since the Dutch colonial time in 1936. Four of the only seven species of sea turtles can be found in the islands, the world's best turtle habitat. They include penyu hijau (\"Chelonia midas\"), penyu sisik (\"Eretmochelys imbricata\"), penyu tempayan (\"Caretta caretta\") and penyu belimbing (\"Dermochelys coriacea\"). In 2011, the habitat was threatened by human activities such as illegal poaching and fish bombing activities; furthermore, many coral reefs, which represent a source of food for turtles, have been damaged.\nEnvironment.\nThe largest environmental issue in Sulawesi is deforestation. In 2007, scientists found that 80 percent of Sulawesi's forest had been lost or degraded, especially centered in the lowlands and the mangroves. Forests have been felled for logging and large agricultural projects. Loss of forest has resulted in many of Sulawesi's endemic species becoming endangered. In addition, 99 percent of Sulawesi's wetlands have been lost or damaged.\nOther environmental threats included bushmeat hunting and mining.\nParks.\nThe island of Sulawesi has six national parks and nineteen nature reserves. In addition, Sulawesi has three marine protected areas. Many of Sulawesi's parks are threatened by logging, mining, and deforestation for agriculture.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28741", "revid": "39091063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28741", "title": "Southeast Asia", "text": "Subregion of the Asian continent\nSoutheast Asia is the geographical southeastern region of Asia, consisting of the regions that are situated south of China, east of the Indian subcontinent, and northwest of mainland Australia, which is part of Oceania. Southeast Asia is bordered to the north by East Asia, to the west by South Asia and the Bay of Bengal, to the east by Oceania and the Pacific Ocean, and to the south by Australia and the Indian Ocean. Apart from the British Indian Ocean Territory and two out of 26 atolls of the Maldives in South Asia, Maritime Southeast Asia is the only other subregion of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere. Mainland Southeast Asia is entirely in the Northern Hemisphere. Timor-Leste and the southern portion of Indonesia are the parts of Southeast Asia that lie south of the equator.\nThe region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with both heavy seismic and volcanic activities. The Sunda plate is the main plate of the region, featuring almost all Southeast Asian countries except Myanmar, northern Thailand, northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and northern Luzon of the Philippines, while the Sunda plate only includes western Indonesia to as far east as the Indonesian province of Bali. The mountain ranges in Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lesser Sunda Islands, and Timor are part of the Alpide belt, while the islands of the Philippines and Indonesia as well as Timor-Leste are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Both seismic belts meet in Indonesia, causing the region to have relatively high occurrences of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, particularly in the Philippines and Indonesia.\nIt covers about , which is 8% of Eurasia and 3% of Earth's total land area. Its total population is more than million, about 8.5% of the world's population. It is the third most populous geographical region in Asia after South Asia and East Asia. The region is culturally and ethnically diverse, with hundreds of languages spoken by different ethnic groups. The eleven countries in the region are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a regional organisation established for economic, political, military, educational, and cultural integration among its members.\nSoutheast Asia is one of the most culturally diverse regions of the world. There are many different languages and ethnicities in the region. Historically, Southeast Asia was significantly influenced by Indian, Chinese, Muslim, and colonial cultures, which became core components of the region's cultural and political institutions. Most modern Southeast Asian countries were colonised by European powers. European colonisation exploited natural resources and labour from the lands they conquered, and attempted to spread European institutions to the region. Several Southeast Asian countries were also briefly occupied by the Empire of Japan during World War II. The aftermath of World War II saw most of the region decolonised. Today, Southeast Asia is predominantly governed by independent states.\nDefinition.\nThe region, together with part of South Asia, was well known by Europeans as the East Indies or simply the Indies until the 20th century. Chinese sources referred to the region as \"Nanyang\" (\"\u5357\u6d0b\"), which literally means the \"Southern Ocean\". The mainland section of Southeast Asia was referred to as Indochina by European geographers due to its location between China and the Indian subcontinent and its having cultural influences from both neighbouring regions. In the 20th century, however, the term became more restricted to territories of the former French Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). The maritime section of Southeast Asia is also known as the Malay Archipelago, a term derived from the European concept of a Malay race. Another term for Maritime Southeast Asia is \"Insulindia\" (Indian Islands), used to describe the region between Indochina and Australasia.\nThe term \"Southeast Asia\" was first used in 1839 by American pastor Howard Malcolm in his book \"Travels in South-Eastern Asia\". Malcolm only included the Mainland section and excluded the Maritime section in his definition of Southeast Asia. The term was officially used in the midst of World War II by the Allies, through the formation of South East Asia Command (SEAC) in 1943. SEAC popularised the use of the term \"Southeast Asia\", although what constituted Southeast Asia was not fixed; for example, SEAC excluded the Philippines and a large part of Indonesia while including Ceylon. However, by the late 1970s, a roughly standard usage of the term \"Southeast Asia\" and the territories it encompasses had emerged. Although from a cultural or linguistic perspective the definitions of \"Southeast Asia\" may vary, the most common definitions nowadays include the area represented by the countries (sovereign states and dependent territories) listed below.\nAll eleven states of Southeast Asia are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Papua New Guinea has stated that it might join ASEAN, and is currently an observer. Sovereignty issues exist over some islands in the South China Sea.\nGeographical divisions.\nSoutheast Asia is geographically divided into two subregions, namely Mainland Southeast Asia (or the Indochinese Peninsula) and Maritime Southeast Asia.\nMainland Southeast Asia includes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMaritime Southeast Asia includes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWhile Peninsular Malaysia is geographically situated in Mainland Southeast Asia, it shares many similar cultural and ecological affinities with surrounding islands, thus it is often grouped with them as part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Geographically, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India is also considered a part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Eastern Bangladesh and Northeast India have strong cultural ties with Mainland Southeast Asia and are sometimes considered transregional areas between South Asia and Southeast Asia (see also: Eastern South Asia and Southeast Asian relations with Northeast India). To the east, Hong Kong is sometimes regarded as part of Southeast Asia. Similarly, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have strong cultural ties with Maritime Southeast Asia and are sometimes considered transregional areas between Southeast Asia and Australia/Oceania. On some occasions, Sri Lanka has been considered a part of Southeast Asia because of its cultural and religious ties to Mainland Southeast Asia. The eastern half of the island of New Guinea, which is not a part of Indonesia, namely, Papua New Guinea, is sometimes included as a part of Maritime Southeast Asia, and so are Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau, which were all parts of the Spanish East Indies with strong cultural and linguistic ties to the region, specifically, the Philippines.\nTimor-Leste and the eastern half of Indonesia (east of the Wallace Line in the region of Wallacea) are considered to be geographically associated with Oceania due to their distinctive faunal features. Geologically, the island of New Guinea and its surrounding islands are considered as parts of the Australian continent, connected via the Sahul Shelf. Both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are located on the Australian plate, south of the Sunda Trench. Even though they are geographically closer to Maritime Southeast Asia than mainland Australia, these two Australian external territories are not geologically associated with Asia as none of them is actually on the Sunda plate. The UN Statistics Division's geoscheme, which is a UN political geography tool created specifically for statistical purposes, has classified both island territories as parts of Oceania, under the UNSD subregion \"Australia and New Zealand\" (Australasia).\nSome definitions of Southeast Asia may include Taiwan. Taiwan has sometimes been included in Southeast Asia as well as East Asia but is not a member of ASEAN. Likewise, a similar argument could be applied to some southern parts of mainland China, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, may also considered as part of Southeast Asia as well as East Asia but are not members of ASEAN.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe region was already inhabited by \"Homo erectus\" from approximately 1,500,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene age. Distinct \"Homo sapiens\" groups, ancestral to Eastern non-African (related to East Asians as well as Papuans) populations, reached the region by between 50,000BC to 70,000BC, with some arguing earlier. Rock art (parietal art) dating from 40,000 to 60,000 years ago (which is currently the world's oldest) has been discovered in the caves of Sulawesi and Borneo (Kalimantan). \"Homo floresiensis\" also lived in the area up until at least 50,000 years ago, after which they became extinct. During much of this time the present-day islands of Western Indonesia were joined into a single landmass with the Malay Peninsula known as Sundaland due to much lower sea levels. The Gulf of Thailand was dry land which connected Sundaland with Mainland Southeast Asia.\nDistinctive Basal-East Eurasian (Eastern non-African) ancestry was recently found to have originated in Mainland Southeast Asia at ~50,000BC, and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards respectively, giving rise to both Oceanian (Papuan related) and basal East Asian (Onge and Tianyuan related) lineages. \nAncient remains of hunter-gatherers in Maritime Southeast Asia, such as one Holocene hunter-gatherer from South Sulawesi, had ancestry from both the Oceanian-related and East Asian-related branches of the Eastern non-African lineage. The hunter-gatherer individual had approximately ~50% \"Basal-East Asian\" ancestry, modeled as Onge or Tianyuan-like ancestry, and was positioned in between the Andamanese Onge and the Papuans of Oceania. The authors concluded that the presence of this ancestry in the Holocene hunter-gatherer suggests that East Asian-related admixture from Mainland Southeast Asia into Maritime Southeast Asia may have taken place long before the expansion of Austronesian societies. Geneflow of East Asian-related ancestry into Maritime Southeast Asia and Oceania could be estimated to ~25,000BC (possibly even earlier). \nThe pre-Neolithic Oceanian-related populations of Maritime Southeast Asia were largely replaced by the expansion of various East Asian-related populations, beginning about 50,000BC to 25,000BC years ago from Mainland Southeast Asia. East Asian-related ancestry was already widespread across Southeast Asia by 15,000BC, predating the expansion of Austroasiatic and Austronesian peoples. \nSamples dated to c.\u200910,000\u20132000 BCE from the Hoabinhian hunter-gatherer lithic techno-complex in Mainland Southeast Asia, which predated the Austronesian and Austroasiatic expansions, display the closest genetic affinities to basal East Asian lineages related to the Upper Paleolithic Tianyuan man from northern China, as well as the prehistoric J\u014dmon peoples of Japan. Compared to modern populations, they share the closest affinities to the Andamanese Onge and Jarawa, and the Semang (also known as \"Malaysian Negritos\") and Maniq in the interior of the Malay Peninsula.\nIn the late Neolithic, the Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste, migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan in the first seaborne human migration known as the Austronesian Expansion. They arrived in the northern Philippines between 7,000 BC to 2,200 BC and rapidly spread further into the Northern Mariana Islands and Borneo by 1500 BC; Island Melanesia by 1300 BC; and to the rest of Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Vietnam, and Palau by 1000 BC. They often settled along coastal areas, replacing and assimilating the diverse preexisting peoples. The remainders of these preexisting populations, known as Negritos, form small minority groups in geographically isolated regions.\nThe Austronesian peoples of Southeast Asia have been seafarers for thousands of years. They spread eastwards to Micronesia and Polynesia, as well as westwards to Madagascar, becoming the ancestors of modern-day Malagasy, Micronesians, Melanesians, and Polynesians. Passage through the Indian Ocean aided the colonisation of Madagascar, as well as commerce between Western Asia, eastern coast of India and Chinese southern coast. Gold from Sumatra is thought to have reached as far west as Rome. Pliny the Elder wrote in his \"Natural History\" about Chryse and Argyre, two legendary islands rich in gold and silver, located in the Indian Ocean. Their vessels, such as the vinta, were capable to sail across the ocean. Magellan's voyage records how much more manoeuvrable their vessels were, as compared to the European ships. A slave from the Sulu Sea was believed to have been used in the Magellan expedition as a translator.\nStudies presented by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) through genetic studies of the various peoples of Asia show empirically that there was a single migration event from Africa, whereby the early people travelled along the south coast of Asia, first entered the Malay Peninsula 50,000\u201390,000 years ago. The Orang Asli, in particular the Semang who show Negrito characteristics, are the direct descendants of these earliest settlers of Southeast Asia. These early people diversified and travelled slowly northwards to China, and the populations of Southeast Asia show greater genetic diversity than the younger population of China.\nSolheim and others have shown evidence for a \"Nusantao\" maritime trading network ranging from Vietnam to the rest of the archipelago as early as 5000 BC to 1 AD. The Bronze Age Dong Son culture flourished in Northern Vietnam from about 1000 BC to 1 BC. Its influence spread to other parts Southeast Asia. The region entered the Iron Age era in 500 BC, when iron was forged also in northern Vietnam still under Dong Son, due to its frequent interactions with neighbouring China.\nMost Southeast Asian people were originally animist, engaged in ancestors, nature, and spirits worship. These belief systems were later supplanted by Hinduism and Buddhism after the region, especially coastal areas, came under contact with Indian subcontinent during the first century. Indian Brahmins and traders brought Hinduism to the region and made contacts with local courts. Local rulers converted to Hinduism or Buddhism and adopted Indian religious traditions to reinforce their legitimacy, elevate ritual status above their fellow chief counterparts and facilitate trade with South Asian states. They periodically invited Indian Brahmins into their realms and began a gradual process of Indianisation in the region. Shaivism was the dominant religious tradition of many southern Indian Hindu kingdoms during the first century. It then spread into Southeast Asia via the Bay of Bengal, Indochina, then Malay Archipelago, leading to thousands of Shiva temples on the islands of Indonesia as well as Cambodia and Vietnam, co-evolving with Buddhism in the region. Theravada Buddhism entered the region during the third century, via maritime trade routes between the region and Sri Lanka. Buddhism later established a strong presence in Funan region in the fifth century. In present-day mainland Southeast Asia, Theravada is still the dominant branch of Buddhism, practised by the Thai, Burmese, and Cambodian Buddhists. This branch was fused with the Hindu-influenced Khmer culture. Mahayana Buddhism established presence in Maritime Southeast Asia, brought by Chinese monks during their transit in the region en route to Nalanda. It is still the dominant branch of Buddhism practised by Indonesian and Malaysian Buddhists.\nThe spread of these two Indian religions confined the adherents of Southeast Asian indigenous beliefs into remote inland areas. The Maluku Islands and New Guinea were never Indianised and its native people were predominantly animists until the 15th century when Islam began to spread in those areas. While in Vietnam, Buddhism never managed to develop strong institutional networks due to strong Chinese influence. In present-day Southeast Asia, Vietnam is the only country where its folk religion makes up the plurality. Recently, Vietnamese folk religion is undergoing a revival with the support of the government. Elsewhere, there are ethnic groups in Southeast Asia that resisted conversion and still retain their original animist beliefs, such as the Dayaks in Kalimantan, the Igorots in Luzon, and the Shans in eastern Myanmar.\nHindu and Buddhist kingdoms era.\nAfter the region came under contact with the Indian subcontinent c.\u2009400 BCE, it began a gradual process of Indianisation where Indian ideas such as religions, cultures, architectures, and political administrations were brought by traders and religious figures and adopted by local rulers. In turn, Indian Brahmins and monks were invited by local rulers to live in their realms and help transforming local polities to become more Indianised, blending Indian and indigenous traditions. Sanskrit and Pali became the elite language of the region, which effectively made Southeast Asia part of the Indosphere. Most of the region had been Indianised during the first centuries, while the Philippines later Indianised c.\u2009ninth century when Kingdom of Tondo was established in Luzon. Vietnam, especially its northern part, was never fully Indianised due to the many periods of Chinese domination it experienced.\nThe first Indian-influenced polities established in the region were the Pyu city-states that already existed circa second century BCE, located in inland Myanmar. It served as an overland trading hub between India and China. Theravada Buddhism was the predominant religion of these city states, while the presence of other Indian religions such as Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism were also widespread. In the first century, the Funan states centered in Mekong Delta were established, encompassed modern-day Cambodia, southern Vietnam, Laos, and eastern Thailand. It became the dominant trading power in mainland Southeast Asia for about five centuries, provided passage for Indian and Chinese goods and assumed authority over the flow of commerce through Southeast Asia. In maritime Southeast Asia, the first recorded Indianised kingdom was Salakanagara, established in western Java circa second century CE. This Hindu kingdom was known by the Greeks as \"Argyre\" (Land of Silver).\nBy the fifth century CE, trade networking between East and West was concentrated in the maritime route. Foreign traders were starting to use new routes such as Malacca and Sunda Strait due to the development of maritime Southeast Asia. This change resulted in the decline of Funan, while new maritime powers such as Srivijaya, Tarumanagara, and Mataram emerged. Srivijaya especially became the dominant maritime power for more than 5 centuries, controlling both Strait of Malacca and Sunda Strait. This dominance started to decline when Srivijaya were invaded by Chola Empire, a dominant maritime power of Indian subcontinent, in 1025. The invasion reshaped power and trade in the region, resulted in the rise of new regional powers such as the Khmer Empire and Kahuripan. Continued commercial contacts with the Chinese Empire enabled the Cholas to influence the local cultures. Many of the surviving examples of the Hindu cultural influence found today throughout Southeast Asia are the result of the Chola expeditions.\nAs Srivijaya influence in the region declined, The Hindu Khmer Empire experienced a golden age during the 11th to 13th century CE. The empire's capital Angkor hosts majestic monuments\u2014such as Angkor Wat and Bayon. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor, during its peak, was the largest pre-industrial urban centre in the world. The Champa civilisation was located in what is today central Vietnam, and was a highly Indianised Hindu Kingdom. The Vietnamese launched a massive conquest against the Cham people during the 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, ransacking and burning Champa, slaughtering thousands of Cham people, and forcibly assimilating them into Vietnamese culture.\nDuring the 13th century CE, the region experienced Mongol invasions, affected areas such as Vietnamese coast, inland Burma and Java. In 1258, 1285 and 1287, the Mongols tried to invade \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and Champa. The invasions were unsuccessful, yet both Dai Viet and Champa agreed to become tributary states to Yuan dynasty to avoid further conflicts. The Mongols also invaded Pagan Kingdom in Burma from 1277 to 1287, resulted in fragmentation of the Kingdom and rise of smaller Shan States ruled by local chieftains nominally submitted to Yuan dynasty. However, in 1297, a new local power emerged. Myinsaing Kingdom became the real ruler of Central Burma and challenged the Mongol rule. This resulted in the second Mongol invasion of Burma in 1300, which was repulsed by Myinsaing. The Mongols would later in 1303 withdrawn from Burma. In 1292, The Mongols sent envoys to Singhasari Kingdom in Java to ask for submission to Mongol rule. Singhasari rejected the proposal and injured the envoys, enraged the Mongols and made them sent a large invasion fleet to Java. Unbeknownst to them, Singhasari collapsed in 1293 due to a revolt by Kadiri, one of its vassals. When the Mongols arrived in Java, a local prince named Raden Wijaya offered his service to assist the Mongols in punishing Kadiri. After Kadiri was defeated, Wijaya turned on his Mongol allies, ambushed their invasion fleet and forced them to immediately leave Java.\nAfter the departure of the Mongols, Wijaya established the Majapahit Empire in eastern Java in 1293. Majapahit would soon grow into a regional power. Its greatest ruler was Hayam Wuruk, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 marked the empire's peak when other kingdoms in the southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali came under its influence. Various sources such as the Nagarakertagama also mention that its influence spanned over parts of Sulawesi, Maluku, and some areas of western New Guinea and southern Philippines, making it one of the largest empire to ever exist in Southeast Asian history.107 By the 15th century CE however, Majapahit's influence began to wane due to many war of successions it experienced and the rise of new Islamic states such as Samudera Pasai and Malacca Sultanate around the strategic Strait of Malacca. Majapahit then collapsed around 1500. It was the last major Hindu kingdom and the last regional power in the region before the arrival of the Europeans.\nSpread of Islam.\nIslam began to make contacts with Southeast Asia in the eighth-century CE, when the Umayyads established trade with the region via sea routes. However its spread into the region happened centuries later. In the 11th century, a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia. The Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram (Kedah); the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too. Soon after that, the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith, and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in 1136. Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in 1267, the King of Malacca Parameswara married the princess of Pasai, and the son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon, Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade, and other rulers followed suit. Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka (1908\u20131981) wrote in 1961: \"The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim, Admiral Zheng He.\"\nThere are several theories to the Islamization process in Southeast Asia. Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India, and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from South Arabia (Hadhramaut) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes. Gujarati Muslims played a pivotal role in establishing Islam in Southeast Asia.\nTrade and colonization.\nTrade among Southeast Asian countries has a long tradition. The consequences of colonial rule, struggle for independence, and in some cases war influenced the economic attitudes and policies of each country.\nChinese.\nFrom 111 BC to 938 AD, northern Vietnam was under Chinese rule. Vietnam was successfully governed by a series of Chinese dynasties including the Han, Eastern Han, Eastern Wu, Cao Wei, Jin, Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang, Sui, Tang, and Southern Han.\nRecords from Magellan's voyage show that Brunei possessed more cannon than European ships, so the Chinese must have been trading with them.\nMalaysian legend has it that a Chinese Ming emperor sent a princess, Hang Li Po, to Malacca, with a retinue of 500, to marry Sultan Mansur Shah after the emperor was impressed by the wisdom of the sultan. Hang Li Poh's Well (constructed 1459) is now a tourist attraction there, as is Bukit Cina, where her retinue settled.\nThe strategic value of the Strait of Malacca, which was controlled by Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th and early 16th century, did not go unnoticed by Portuguese writer Tom\u00e9 Pires, who wrote in the \"Suma Oriental\": \"Whoever is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice.\" (Venice was a major European trading partner, and goods were transported there via the Strait.)\nEuropean.\nWestern influence started to enter in the 16th century, with the arrival of the Portuguese in Malacca, Maluku, and the Philippines, the latter being settled by the Spaniards years later, which they used to trade between Asia and Latin America. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies; the French Indochina; and the British Strait Settlements. By the 19th century, all Southeast Asian countries were colonised except for Thailand.\nEuropean explorers were reaching Southeast Asia from the west and from the east. Regular trade between the ships sailing east from the Indian Ocean and south from mainland Asia provided goods in return for natural products, such as honey and hornbill beaks from the islands of the archipelago. Before the 18th and 19th centuries, the Europeans mostly were interested in expanding trade links. For the majority of the populations in each country, there was comparatively little interaction with Europeans and traditional social routines and relationships continued. For most, a life with subsistence-level agriculture, fishing and, in less developed civilisations, hunting and gathering was still hard.\nEuropeans brought Christianity allowing Christian missionaries to become widespread. Thailand also allowed Western scientists to enter its country to develop its own education system as well as start sending royal members and Thai scholars to get higher education from Europe and Russia.\nJapanese.\nDuring World War II, Imperial Japan invaded most of the former western colonies under the concept of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\". However, the Sh\u014dwa occupation regime committed violent actions against civilians such as live human experimentation, sexual slavery under the brutal \"comfort women\" system, the Manila massacre and the implementation of a system of forced labour, such as the one involving four to ten million \"romusha\" in Indonesia. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labour during the Japanese occupation. The Allied powers who then defeated Japan (and other allies of Axis) in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II then contended with nationalists to whom the occupation authorities had granted independence.\nIndian.\nGujarat, India had a flourishing trade relationship with Southeast Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries. The trade relationship with Gujarat declined after the Portuguese invasion of Southeast Asia in the 17th century.\nAmerican.\nThe United States took the Philippines from Spain in 1898. Internal autonomy was granted in 1934, and independence in 1946.\nContemporary history.\nMost countries in the region maintain national autonomy. Democratic forms of government are practised in most Southeast Asian countries and human rights is recognised but dependent on each nation state. Socialist or communist countries in Southeast Asia include Vietnam and Laos. ASEAN provides a framework for the integration of commerce and regional responses to international concerns.\nChina has asserted broad claims over the South China Sea, based on its nine-dash line, and has built artificial islands in an attempt to bolster its claims. China also has asserted an exclusive economic zone based on the Spratly Islands. The Philippines challenged China in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2013, and in \"Philippines v. China\" (2016), the Court ruled in favour of the Philippines and rejected China's claims.\nGeography.\nIndonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia and is also the largest archipelago in the world by size (according to the CIA World Factbook). Geologically, the Indonesian Archipelago is one of the most volcanically active regions in the world. Geological uplifts in the region have also produced some impressive mountains, culminating in Puncak Jaya in Papua, Indonesia at , on the island of New Guinea; it is the only place where ice glaciers can be found in Southeast Asia. The highest mountain in Southeast Asia is Hkakabo Razi at and can be found in northern Burma sharing the same range of its parent peak, Mount Everest.\nThe South China Sea is the major body of water within Southeast Asia. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Singapore, have integral rivers that flow into the South China Sea.\nMayon Volcano, despite being dangerously active, holds the record of the world's most perfect cone which is built from past and continuous eruption.\nBoundaries.\nGeographically, Southeast Asia is bounded to the southeast by the Australian continent, the boundary between these two regions is most often considered to run through Wallacea.\nGeopolitically, the boundary lies between Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian region of Western New Guinea (Papua and West Papua). Both countries share the island of New Guinea.\nIslands to the east of the Philippines make up the region of Micronesia. These islands are not biogeographically, geologically or historically linked to mainland Asia, and are considered part of Oceania by the United Nations, \"The World Factbook\", and other organisations. The Oceania region is politically represented through the Pacific Islands Forum, a governing body which, up until 2022, included Australia, New Zealand and all independent territories in Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Several countries of Maritime Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, are dialogue partners of the Pacific Islands Forum, but none have full membership.\nMaritime Southeast Asia was often grouped with Australia and Oceania in the mid to late 1800s, rather than with mainland Asia. The term Oceania came into usage at the beginning of the 1800s, and the earlier definitions predated the advent of concepts such as Wallacea.\nThe non-continental Australian external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are sometimes considered part of Maritime Southeast Asia, as they lie in much closer proximity to western Indonesia than they do to mainland Australia. They have a multicultural mix of inhabitants with Asian and European Australian ancestry, and were uninhabited when discovered by the British during the 17th century. The islands lie within the bounds of the Australian Plate, and are defined by \"The World Factbook\" as the westernmost extent of Oceania. The United Nations also include these islands in their definition of Oceania, under the same subregion as Australia and New Zealand.\nClimate.\nMost of Southeast Asia has a tropical climate that is hot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shifts in winds or monsoons. The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rainforest is the second largest on Earth (with the Amazon rainforest being the largest). Exceptions to the typical tropical climate and forest vegetation are:\nClimate change.\nSoutheast Asia lags behind on mitigation measures, even though it is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in the world. Climate change has already caused an increase in \"heavy\" precipitation events (defined as 400\u00a0mm or more in a day) and greater increases are expected in this region. Changes in rainfall and runoff will also affect the quality of water supply used by the irrigation systems. Under a high-warming scenario, heat-related deaths in the region could increase by 12.7% by 2100. Among the elderly in Malaysia, annual heat-related deaths may go from less than 1 per 100,000 to 45 per 100,000.\nSea level rise is a serious threat. Along Philippine coasts, it occurs three times faster than the global average, while 199 out of 514 cities and districts in Indonesia could be affected by tidal flooding by 2050. Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are amongst the 20 coastal cities which would have the world's highest annual flood losses in the year 2050. Due to land subsidence, Jakarta is sinking so much (up to per year between 1982 and 2010 in some areas) that by 2019, the government had committed to relocate the capital of Indonesia to another city.\nClimate change is also likely to pose a serious threat to the region's fisheries: \n3.35 million fishers in the Southeast Asia are reliant on coral reefs, and yet those reefs are highly vulnerable to even low-emission climate change and will likely be lost if global warming exceeds By 2050\u20132070, around 30% of the region's aquaculture area and 10\u201320% of aquaculture production may be lost.\nEnvironment.\nThe vast majority of Southeast Asia falls within the warm, humid tropics, and its climate generally can be characterized as monsoonal. The animals of Southeast Asia are diverse; on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, the orangutan, the Asian elephant, the Malayan tapir, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Bornean clouded leopard can also be found. Six subspecies of the binturong or \"bearcat\" exist in the region, though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable. Tigers of three different subspecies are found on the island of Sumatra (the Sumatran tiger), in peninsular Malaysia (the Malayan tiger), and in Indochina (the Indochinese tiger); all of which are endangered species. The Komodo dragon is the largest living species of lizard and inhabits the islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang in Indonesia. The Philippine eagle is the national bird of the Philippines. It is considered by scientists as the largest eagle in the world, and is endemic to the Philippines' forests. The wild water buffalo, and on various islands related dwarf species of \"Bubalus\" such as anoa were once widespread in Southeast Asia; nowadays the domestic Asian water buffalo is common across the region, but its remaining relatives are rare and endangered. The mouse deer, a small tusked deer as large as a toy dog or cat, mostly can be found on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia), and in Palawan (Philippines). The gaur, a gigantic wild ox larger than even wild water buffalo, is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.\nBirds such as the green peafowl and drongo live in this subregion as far east as Indonesia. The babirusa, a four-tusked pig, can be found in Indonesia as well. The hornbill was prized for its beak and used in trade with China. The horn of the rhinoceros, not part of its skull, was prized in China as well.\nThe Indonesian Archipelago is split by the Wallace Line. This line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary, and separates Asian (Western) species from Australasian (Eastern) species. The islands between Java/Borneo and Papua form a mixed zone, where both types occur, known as Wallacea. As the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in Southeast Asia, concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region's environment. A significant portion of Southeast Asia, however, has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife. The nations of the region, with only a few exceptions, have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna. Indonesia, for example, has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose. Even so, such species as the Javan rhinoceros face extinction, with only a handful of the animals remaining in western Java.\nThe shallow waters of the Southeast Asian coral reefs have the highest levels of biodiversity for the world's marine ecosystems, where coral, fish, and molluscs abound. According to Conservation International, marine surveys suggest that the marine life diversity in the Raja Ampat (Indonesia) is the highest recorded on Earth. Diversity is considerably greater than any other area sampled in the Coral Triangle composed of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The Coral Triangle is the heart of the world's coral reef biodiversity, the Verde Passage is dubbed by Conservation International as the world's \"center of the center of marine shore fish biodiversity\". The whale shark, the world's largest species of fish and 6 species of sea turtles can also be found in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean territories of the Philippines.\nThe trees and other plants of the region are tropical; in some countries where the mountains are tall enough, temperate-climate vegetation can be found. These rainforest areas are currently being logged-over, especially in Borneo.\nWhile Southeast Asia is rich in flora and fauna, Southeast Asia is facing severe deforestation which causes habitat loss for various endangered species such as orangutan and the Sumatran tiger. Predictions have been made that more than 40% of the animal and plant species in Southeast Asia could be wiped out in the 21st century. At the same time, haze has been a regular occurrence. The two worst regional hazes were in 1997 and 2006 in which multiple countries were covered with thick haze, mostly caused by \"slash and burn\" activities in Sumatra and Borneo. In reaction, several countries in Southeast Asia signed the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution to combat haze pollution.\nThe 2013 Southeast Asian Haze saw API levels reach a hazardous level in some countries. Muar experienced the highest API level of 746 on 23 June 2013 at around 7 am.\nEconomy.\nEven prior to the penetration of European interests, Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First, Spaniards (Manila galleon) who sailed from the Americas and Kingdom of Portugal, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into Indonesia, the British into Malaya and parts of Borneo, the French into Indochina, and the Spanish and the US into the Philippines. An economic effect of this imperialism was the shift in the production of commodities. For example, the rubber plantations of Malaysia, Java, Vietnam, and Cambodia, the tin mining of Malaya, the rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and the Irrawaddy River delta in Burma, were a response to the powerful market demands.\nThe overseas Chinese community has played a large role in the development of the economies in the region. The origins of Chinese influence can be traced to the 16th century, when Chinese migrants from southern China settled in Indonesia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries. Chinese populations in the region saw a rapid increase following the Communist Revolution in 1949, which forced many refugees to emigrate outside of China. In 2022, Malaysian petroleum industry through its oil and gas company, Petronas, was ranked eighth in the world by the Brandirectory. Seventeen telecommunications companies contracted to build the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable to connect Southeast Asia to the US This is to avoid disruption of the kind caused by the cutting of the undersea cable from Taiwan to the US in the 2006 Hengchun earthquakes.\nTourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia. According to UNESCO, \"tourism, if correctly conceived, can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet.\" Since the early 1990s, \"even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where the income derived from tourism is low, are attempting to expand their own tourism industries.\" In 1995, Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8%. By 1998, those receipts had dropped to less than 6% of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7%. Since 2000, Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15% of its GDP from tourism in 2006. Furthermore, Vietnam is considered as a growing power in Southeast Asia due to its large foreign investment opportunities and the booming tourism sector.\nBy the early 21st century, Indonesia had grown to an emerging market economy, becoming the largest economy in the region. It was classified a newly industrialised country and is the region's singular member of the G-20 major economies. Indonesia's estimated gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 was US$1,088.8\u00a0billion (nominal) or $3,328.3\u00a0billion (PPP) with per capita GDP of US$4,038 (nominal) or $12,345 (PPP). By GDP per capita in 2023, Singapore is the leading nation in the region with US$84,500 (nominal) or US$140,280 (PPP), followed by Brunei with US$41,713 (nominal) or US$79,408 (PPP) and Malaysia with US$13,942 (nominal) or US$33,353 (PPP). Besides that, Malaysia has the lowest cost of living in the region, followed by Brunei and Vietnam. On the contrary, Singapore is the costliest country in the region, followed by Thailand and the Philippines.\nStock markets in Southeast Asia have performed better than other bourses in the Asia-Pacific region in 2010, with the Philippines' PSE leading the way with 22 per cent growth, followed by Thailand's SET with 21 per cent and Indonesia's JKSE with 19 per cent.\nSoutheast Asia's GDP per capita is US$4,685 according to a 2020 International Monetary Fund estimates, which is comparable to South Africa, Iraq, and Georgia.\nEnergy.\nTraditionally, the Southeast Asian economy has heavily relied on fossil fuels. However, it has begun transitioning towards clean energy. The region possesses significant renewable energy potential, including solar, wind, hydro, and pumped hydro energy storage. Modeling indicates that it could achieve a 97% share of solar and wind energy in the electricity mix at competitive costs ranging from $US 55 to $115 per megawatt-hour.\nThe energy transition in Southeast Asia can be characterized as demanding, doable, and dependent. This implies the presence of substantial challenges, including financial, technical, and institutional barriers. However, it is feasible, as evidenced by Vietnam's remarkable achievement of installing about 20 GW of solar and wind power in just three years. International cooperation plays a crucial role in facilitating this transition.\nDemographics.\nSoutheast Asia has an area of approximately . As of , around million people live in the region, more than a fifth live (143 million) on the Indonesian island of Java, the most densely populated large island in the world. Indonesia is the most populous country with million people (~40% of South East Asia), and also the fourth most populous country in the world. The distribution of the religions and people is diverse in Southeast Asia and varies by country. Some 30\u00a0million overseas Chinese also live in Southeast Asia, most prominently in Christmas Island, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and also as the Hoa in Vietnam. People of Southeast Asian origins are known as Southeast Asians or Aseanites.\nEthnic groups.\nThe peoples of Southeast Asia are mainly divided into four major ethnolinguistic groups: the Austronesian, Austroasiatic (or Mon-Khmers), Tai (part of the wider Kra-Dai family) and Tibeto-Burman (part of greater Sino-Tibetan language family) peoples. There is also a smaller but significant number of Hmong\u2013Mien, Chinese, Dravidians, Indo-Aryans, Eurasians and Papuans, which also contributes to the diversity of peoples in the region.\nThe Aslians and Negritos were believed to be one of the earliest inhabitants in the region. They are genetically related to Papuans in Eastern Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Aboriginal Australians. In modern times, the Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia, with more than 100 million people, mostly concentrated in Java, Indonesia. The second-largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia are the Vietnamese (Kinh people) with around 86 million people, mainly inhabiting Vietnam but also forming a significant minority in neighbouring Cambodia and Laos. The Thais are the third largest with around 59 million people, forming the majority in Thailand.\nIndonesia is politically and culturally dominated by the Javanese and Sundanese ethnic groups (both native to Java), but the country also has hundreds of ethnic groups scattered throughout the archipelago, such as the Madurese, Minangkabau, Acehnese, Bugis, Balinese, Makassarese, Dayak, Minahasan, Batak, Malay, Betawi, Torajan and Ambonese peoples.\nIn Malaysia, the country is demographically divided into Malays, who make up more than half of the country's population; the Chinese, at around 22%; other Bumiputeras, at 12%; and Indians, at around 6%. In East Malaysia, the Dayaks (mainly Ibans and Bidayuhs) make up the majority in the state of Sarawak, while the Kadazan-Dusuns make up the majority in Sabah. In Labuan, the Bruneian Malays and Kedayans are the largest groups. Overall, the Malays are the majority in Malaysia and Brunei and form a significant minority in Indonesia, Southern Thailand, Myanmar, and Singapore. In Singapore, the demographics of the country is similar to that of its West Malaysian counterparts but instead of Malays, it is the Chinese that are the majority, while the Malays are the second largest group and Indians third largest.\nWithin the Philippines, the country has no majority ethnic groups; but the four largest ethnolinguistic groups in the country are the Visayans (mainly Cebuanos, Warays and Hiligaynons), Tagalogs, Ilocanos and Bicolanos. Besides the major four, there are also the Moro peoples of Mindanao, consisting of the Tausug, Maranao, Yakan and Maguindanao. Other regional groups in the country are the Kapampangans, Pangasinans, Surigaonons, Ifugao, Kalinga, Kamayo, Cuyonon and Ivatan.\nIn mainland Southeast Asia, the Burmese accounts for more than two-thirds of the population in Myanmar, but the country also has several regional ethnic groups which mainly live in states that are specifically formed for ethnic minorities. The major regional ethnic groups in Myanmar are the Tai-speaking Shan people, Karen people, Rakhine people, Chin people, Kayah people and Indo-Aryan-speaking Rohingya people living on the westernmost part of the country near the border with Bangladesh. In neighbouring Thailand, the Thais are the largest ethnic group in the country but is divided into several regional Tai groups such as Central Thais, Northern Thais or Lanna, Southern Thais or Pak Thai, and Northeastern Thai or Isan people (which is ethnically more closely related to Lao people than to Central Thais), each have their own unique dialects, history and culture. Besides the Thais, Thailand is also home to more than 70 ethnolinguistic groups of which the largest being Patani Malays, Northern Khmers, Karen, Hmongs and Chinese.\nCambodia is one of the most homogeneous countries in the area, with Khmers forming more than 90% of the population but the country also has a large number of ethnic Chams, Vietnamese and various inland tribes categorised under the term Khmer Loeu (Hill Khmers).\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCountries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions and the region is home to many world religions including Abrahamic, Indian, East Asian and Iranian religions. By population, Islam is the most practised faith with approximately 240 million adherents, or about 40% of the entire population, concentrated in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Southern Thailand and in the Southern Philippines. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world. Meanwhile, Islam is constitutionally the official religion in Malaysia and Brunei. The \nmajority of the Muslim population is Sunni, with very minority Shia population. A minority are Sufi or Ahmadiyya Muslims.\nThere are approximately 190\u2013205 million Buddhists in Southeast Asia, making it the second-largest religion in the region. Approximately 28 to 35% of the world's Buddhists reside in Southeast Asia. Buddhism is predominant in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Singapore, and adherents may come from Theravada or Mahayana schools. Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore. Taoism and Chinese folk religions such as Mazuism are also widely practised by the overseas Chinese community in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. In certain cases, they may include Chinese or local deities in their worshipping practises such as Tua Pek Kong, Datuk Keramat and many more.\nChristianity is predominant in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia, and Timor-Leste. The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia. Timor-Leste is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Indonesian and Portuguese rule. In October 2019, the number of Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, in Southeast Asia reached 156 million, of which 97 million came from the Philippines, 29 million from Indonesia, 11 million from Vietnam, and the rest from Malaysia, Myanmar, Timor-Leste, Singapore, Laos, Cambodia and Brunei. In addition, Eastern Orthodox Christianity can also be found in the region. In addition, Judaism is practised in certain countries such as in the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia due to the presence of Jewish diaspora. There is a small population of Parsis in Singapore who practise Zoroastrianism, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed is also practised by very small population in Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand.\nNo individual Southeast Asian country is religiously homogeneous. Some groups are protected \"de facto\" by their isolation from the rest of the world. In the world's most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, Hinduism is dominant on islands such as Bali. Christianity also predominates in the rest of the part of the Philippines, New Guinea, Flores and Timor. Pockets of Hindu population can also be found around Southeast Asia in Singapore, Malaysia, etc. Garuda, the phoenix who is the mount (\"vahanam\") of Vishnu, is a national symbol in both Thailand and Indonesia; in the Philippines, gold images of Garuda have been found on Palawan; gold images of other Hindu gods and goddesses have also been found on Mindanao. Balinese Hinduism is somewhat different from Hinduism practised elsewhere, as animism and local culture is incorporated into it. Meanwhile, Hindu community in Malaysia and Singapore are mostly South Indian diaspora, hence the practices are closely related to the Indian Hinduism. Additionally, Sikhism is also practised by significant population especially in Malaysia and Singapore by North Indian diaspora specifically from Punjab region. Small population of the Indian diaspora in the region are Jains and can be found in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. Christians can also be found throughout Southeast Asia; they are in the majority in Timor-Leste and the Philippines, Asia's largest Christian nation. In addition, there are also older tribal religious practices in remote areas of Sarawak in East Malaysia, Highland Philippines, and Papua in eastern Indonesia. In Burma, Sakka (Indra) is revered as a \"Nat\". In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhism is practised, which is influenced by native animism but with a strong emphasis on ancestor worship. Vietnamese folk religions are practised by majority of population in Vietnam. Caodaism, a monotheistic syncretic new religious movement, is also practised by less than one percent of the population in Vietnam. Due to the presence of Japanese diaspora in the region, the practice of Shinto has growingly made appearance in certain countries such as in Thailand.\nThe religious composition for each country is as follows: Some values are taken from the \"CIA World Factbook\":\nLanguages.\nEach of the languages has been influenced by cultural pressures due to trade, immigration, and historical colonisation as well. There are nearly 800 native languages in the region.\nThe language composition for each country is as follows (with official languages in bold):\nCulture.\nThe culture in Southeast Asia is diverse: on mainland Southeast Asia, the culture is a mix of Burmese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai (Indian) and Vietnamese (Chinese) cultures. While in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia the culture is a mix of indigenous Austronesian, Indian, Islamic, Western, and Chinese cultures. In addition, Brunei shows a strong influence from Arabia. Vietnam and Singapore show more Chinese influence in that Singapore, although being geographically a Southeast Asian nation, is home to a large Chinese majority and Vietnam was in China's sphere of influence for much of its history. Indian influence in Singapore is most prominently evident through the Tamil migrants, which influenced, to some extent, the cuisine of Singapore. Throughout Vietnam's history, it has had no direct influence from India \u2013 only through contact with the Thai, Khmer and Cham peoples. Moreover, Vietnam is also categorised under the East Asian cultural sphere along with China, Korea, and Japan due to a large amount of Chinese influence embedded in their culture and lifestyle.\nRice paddy agriculture has existed in Southeast Asia for millennia, ranging across the subregion. Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the Banaue Rice Terraces in the mountains of Luzon in the Philippines. Maintenance of these paddies is very labour-intensive. The rice paddies are well-suited to the monsoon climate of the region.\nStilt houses can be found all over Southeast Asia, from Thailand and Vietnam to Borneo, to Luzon in the Philippines, to Papua New Guinea. The region has diverse metalworking, especially in Indonesia. This includes weaponry, such as the distinctive kris, and musical instruments, such as the gamelan.\nInfluences.\nThe region's chief cultural influences have been from some combination of Islam, India, and China. Diverse cultural influence is pronounced in the Philippines, derived particularly from the period of Spanish and American rule, contact with Indian-influenced cultures, and the Chinese and Japanese trading era.\nAs a rule of thumb, the peoples who ate with their fingers were more likely influenced by the culture of India, for example, than the culture of China, where the peoples ate with chopsticks; tea, as a beverage, can be found across the region. The fish sauces distinctive to the region tend to vary.\nArts.\nThe arts of Southeast Asia have an affinity with the arts of other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands as well as the feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early seventh century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. The Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.\nPuppetry and shadow plays were also a favoured form of entertainment in past centuries, a famous one being the \"wayang\" from Indonesia. The arts and literature in some of Southeast Asia are quite influenced by Hinduism, which was brought to them centuries ago. Indonesia, despite large-scale conversion to Islam which opposes certain forms of art, has retained many forms of Hindu-influenced practices, culture, art, and literature. An example is the (shadow puppet) and literature like the \"Ramayana\". The show has been recognised by UNESCO on 7 November 2003 as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\nIt has been pointed out that Khmer and Indonesian classical arts were concerned with depicting the life of the gods, but to the Southeast Asian mind, the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselves\u2014joyous, earthy, yet divine. The Tai, coming late into Southeast Asia, brought with them some Chinese artistic traditions, but they soon shed them in favour of the Khmer and Mon traditions, and the only indications of their earlier contact with Chinese arts were in the style of their temples, especially the tapering roof, and in their lacquerware.\nMusic.\nTraditional music in Southeast Asia is as varied as its many ethnic and cultural divisions. The main styles of traditional music include court music, folk music, music styles of smaller ethnic groups, and music influenced by genres outside the geographic region.\nOf the court and folk genres, gong chime ensembles and orchestras make up the majority (the exception being lowland areas of Vietnam). \"Gamelan\" and \"angklung\" orchestras from \"Indonesia\"; \"piphat\" and \"pinpeat\" ensembles of Thailand and Cambodia; and the \"kulintang\" ensembles of the southern Philippines, Borneo, Sulawesi and Timor are the three main distinct styles of musical genres that have influenced other traditional musical styles in the region. String instruments are also popular in the region.\nOn 18 November 2010, UNESCO officially recognised the \"angklung\" as a \"Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\", and encouraged the Indonesian people and government to safeguard, transmit, promote performances and to encourage the craftsmanship of \"angklung\" making.\nWriting.\nThe history of Southeast Asia has led to a wealth of different authors, from both within and without writing about the region.\nSome of the earliest writing systems of Southeast Asia stem from those of India. This is shown through Brahmic forms of writing present in the region, such as the Balinese script shown on split palm leaves called \"lontar\" (see image to the left \u2013 magnify the image to see the writing on the flat side, and the decoration on the reverse side).\nThe antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in China. Note each palm leaf section was only several lines, written longitudinally across the leaf, and bound by twine to the other sections. The outer portion was decorated. The alphabets of Southeast Asia tended to be abugidas, until the arrival of the Europeans, who used words that also ended in consonants, not just vowels. Other forms of official documents, which did not use paper, included Javanese copperplate scrolls. This material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia.\nIn Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, the Malay language is now generally written in the Latin script. The same phenomenon is present in Indonesian, although different spelling standards are utilised (e.g. 'Teksi' in Malay and 'Taksi' in Indonesian for the word 'Taxi').\nThe use of Chinese characters, in the past and present, is only evident in Vietnam and more recently, Singapore and Malaysia. The adoption of ch\u1eef H\u00e1n in Vietnam dates back to around 111 BC when it was occupied by the Chinese. A Vietnamese script called ch\u1eef N\u00f4m used modified ch\u1eef H\u00e1n to express the Vietnamese language. Both ch\u1eef H\u00e1n and ch\u1eef N\u00f4m were used up until the early 20th century.\nRapa Nui is an Austronesian language like those of Indonesian, Tagalog, and many other Southeast Asian languages. Rongorongo is presumed to be the script of Rapa Nui and if proven so, would place it as one of very few inventions of writing in human history.\nSports.\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in the region, with the ASEAN Football Federation, the region's primary regulatory body, formed on 31 January 1984, in Jakarta, Indonesia. The AFF Championship is the largest football competition in the region since its inaugural in 1996, with Thailand holding the most titles in the competition with seven titles. The current reigning winner is Vietnam, who defeated Thailand in the 2024 final. Thailand has had the most numerous appearances in the AFC Asian Cup with 7 while the highest-ranked result in the Asian Cup for a Southeast Asian team is second place in the 1968 by Myanmar in Iran. Indonesia is the only Southeast Asian team to have played in the 1938 FIFA World Cup as the Dutch East Indies.\nASEAN has also committed to preserving traditional sports and games (TSG) in the region.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28742", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28742", "title": "Supercontinent", "text": "Landmass comprising more than one continental core, or craton\nIn geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, some geologists use a different definition, \"a grouping of formerly dispersed continents\", which leaves room for interpretation and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. To separate supercontinents from other groupings, a limit has been proposed in which a continent must include at least about 75% of the continental crust then in existence in order to qualify as a supercontinent.\nMoving under the forces of plate tectonics, supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past. According to modern definitions, a supercontinent does not exist today; the closest is the current Afro-Eurasian landmass, which covers approximately 57% of Earth's total land area. The last period in which the continental landmasses were near to one another was 336 to 175 million years ago, forming the supercontinent Pangaea. The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic, shortly before the breakup of Pangaea. Pangaea's predecessor Gondwana is not considered a supercontinent under the first definition since the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia were separate at the time.\nA future supercontinent, termed Pangaea Proxima, is hypothesized to form within the next 250 million years.\nTheories.\nThe Phanerozoic supercontinent Pangaea began to break up 215 Ma and this distancing continues today. Because Pangaea is the most recent of Earth's supercontinents, it is the best known and understood. Contributing to Pangaea's popularity in the classroom, its reconstruction is almost as simple as fitting together the present continents bordering the Atlantic ocean like puzzle pieces.\nFor the period before Pangaea, there are two contrasting models for supercontinent evolution through geological time. \nSeries.\nThe first model theorizes that at least two separate supercontinents existed comprising Vaalbara and Kenorland, with Kenorland comprising Superia and Sclavia. These parts of Neoarchean age broke off at ~2480 and 2312 Ma, and portions of them later collided to form Nuna (Northern Europe and North America). Nuna continued to develop during the Mesoproterozoic, primarily by lateral accretion of juvenile arcs, and in ~1000 Ma Nuna collided with other land masses, forming Rodinia. Between ~825 and 750 Ma Rodinia broke apart. However, before completely breaking up, some fragments of Rodinia had already come together to form Gondwana by ~608 Ma. Pangaea formed through the collision of Gondwana, Laurasia (Laurentia and Baltica), and Siberia.\nProtopangea\u2013Paleopangea.\nThe second model (Kenorland-Arctica) is based on both palaeomagnetic and geological evidence and proposes that the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from ~2.72 Ga until break-up during the Ediacaran period after ~0.573 Ga. The reconstruction is derived from the observation that palaeomagnetic poles converge to quasi-static positions for long intervals between ~2.72\u20132.115 Ga; 1.35\u20131.13 Ga; and 0.75\u20130.573 Ga with only small peripheral modifications to the reconstruction. During the intervening periods, the poles conform to a unified apparent polar wander path. \nAlthough it contrasts the first model, the first phase (Protopangea) essentially incorporates Vaalbara and Kenorland of the first model. The explanation for the prolonged duration of the Protopangea\u2013Paleopangea supercontinent appears to be that lid tectonics (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) prevailed during Precambrian times. According to this theory, plate tectonics as seen on the contemporary Earth became dominant only during the latter part of geological times. This approach was widely criticized by many researchers as it uses incorrect application of paleomagnetic data.\nCycles.\nA supercontinent cycle is the break-up of one supercontinent and the development of another, which takes place on a global scale. Supercontinent cycles are not the same as the Wilson cycle, which is the opening and closing of an individual oceanic basin. The Wilson cycle rarely synchronizes with the timing of a supercontinent cycle. However, supercontinent cycles and Wilson cycles were both involved in the creation of Pangaea and Rodinia.\nSecular trends such as carbonatites, granulites, eclogites, and greenstone belt deformation events are all possible indicators of Precambrian supercontinent cyclicity, although the Protopangea\u2013Paleopangea solution implies that Phanerozoic style of supercontinent cycles did not operate during these times. Also, there are instances where these secular trends have a weak, uneven, or absent imprint on the supercontinent cycle; secular methods for supercontinent reconstruction will produce results that have only one explanation, and each explanation for a trend must fit in with the rest.\nThe following table names reconstructed ancient supercontinents, using Bradley's 2011 looser definition, with an approximate timescale of millions of years ago (Ma).\nVolcanism.\nThe causes of supercontinent assembly and dispersal are thought to be driven by convection processes in Earth's mantle. Approximately 660\u00a0km into the mantle, a discontinuity occurs, affecting the surface crust through processes involving plumes and \"superplumes\" (aka large low-shear-velocity provinces). When a slab of the subducted crust is denser than the surrounding mantle, it sinks to discontinuity. Once the slabs build up, they will sink through to the lower mantle in what is known as a \"slab avalanche\". This displacement at the discontinuity will cause the lower mantle to compensate and rise elsewhere. The rising mantle can form a plume or superplume.\nBesides having compositional effects on the upper mantle by replenishing the large-ion lithophile elements, volcanism affects plate movement. The plates will be moved towards a geoidal low perhaps where the slab avalanche occurred and pushed away from the geoidal high that can be caused by the plumes or superplumes. This causes the continents to push together to form supercontinents and was evidently the process that operated to cause the early continental crust to aggregate into Protopangea. \nDispersal of supercontinents is caused by the accumulation of heat underneath the crust due to the rising of very large convection cells or plumes, and a massive heat release resulted in the final break-up of Paleopangea. Accretion occurs over geoidal lows that can be caused by avalanche slabs or the downgoing limbs of convection cells. Evidence of the accretion and dispersion of supercontinents is seen in the geological rock record.\nThe influence of known volcanic eruptions does not compare to that of flood basalts. The timing of flood basalts has corresponded with a large-scale continental break-up. However, due to a lack of data on the time required to produce flood basalts, the climatic impact is difficult to quantify. The timing of a single lava flow is also undetermined. These are important factors on how flood basalts influenced paleoclimate.\nPlate tectonics.\nGlobal palaeogeography and plate interactions as far back as Pangaea are relatively well understood today. However, the evidence becomes more sparse further back in geologic history. Marine magnetic anomalies, passive margin match-ups, geologic interpretation of orogenic belts, paleomagnetism, paleobiogeography of fossils, and distribution of climatically sensitive strata are all methods to obtain evidence for continent locality and indicators of the environment throughout time.\nPhanerozoic (541 Ma to present) and Precambrian (4.6 Ga to 541 Ma) had primarily passive margins and detrital zircons (and orogenic granites), whereas the tenure of Pangaea contained few. Matching edges of continents are where passive margins form. The edges of these continents may rift. At this point, seafloor spreading becomes the driving force. Passive margins are therefore born during the break-up of supercontinents and die during supercontinent assembly. Pangaea's supercontinent cycle is a good example of the efficiency of using the presence or lack of these entities to record the development, tenure, and break-up of supercontinents. There is a sharp decrease in passive margins between 500 and 350 Ma during the timing of Pangaea's assembly. The tenure of Pangaea is marked by a low number of passive margins during 336 to 275 Ma, and its break-up is indicated accurately by an increase in passive margins.\nOrogenic belts can form during the assembly of continents and supercontinents. The orogenic belts present on continental blocks are classified into three different categories and have implications for interpreting geologic bodies. Intercratonic orogenic belts are characteristic of ocean basin closure. Clear indicators of intracratonic activity contain ophiolites and other oceanic materials that are present in the suture zone. Intracratonic orogenic belts occur as thrust belts and do not contain any oceanic material. However, the absence of ophiolites is not strong evidence for intracratonic belts, because the oceanic material can be squeezed out and eroded away in an intracratonic environment. The third kind of orogenic belt is a confined orogenic belt which is the closure of small basins. The assembly of a supercontinent would have to show intracratonic orogenic belts. However, interpretation of orogenic belts can be difficult.\nThe collision of Gondwana and Laurasia occurred in the late Palaeozoic. By this collision, the Variscan mountain range was created, along the equator. This 6000-km-long mountain range is usually referred to in two parts: the Hercynian mountain range of the late Carboniferous makes up the eastern part, and the western part is the Appalachian Mountains, uplifted in the early Permian. (The existence of a flat elevated plateau like the Tibetan Plateau is under debate.) The locality of the Variscan range made it influential to both the northern and southern hemispheres. The elevation of the Appalachians would greatly influence global atmospheric circulation.\nClimate.\nContinents affect the climate of the planet drastically, with supercontinents having a larger, more prevalent influence. Continents modify global wind patterns, control ocean current paths, and have a higher albedo than the oceans. Winds are redirected by mountains, and albedo differences cause shifts in onshore winds. Higher elevation in continental interiors produces a cooler, drier climate, the phenomenon of continentality. This is seen today in Eurasia, and rock record shows evidence of continentality in the middle of Pangaea.\nGlacial.\nThe term glacial-epoch refers to a long episode of glaciation on Earth over millions of years. Glaciers have major implications on the climate, particularly through sea level change. Changes in the position and elevation of the continents, the paleolatitude and ocean circulation affect the glacial epochs. There is an association between the rifting and breakup of continents and supercontinents and glacial epochs. According to the model for Precambrian supercontinent series, the breakup of Kenorland and Rodinia was associated with the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic glacial epochs, respectively. \nIn contrast, the Protopangea\u2013Paleopangea theory shows that these glaciations correlated with periods of low continental velocity, and it is concluded that a fall in tectonic and corresponding volcanic activity was responsible for these intervals of global frigidity. During the accumulation of supercontinents with times of regional uplift, glacial epochs seem to be rare with little supporting evidence. However, the lack of evidence does not allow for the conclusion that glacial epochs are not associated with the collisional assembly of supercontinents. This could just represent a preservation bias.\nDuring the late Ordovician (~458.4 Ma), the particular configuration of Gondwana may have allowed for glaciation and high CO2 levels to occur at the same time. However, some geologists disagree and think that there was a temperature increase at this time. This increase may have been strongly influenced by the movement of Gondwana across the South Pole, which may have prevented lengthy snow accumulation. Although late Ordovician temperatures at the South Pole may have reached freezing, there were no ice sheets during the early Silurian (~443.8 Ma) through the late Mississippian (~330.9 Ma). Agreement can be met with the theory that continental snow can occur when the edge of a continent is near the pole. Therefore Gondwana, although located tangent to the South Pole, may have experienced glaciation along its coasts.\nPrecipitation.\nThough precipitation rates during monsoonal circulations are difficult to predict, there is evidence for a large orographic barrier within the interior of Pangaea during the late Paleozoic (~251.9 Ma). The possibility of the southwest\u2013northeast trending Appalachian-Hercynian Mountains makes the region's monsoonal circulations potentially relatable to present-day monsoonal circulations surrounding the Tibetan Plateau, which is known to positively influence the magnitude of monsoonal periods within Eurasia. It is therefore somewhat expected that lower topography in other regions of the supercontinent during the Jurassic would negatively influence precipitation variations. The breakup of supercontinents may have affected local precipitation. When any supercontinent breaks up, there will be an increase in precipitation runoff over the surface of the continental landmasses, increasing silicate weathering and the consumption of CO2.\nTemperature.\nEven though during the Archaean solar radiation was reduced by 30 percent and the Cambrian-Precambrian boundary by 6 percent, the Earth has only experienced three ice ages throughout the Precambrian. Erroneous conclusions are more likely to be made when models are limited to one climatic configuration (which is usually present-day).\nCold winters in continental interiors are due to rate ratios of radiative cooling (greater) and heat transport from continental rims. To raise winter temperatures within continental interiors, the rate of heat transport must increase to become greater than the rate of radiative cooling. Through climate models, alterations in atmospheric CO2 content and ocean heat transport are not comparatively effective.\nCO2 models suggest that values were low in the late Cenozoic and Carboniferous-Permian glaciations. Although early Paleozoic values are much larger (more than 10 percent higher than that of today). This may be due to high seafloor spreading rates after the breakup of Precambrian supercontinents and the lack of land plants as a carbon sink.\nDuring the late Permian, it is expected that seasonal Pangaean temperatures varied drastically. Subtropic summer temperatures were warmer than that of today by as much as 6\u201310 degrees, and mid-latitudes in the winter were less than \u221230 degrees Celsius. These seasonal changes within the supercontinent were influenced by the large size of Pangaea. And, just like today, coastal regions experienced much less variation.\nDuring the Jurassic, summer temperatures did not rise above zero degrees Celsius along the northern rim of Laurasia, which was the northernmost part of Pangaea (the southernmost portion of Pangaea was Gondwana). Ice-rafted dropstones sourced from Russia are indicators of this northern boundary. The Jurassic is thought to have been approximately 10 degrees Celsius warmer along 90 degrees East paleolongitude compared to the present temperature of today's central Eurasia.\nMilankovitch cycles.\nMany studies of the Milankovitch cycles during supercontinent time periods have focused on the mid-Cretaceous. Present amplitudes of Milankovitch cycles over present-day Eurasia may be mirrored in both the southern and northern hemispheres of the supercontinent Pangaea. Climate modeling shows that summer fluctuations varied 14\u201316 degrees Celsius on Pangaea, which is similar or slightly higher than summer temperatures of Eurasia during the Pleistocene. The largest-amplitude Milankovitch cycles are expected to have been at mid-to high-latitudes during the Triassic and Jurassic.\nAtmospheric gases.\nPlate tectonics and the chemical composition of the atmosphere (specifically greenhouse gases) are the two most prevailing factors present within the geologic time scale. Continental drift influences both cold and warm climatic episodes. Atmospheric circulation and climate are strongly influenced by the location and formation of continents and supercontinents. Therefore, continental drift influences mean global temperature.\nOxygen levels of the Archaean were negligible, and today they are roughly 21 percent. It is thought that the Earth's oxygen content has risen in stages: six or seven steps that are timed very closely to the development of Earth's supercontinents.\nThe process of Earth's increase in atmospheric oxygen content is theorized to have started with the continent-continent collision of huge landmasses forming supercontinents, and therefore possibly supercontinent mountain ranges (super-mountains). These super-mountains would have eroded, and the mass amounts of nutrients, including iron and phosphorus, would have washed into oceans, just as is seen happening today. The oceans would then be rich in nutrients essential to photosynthetic organisms, which would then be able to respire mass amounts of oxygen. There is an apparent direct relationship between orogeny and the atmospheric oxygen content. There is also evidence for increased sedimentation concurrent with the timing of these mass oxygenation events, meaning that the organic carbon and pyrite at these times were more likely to be buried beneath sediment and therefore unable to react with the free oxygen. This sustained the atmospheric oxygen increases.\nAt 2.65 Ga there was an increase in molybdenum isotope fractionation. It was temporary but supports the increase in atmospheric oxygen because molybdenum isotopes require free oxygen to fractionate. Between 2.45 and 2.32 Ga, the second period of oxygenation occurred, which has been called the 'great oxygenation event.' Evidence supporting this event includes red beds appearance 2.3 Ga (meaning that Fe3+ was being produced and became an important component in soils). \nThe third oxygenation stage approximately 1.8 Ga is indicated by the disappearance of iron formations. Neodymium isotopic studies suggest that iron formations are usually from continental sources, meaning that dissolved Fe and Fe2+ had to be transported during continental erosion. A rise in atmospheric oxygen prevents Fe transport, so the lack of iron formations may have been the result of an increase in oxygen. The fourth oxygenation event, roughly 0.6 Ga, is based on modeled rates of sulfur isotopes from marine carbonate-associated sulfates. An increase (near doubled concentration) of sulfur isotopes, which is suggested by these models, would require an increase in the oxygen content of the deep oceans. \nBetween 650 and 550 Ma there were three increases in ocean oxygen levels, this period is the fifth oxygenation stage. One of the reasons indicating this period to be an oxygenation event is the increase in redox-sensitive molybdenum in black shales. The sixth event occurred between 360 and 260 Ma and was identified by models suggesting shifts in the balance of 34S in sulfates and 13C in carbonates, which were strongly influenced by an increase in atmospheric oxygen.\nProxies.\nGranites and detrital zircons have notably similar and episodic appearances in the rock record. Their fluctuations correlate with Precambrian supercontinent cycles. The U\u2013Pb zircon dates from orogenic granites are among the most reliable aging determinants. \nSome issues exist with relying on granite sourced zircons, such as a lack of evenly globally sourced data and the loss of granite zircons by sedimentary coverage or plutonic consumption. Where granite zircons are less adequate, detrital zircons from sandstones appear and make up for the gaps. These detrital zircons are taken from the sands of major modern rivers and their drainage basins. Oceanic magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic data are the primary resources used for reconstructing continent and supercontinent locations back to roughly 150 Ma.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the simplest analog computers.\nSlide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear, circular or cylindrical form. Slide rules manufactured for specialized fields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid in specialized calculations particular to those fields. The slide rule is closely related to nomograms used for application-specific computations. Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines. Maximum accuracy for standard linear slide rules is about three decimal significant digits, while scientific notation is used to keep track of the order of magnitude of results.\nEnglish mathematician and clergyman Reverend William Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on logarithms by John Napier. It made calculations faster and less error-prone than evaluating on paper. Before the advent of the scientific pocket calculator, it was the most commonly used calculation tool in science and engineering. The slide rule's ease of use, ready availability, and low cost caused its use to continue to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even with the introduction of mainframe digital electronic computers. But after the handheld HP-35 scientific calculator was introduced in 1972 and became inexpensive in the mid-1970s, slide rules became largely obsolete and no longer were in use by the advent of personal desktop computers in the 1980s.\nIn the United States, the slide rule is colloquially called a slipstick.\nBasic concepts.\nEach ruler's scale has graduations labeled with precomputed outputs of various mathematical functions, acting as a lookup table that maps from position on the ruler as each function's input. Calculations that can be reduced to simple addition or subtraction using those precomputed functions can be solved by aligning the two rulers and reading the approximate result.\nFor example, a number to be multiplied on one logarithmic-scale ruler can be aligned with the start of another such ruler to sum their logarithms. Then by applying the law of the logarithm of a product, the product of the two numbers can be read. More elaborate slide rules can perform other calculations, such as square roots, exponentials, and trigonometric functions.\nThe user may estimate the location of the decimal point in the result by mentally interpolating between labeled graduations. Scientific notation is used to track the decimal point for more precise calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.\nComponents.\nMost slide rules consist of three parts:\nSome slide rules (\"duplex\" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip (which can usually be pulled out, flipped over and reinserted for convenience), still others on one side only (\"simplex\" rules). A sliding with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.\nDecades.\nScales may be grouped in decades, where each decade corresponds to a range of numbers that spans a ratio of 10 (i.e. a range from 10\"n\" to 10\"n\"+1). For example, the range 1 to 10 is a single decade, and the range from 10 to 100 is another decade. Thus, single-decade scales (named C and D) range from 1 to 10 across the entire length of the slide rule, while double-decade scales (named A and B) range from 1 to 100 over the length of the slide rule.\nOperation.\nLogarithmic scales.\nThe following logarithmic identities transform the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction, respectively:\nformula_1formula_2\nMultiplication.\nWith two logarithmic scales, the act of positioning the top scale to start at the bottom scale's label for formula_3 corresponds to shifting the top logarithmic scale by a distance of formula_4. This aligns each top scale's number formula_5 at offset formula_6 with the bottom scale's number at position formula_7. Because formula_8, the mark on the bottom scale at that position corresponds to formula_9. With x=2 and y=3 for example, by positioning the top scale to start at the bottom scale's 2, the result of the multiplication 3\u00d72=6 can then be read on the bottom scale under the top scale's 3:\nWhile the above example lies within one decade, users must mentally account for additional zeroes when dealing with multiple decades. For example, the answer to 7\u00d72=14 is found by first positioning the top scale to start above the 2 of the bottom scale, and then reading the marking 1.4 off the bottom two-decade scale where 7 is on the top scale:\nBut since the 7 is above the \"second\" set of numbers that number \"must\" be multiplied by 10. Thus, even though the answer directly reads 1.4, the correct answer is 1.4\u00d710 = 14.\nFor an example with even larger numbers, to multiply 88\u00d720, the top scale is again positioned to start at the 2 on the bottom scale. Since 2 represents 20, all numbers in that scale are multiplied by 10. Thus, any answer in the \"second\" set of numbers is multiplied by 100. Since 8.8 in the top scale represents 88, the answer must additionally be multiplied by 10. The answer directly reads 1.76. Multiply by 100 and then by 10 to get the actual answer: 1,760.\nIn general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top. This works because the distances from the 1 mark are proportional to the logarithms of the marked values.\nDivision.\nThe illustration below demonstrates the computation of . The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The resulting quotient, 2.75, can then be read below the top scale's 1:\nThere is more than one method for doing division, and the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.\nWith more complex calculations involving multiple factors in the numerator and denominator of an expression, movement of the scales can be minimized by alternating divisions and multiplications. Thus would be computed as \u00d73 and the result, 8.25, can be read beneath the 3 in the top scale in the figure above, without the need to register the intermediate result for .\nSolving proportions.\nBecause pairs of numbers that are aligned on the logarithmic scales form constant ratios, no matter how the scales are offset, slide rules can be used to generate equivalent fractions that solve proportion and percent problems.\nFor example, setting 7.5 on one scale over 10 on the other scale, the user can see that at the same time 1.5 is over 2, 2.25 is over 3, 3 is over 4, 3.75 is over 5, 4.5 is over 6, and 6 is over 8, among other pairs. For a real-life situation where 750 represents a whole 100%, these readings could be interpreted to suggest that 150 is 20%, 225 is 30%, 300 is 40%, 375 is 50%, 450 is 60%, and 600 is 80%.\nOther scales.\nIn addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular are trigonometric, usually sine and tangent, common logarithm (log10) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), natural logarithm (ln) and exponential (\"ex\") scales. Others feature scales for calculating hyperbolic functions. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order.\nRoots and powers.\nThere are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute formula_10, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.\nFor formula_11 problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with \"x\" on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find \"y\" on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with \"x\" on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If \"y\" is \"off the scale\", locate formula_12 and square it using the A and B scales as described above. Alternatively, use the rightmost 1 on the C scale, and read the answer off the next higher LL scale. For example, aligning the rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, 3 on the C scale lines up with 8 on the LL3 scale.\nTo extract a cube root using a slide rule with only C/D and A/B scales, align 1 on the B cursor with the base number on the A scale (taking care as always to distinguish between the lower and upper halves of the A scale). Slide the slide until the number on the D scale which is against 1 on the C cursor is the same as the number on the B cursor which is against the base number on the A scale. (Examples: A 8, B 2, C 1, D 2; A 27, B 3, C 1, D 3.)\nRoots of quadratic equations.\nQuadratic equations of the form formula_13 can be solved by first reducing the equation to the form formula_14 (where formula_15 and formula_16), and then aligning the index (\"1\") of the C scale to the value formula_17 on the D scale. The cursor is then moved along the rule until a position is found where the numbers on the CI and D scales add up to formula_18. These two values are the roots of the equation.\nFuture value of money.\nThe LLN scales can be used to compute and compare the cost or return on a fixed rate loan or investment.\nThe simplest case is for continuously compounded interest. Example: Taking D as the interest rate in percent,\nslide the index (the \"1\" at the right or left end of the scale) of C to the percent on D. The corresponding value on LL2 directly below the index will be the multiplier for 10 cycles of interest (typically years). The value on LL2 below 2 on the C scale will be the multiplier after 20 cycles, and so on.\nTrigonometry.\nThe S, T, and ST scales are used for trig functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees.\nFor angles from around 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by comparing the S scale with C (or D) scale. (On many closed-body rules the S scale relates to the A and B scales instead and covers angles from around 0.57 up to 90 degrees; what follows must be adjusted appropriately.) The S scale has a second set of angles (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as formula_19 can be read directly from \"x\" on the S scale to the result on the D scale, when the C scale index is set at\u00a0\"k\". For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/radian. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.\nMany slide rules have S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes (e.g. some Keuffel and Esser models (Doric duplex 5\" models, for example), late-model Teledyne-Post Mannheim-type rules). So-called \"decitrig\" models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.\nLogarithms and exponentials.\nBase-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e. Logarithms to any other base can be calculated by reversing the procedure for calculating powers of a number. For example, log2 values can be determined by lining up either leftmost or rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, finding the number whose logarithm is to be calculated on the corresponding LL scale, and reading the log2 value on the C scale.\nAddition and subtraction.\nAddition and subtraction aren't typically performed on slide rules, but is possible using either of the following two techniques:\nGeneralizations.\nUsing (almost) any strictly monotonic scales, other calculations can also be made with one movement. For example, quadratic scales can be used to solve formula_21, used for instance by the Pythagorean theorem. Reciprocal scales can be used for the equality:formula_22which is useful for calculating parallel resistances, optical power, harmonic mean, etc.\nPhysical design.\nStandard linear rules.\nThe width of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal width of the scales. Scales on the most common \"10-inch\" models are actually 25\u00a0cm, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflows. Pocket rules are typically 5\u00a0inches (12\u00a0cm). Models a couple of metres (yards) wide were made to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes.\nTypically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures, and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch model.\nVarious other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called \"Darmstadt\" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often \"split\" to get higher accuracy. For example, instead of reading from an A scale to a D scale to find a square root, it may be possible to read from a D scale to an R1 scale running from 1 to square root of 10 or to an R2 scale running from square root of 10 to 10, where having more subdivisions marked can result in being able to read an answer with one more significant digit.\nCircular slide rules.\nCircular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors, and another with a free dish and one cursor. The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by holding a constant angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The onefold cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.\nThe basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by \u03c0). For example, a circular would have a maximum precision approximately equal to a ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate \"off-scale\" calculations, because the scales were designed to \"wrap around\"; they never have to be reoriented when results are near 1.0\u2014the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale width is narrowed to make room for end margins.\nCircular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute off-centre of the pivot can result in a worst case alignment error. The pivot does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than \"split\" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale. Around 1970, an inexpensive model from B. C. Boykin (Model 510) featured 20 scales, including 50-inch C-D (multiplication) and log scales. The RotaRule featured a friction brake for the cursor.\nThe main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.\nOne slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the E6-B. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called \"prayer wheel\" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6-B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.\nProportion wheels are simple circular slide rules used in graphic design to calculate aspect ratios. Lining up the original and desired size values on the inner and outer wheels will display their ratio as a percentage in a small window. Though not as common since the advent of computerized layout, they \nIn 1952, Swiss watch company Breitling introduced a pilot's wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a \"navigation computer\", featured airspeed, rate/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer\u2014nautical mile and gallon\u2014liter fuel amount conversion functions.\nCylindrical slide rules.\nCylindrical slide rules are made in two styles: those with helical scales such as the Fuller calculator, the Otis King and the Bygrave slide rule, and those with bars, such as the Thacher and some Loga models. In either case, the advantage is a much longer scale, and hence potentially greater precision, than afforded by a straight or circular rule.\nMaterials.\nTraditionally slide rules were made out of a relatively dense, stable hardwood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. Aluminum was used, and at least one high precision instrument was made of steel.\nIn 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from celluloid-clad bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933, and probably only a little earlier in Germany.\nScales were also made of celluloid or other polymers, or printed on aluminium. Later cursors were molded from acrylics or polycarbonate, sometimes with Teflon bearing surfaces.\nAll premium slide rules had numbers and scales deeply engraved, and then filled with paint or other resin. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior, because the markings could wear off or be chemically damaged. Nevertheless, Pickett &amp; Eckel, an American slide rule company, made only printed scale rules. Premium slide rules included clever mechanical catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops.\nHistory.\nThe slide rule was invented around 1620\u20131630, shortly after John Napier's publication of the concept of the logarithm. In 1620 Edmund Gunter of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. In c. 1622, William Oughtred of Cambridge combined two handheld Gunter rules to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Oughtred became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student Richard Delamain and the prior claims of Edmund Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\nIn 1677, Henry Coggeshall created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the Coggeshall slide rule, expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\nIn 1815, Peter Mark Roget invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\nIn 1821, Nathaniel Bowditch, described in the \"American Practical Navigator\" a \"sliding rule\" that contained scaled trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.\nIn 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a nautical slide rule capable of answering navigation questions, including right ascension and declination of the sun and principal stars.\nModern form.\nA more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Mannheim, who was fortunate both in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation, and its adoption by the French Artillery. Mannheim's rule had two major modifications that made it easier to use than previous general-purpose slide rules. Such rules had four basic scales, A, B, C, and D, and D was the only single-decade logarithmic scale; C had two decades, like A and B. Most operations were done on the A and B scales; D was only used for finding squares and square roots.\nMannheim changed the C scale to a single-decade scale and performed most operations with C and D instead of A and B. Because the C and D scales were single-decade, they could be read more precisely, so the rule's results could be more accurate. The change also made it easier to include squares and square roots as part of a larger calculation. Mannheim's rule also had a cursor, unlike almost all preceding rules, so any of the scales could be easily and accurately compared across the rule width. The \"Mannheim rule\" became the standard slide rule arrangement for the later 19th century and remained a common standard throughout the slide-rule era.\nThe growth of the engineering profession during the later 19th century drove widespread slide-rule use, beginning in Europe and eventually taking hold in the United States as well. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891 and was produced by Keuffel and Esser Co. of New York.\nIn 1881, the American inventor Edwin Thacher introduced his cylindrical rule, which had a much longer scale than standard linear rules and thus could calculate to higher precision, about four to five significant digits. However, the Thacher rule was quite expensive, as well as being non-portable, so it was used in far more limited numbers than conventional slide rules.\nAstronomical work also required precise computations, and, in 19th-century Germany, a steel slide rule about two meters long was used at one observatory. It had a microscope attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.\n20th century.\nIn the 1920s, the novelist and engineer Nevil Shute Norway (he called his autobiography ) was \"Chief Calculator\" on the design of the British R100 airship for Vickers Ltd. from 1924. The stress calculations for each transverse frame required computations by a pair of \"calculators\" (people) using Fuller's cylindrical slide rules for two or three months. The simultaneous equation contained up to seven unknown quantities, took about a week to solve, and had to be repeated with a different selection of slack wires if the guess on which of the eight radial wires were slack was wrong and one of the wires guessed to be slack was not slack. After months of labour filling perhaps fifty foolscap sheets with calculations \"the truth stood revealed (and) produced a satisfaction almost amounting to a religious experience\".\nIn 1937, physicist Lucy Hayner designed and constructed a circular slide rule in Braille.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer's profession in the same way the stethoscope is that of the medical profession.\nAluminium Pickett-brand slide rules were carried on Project Apollo space missions. The model N600-ES owned by Buzz Aldrin that flew with him to the Moon on Apollo\u00a011 was sold at auction in 2007. The model N600-ES taken along on Apollo\u00a013 in 1970 is owned by the National Air and Space Museum.\nSome engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, a common sight on campuses even into the mid-1970s. Until the advent of the pocket digital calculator, students also might keep a ten- or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.\nIn 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on \"prosthaphaeresis\", an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. However, there has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype.\nSpecialized calculators.\nSlide rules have often been specialized to varying degrees for their field of use, such as excise, proof calculation, engineering, navigation, etc., and some slide rules are extremely specialized for very narrow applications. For example, the John Rabone &amp; Sons 1892 catalog lists a \"Measuring Tape and Cattle Gauge\", a device to estimate the weight of a cow from its measurements.\nThere were many specialized slide rules for photographic applications. For example, the actinograph of Hurter and Driffield was a two-slide boxwood, brass, and cardboard device for estimating exposure from time of day, time of year, and latitude.\nSpecialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the Fisher Controls company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.\nPilot balloon slide rules were used by meteorologists in weather services to determine the upper wind velocities from an ascending hydrogen or helium-filled pilot balloon.\nThe E6-B is a circular slide rule used by pilots and navigators.\nCircular slide rules to estimate ovulation dates and fertility are known as \"wheel calculators\".\nA Department of Defense publication from 1962 infamously included a special-purpose circular slide rule for calculating blast effects, overpressure, and radiation exposure from a given yield of an atomic bomb.\nDecline.\nThe importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers, a new but rare resource in the 1950s, became more widely available to technical workers during the 1960s.\nThe first step away from slide rules was the introduction of relatively inexpensive electronic desktop scientific calculators. These included the Wang Laboratories LOCI-2, introduced in 1965, which used logarithms for multiplication and division; and the Hewlett-Packard HP 9100A, introduced in 1968. Both of these were programmable and provided exponential and logarithmic functions; the HP had trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) and hyperbolic trigonometric functions as well. The HP used the CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm, which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.\nAs with mainframe computing, the availability of these desktop machines did not significantly affect the ubiquitous use of the slide rule, until cheap hand-held scientific electronic calculators became available in the mid-1970s, at which point it rapidly declined. The pocket-sized Hewlett-Packard HP-35 scientific calculator was the first handheld device of its type, but it cost US$395 in 1972. This was justifiable for some engineering professionals, but too expensive for most students.\nAround 1974, lower-cost handheld electronic scientific calculators started to make slide rules largely obsolete. By 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for less than $50, and by 1976 the TI-30 scientific calculator was sold for less than $25 ($ adjusted for inflation).\n1980 was the final year of the University Interscholastic League (UIL) competition in Texas to use slide rules. The UIL had been originally been organized in 1910 to administer literary events, but had become the governing body of school sports events as well.\nComparison to electronic digital calculators.\nEven during their heyday, slide rules never caught on with the general public. Addition and subtraction are not well-supported operations on slide rules and doing a calculation on a slide rule tends to be slower than on a calculator. This led engineers to use mathematical equations that favored operations that were easy on a slide rule over more accurate but complex functions; these approximations could lead to inaccuracies and mistakes. On the other hand, the spatial, manual operation of slide rules cultivates in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale that people who have used only digital calculators often lack. A slide rule will also display all the terms of a calculation along with the result, thus eliminating uncertainty about what calculation was actually performed. It has thus been compared with reverse Polish notation (RPN) implemented in electronic calculators.\nA slide rule requires the user to separately compute the order of magnitude of the answer to position the decimal point in the results. For example, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 30 (which equals 45) will show the same result as \u00a0\u00d7 0.03 (which equals ). This separate calculation forces the user to keep track of magnitude in short-term memory (which is error-prone), keep notes (which is cumbersome) or reason about it in every step (which distracts from the other calculation requirements).\nThe typical arithmetic precision of a slide rule is about three significant digits, compared to many digits on digital calculators. As order of magnitude gets the greatest prominence when using a slide rule, users are less likely to make errors of false precision.\nWhen performing a sequence of multiplications or divisions by the same number, the answer can often be determined by merely glancing at the slide rule without any manipulation. This can be especially useful when calculating percentages (e.g. for test scores) or when comparing prices (e.g. in dollars per kilogram). Multiple speed-time-distance calculations can be performed hands-free at a glance with a slide rule. Other useful linear conversions such as pounds to kilograms can be easily marked on the rule and used directly in calculations.\nBeing entirely mechanical, a slide rule does not depend on grid electricity or batteries. Mechanical imprecision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors.\nMany sailors keep slide rules as backups for navigation in case of electric failure or battery depletion on long route segments. Slide rules are still commonly used in aviation, particularly for smaller planes. They are being replaced only by integrated, special purpose and expensive flight computers, and not general-purpose calculators. The E6-B circular slide rule used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available in a variety of models. Some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature slide rule scales to permit quick calculations. The Citizen Skyhawk AT and the Seiko Flightmaster SNA411 are two notable examples.\nContemporary use.\nEven in the 21st century, some people prefer a slide rule over an electronic calculator as a practical computing device. Others keep their old slide rules out of a sense of nostalgia, or collect them as a hobby.\nA popular collectible model is the Keuffel &amp; Esser \"Deci-Lon\", a premium scientific and engineering slide rule available both in a ten-inch (25\u00a0cm) \"regular\" (\"Deci-Lon 10\") and a five-inch \"pocket\" (\"Deci-Lon 5\") variant. Another prized American model is the eight-inch (20\u00a0cm) Scientific Instruments circular rule. Of European rules, Faber-Castell's high-end models are the most popular among collectors.\nAlthough a great many slide rules are circulating on the market, specimens in good condition tend to be expensive. Many rules found for sale on are damaged or have missing parts, and the seller may not know enough to supply the relevant information. Replacement parts are scarce, expensive, and generally available only for separate purchase on individual collectors' web sites. The Keuffel and Esser rules from the period up to about 1950 are particularly problematic, because the end-pieces on the cursors, made of celluloid, tend to chemically break down over time. Methods of preserving plastic may be used to slow the deterioration of some older slide rules, and 3D printing may be used to recreate missing or irretrievably broken cursor parts.\nThere are still a handful of sources for brand new slide rules. The Concise Company of Tokyo, which began as a manufacturer of circular slide rules in July 1954, continues to make and sell them today. In September 2009, on-line retailer ThinkGeek introduced its own brand of straight slide rules, described as \"faithful replica[s]\" that were \"individually hand tooled\". These were no longer available in 2012. In addition, Faber-Castell had a number of slide rules in inventory, available for international purchase through their web store, until mid 2018. Proportion wheels are still used in graphic design.\nVarious slide rule simulator apps are available for Android and iOS-based smart phones and tablets.\nSpecialized slide rules such as the E6-B used in aviation, and gunnery slide rules used in laying artillery are still used though no longer on a routine basis. These rules are used as part of the teaching and instruction process as in learning to use them the student also learns about the principles behind the calculations, it also allows the student to be able to use these instruments as a backup in the event that the modern electronics in general use fail.\nCollections.\nThe MIT Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has a collection of hundreds of slide rules, nomograms, and mechanical calculators. The Keuffel and Esser Company collection, from the slide rule manufacturer formerly located in Hoboken, New Jersey, was donated to MIT around 2005, substantially expanding existing holdings. Selected items from the collection are usually on display at the museum.\nThe International Slide Rule Museum is claimed to be \"[the world's] most extensive resource for all things concerning slide rules and logarithmic calculators\".

Her parents were the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and she was the wife of the Titan Pallas and the mother of Zelus, Nike, Kratos, and Bia. She sided with Zeus in his war against the Titans, and because of this, to honor her, Zeus decreed that the solemn oaths of the gods be sworn by the water of Styx.\nFamily.\nAccording to the usual account, Styx was the eldest of the Oceanids, the many daughters of the Titan Oceanus, the great world-encircling river, and his sister-wife, the Titaness Tethys. However, according to the Roman mythographer Hyginus, she was the daughter of Nox (\"Night\", the Roman equivalent of Nyx) and Erebus (Darkness).\nShe married the Titan Pallas and by him gave birth to the personifications Zelus (Glory, Emulation), Nike (Victory), Kratos (Strength, Dominion), and Bia (Force, Violence). The geographer Pausanias tells us that, according to Epimenides of Crete, Styx was the mother of the monster Echidna, by an otherwise unknown Perias.\nAlthough usually Demeter was the mother, by Zeus, of the underworld-goddess Persephone, according to the mythographer Apollodorus, it was Styx. However, when Apollodorus relates the famous story of the abduction of Persephone, and the search for her by her angry and distraught mother, as usual, it is Demeter who conducts the search.\nMythology.\nOath of the gods.\nStyx was the oath of the gods. Homer calls Styx the \"dread river of oath\". In both the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", it is said that swearing by the water of Styx is \"the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods\". Homer has Hera (in the \"Iliad\") say this when she swears by Styx to Zeus, that she is not to blame for Poseidon's intervention on the side of the Greeks in the Trojan War, and he has Calypso (in the \"Odyssey\") use the same words when she swears by Styx to Odysseus that she will cease to plot against him. Also Hypnos (in the \"Iliad\") makes Hera swear to him \"by the inviolable water of Styx\".\nExamples of oaths sworn by Styx also occur in the \"Homeric Hymns\". Demeter asks the \"implacable\" water of Styx to be her witness, as she swears to Metaneira, Leto swears to the personified Delos by the water of Styx, calling it the \"most powerful and dreadful oath that the blessed gods can swear\", while Apollo asks Hermes to swear to him on the \"dread\" water of Styx.\nHesiod, in the \"Theogony\", gives an account of how this role for Styx came about. He says that, during the Titanomachy, the great war of Zeus and his fellow Olympians against Cronus and his fellow Titans, Zeus summoned \"all the deathless gods to great Olympus\" and promised, to whosoever would join him against the Titans, that he would preserve whatever rights and offices each had, or if they had none under Cronus, they would be given both under his rule. Styx, upon the advice of her father Oceanus, was the first to side with Zeus, bringing her children by Pallas along with her. And so in return Zeus appointed Styx to be \"the great oath of the gods, and her children to live with him always.\"\nAccording to Hesiod, Styx lived at the entrance to Hades, in a cave \"propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars\". Hesiod also tells us that Zeus would send Iris, the messenger of the gods, to fetch the \"famous cold water\" of Styx for the gods to swear by, and describes the punishments which would follow the breaking of such an oath:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For whoever of the deathless gods that hold the peaks of snowy Olympus pours a libation of her water and is forsworn, must lie breathless until a full year is completed, and never come near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but lie spiritless and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance overshadows him. But when he has spent a long year in his sickness, another penance more hard follows after the first. For nine years he is cut off from the eternal gods and never joins their councils or their feasts, nine full years. But in the tenth year he comes again to join the assemblies of the deathless gods who live in the house of Olympus.\nThe Roman poet Ovid has Jove (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) swear by the waters of Styx when he promises Semele:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nand was then obliged to follow through even though he realized to his horror that Semele's request would lead to her death. Similarly Sol (the Roman equivalent of the Greek Helios) promised his son Phaethon whatever he desired, which also resulted in the boy's death after he asked to drive his father's chariot for a day.\nRiver.\nThe goddess Styx, like her father Oceanus, and his sons the river gods, was also a river, in her case, a river of the Underworld. According to Hesiod, Styx was given one-tenth of her father's water, which flowed far underground, and came up to the surface to pour out from a high rock: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the famous cold water ... trickles down from a high and beetling rock. Far under the wide-pathed earth a branch of Oceanus flows through the dark night out of the holy stream, and a tenth part of his water is allotted to her.\nIn the \"Iliad\" the river Styx forms a boundary of Hades, the abode of the dead, in the Underworld. Athena mentions the \"sheer-falling waters of Styx\" needing to be crossed when Heracles returned from Hades after capturing Cerberus, and Patroclus's shade begs Achilles to bury his corpse quickly so that he might \"pass within the gates of Hades\" and join the other dead \"beyond the River\". So too in Virgil's \"Aeneid\", where the Styx winds nine times around the borders of Hades, and the boatman Charon is in charge of ferrying the dead across it. More usually, however, Acheron is the river (or lake) which separates the world of the living from the world of the dead.\nIn the \"Odyssey\", Circe says that the Underworld river Cocytus is a branch of the Styx. In Dante's \"Inferno\", Phlegyas ferries Virgil and Dante across the foul waters of the river Styx which is portrayed as a marsh comprising the Hell's Fifth Circle, where the angry and sullen are punished.\nBy metonymy, the adjective \"stygian\" () came to refer to anything unpleasantly dark, gloomy, or forbidding.\nOther.\nIn the \"Homeric Hymn\" 2 \"to Demeter\" Persephone names Styx as one of her \"frolicking\" Oceanid-companions when she was abducted by Hades.\nAccording to the \"Achilleid\", written by the Roman poet Statius in the 1st century AD, when Achilles was born his mother Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel. And so Paris was able to kill Achilles during the Trojan War by shooting an arrow into his heel.\nIn the second-century \"Metamorphoses\" of Apuleius, one of the impossible trials which Venus imposed on Psyche was to fetch water from the Styx. Apuleius has the water guarded by fierce dragons (\"dracones\"), and from the water itself came fearsome cries of deadly warning. The sheer impossibility of her task caused Psyche to become senseless, as if turned into stone. Jupiter's eagle admonishes Psyche saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do you ... really expect to be able to steal, or even touch, a single drop from that holiest\u2014and cruelest\u2014of springs? Even the gods and Jupiter himself are frightened of these Stygian waters. You must know that, at least by hearsay, and that, as you swear by the powers of the gods, so the gods always swear by the majesty of the Styx.\nThe Arcadian Styx.\nStyx, along with the underworld rivers Cocytus and Acheron, were associated with waterways in the upper world. For example, according to Homer, the river Titaressus, a tributary of the river Peneius in Thessaly, was a branch of the Styx. However Styx has been most commonly associated with an Arcadian stream and waterfall (the Mavron\u00e9ri) that runs through a ravine on the North face of mount Chelmos and flows into the Krathis river. The fifth-century BC historian Herodotus, locates this stream\u2014calling it \"the water of Styx\"\u2014as being near Nonacris a town (in what was then ancient Arcadia and now modern Achaea) not far from Pheneus, and says that the Spartan king Cleomenes, would make men take oaths swearing by its water. Herodotus describes it as \"a stream of small appearance, dropping from a cliff into a pool; a wall of stones runs round the pool\". Pausanias reports visiting the \"water of the Styx\" near Nonacris (which at the time of his visit, in the second century AD, was already a partially-buried ruins), saying that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Not far from the ruins is a high cliff; I know of none other that rises to so great a height. A water trickles down the cliff, called by the Greeks the water of the Styx.\nAccording to Aelian, Demeter caused the water of this Arcadian Styx \"to well up in the neighbourhood of Pheneus\". An ancient legend apparently also connected Demeter with this Styx. According to Photius, a certain Ptolemy Hephaestion (probably referring to Ptolemy Chennus) knew of a story, \"concerning the water of the Styx in Arcadia\", which told how an angry Demeter had turned the Styx's water black. According to James George Frazer, this \"fable\" provided an explanation for the fact that, from a distance, the waterfall appears black.\nWater from this Styx was said to be poisonous and able to dissolve most substances. The first-century natural philosopher Pliny, wrote that drinking its water caused immediate death, and that the hoof of a female mule was the only material not \"rotted\" by its water. According to Plutarch the poisonous water could only be held by an ass's hoof, since all other vessels would \"be eaten through by it, owing to its coldness and pungency.\" While according to Pausanias, the only vessel that could hold the Styx's water (poisonous to both men and animals) was a horse's hoof. There were ancient suspicions that Alexander the Great's death was caused by being poisoned with the water of this Styx.\nThe Arcadian Styx may have been named so after its mythological counterpart, but it is also possible that this Arcadian stream was the model for the mythological Styx. The latter seems to be the case, at least, for the Styx in Apuleius's \"Metamorphoses\", which has Venus, addressing Psyche, give the following description:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do you see that steep mountain-peak standing above the towering cliff? Dark waves flow down from a black spring on that peak and are enclosed by the reservoir formed by the valley nearby, to water the swamps of Styx and feed the rasping currents of Cocytus.\nThat Apuleius has his \"black spring\" being guarded by dragons, also suggests a connection between his Styx and two modern local names for the waterfall: the Black Water (\"Mavro Nero\") and the Dragon Water (\"Drako Nero\").\nMoon.\nOn 2 July 2013, \"Styx\" officially became the name of one of Pluto's moons. The other moons of Pluto (Charon, Nix, Hydra, and Kerberos) also have names from Greco-Roman mythology related to the underworld.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28747", "revid": "40908064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28747", "title": "Sangha", "text": "Pali and Sanskrit word meaning religious community\nSa\u1e45gha or sa\u1e43gha () is a term meaning \"association\", \"assembly\", \"company\" or \"community\". In a political context, it was historically used to denote a governing assembly in a republic or a kingdom, and for a long time, it has been used by religious associations, including Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. Given this history, some Buddhists have stated that the tradition of the \"sangha\" represents humanity's oldest surviving democratic institution.\nIn Buddhism, \"sangha\" refers to the monastic communities of \"bhikkhu\" (monks) and \"bhikkhuni\" (nuns). These communities are traditionally referred to as the \"bhikkhu-sangha\" or the \"bhikkhuni-sangha\". As a separate category, those Buddhists who have attained any of the four stages of enlightenment, whether or not they are members of the monastic community, are referred to as the \"\u0101ryasa\u1e45gha\" (\"noble Sangha\").\nAccording to the Theravada school and Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, the term \"sangha\" does not refer to the community of unenlightened s\u0101vakas (lay followers) nor does it refer to the community of Buddhists as a whole. Instead, the Theravada school uses the term \"paris\u0101\" (\"assembly\") or \"catuparis\u0101\" (\"fourfold assembly\") to refer to the \"bhikkhu\", \"bhikkhun\u012b\", \"up\u0101saka\", and \"up\u0101sik\u0101\" as a collective.\nDefinitions.\nIn a glossary of Buddhist terms, Richard Robinson et al. define sangha as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sangha. Community. This word has two levels of meaning:\n(1) on the ideal (\"arya\") level, it denotes all of the Buddha\u2019s followers, lay or ordained, who have at least attained the level of srot\u0101panna;\n(2) on the conventional (\"sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti\") level, it denotes the orders of the Bhik\u1e63us and Bhik\u1e63unis.\nMahayana practitioners may use the word \"sangha\" as a collective term for all Buddhists, but the Theravada P\u0101li Canon uses the word \"paris\u0101\" (Sanskrit \"pari\u1e63ad\") for the larger Buddhist community\u2014the monks, nuns, lay men, and lay women who have taken the Three Refuges\u2014with a few exceptions reserving \"sangha\" for its original use in the P\u0101li Canon\u2014the ideal (\"arya\") and the conventional.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nQualities of the Sangha.\nThe \"Sangha\" is the third of the Three Refuges in Buddhism. Common over all schools is that the \"\u0101ryasa\u1e45gha\" is the foremost form of this third jewel. As for its recognizable contemporary forms, the interpretation of what is the Jewel is often dependent on how a school defines Sangha. In many schools, for example, monastic life is considered to provide the safest and most suitable environment for advancing toward enlightenment and liberation due to the temptations and vicissitudes of life in the world.\nIn Buddhism, Gautama Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha each are described as having certain characteristics. These characteristics are chanted either on a daily basis and/or on Uposatha days, depending on the school of Buddhism. In Theravada tradition they are a part of daily chanting:\nThe Sangha: The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples (s\u0101vakas) is:\nThat is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals - This Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is:\nMonastic tradition.\nThe Sangha was originally established by Gautama Buddha in the fifth century BCE in order to provide a means for those who wish to practice full-time in a direct and highly disciplined way, free from the restrictions and responsibilities of the household life. The Sangha also fulfils the function of preserving the Buddha's original teachings and of providing spiritual support for the Buddhist lay-community. The Sangha has historically assumed responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the doctrine as well as the translation and propagation of the teachings of the Buddha.\nThe key feature of Buddhist monasticism is the adherence to the vinaya which contains an elaborate set of \"227 main rules of conduct\" (known as \"Patimokkha\" in P\u0101li) including complete chastity, eating only before noon, and not indulging in malicious or salacious talk. Between midday and the next day, a strict life of scripture study, chanting, meditation, and occasional cleaning forms most of the duties for members of the \"sangha\". Transgression of rules carries penalties ranging from confession to permanent expulsion from the \"sangha\".\nJapanese monastic regulations.\nSaich\u014d, the founder of the Japanese school of Tendai, decided to reduce the number of rules down to about 60 based on the Bodhisattva Precepts. In the Kamakura, many Japanese schools that originated in or were influenced by the Tendai such as Zen, Pure Land Buddhism and Nichiren Buddhism abolished traditional ordination in favor of this new model of the monastic regulations.\nThe Fourteen Precepts of the Order of Interbeing.\nThe Order of Interbeing, established in 1964 and associated with the Plum Village Tradition, has fourteen precepts observed by all monastics. They were written by Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh.\nPossessions.\nMonks and nuns generally own a minimum of possessions due to their \"samaya\" as renunciants, including three robes, an alms bowl, a cloth belt, a needle and thread, a razor for shaving the head, and a water filter. In practice, they often have a few additional personal possessions.\nTraditionally, Buddhist monks, nuns, and novices eschew ordinary clothes and wear robes. Originally the robes were sewn together from rags and stained with earth or other available dyes. The color of modern robes varies from community to community: saffron is characteristic for Theravada groups; blue, grey or brown for Mahayana Sangha members in Vietnam, maroon in Tibetan Buddhism, grey in Korea, and black in Japan.\nAttitudes regarding food and work.\nA Buddhist monk is a \"bhikkhu\" in Pali, Sanskrit \"bhik\u1e63u\", while a nun is a \"bhikkhuni\", Sanskrit \"bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b\". These words literally mean \"beggar\" or \"one who lives by alms\", and it was traditional in early Buddhism for the Sangha to go on \"alms round\" for food, walking or standing quietly in populated areas with alms bowls ready to receive food offerings each day. Although in the \"vinaya\" laid down by the Gautama Buddha, the \"sangha\" was not allowed to engage directly in agriculture, this later changed in some Mahayana schools when Buddhism moved to East Asia, so that in the East Asian cultural sphere, the monastic community traditionally has engaged in agriculture. An emphasis on working for food is attributed to additional training guidelines laid down by a Chan Buddhist master, Baizhang Huaihai, notably the phrase, \"A day without work is a day without food\" ().\nThe idea that all Buddhists, especially \"sangha\" members, practice vegetarianism is a Western misperception. In the Pali Canon, the Buddha rejected a suggestion by Devadatta to impose vegetarianism on the \"sangha\". According to the Pali Texts, the Buddha ate meat as long as the animal was not killed specifically for him. The P\u0101li Canon allowed Sangha members to eat whatever food is donated to them by laypeople, except that they may not eat meat if they know or suspect the animal was killed specifically for them. Consequently, the Theravada tradition does not practice strict vegetarianism, although an individual may do so as his or her personal choice.\nBoth Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions vary depending on their interpretation of their scriptures. In some Mahayana sutras, meat-eating is strongly discouraged and it is stated that the Buddha did not eat meat. In particular, East Asian \"sangha\" members take on the Bodhisattva Precepts originating in the \"Brahmaj\u0101la S\u016btra\", which has a vow of vegetarianism as part of the Triple Platform Ordination, where they receive the three sets of vows: \u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era/\u015br\u0101ma\u1e47er\u012b (novitiate), monastic, and then the \"Brahmaj\u0101la S\u016btra\" Bodhisattva Precepts, whereas the Tibetan lineages transmit a tradition of Bodhisattva Precepts from Asanga's \"Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015a\u0101stra\", which do not include a vow of vegetarianism.\nAccording to Mahayana sutras, Shakyamuni Buddha always maintained that lay persons were capable of great wisdom and of reaching enlightenment. In some areas there has been a misconception that Theravada regards enlightenment to be an impossible goal for those outside the \"sangha\", but in Theravada suttas it is clearly recorded that the Buddha's uncle, a lay follower, reached enlightenment by hearing the Buddha's discourse, and there are many other such instances described in the P\u0101li Canon. Accordingly, emphasis on lay persons, as well as Sangha members, practicing the Buddhist path of morality, meditation, and wisdom is present in all major Buddhist schools.\nThe \"Sangha\" as any Buddhist community.\nSome liberal scholars opine that \"sangha\" is frequently (and according to them, mistakenly) used in the West to refer to any sort of Buddhist community.\nIn Nichiren Buddhism.\nAccordingly, the Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b sect maintains the traditionalist definition of the \"sangha\" as the Head Temple Taisekiji priesthood collective as the sole custodians and arbiters of Buddhist doctrine.\nThe Soka Gakkai, a new religious movement which began as a lay organization previously associated with Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b in Japan, disputes the traditional definition of sangha. The organization interprets the meaning of the Three Jewels of Buddhism, in particular the \"treasure of the Sangha\", to include all people who practice Buddhism according to its own interpretation within their organization, whether lay or clerical. After its formal expulsion from its parent religion in December 1991 due to conflicts of religious doctrine, the organization re\u2014published newer literature which revised the terms such as \"Treasure of the Priesthood\" to \"The Buddhist Order\".\nSome modernist sects of Nichiren-shu holds a position that any Buddhist community is also called Sangha, along with both liberal and progressive Mahayana lay movements as well claiming this new definition.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28748", "revid": "35019008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28748", "title": "Speed", "text": "Magnitude of velocity\nIn kinematics, the speed (commonly referred to as v) of an object is the magnitude of the change of its position over time or the magnitude of the change of its position per unit of time; it is thus a non-negative scalar quantity. The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. Speed is the magnitude of \"velocity\" (a vector), which indicates additionally the direction of motion.\nSpeed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second (m/s), but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour (km/h) or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour (mph). For air and marine travel, the knot is commonly used.\nThe fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in vacuum \"c\" = metres per second (approximately or ). Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.\nDefinition.\nHistorical definition.\nItalian physicist Galileo Galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time. In equation form, that is\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is speed, formula_3 is distance, and formula_4 is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50\u00a0km/h, slow to 0\u00a0km/h, and then reach 30\u00a0km/h).\nInstantaneous speed.\nSpeed at some instant, or assumed constant during a very short period of time, is called \"instantaneous speed\". By looking at a speedometer, one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant. A car travelling at 50\u00a0km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50\u00a0km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25\u00a0km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833\u00a0m.\nIn mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed formula_2 is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity formula_6, that is, the derivative of the position formula_7 with respect to time:\nformula_8\nIf formula_9 is the length of the path (also known as the distance) travelled until time formula_4, the speed equals the time derivative of formula_9:\nformula_12\nIn the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to formula_13.\nAverage speed.\nDifferent from instantaneous speed, \"average speed\" is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).\nAverage speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed. If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to\nformula_14\nUsing this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.\nExpressed in graphical language, the slope of a tangent line at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a chord line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord.\nDifference between speed and velocity.\nSpeed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60\u00a0km/h, its \"speed\" has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60\u00a0km/h to the north, its \"velocity\" has now been specified.\nThe big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average \"velocity\" is zero, but its average \"speed\" is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average \"velocity\" is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average \"speed\" considers only the total distance travelled.\nUnits.\nUnits of speed include:\n (* = approximate values)\nPsychology.\nAccording to Jean Piaget, the intuition for the notion of speed in humans precedes that of duration, and is based on the notion of outdistancing. Piaget studied this subject inspired by a question asked to him in 1928 by Albert Einstein: \"In what order do children acquire the concepts of time and speed?\" Children's early concept of speed is based on \"overtaking\", taking only temporal and spatial orders into consideration, specifically: \"A moving object is judged to be more rapid than another when at a given moment the first object is behind and a moment or so later ahead of the other object.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The current scientific consensus is that faster-than-light communication is not possible, and to date it has not been achieved in any experiment.\nFaster-than-light communication other than possibly through wormholes is likely impossible because, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, it could be used to transmit information into the past. This would complicate causality, but no theoretical arguments conclusively preclude this possibility.\nA number of theories and phenomena related to faster-than-light communication have been proposed or studied, including tachyons, neutrinos, quantum nonlocality, wormholes, quantum entanglement and quantum tunneling.\nProposed mechanisms.\nTachyons.\nTachyonic particles are hypothetical particles that travel faster than light, which could conceivably allow for superluminal communication. Because such a particle would violate the known laws of physics, many scientists reject the idea that they exist. By contrast, tachyonic fields\u00a0\u2013 quantum fields with imaginary mass\u00a0\u2013 do exist and exhibit superluminal group velocity under some circumstances. However, such fields have luminal signal velocity and do not allow superluminal communication.\nQuantum nonlocality.\nQuantum mechanics is non-local in the sense that distant systems can be entangled. Entangled states lead to correlations in the results of otherwise random measurements, even when the measurements are made nearly simultaneously and at far distant points. The impossibility of superluminal communication led Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen to propose that quantum mechanics must be incomplete (see EPR paradox).\nHowever, it is now well understood that quantum entanglement does not allow any influence or information to propagate superluminally.\nPractically, any attempt to force one member of an entangled pair of particles into a particular quantum state, breaks the entanglement between the two particles. That is to say, the other member of the entangled pair is completely unaffected by this \"forcing\" action, and its quantum state remains random; a preferred outcome cannot be encoded into a quantum measurement.\nTechnically, the microscopic causality postulate of axiomatic quantum field theory implies the impossibility of superluminal communication using any phenomena whose behavior can be described by orthodox quantum field theory. A special case of this is the no-communication theorem, which prevents communication using the quantum entanglement of a composite system shared between two spacelike-separated observers.\nWormholes.\nIf wormholes are possible, then ordinary subluminal methods of communication could be sent through them to achieve effectively superluminal transmission speeds across non-local regions of spacetime. Considering the immense energy or exotic matter with negative mass/negative energy that current theories suggest would be required to open a wormhole large enough to pass spacecraft through, it may be that only atomic-scale wormholes would be practical to build, limiting their use solely to information transmission. Some hypotheses of wormhole formation would prevent them from ever becoming \"timeholes\", allowing superluminal communication without the additional complication of allowing communication with the past.\nFictional devices.\nTachyon-like.\nThe \"Dirac communicator\" features in several of the works of James Blish, notably his 1954 short story \"Beep\" (later expanded into \"The Quincunx of Time\"). As alluded to in the title, any active device received the sum of all transmitted messages in universal space-time, in a single pulse, so that demultiplexing yielded information about the past, present, and future.\nSuperluminal transmitters and ansibles.\nThe terms \"ultrawave\" and \"hyperwave\" have been used by several authors, often interchangeably, to denote faster-than-light communications. Examples include:\nA later device was the ansible coined by Ursula K. Le Guin and used extensively in her Hainish Cycle. Like Blish's device it provided instantaneous communication, but without the inconvenient beep.\nThe ansible is also a major plot element, nearly a MacGuffin, in Elizabeth Moon's Vatta's War series. Much of the story line revolves around various parties attacking or repairing ansibles, and around the internal politics of ISC (InterStellar Communications), a corporation which holds a monopoly on the ansible technology.\nThe ansible is also used as the main form of communication in Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series. It is inhabited by an energy based, non-artificial sentient creature called an Ai\u00faa that was placed within the ansible network and goes by the name of Jane. It was made when the humans realized that the Buggers, an alien species that attacked Earth, could communicate instantaneously and so the humans tried to do the same.\nPsychic links.\nPsychic links, belonging to pseudoscience, have been described as explainable by physical principles or unexplained, but they are claimed to operate instantaneously over large distances.\nIn the \"Stargate\" television series, characters are able to communicate instantaneously over long distances by transferring their consciousness into another person or being anywhere in the universe using \"Ancient communication stones\". It is not known how these stones operate, but the technology explained in the show usually revolves around wormholes for instant teleportation, faster-than-light, space-warping travel, and sometimes around quantum multiverses.\nIn Robert A. Heinlein's \"Time for the Stars\", twin telepathy was used to maintain communication with a distant spaceship.\nPeter F. Hamilton's \"Void Trilogy\" features psychic links between the multiple bodies simultaneously occupied by some characters.\nIn Brandon Sanderson's \"Skyward\" series, characters are able to use \"Cytonics\" to communicate instantaneously over any distance by sending messages via an inter-dimensional reality called \"nowhere\".\nOther devices.\nSimilar devices are present in the works of numerous others, such as Frank Herbert and Philip Pullman, who called his a \"lodestone resonator\".\nAnne McCaffrey's \"Crystal Singer\" series posited an instantaneous communication device powered by rare \"Black Crystal\" from the planet Ballybran. Black Crystals cut from the same mineral deposit could be \"tuned\" to sympathetically vibrate with each other instantly, even when separated by interstellar distances, allowing instantaneous telephone-like voice and data communication. Similarly, in Gregory Keyes' series \"The Age of Unreason\", \"aetherschreibers\" use two-halves of a single \"chime\" to communicate, aided by scientific alchemy. While the speed of communication is important, so is the fact that the messages cannot be overheard except by listeners with a piece of the same original crystal.\nStephen R. Donaldson, in his Gap cycle, proposed a similar system, \"Symbiotic Crystalline Resonance Transmission\", clearly ansible-type technology but very difficult to produce and limited to text messages.\nIn \"With Folded Hands\" (1947) and \"The Humanoids\" (1949), by Jack Williamson, instant communication and power transfer through interstellar space is possible with \"rhodomagnetic energy\".\nIn Ivan Yefremov's 1957 novel \"Andromeda Nebula\", a device for instant transfer of information and matter is made real by using \"bipolar mathematics\" to explore use of anti-gravitational shadow vectors through a zero field and the antispace, which enables them to make contact with the planet of Epsilon Tucanae.\nIn Edmond Hamilton's \"The Star Kings\" (1949), the discovery of an unknown form of electromagnetic radiation called sub-spectrum rays moves faster than light. The fastest of these are those of the Minus-42nd Octave, which allows for real time telestereo communication with anyone within the galaxy.\nIn Cordwainer Smith's Instrumentality novels and stories, interplanetary and interstellar communication is normally relayed from planet to planet, presumably at superluminal speed for each stage (at least between solar systems) but with a cumulative delay. For urgent communication there is the \"instant message\", which is effectively instantaneous but very expensive.\nIn Howard Taylor's web comic series Schlock Mercenary, superluminal communication is performed via the hypernet, a galaxy-spanning analogue to the Internet. Through the hypernet, communications and data are routed through nanoscopic wormholes, using conventional electromagnetic signals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As the fifth Mughal emperor, his reign marked the zenith of Mughal architectural and cultural achievements.\nThe third son of Jahangir (r.\u20091605\u00a0\u2013\u00a01627), Shah Jahan participated in the military campaigns against the Sisodia Rajputs of Mewar and the rebel Lodi nobles of the Deccan. After Jahangir's death in October 1627, Shah Jahan defeated his youngest brother Shahryar Mirza and crowned himself emperor in the Agra Fort. In addition to Shahryar, Shah Jahan executed most of his rival claimants to the throne. He commissioned many monuments, including the Red Fort, Shah Jahan Mosque and the Taj Mahal, where his favorite consort Mumtaz Mahal is entombed. In foreign affairs, Shah Jahan presided over the aggressive campaigns against the Deccan sultanates, the conflicts with the Portuguese, and the wars with the Safavids. He also suppressed several local rebellions and dealt with the devastating Deccan famine of 1630\u201332.\nIn September 1657, Shah Jahan was ailing and appointed his eldest son Dara Shikoh as his successor. This nomination led to the Mughal war of succession (1658\u20131659) among his three sons, with Aurangzeb (r.\u20091658\u00a0\u2013\u00a01707) emerging victorious to become the sixth emperor, executing all of his surviving brothers, including the Crown Prince Dara Shikoh. After Shah Jahan recovered from his illness in July 1658, Aurangzeb imprisoned him in Agra Fort from July 1658 until his death in January 1666. He was laid to rest next to his wife in the Taj Mahal. His reign is known for doing away with the liberal policies initiated by his grandfather Akbar. During Shah Jahan's time, Islamic revivalist movements like the Naqshbandi began to shape Mughal policies.\nEarly life.\nBirth and background.\nHe was born on 5 January 1592 in Lahore, present-day Pakistan, as the ninth child and third son of Prince Salim (later known as 'Jahangir' upon his accession) and his chief consort, Jagat Gosain. The name Khurram () was chosen for the young prince by his grandfather, Emperor Akbar, with whom the young prince shared a close relationship. Jahangir stated that Akbar was very fond of Khurram and had often told him, \"There is no comparison between him and your other sons. I consider him my true son.\"\nWhen Khurram was born, Akbar, considering him to be auspicious, insisted the prince be raised in his household rather than Salim's and was thus entrusted to the care of Ruqaiya Sultan Begum. Ruqaiya assumed the primary responsibility for raising Khurram and is noted to have raised Khurram affectionately. Jahangir noted in his memoirs that Ruqaiya had loved his son, Khurram, \"a thousand times more than if he had been her own [son].\"\nHowever, after the death of his grandfather Akbar in 1605, he returned to the care of his mother, Jagat Gosain whom he cared for and loved immensely. Although separated from her at birth, he had become devoted to her and had her addressed as \"Hazrat\" in court chronicles. On the death of Jagat Gosain in Akbarabad on 8 April 1619, he is recorded to be inconsolable by Jahangir and mourned for 21 days. For these three weeks of the mourning period, he attended no public meetings and subsisted on simple vegetarian meals. His consort Mumtaz Mahal personally supervised the distribution of food to the poor during this period. She led the recitation of the Quran every morning, and gave her husband many lessons on the substance of life and death, and begged him not to grieve.\nEducation.\nAs a child, Khurram received a broad education befitting his status as a Mughal prince, which included martial training and exposure to a wide variety of cultural arts, such as poetry and music, most of which were inculcated, according to court chroniclers, by Jahangir. According to his chronicler Qazvini, prince Khurram was only familiar with a few Turki words and showed little interest in the study of the language as a child. Khurram was attracted to Hindi literature since his childhood, and his Hindi letters were mentioned in his father's biography, \"Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\". In 1605, as Akbar lay on his deathbed, young Khurram remained by his bedside and refused to move even after his mother tried to retrieve him. Given the politically uncertain times immediately preceding Akbar's death, Khurram was in a fair amount of physical danger from political opponents of his father. He was at last ordered to return to his quarters by the senior women of his grandfather's household, namely Salima Sultan Begum and his grandmother Mariam-uz-Zamani as Akbar's health deteriorated.\nKhusrau rebellion.\nIn 1605, his father succeeded to the throne, after crushing a rebellion by Prince Khusrau. Khurram left Ruqaiya's care and returned to his mother's care. As the third son, Khurram did not challenge the two major power blocs of the time, his father's and his half-brother's; thus, he enjoyed the benefits of imperial protection and luxury while being allowed to continue with his education and training. This relatively quiet and stable period of his life allowed Khurram to build his own support base in the Mughal court, which would be useful later on in his life.\nJahangir assigned Khurram to guard the palace and treasury while he went to pursue Khusrau. He was later ordered to bring Mariam-uz-Zamani, his grandmother and Jahangir's harem to him.\nDuring Khusrau's second rebellion, Khurram's informants informed him that Fatehullah, Nuruddin and Muhammad Sharif gathered around 500 men at Khusrau's instigation and lay await for the Emperor. Khurram relayed this information to Jahangir who praised him.\nJahangir had Khurram weighed against gold, silver and other wealth at his mansion at Orta.\nNur Jahan.\nDue to the long period of tensions between his father and his half-brother, Khusrau Mirza, Khurram began to drift closer to his father, and, over time, started to be considered the de facto heir-apparent by court chroniclers. This status was given official sanction when Jahangir granted the sarkar of Hissar-e-Feroza, which had traditionally been the fief of the heir-apparent, to Khurram in 1608. After her marriage to Jahangir in the year 1611, Nur Jahan gradually became an active participant in all decisions made by Jahangir and gained extreme powers in administration, so much so that it was obvious to everyone both inside and outside that most of his decisions were actually hers. Slowly, while Jahangir became more indulgent in wine and opium, she was considered to be the actual power behind the throne. Her near and dear relatives acquired important positions in the Mughal court, termed the Nur Jahan junta by historians. Khurram was in constant conflict with his stepmother, Nur Jahan who favoured her son-in-law Shahryar Mirza for the succession to the Mughal throne over him. In the last years of Jahangir's life, Nur Jahan was in full power, and the emperor had left all the burden of governance on her. She tried to weaken Khurram's position in the Mughal court by sending him on campaigns far in Deccan, while ensuring several favours were being bestowed on her son-in-law. Khurram, after sensing the danger posed to his status as heir-apparent, rebelled against his father in 1622 but did not succeed and eventually lost the favour of his father. Several years before Jahangir's death in 1627, coins began to be struck containing Nur Jahan's name along with Jahangir's name; In fact, there were two prerogatives of sovereignty for the legitimacy of a Muslim monarchy (reading the Khutbah and the other being the right to mint coins). After the death of Jahangir in 1627, a struggle developed between Khurram and his half-brother, Shahryar Mirza for the succession to the Mughal throne. Khurram won the battle of succession and became the fifth Mughal Emperor. Nur Jahan was subsequently deprived of her imperial stature, authority, privileges, honors and economic grants and was put under house arrest on the orders of Khurram and led a quiet and comfortable life till her death.\nMarriages.\nIn 1607, Khurram became engaged to Arjumand Banu Begum (1593\u20131631), who is also known as Mumtaz Mahal (Persian lit.\u2009'The Exalted One of the Palace'). They were about 14 and 15 when they were engaged, and five years later, they married. The young girl belonged to an illustrious Persian noble family that included Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan, who had been serving Mughal emperors since the reign of Akbar. The family's patriarch was Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who was also known by his title I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah or \"Pillar of the State\". He had been Jahangir's finance minister, and his son, Asaf Khan \u2013 Arjumand Banu's father \u2013 played an important role in the Mughal court, eventually serving as Chief Minister. Her aunt Mehr-un-Nissa later became the Empress Nur Jahan, chief consort of Emperor Jahangir.\nThe prince would have to wait five years before he was married in 1612 (1021 AH), on a date selected by the court astrologers as most conducive to ensuring a happy marriage. This was an unusually long engagement for the time. However, Shah Jahan first married a Persian Princess (name not known) entitled Kandahari Begum, the daughter of a great-grandson of the great Shah Ismail I of Persia, with whom he had a daughter, his first child.\nIn 1612, aged 20, Khurram married Mumtaz Mahal, on a date chosen by court astrologers. The marriage was a happy one, and Khurram remained devoted to her. They had fourteen children, out of whom seven survived into adulthood.\nThough there was genuine love between the two, Arjumand Banu Begum was a politically astute woman and served as a crucial advisor and confidante to her husband. Later on, as empress, Mumtaz Mahal wielded immense power, such as being consulted by her husband in state matters, attending the council (\"shura\" or \"diwan\"), and being responsible for the imperial seal, which allowed her to review official documents in their final draft. Shah Jahan also gave her the right to issue her own orders (hukums) and make appointments to him. \nMumtaz Mahal died at the young age of 38 (7 June 1631), upon giving birth to Princess Gauhar Ara Begum in the city of Burhanpur, Deccan, of a postpartum haemorrhage, which caused considerable blood-loss after painful labor of thirty hours. Contemporary historians note that Princess Jahanara, aged 17, was so distressed by her mother's pain that she started distributing gems to the poor, hoping for divine intervention, and Shah Jahan was noted as being \"paralysed by grief\" and weeping fits. Her body was temporarily buried in a walled pleasure garden known as Zainabad, originally constructed by Shah Jahan's uncle Prince Daniyal along the Tapti River. Her death had a profound impact on Shah Jahan's personality and inspired the construction of the marvelous Taj Mahal, where she was later reburied.\nKhurram had taken other wives, among whom were Kandahari Begum (m. 28 October 1610) and another Persian Princess Izz un-Nisa Begum (m. 2 September 1617), the daughters of Prince Muzaffar Husain Mirza Safawi and Shahnawaz Khan, son of Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, respectively. But according to court chroniclers, these marriages were more out of political consideration, and they enjoyed only the status of being royal wives.\nKhurram is also recorded to have married Leelavati Deiji, daughter of Kunwar Shakti Singh, son of Mota Raja Udai Singh and half-brother of Raja Sur Singh of Marwar. The marriage took place at Jodhpur when Khurram was in rebellion against his father, emperor Jahangir.\nRelation with Jahanara.\nAfter Shah Jahan fell ill in 1658, his daughter Jahanara Begum had a significant influence in the Mughal administration. As a result, several accusations of an incestual relationship between Shah Jahan and Jahanara were propagated. Such accusations have been dismissed by modern historians as gossip, as no witness of an incident has been mentioned.\nHistorian K. S. Lal also dismisses such claims as rumors propagated by courtiers and mullahs. He cites Aurangzeb's confining of Jahanara in the Agra Fort with the Royal prisoner and the talk of the low people magnifying a rumor.\nSeveral contemporary travelers have mentioned such accessions. Francois Bernier, a French physician, mentions rumors of an incestuous relationship being propagated in the Mughal Court. However, Bernier did not mention witnessing such a relationship. Niccolao Manucci, a Venetian traveler, dismisses such accusations by Bernier as gossip and \"\"The talk of the Low People\".\"\nEarly military campaigns.\nPrince Khurram showed extraordinary military talent. The first occasion for Khurram to test his military prowess was during the Mughal campaign against the Rajput state of Mewar, which had been a hostile force to the Mughals since Akbar's reign.\nAfter a year of a harsh war of attrition, Rana Amar Singh I surrendered conditionally to the Mughal forces and became a vassal state of the Mughal Empire as a result of Mughal expedition of Mewar. In 1615, Khurram presented Kunwar Karan Singh, Amar Singh's heir, to Jahangir. Khurram was sent to pay homage to his mother and stepmothers and was later awarded by Jahangir. The same year, his mansab was increased from 12000/6000 to 15000/7000, to equal that of his brother Parvez's and was further increased to 20000/10000 in 1616.\nIn 1616, on Khurram's departure to Deccan, Jahangir awarded him the title Shah Sultan Khurram.\nIn 1617, Khurram was directed to deal with the Lodis in the Deccan to secure the Empire's southern borders and to restore imperial control over the region. On his return in 1617, after successes in these campaigns, Khurram performed koronush before Jahangir, who called him to jharoka and rose from his seat to embrace him. Jahangir also granted him the title of Shah Jahan (Persian: \"King of the World\"), and raised his military rank to 30000/20000 and allowed him a special throne in his Durbar, an unprecedented honor for a prince. Edward S. Holden writes, \"He was flattered by some, envied by others, loved by none.\"\nIn 1618, Shah Jahan was given the first copy of \"Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\" by his father, who considered him \"the first of all my sons in everything.\"\nRebel prince.\nInheritance in the Mughal Empire was not always determined through primogeniture, but also by princely sons competing to achieve military successes and consolidating their power at court. This often led to rebellions and wars of succession. As a result, a complex political climate surrounded the Mughal court in Shah Jahan's formative years. In 1611 his father married Nur Jahan, the widowed daughter of a Persian noble. She rapidly became an important member of Jahangir's court and, together with her brother Asaf Khan, wielded considerable influence. Arjumand was Asaf Khan's daughter, and her marriage to Khurram consolidated Nur Jahan and Asaf Khan's positions in court.\nCourt intrigues, however, including Nur Jahan's decision to have her daughter from her first marriage wed Prince Khurram's youngest brother Shahzada Shahryar, and her support for his claim to the throne led to much internal division. Prince Khurram resented the influence Nur Jahan held over his father and was angered at having to play second fiddle to her favourite Shahryar, his half-brother and her son-in-law. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of the affairs. She ordered Prince Khurram to march to Kandahar, but he refused. As a result of Prince Khurram's refusal to obey Nur Jahan's orders, Kandahar was lost to the Persians after a forty-five-day siege. Prince Khurram feared that in his absence, Nur Jahan would attempt to poison his father against him and convince Jahangir to name Shahryar the heir in his place. This fear brought Prince Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the Persians.\nIn 1622, Prince Khurram raised an army and marched against his father. He was defeated at Bilochpur in March 1623. Later he took refuge in Udaipur Mewar with Maharana Karan Singh II. He was first lodged in Delwada Ki Haveli and subsequently shifted to Jagmandir Palace on his request. Prince Khurram exchanged his turban with the Maharana and that turban is still preserved in Pratap Museum, Udaipur (R V Somani 1976). It is believed that the mosaic work of Jagmandir inspired him to use mosaic work in the Taj Mahal of Agra. In November 1623, he found safe asylum in Bengal Subah after he was driven from Agra and the Deccan. He advanced through Midnapur and Burdwan. At Akbarnagar, he defeated and killed the then Subahdar of Bengal, Ibrahim Khan Fath-i-Jang, on 20 April 1624. He entered Dhaka and \"all the elephants, horses, and 4,000,000 rupees in specie belonging to the Government were delivered to him\". After a short stay he then moved to Patna. His rebellion did not succeed in the end, as his attempt was foiled by Jahangir 's trusted general, Mahabat Khan. He was forced to submit unconditionally after he was defeated near Allahabad. Although the prince was forgiven for his errors in 1626, tensions between Nur Jahan and her stepson continued to grow beneath the surface.\nUpon the death of Jahangir in 1627, the wazir Asaf Khan, who had long been a quiet partisan of Prince Khurram, acted with unexpected forcefulness and determination to forestall his sister's plans to place Prince Shahryar on the throne. He put Nur Jahan in close confinement. He obtained control of Prince Khurram's three sons, who were under her charge. Asaf Khan also managed palace intrigues to ensure Prince Khurram's succession to the throne. Prince Khurram succeeded to the Mughal throne as Abu ud-Muzaffar Shihab ud-Din Mohammad Sahib ud-Quiran ud-Thani Shah Jahan Padshah Ghazi (Urdu: \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0631\u0645), or Shah Jahan.\nHis regnal name is divided into various parts. \"Shihab ud-Din\", meaning \"Star of the Faith\", \"Sahib al-Quiran ud-Thani\", meaning \"Second Lord of the Happy Conjunction of Jupiter and Venus\". \"Shah Jahan\", meaning \"King of the World\", alluding to his pride in his Timurid roots and his ambitions. More epithets showed his secular and religious duties. He was also titled \"Hazrat Shahenshah\" (\"His Imperial Majesty\"), \"Hazrat-i-Khilafat-Panahi\" (\"His Majesty the Refuge of the Caliphate\"), \"Hazrat Zill-i-Ilahi\" (\"His Majesty the Shadow of God\").\nHis first act as ruler was to execute his chief rivals and imprison his stepmother, Nur Jahan. Upon Shah Jahan's orders, several executions took place on 23 January 1628. Those put to death included his brother Shahryar; his nephews Dawar and Garshasp, sons of Shah Jahan's previously executed brother Prince Khusrau; and his cousins Tahmuras and Hoshang, sons of the late Prince Daniyal Mirza.\nThis allowed Shah Jahan to rule his empire without contention.\nReign.\nEvidence from the reign of Shah Jahan states that in 1648 the army consisted of 911,400 infantry, musketeers, and artillery men, and 185,000 Sowars commanded by princes and nobles.\nHis cultural and political initial steps have been described as a type of the Timurid Renaissance, in which he built historical and political bonds with his Timurid heritage, mainly via his numerous unsuccessful military campaigns on his ancestral region of Balkh. In various forms, Shah Jahan appropriated his Timurid background and grafted it onto his imperial legacy.\nDuring his reign, the Marwari horse was introduced, becoming Shah Jahan's favorite, and various Mughal cannons were mass-produced in the Jaigarh Fort. Under his rule, the empire became a huge military machine, and the nobles and their contingents multiplied almost fourfold, as did the demands for more revenue from their citizens. But due to his measures in the financial and commercial fields, it was a period of general stability\u00a0\u2013 the administration was centralized and court affairs systematized.\nThe Mughal Empire continued to expand moderately during his reign, as his sons commanded large armies on different fronts. India at the time was a rich center of the arts, crafts and architecture, and some of the best of the architects, artisans, craftsmen, painters and writers of the world resided in Shah Jahan's empire. According to economist Angus Maddison, Mughal-era India's share of global gross domestic product (GDP) grew from 22.7% in 1600 to 24.4% in 1700, surpassing China to become the world's largest. E. Dewick and Murray Titus, quoting \"Badshahnama\", write that 76 temples in Benares were demolished on Shah Jahan's orders.\nFamine of 1630.\nA famine broke out in 1630\u201332 in Deccan, Gujarat and Khandesh as a result of three main crop failures. Two million people died of starvation; grocers sold dogs' flesh and mixed powdered bones with flour. It is reported that parents ate their own children. Some villages were completely destroyed, their streets filled with human corpses. In response to the devastation, Shah Jahan set up \"langar\" (free kitchens) for the victims of the famine.\nSuccessful military campaigns against Deccan sultanates.\nIn 1632, Shah Jahan captured the fortress at Daulatabad, Maharashtra and imprisoned Husein Shah of the Nizam Shahi Kingdom of Ahmednagar. Golconda submitted in 1635 and then Bijapur in 1636. Shah Jahan appointed Aurangzeb as Viceroy of the Deccan, consisting of Khandesh, Berar, Telangana, and Daulatabad. During his viceroyalty, Aurangzeb conquered Baglana where he defeated Baharji, the Raja. The small Maratha kingdom of Baglana straddled the main route from Surat and the western ports to Burhanpur in the Deccan, and had been subservient to one Muslim ruler or another for centuries. In 1637, however, Shah Jahan decided on complete annexation. Baharji, who had commanded the Baglana forces, died soon after the conquest. His son converted to Islam and received the title of Daulatmand Khan.\nAurangzeb then defeated Golconda in 1656, and then Bijapur in 1657.\nRelations with the Safavid dynasty.\nShah Jahan and his sons captured the city of Kandahar in 1638 from the Safavids, prompting the retaliation of the Persians led by their ruler Abbas II of Persia, who recaptured it in 1649. The Mughal armies were unable to recapture it despite repeated sieges during the Mughal\u2013Safavid War. Shah Jahan also expanded the Mughal Empire to the west beyond the Khyber Pass to Ghazna and Kandahar.\nMilitary campaign in Central Asia.\nShah Jahan launched an invasion of Central Asia from 1646 to 1647 against the Khanate of Bukhara. With a total army of 75,000, Shah Jahan and his sons Aurangzeb and Murad Bakhsh temporarily occupied the territories of Balkh and Badakhshan. However, they retreated from the fruitless lands, and Balkh and Badakhshan returned to Bukharan control.\nRelations with the Ottoman Empire.\nShah Jahan sent an embassy to the Ottoman court in 1637. Led by Mir Zarif, it reached Sultan Murad IV the following year, while he was encamped in Baghdad. Zarif presented him with fine gifts and a letter that encouraged an alliance against Safavid Persia. The Sultan sent a return embassy led by Arsalan Agha. Shah Jahan received the ambassador in June 1640.\nWhile he was encamped in Baghdad, Murad IV is known to have met ambassadors of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Mir Zarif and Mir Baraka, who presented 1000 pieces of finely embroidered cloth and even armor. Murad IV gave them the finest weapons, saddles and Kaftans and ordered his forces to accompany the Mughals to the port of Basra, where they set sail to Thatta and finally Surat. They exchanged lavish presents, but Shah Jahan was displeased with Sultan Murad's return letter, the tone of which he found discourteous. Sultan Murad's successor, Sultan Ibrahim, sent Shah Jahan another letter encouraging him to wage war against the Persians, but there is no record of a reply.\nWar with Portuguese.\nShah Jahan gave orders in 1631 to Qasim Khan, the Mughal viceroy of Bengal, to drive out the Portuguese from their trading post at Port Hoogly. The post was heavily armed with cannons, battleships, fortified walls, and other instruments of war. The Portuguese were accused of trafficking by high Mughal officials, and due to commercial competition, the Mughal-controlled port of Saptagram began to slump. Shah Jahan was particularly outraged by the activities of Jesuits in that region, notably when they were accused of abducting peasants. On 25 September 1632, the Mughal Army raised imperial banners and gained control over the Bandel region, and the garrison was punished. On 23 December 1635, Shah Jahan issued a farman ordering the Agra Church to be demolished. The Church was occupied by the Portuguese Jesuits. However, the Emperor allowed the Jesuits to conduct their religious ceremonies in privacy. He also banned the Jesuits from preaching their religion and making converts from both Hindus and Muslims. Though in the decree, he also granted 777 bighas of rent-free land to the Augustinian Fathers and the Christian community in Bandel, currently in West Bengal, shaping its Portuguese heritage for times to come.\nRevolts against Shah Jahan.\nThe Kolis of Gujarat rebelled against the rule of Shah Jahan. In 1622, Shah Jahan sent Raja Vikramjit, the Governor of Gujarat, to subdue the Kolis of Ahmedabad. Between 1632 and 1635, four viceroys were appointed in an effort to manage the Koli's activities. The Kolis of Kankrej in North Gujarat committed excesses, and the Jam of Nawanagar refused to pay tribute to Shah Jahan. Soon, \u00c1zam Kh\u00e1n was appointed in an effort to subdue the Kolis and bring order to the province. \u00c1zam Kh\u00e1n marched against Koli rebels. When \u00c1zam Kh\u00e1n reached Sidhpur, the local merchants complained bitterly of the outrages of one K\u00e1nji, a Chunvalia Koli, who had been especially daring in plundering merchandise and committing highway robberies. \u00c1zam Kh\u00e1n, anxious to start with a show of vigour before proceeding to \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, marched against K\u00e1nji, who fled to the village of Bh\u00e1dar near Kheralu, sixty miles north-east of \u00c1hmed\u00e1b\u00e1d. \u00c1zam Kh\u00e1n pursued him so hotly that K\u00e1nji surrendered, handed over his plunder, and guaranteed that he would not only cease to commit robberies but also pay an annual tribute of Rupees 10,000. \u00c1zam Kh\u00e1n then built two fortified posts in the Koli's territory, naming one \u00c1zam\u00e1b\u00e1d after himself, and the other Khal\u00edl\u00e1b\u00e1d after his son. Additionally, he forced the surrender of the Jam of Nawanagar. The next viceroy, \u00cdsa Tarkh\u00e1n, carried out financial reforms. In 1644, the Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed as the viceroy, who then proceeded to become engaged in religious disputes, such as the destruction of a Jain temple in Ahmedabad. Due to these disputes, he was replaced by Shaista Khan who failed to subdue Kolis. Subsequently, prince Murad Bakhsh was appointed as the viceroy in 1654. He restored order and defeated the Koli rebels.\nIllness and death.\nWhen Shah Jahan became ill in 1658, Dara Shikoh (Mumtaz Mahal's eldest son) assumed the role of regent in his father's stead, which swiftly incurred the animosity of his brothers. Upon learning of his assumption of the regency, his younger brothers, Shuja, Viceroy of Bengal, and Murad Baksh, Viceroy of Gujarat, declared their independence and marched upon Agra in order to claim their riches. Aurangzeb, the third son, gathered a well-trained army and became its chief commander. He faced Dara's army near Agra and defeated him during the Battle of Samugarh. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and put him under house arrest in Agra Fort.\nJahanara Begum Sahib, Mumtaz Mahal's eldest surviving daughter, voluntarily shared his 8-year confinement and nursed him in his dotage. In January 1666, Shah Jahan fell ill. Confined to bed, he became progressively weaker until, on 22 January, he commended the ladies of the imperial court, particularly his consort of later years Akbarabadi Mahal, to the care of Jahanara. After reciting the \"Kal'ma\" (\"Laa ilaaha ill allah\") and verses from the Quran, Shah Jahan died, aged 74.\nShah Jahan's chaplain Sayyid Muhammad Qanauji and Kazi Qurban of Agra came to the fort, moved his body to a nearby hall, washed it, enshrouded it, and put it in a coffin of sandalwood.\nPrincess Jahanara had planned a state funeral, which was to include a procession with Shah Jahan's body carried by eminent nobles followed by the notable citizens of Agra and officials scattering coins for the poor and needy. Aurangzeb refused to accommodate such ostentation. The body was taken to the Taj Mahal and was interred there next to the body of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.\nContributions to architecture.\nShah Jahan left behind a grand legacy of structures constructed during his reign. He was one of the greatest patrons of Mughal architecture. His reign ushered in the golden age of Mughal architecture. His most famous building was the Taj Mahal, which he built out of love for his wife, the empress Mumtaz Mahal. His relationship with Mumtaz Mahal has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature and cinema. Shah Jahan personally owned the royal treasury, and several precious stones, such as the Kohinoor.\nIts structure was drawn with great care, and architects from all over the world were called for this purpose. The building took twenty years to complete and was constructed from white marble underlaid with brick. Upon his death, his son Aurangzeb had him interred in it next to Mumtaz Mahal. Among other constructions from his reign are the Red Fort, also called the \"Delhi Fort\" or \"Lal Qila\" in Urdu, large sections of Agra Fort, the Jama Masjid, the Wazir Khan Mosque, the Moti Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens, sections of the Lahore Fort, the Mahabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar, the Mini Qutub Minar in Hastsal, the Jahangir mausoleum\u00a0\u2013 his father's tomb, the construction of which was overseen by his stepmother Nur Jahan and the Shahjahan Mosque. He also had the Peacock Throne, Takht e Taus, made to celebrate his rule. Shah Jahan also placed profound verses of the Quran on his masterpieces of architecture.\nThe Shah Jahan Mosque in Thatta, Sindh province of Pakistan (100\u00a0km / 60 miles from Karachi) was built during the reign of Shah Jahan in 1647. The mosque is built with red bricks with blue coloured glaze tiles, probably imported from another Sindh's town of Hala. The mosque has overall 93 domes, and it is the world's largest mosque having such a number of domes. It has been built keeping acoustics in mind. A person speaking inside one end of the dome can be heard at the other end when the speech exceeds 100 decibels. It has been on the tentative UNESCO World Heritage List since 1993.\nCoins.\nShah Jahan continued striking coins in three metals: gold (mohur), silver (rupee) and copper (dam). His pre-accession coins bear the name Khurram.\nInscriptions.\nThe inscription from Makrana, Nagaur District, dating back to 1651 AD, mentions Mirza Ali Baig, who was likely a local governor under Shah Jahan's rule. It describes a notice he posted on a step-well, prohibiting low-caste individuals from using the well alongside higher-caste people.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28754", "revid": "38001712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28754", "title": "Saul Bellow", "text": "American writer (1915\u20132005)\nSaul Bellow (born Solomon Bellows; June 10, 1915\u00a0\u2013 April 5, 2005) was a Canadian-American writer. For his literary work, Bellow was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the 1976 Nobel Prize in Literature, and the National Medal of Arts. He is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times, and he received the National Book Foundation's lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990.\nIn the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee, his writing exhibited \"the mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age.\" His best-known works include \"The Adventures of Augie March,\" \"Henderson the Rain King\", \"Herzog\", \"Mr. Sammler's Planet\", \"Seize the Day\", \"Humboldt's Gift\", and \"Ravelstein\".\nBellow said that of all his characters, Eugene Henderson, of \"Henderson the Rain King\", was the one most like himself. Bellow grew up as an immigrant from Quebec. As Christopher Hitchens describes it, Bellow's fiction and principal characters reflect his own yearning for transcendence, a battle \"to overcome not just ghetto conditions but also ghetto psychoses.\" Bellow's protagonists wrestle with what Albert Corde, the dean in \"The Dean's December\", called \"the big-scale insanities of the 20th century.\" This transcendence of the \"unutterably dismal\" (a phrase from \"Dangling Man\") is achieved, if it can be achieved at all, through a \"ferocious assimilation of learning\" (Hitchens) and an emphasis on nobility.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nSaul Bellow was born Solomon Bellows in Lachine, Quebec, two years after his parents, Lescha (n\u00e9e Gordin) and Abraham Bellows, emigrated from Saint Petersburg, Russia. He had three elder siblings - sister Zelda (later Jane, born in 1907), brothers Moishe (later Maurice, born in 1908) and Schmuel (later Samuel, born in 1911). Bellow's family was Lithuanian-Jewish; his father was born in Vilnius. Bellow celebrated his birthday on June 10, although he appears to have been born on July 10, according to records from the Jewish Genealogical Society-Montreal. (In the Jewish community, it was customary to record the Hebrew date of birth, which does not always coincide with the Gregorian calendar.) Of his family's emigration, Bellow wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The retrospective was strong in me because of my parents. They were both full of the notion that they were falling, falling. They had been prosperous cosmopolitans in Saint Petersburg. My mother could never stop talking about the family dacha, her privileged life, and how all that was now gone. She was working in the kitchen. Cooking, washing, mending ... There had been servants in Russia ... But you could always transpose from your humiliating condition with the help of a sort of embittered irony.\nA period of illness from a respiratory infection at age eight both taught him self-reliance (he was a very fit man despite his sedentary occupation) and provided an opportunity to satisfy his hunger for reading: reportedly, he decided to be a writer when he first read Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"\nWhen Bellow was nine, his family moved to the Humboldt Park neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, the city that formed the backdrop of many of his novels. Bellow's father, Abraham, had become an onion importer. He also worked in a bakery, as a coal delivery man, and as a bootlegger. Bellow's mother, Liza, died when he was 17. She had been deeply religious and wanted her youngest son, Saul, to become a rabbi or a concert violinist. But he rebelled against what he later called the \"suffocating orthodoxy\" of his religious upbringing, and he began writing at a young age. Bellow's lifelong love for the Torah began at four when he learned Hebrew. Bellow also grew up reading Shakespeare and the great Russian novelists of the 19th century.\nIn Chicago, he took part in anthroposophical studies at the Anthroposophical Society of Chicago. Bellow attended Tuley High School on Chicago's west side where he befriended Yetta Barsh and Isaac Rosenfeld. In his 1959 novel \"Henderson the Rain King\", Bellow modeled the character King Dahfu on Rosenfeld.\nEducation and early career.\nBellow attended the University of Chicago but later transferred to Northwestern University. He originally wanted to study literature, but he felt the English department was anti-Jewish. Instead, he graduated with honors in anthropology and sociology. It has been suggested Bellow's study of anthropology had an influence on his literary style, and anthropological references pepper his works. He later did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin.\nParaphrasing Bellow's description of his close friend Allan Bloom (see \"Ravelstein\"), John Podhoretz has said that both Bellow and Bloom \"inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air.\"\nIn the 1930s, Bellow was part of the Chicago branch of the Federal Writers' Project, which included such future Chicago literary luminaries as Richard Wright and Nelson Algren. Many of the writers were radical: if they were not members of the Communist Party USA, they were sympathetic to the cause. Bellow was a Trotskyist, but because of the greater numbers of Stalinist-leaning writers, he had to suffer their taunts.\nIn 1941, Bellow became a naturalized United States citizen, after discovering, on attempting to enlist in the armed forces, that he had immigrated to the United States illegally as a child.\nIn 1943, Maxim Lieber was his literary agent.\nDuring World War II, Bellow joined the merchant marine and during his service he completed his first novel, \"Dangling Man\" (1944) about a young Chicago man waiting to be drafted for the war.\nFrom 1946 through 1948 Bellow taught at the University of Minnesota. In the fall of 1947, following a tour to promote his novel \"The Victim\", he moved into a large old house at 58 Orlin Avenue SE in the Prospect Park neighborhood of Minneapolis.\nIn 1948, Bellow was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship that allowed him to move to Paris, where he began writing \"The Adventures of Augie March\" (1953). Critics have remarked on the resemblance between Bellow's picaresque novel and the great 17th-century Spanish classic \"Don Quixote\". The book starts with one of American literature's most famous opening paragraphs, and it follows its titular character through a series of careers and encounters, as he lives by his wits and his resolve. Written in a colloquial yet philosophical style, \"The Adventures of Augie March\" established Bellow's reputation as a major author.\nIn 1953, Bellow translated Gimpel the Fool by Isaac Bashevis Singer from Yiddish into English.\nIn 1958, Bellow once again taught at the University of Minnesota. During this time, he and his wife Sasha received psychoanalysis from University of Minnesota Psychology Professor Paul Meehl.\nIn the spring term of 1961 he taught creative writing at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras.\nOne of his students was William Kennedy, who was encouraged by Bellow to write fiction.\nReturn to Chicago and mid-career.\nBellow lived in New York City for years, but returned to Chicago in 1962 as a professor at the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. The committee's goal was to have professors work closely with talented graduate students on a multi-disciplinary approach to learning. His students included the poet, Tom Mandel. Bellow taught on the committee for more than 30 years, alongside his close friend, the philosopher Allan Bloom.\nThere were also other reasons for Bellow's return to Chicago, where he moved into the Hyde Park neighborhood with his third wife, Susan Glassman. Bellow found Chicago vulgar but vital, and more representative of America than New York. He was able to stay in contact with old high school friends and a broad cross-section of society. In a 1982 profile, Bellow's neighborhood was described as a high-crime area in the city's center, and Bellow maintained he had to live in such a place as a writer and \"stick to his guns.\"\nBellow hit the bestseller list in 1964 with his novel \"Herzog\". Bellow was surprised at the commercial success of this cerebral novel about a middle-aged and troubled college professor who writes letters to friends, scholars and the dead, but never sends them. Bellow returned to his exploration of mental instability, and its relationship to genius, in his 1975 novel \"Humboldt's Gift\". Bellow used his late friend and rival, the brilliant but self-destructive poet Delmore Schwartz, as his model for the novel's title character, Von Humboldt Fleisher. Bellow also used Rudolf Steiner's spiritual science, anthroposophy, as a theme in the book, having attended a study group in Chicago. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969.\nNobel Prize and later career.\nPropelled by the success of \"Humboldt's Gift\", Bellow won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1976. In the 70-minute address he gave to an audience in Stockholm, Sweden, Bellow called on writers to be beacons for civilization and awaken it from intellectual torpor.\nThe following year, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Bellow for the Jefferson Lecture, the US federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. Bellow's lecture was entitled \"The Writer and His Country Look Each Other Over.\"\nFrom December 1981 to March 1982, Bellow was the Visiting Lansdowne Scholar at the University of Victoria (BC), and also held the title Writer-in-Residence. In 1998, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.\nBellow traveled widely throughout his life, mainly to Europe, which he sometimes visited twice a year. As a young man, Bellow went to Mexico City to meet Leon Trotsky, but the expatriate Russian revolutionary was assassinated the day before they were to meet. Bellow's social contacts were wide and varied. He tagged along with Robert F. Kennedy for a magazine profile he never wrote, and was close friends with the author Ralph Ellison. His many friends included the journalist Sydney J. Harris and the poet John Berryman.\nWhile sales of Bellow's first few novels were modest, that turned around with \"Herzog\". Bellow continued teaching well into his old age, enjoying its human interaction and exchange of ideas. He taught at Yale University, University of Minnesota, New York University, Princeton University, University of Puerto Rico, University of Chicago, Bard College and Boston University, where he co-taught a class with James Wood ('modestly absenting himself' when it was time to discuss \"Seize the Day\"). In order to take up his appointment at Boston, Bellow moved from Chicago to Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1993; he died there on April 5, 2005, at age 89. He is buried at the Jewish cemetery Shir HeHarim of Brattleboro, Vermont.\nWhile he read voluminously, Bellow also played the violin and followed sports. Work was a constant for him, but he at times toiled at a plodding pace on his novels, frustrating the publishing company.\nHis early works earned him the reputation as a major novelist of the 20th century, and by his death he was widely regarded as one of the greatest living novelists. He was the first writer to win three National Book Awards in all award categories. His friend and protege Philip Roth has said of him, \"The backbone of 20th-century American literature has been provided by two novelists\u2014William Faulkner and Saul Bellow. Together they are the Melville, Hawthorne, and Twain of the 20th century.\" James Wood, in a eulogy of Bellow in \"The New Republic\", wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I judged all modern prose by his. Unfair, certainly, because he made even the fleet-footed\u2014the Updikes, the DeLillos, the Roths\u2014seem like monopodes. Yet what else could I do? I discovered Saul Bellow's prose in my late teens, and henceforth, the relationship had the quality of a love affair about which one could not keep silent. Over the last week, much has been said about Bellow's prose, and most of the praise\u2014perhaps because it has been overwhelmingly by men\u2014has tended toward the robust: We hear about Bellow's mixing of high and low registers, his Melvillean cadences jostling the jivey Yiddish rhythms, the great teeming democracy of the big novels, the crooks and frauds and intellectuals who loudly people the brilliant sensorium of the fiction. All of this is true enough; John Cheever, in his journals, lamented that, alongside Bellow's fiction, his stories seemed like mere suburban splinters. Ian McEwan wisely suggested last week that British writers and critics may have been attracted to Bellow precisely because he kept alive a Dickensian amplitude now lacking in the English novel. ... But nobody mentioned the beauty of this writing, its music, its high lyricism, its firm but luxurious pleasure in language itself. ... [I]n truth, I could not thank him enough when he was alive, and I cannot now.\nPersonal life.\nBellow was married five times, with all but his last marriage ending in divorce. Bellow's wives were Anita Goshkin, Alexandra (Sondra) Tschacbasov (daughter of painter Nahum Tschacbasov), Susan Glassman, Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea, and Janis Freedman.\nHis son Greg by his first marriage became a psychotherapist; he published \"Saul Bellow's Heart: A Son's Memoir\" in 2013, nearly a decade after his father's death. Bellow's son by his second marriage, Adam, published a nonfiction book \"In Praise of Nepotism\" in 2003. Bellow's son by his third marriage, Daniel, is a potter, a writer and a former journalist. In 1999, when he was 84, Bellow had his fourth child and first daughter, with Freedman.\nHe was a patron of Woodlawn Tap, a Hyde Park tavern popular among writers and academics.\nThemes and style.\nBellow's themes include the disorientation of contemporary society, and the ability of people to overcome their frailty and achieve greatness or awareness. Bellow saw many flaws in modern civilization, and its ability to foster madness, materialism and misleading knowledge. Principal characters in Bellow's fiction have heroic potential, and many times they stand in contrast to the negative forces of society. Often these characters are Jewish and have a sense of alienation or otherness.\nJewish life and identity is a major theme in Bellow's work, although he bristled at being called a \"Jewish writer\". Bellow's work also shows a great appreciation of America, and a fascination with the uniqueness and vibrancy of the American experience.\nBellow's work abounds in references and quotes from Marcel Proust and Henry James, among others, but he offsets these high-culture references with jokes. Bellow interspersed autobiographical elements into his fiction, and many of his principal characters were said to bear a resemblance to him.\nAssessment.\nMartin Amis described Bellow as \"The greatest American author ever, in my view\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His sentences seem to weigh more than anyone else's. He is like a force of nature ... He breaks all the rules ... [T]he people in Bellow's fiction are real people, yet the intensity of the gaze that he bathes them in, somehow through the particular, opens up into the universal.\nFor Linda Grant, \"What Bellow had to tell us in his fiction was that it was worth it, being alive.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His vigour, vitality, humour and passion were always matched by the insistence on thought, not the predigested cliches of the mass media or of those on the left, which had begun to disgust him by the Sixties ... It's easy to be a 'writer of conscience'\u2014anyone can do it if they want to; just choose your cause. Bellow was a writer about conscience and consciousness, forever conflicted by the competing demands of the great cities, the individual's urge to survival against all odds and his equal need for love and some kind of penetrating understanding of what there was of significance beyond all the racket and racketeering.\nOn the other hand, Bellow's detractors considered his work conventional and old-fashioned, as if the author were trying to revive the 19th-century European novel. In a private letter, Vladimir Nabokov described Bellow as a \"miserable mediocrity\". Journalist and author Ron Rosenbaum described Bellow's \"Ravelstein\" (2000) as the only book that rose above Bellow's failings as an author. Rosenbaum wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My problem with the pre-\"Ravelstein\" Bellow is that he all too often strains too hard to yoke together two somewhat contradictory aspects of his being and style. There's the street-wise Windy City wiseguy and then\u2014as if to show off that the wiseguy has Wisdom\u2014there are the undigested chunks of arcane, not entirely impressive, philosophic thought and speculation. Just to make sure you know his novels have intellectual heft. That the world and the flesh in his prose are both figured and transfigured.\nKingsley Amis, father of Martin Amis, was less impressed by Bellow. In 1971, Kingsley suggested that crime writer John D. MacDonald \"is by any standards a better writer than Saul Bellow\".\nSam Tanenhaus wrote in \"The New York Times Book Review\" in 2007:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But what, then, of the many defects\u2014the longueurs and digressions, the lectures on anthroposophy and religion, the arcane reading lists? What of the characters who don't change or grow but simply bristle onto the page, even the colorful lowlifes pontificating like fevered students in the seminars Bellow taught at the University of Chicago? And what of the punitively caricatured ex-wives drawn from the teeming annals of the novelist's own marital discord?\nBut Tanenhaus went on to answer his question:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Shortcomings, to be sure. But so what? Nature doesn't owe us perfection. Novelists don't either. Who among us would even recognize perfection if we saw it? In any event, applying critical methods, of whatever sort, seemed futile in the case of an author who, as Randall Jarrell once wrote of Walt Whitman, 'is a world, a waste with, here and there, systems blazing at random out of the darkness'\u2014those systems 'as beautifully and astonishingly organized as the rings and satellites of Saturn.' \nV. S. Pritchett praised Bellow, finding his shorter works to be his best. Pritchett called Bellow's novella \"Seize the Day\" a \"small gray masterpiece.\"\nPolitical views.\nAs he grew older, Bellow moved decidedly away from leftist politics and became identified with cultural conservatism. His opponents included feminism, campus activism and postmodernism. Bellow also thrust himself into the often contentious realm of African American\u2013Jewish relations. Bellow was critical of multiculturalism and according to Alfred Kazin once said: \"Who is the Tolstoy of the Zulus? The Proust of the Papuans? I'd be glad to read him.\" Bellow distanced himself somewhat from these remarks, which he characterized as \"off the cuff obviously and pedantic certainly.\" He, however, stood by his criticism of multiculturalism, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In any reasonably open society, the absurdity of a petty thought-police campaign provoked by the inane magnification of \"discriminatory\" remarks about the Papuans and the Zulus would be laughed at. To be serious in this fanatical style is a sort of Stalinism \u2013 the Stalinist seriousness and fidelity to the party line that senior citizens like me remember all too well.\nDespite his identification with Chicago, he kept aloof from some of that city's more conventional writers. In a 2006 interview with \"Stop Smiling\" magazine, Studs Terkel said of Bellow: \"I didn't know him too well. We disagreed on a number of things politically. In the protests in the beginning of Norman Mailer's \"Armies of the Night\", when Mailer, Robert Lowell and Paul Goodman were marching to protest the Vietnam War, Bellow was invited to a sort of counter-gathering. He said, 'Of course I'll attend'. But he made a big thing of it. Instead of just saying OK, he was proud of it. So I wrote him a letter and he didn't like it. He wrote me a letter back. He called me a Stalinist. But otherwise, we were friendly. He was a brilliant writer, of course. I love \"Seize the Day\".\"\nAttempts to name a street after Bellow in his Hyde Park neighborhood were halted by a local alderman, Toni Preckwinkle, on the grounds that Bellow had made remarks about the neighborhood's inhabitants that they considered racist. A one-block stretch of West Augusta Boulevard in Humboldt Park was named Saul Bellow Way in his honor instead.\nBellow was a supporter of U.S. English, an organization formed in the early 1980s by John Tanton and former Senator S.\u00a0I. Hayakawa, that supports making English the official language of the United States, but ended his association with the group in 1988.\nAwards and honors.\nBellow is represented in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery with six portraits, including a photograph by Irving Penn, a painting by Sarah Yuster, a bust by Sara Miller, and drawings by Edward Sorel and Arthur Herschel Lidov. A copy of the Miller bust was installed at the Harold Washington Library Center in 1993.\nBellow's papers are held at the library of the University of Chicago.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28756", "revid": "1318489278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28756", "title": "Stereochemistry", "text": "Subdiscipline of chemistry\nStereochemistry, a subdiscipline of chemistry, studies the spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation. The study of stereochemistry focuses on the relationships between stereoisomers, which are defined as having the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution) but differing in the geometric positioning of the atoms in space. For this reason, it is also known as 3D chemistry\u2014the prefix \"stereo-\" means \"three-dimensionality\". Stereochemistry applies to all kinds of compounds and ions, organic and inorganic species alike. Stereochemistry affects biological, physical, and supramolecular chemistry. \nStereochemistry also studies the reactivity of the molecules in question (dynamic stereochemistry).\nCahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecule's stereochemistry. They rank the atoms around a stereocenter in a standard way, allowing unambiguous descriptions of their relative positions in the molecule. A Fischer projection is a simplified way to depict the stereochemistry around a stereocenter.\nThalidomide example.\nStereochemistry has important applications in the field of medicine, particularly pharmaceuticals. An often cited example of the importance of stereochemistry relates to the thalidomide disaster. Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical drug, first prepared in 1957 in Germany, prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. The drug was discovered to be teratogenic, causing serious genetic damage to early embryonic growth and development, leading to limb deformation in babies. Several proposed mechanisms of teratogenicity involve different biological functions for the (R)- and (S)-thalidomide enantiomers. In the human body, however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism. Accordingly, it is incorrect to state that one stereoisomer is safe while the other is teratogenic. Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy. Strict regulations and controls have been implemented to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformities. This disaster was a driving force behind requiring strict testing of drugs before making them available to the public.\nIn yet another example, the drug ibuprofen can exist as (R)- and (S)-isomers. Only the (S)-ibuprofen is active in reducing inflammation and pain.\nDiastereomers.\nIsomers are of two types: diastereomers (also called diastereoisomers) and enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Diastereomers are all other types of isomers.\nEpimers.\nEpimers are a subcategory of diastereomers that differ in absolute configuration configurations at only one corresponding stereocenter. They are commonly found in sugar chemistry, where two sugars can differ by the configuration of a single carbon atom. D-glucose and D-galactose are epimers, differing only at the C-4 position in their structure. (see sugar numbering)\nCis-Trans isomers.\nCis-Trans isomers are often associated alkene double bonds.\nThe more general \"E\"/\"Z\" nomenclature refers to the concept of \"cis\"/\"trans\" isomerism, and is especially useful for more complex compounds.\nAtropisomers.\nAtropisomerism are another kind of diasteromer. They exist because of the inability to rotate about a bond, such as due to steric hindrance between functional groups on two sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. Usually atropisomers are chiral, and as such they are a form of axial chirality. Atropisomerism can be described as conformational isomerism\nHistory.\nIn 1815, Jean-Baptiste Biot's observation of optical activity marked the beginning of organic stereochemistry history. He observed that organic molecules were able to rotate the plane of polarized light in a solution or in the gaseous phase. Despite Biot's discoveries, Louis Pasteur is commonly described as the first stereochemist, having observed in 1842 that salts of tartaric acid collected from wine production vessels could rotate the plane of polarized light, but that salts from other sources did not. This was the only physical property that differed between the two types of tartrate salts, which is due to optical isomerism. In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Le Bel explained optical activity in terms of the tetrahedral arrangement of the atoms bound to carbon. Kekul\u00e9 explored tetrahedral models earlier, in 1862, but never published his work; Emanuele Patern\u00f2 probably knew of these but was the first to draw and discuss three dimensional structures, such as of 1,2-dibromoethane in the \"Giornale di Scienze Naturali ed Economiche\" in 1869. The term \"chiral\" was introduced by Lord Kelvin in 1904. Arthur Robertson Cushny, a Scottish Pharmacologist, first provided a clear example in 1908 of a bioactivity difference between enantiomers of a chiral molecule viz. (\u2212)-Adrenaline is two times more potent than the (\u00b1)- form as a vasoconstrictor and in 1926 laid the foundation for chiral pharmacology/stereo-pharmacology (biological relations of optically isomeric substances). Later in 1966, the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog nomenclature or Sequence rule was devised to assign absolute configuration to stereogenic/chiral center (R- and S- notation) and extended to be applied across olefinic bonds (E- and Z- notation).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Spacetime diagrams are useful in visualizing and understanding relativistic effects, such as how different observers perceive \"where\" and \"when\" events occur.\nUntil the turn of the 20th century, the assumption had been that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its description in terms of locations, shapes, distances, and directions) was distinct from time (the measurement of when events occur within the universe). However, space and time took on new meanings with the Lorentz transformation and special theory of relativity.\nIn 1908, Hermann Minkowski presented a geometric interpretation of special relativity that fused time and the three spatial dimensions into a single four-dimensional continuum now known as Minkowski space. This interpretation proved vital to the general theory of relativity, wherein spacetime is curved by mass and energy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFundamentals.\nDefinitions.\nNon-relativistic classical mechanics treats time as a universal quantity of measurement that is uniform throughout, is separate from space, and is agreed on by all observers. Classical mechanics assumes that time has a constant rate of passage, independent of the observer's state of motion, or anything external. It assumes that space is Euclidean: it assumes that space follows the geometry of common sense.\nIn the context of special relativity, time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space, because the observed rate at which time passes for an object depends on the object's velocity relative to the observer. General relativity provides an explanation of how gravitational fields can slow the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field.\nIn ordinary space, a position is specified by three numbers, known as dimensions. In the Cartesian coordinate system, these are often called \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\". A point in spacetime is called an \"event\", and requires four numbers to be specified: the three-dimensional location in space, plus the position in time (Fig.\u00a01). An event is represented by a set of coordinates \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" and \"t\". Spacetime is thus four-dimensional.\nUnlike the analogies used in popular writings to explain events, such as firecrackers or sparks, mathematical events have zero duration and represent a single point in spacetime. Although it is possible to be in motion relative to the popping of a firecracker or a spark, it is not possible for an observer to be in motion relative to an event.\nThe path of a particle through spacetime can be considered to be a sequence of events. The series of events can be linked together to form a curve that represents the particle's progress through spacetime. That path is called the particle's \"world line\".\nMathematically, spacetime is a \"manifold\", which is to say, it appears locally \"flat\" near each point in the same way that, at small enough scales, the surface of a globe appears to be flat. A scale factor, formula_1 (conventionally called the \"speed-of-light\") relates distances measured in space to distances measured in time. The magnitude of this scale factor (nearly in space being equivalent to one second in time), along with the fact that spacetime is a manifold, implies that at ordinary, non-relativistic speeds and at ordinary, human-scale distances, there is little that humans might observe that is noticeably different from what they might observe if the world were Euclidean. It was only with the advent of sensitive scientific measurements in the mid-1800s, such as the Fizeau experiment and the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment, that puzzling discrepancies began to be noted between observation versus predictions based on the implicit assumption of Euclidean space.\nIn special relativity, an observer will, in most cases, mean a frame of reference from which a set of objects or events is being measured. This usage differs significantly from the ordinary English meaning of the term. Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, and according to this usage of the term, it does not make sense to speak of an observer as having a location.\nIn Fig.\u00a01-1, imagine that the frame under consideration is equipped with a dense lattice of clocks, synchronized within this reference frame, that extends indefinitely throughout the three dimensions of space. Any specific location within the lattice is not important. The latticework of clocks is used to determine the time and position of events taking place within the whole frame. The term \"observer\" refers to the whole ensemble of clocks associated with one inertial frame of reference.\nIn this idealized case, every point in space has a clock associated with it, and thus the clocks register each event instantly, with no time delay between an event and its recording. A real observer will see a delay between the emission of a signal and its detection due to the speed of light. To synchronize the clocks, in the data reduction following an experiment, the time when a signal is received will be corrected to reflect its actual time were it to have been recorded by an idealized lattice of clocks.\nIn many books on special relativity, especially older ones, the word \"observer\" is used in the more ordinary sense of the word. It is usually clear from context which meaning has been adopted.\nPhysicists distinguish between what one \"measures\" or \"observes\", after one has factored out signal propagation delays, versus what one visually sees without such corrections. Failing to understand the difference between what one measures and what one sees is the source of much confusion among students of relativity.\nHistory.\nBy the mid-1800s, various experiments such as the observation of the Arago spot and differential measurements of the speed of light in air versus water were considered to have proven the wave nature of light as opposed to a corpuscular theory. Propagation of waves was then assumed to require the existence of a \"waving\" medium; in the case of light waves, this was considered to be a hypothetical luminiferous aether. The various attempts to establish the properties of this hypothetical medium yielded contradictory results. For example, the Fizeau experiment of 1851, conducted by French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau, demonstrated that the speed of light in flowing water was less than the sum of the speed of light in air plus the speed of the water by an amount dependent on the water's index of refraction.\nAmong other issues, the dependence of the partial aether-dragging implied by this experiment on the index of refraction (which is dependent on wavelength) led to the unpalatable conclusion that aether \"simultaneously\" flows at different speeds for different colors of light. The Michelson\u2013Morley experiment of 1887 (Fig.\u00a01-2) showed no differential influence of Earth's motions through the hypothetical aether on the speed of light, and the most likely explanation, complete aether dragging, was in conflict with the observation of stellar aberration.\nGeorge Francis FitzGerald in 1889, and Hendrik Lorentz in 1892, independently proposed that material bodies traveling through the fixed aether were physically affected by their passage, contracting in the direction of motion by an amount that was exactly what was necessary to explain the negative results of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment. No length changes occur in directions transverse to the direction of motion.\nBy 1904, Lorentz had expanded his theory such that he had arrived at equations formally identical with those that Einstein was to derive later, i.e. the Lorentz transformation. As a theory of dynamics (the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion), his theory assumed actual physical deformations of the physical constituents of matter. Lorentz's equations predicted a quantity that he called \"local time\", with which he could explain the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and other phenomena.\nHenri Poincar\u00e9 was the first to combine space and time into spacetime. He argued in 1898 that the simultaneity of two events is a matter of convention. In 1900, he recognized that Lorentz's \"local time\" is actually what is indicated by moving clocks by applying an explicitly \"operational definition\" of clock synchronization assuming constant light speed. In 1900 and 1904, he suggested the inherent undetectability of the aether by emphasizing the validity of what he called the principle of relativity. In 1905/1906 he mathematically perfected Lorentz's theory of electrons in order to bring it into accordance with the postulate of relativity.\nWhile discussing various hypotheses on Lorentz invariant gravitation, he introduced the innovative concept of a 4-dimensional spacetime by defining various four-vectors, namely four-position, four-velocity, and four-force. He did not pursue the 4-dimensional formalism in subsequent papers, however, stating that this line of research seemed to \"entail great pain for limited profit\", ultimately concluding \"that three-dimensional language seems the best suited to the description of our world\". Even as late as 1909, Poincar\u00e9 continued to describe the dynamical interpretation of the Lorentz transform.\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein analyzed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies without reference to forces) rather than dynamics. His results were mathematically equivalent to those of Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9. He obtained them by recognizing that the entire theory can be built upon two postulates: the principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of light speed. His work was filled with vivid imagery involving the exchange of light signals between clocks in motion, careful measurements of the lengths of moving rods, and other such examples.\nEinstein in 1905 superseded previous attempts of an electromagnetic mass\u2013energy relation by introducing the general equivalence of mass and energy, which was instrumental for his subsequent formulation of the equivalence principle in 1907, which declares the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass. By using the mass\u2013energy equivalence, Einstein showed that the gravitational mass of a body is proportional to its energy content, which was one of the early results in developing general relativity. While it would appear that he did not at first think geometrically about spacetime, in the further development of general relativity, Einstein fully incorporated the spacetime formalism.\nWhen Einstein published in 1905, another of his competitors, his former mathematics professor Hermann Minkowski, had also arrived at most of the basic elements of special relativity. Max Born recounted a meeting he had made with Minkowski, seeking to be Minkowski's student/collaborator:\nMinkowski had been concerned with the state of electrodynamics after Michelson's disruptive experiments at least since the summer of 1905, when Minkowski and David Hilbert led an advanced seminar attended by notable physicists of the time to study the papers of Lorentz, Poincar\u00e9 et al. Minkowski saw Einstein's work as an extension of Lorentz's, and was most directly influenced by Poincar\u00e9.\nOn 5 November 1907 (a little more than a year before his death), Minkowski introduced his geometric interpretation of spacetime in a lecture to the G\u00f6ttingen Mathematical society with the title, \"The Relativity Principle\" (\"Das Relativit\u00e4tsprinzip\"). On 21 September 1908, Minkowski presented his talk, \"Space and Time\" (\"Raum und Zeit\"), to the German Society of Scientists and Physicians. The opening words of \"Space and Time\" include Minkowski's statement that \"Henceforth, space for itself, and time for itself shall completely reduce to a mere shadow, and only some sort of union of the two shall preserve independence.\" \"Space and Time\" included the first public presentation of spacetime diagrams (Fig.\u00a01-4), and included a remarkable demonstration that the concept of the \"invariant interval\" (discussed below), along with the empirical observation that the speed of light is finite, allows derivation of the entirety of special relativity.\nThe spacetime concept and the Lorentz group are closely connected to certain types of sphere, hyperbolic, or conformal geometries and their transformation groups already developed in the 19th century, in which invariant intervals analogous to the spacetime interval are used.\nEinstein, for his part, was initially dismissive of Minkowski's geometric interpretation of special relativity, regarding it as \"\u00fcberfl\u00fcssige Gelehrsamkeit\" (superfluous learnedness). However, in order to complete his search for general relativity that started in 1907, the geometric interpretation of relativity proved to be vital. In 1916, Einstein fully acknowledged his indebtedness to Minkowski, whose interpretation greatly facilitated the transition to general relativity. Since there are other types of spacetime, such as the curved spacetime of general relativity, the spacetime of special relativity is today known as \"Minkowski spacetime.\"\nSpacetime in special relativity.\n \nSpacetime interval.\nIn three dimensions, the \"distance\" formula_2 between two points can be defined using the Pythagorean theorem:\n formula_3\nAlthough two viewers may measure the \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" position of the two points using different coordinate systems, the distance between the points will be the same for both, assuming that they are measuring using the same units. The distance is \"invariant\".\nIn special relativity, however, the distance between two points is no longer the same if measured by two different observers, when one of the observers is moving, because of Lorentz contraction. The situation is even more complicated if the two points are separated in time as well as in space. For example, if one observer sees two events occur at the same place, but at different times, a person moving with respect to the first observer will see the two events occurring at different places, because the moving point of view sees itself as stationary, and the position of the event as receding or approaching. Thus, a different measure must be used to measure the effective \"distance\" between two events.\nIn four-dimensional spacetime, the analog to distance is the interval. Although time comes in as a fourth dimension, it is treated differently than the spatial dimensions. Minkowski space hence differs in important respects from four-dimensional Euclidean space. The fundamental reason for merging space and time into spacetime is that space and time are separately not invariant, which is to say that, under the proper conditions, different observers will disagree on the length of time between two events (because of time dilation) or the distance between the two events (because of length contraction). Special relativity provides a new invariant, called the spacetime interval, which combines distances in space and in time. All observers who measure the time and distance between any two events will end up computing the same spacetime interval. Suppose an observer measures two events as being separated in time by formula_4 and a spatial distance formula_5 Then the squared spacetime interval formula_6 between the two events that are separated by a distance formula_7 in space and by formula_8 in the formula_9-coordinate is:\n formula_10\nor for three space dimensions,\n formula_11\nThe constant formula_12 the speed of light, converts time formula_13 units (like seconds) into space units (like meters). The squared interval formula_14 is a measure of separation between events A and B that are time separated and in addition space separated either because there are two separate objects undergoing events, or because a single object in space is moving inertially between its events. The separation interval is the difference between the square of the spatial distance separating event B from event A and the square of the spatial distance traveled by a light signal in that same time interval formula_4. If the event separation is due to a light signal, then this difference vanishes and formula_16.\nWhen the event considered is infinitesimally close to each other, then we may write\n formula_17\nIn a different inertial frame, say with coordinates formula_18, the spacetime interval formula_19 can be written in a same form as above. Because of the constancy of speed of light, the light events in all inertial frames belong to zero interval, formula_20. For any other infinitesimal event where formula_21, one can prove that formula_22\nwhich in turn upon integration leads to formula_23. The invariance of the spacetime interval between the same events for all inertial frames of reference is one of the fundamental results of special theory of relativity.\nAlthough for brevity, one frequently sees interval expressions expressed without deltas, including in most of the following discussion, it should be understood that in general, formula_24 means formula_7, etc. We are always concerned with \"differences\" of spatial or temporal coordinate values belonging to two events, and since there is no preferred origin, single coordinate values have no essential meaning.\nThe equation above is similar to the Pythagorean theorem, except with a minus sign between the formula_26 and the formula_27 terms. The spacetime interval is the quantity formula_28 not formula_29 itself. The reason is that unlike distances in Euclidean geometry, intervals in Minkowski spacetime can be negative. Rather than deal with square roots of negative numbers, physicists customarily regard formula_30 as a distinct symbol in itself, rather than the square of something.\n Note: There are two sign conventions in use in the relativity literature:\n formula_31\n and\n formula_32\n These sign conventions are associated with the metric signatures (+\u2212\u2212\u2212) and (\u2212+++). A minor variation is to place the time coordinate last rather than first. Both conventions are widely used within the field of study.\n In the following discussion, we use the first convention.\nIn general formula_30 can assume any real number value. If formula_30 is positive, the spacetime interval is referred to as timelike. Since spatial distance traversed by any massive object is always less than distance traveled by the light for the same time interval, positive intervals are always timelike. If formula_30 is negative, the spacetime interval is said to be spacelike. Spacetime intervals are equal to zero when formula_36 In other words, the spacetime interval between two events on the world line of something moving at the speed of light is zero. Such an interval is termed lightlike or null. A photon arriving in our eye from a distant star will not have aged, despite having (from our perspective) spent years in its passage.\nA spacetime diagram is typically drawn with only a single space and a single time coordinate. Fig.\u00a02-1 presents a spacetime diagram illustrating the world lines (i.e. paths in spacetime) of two photons, A and B, originating from the same event and going in opposite directions. In addition, C illustrates the world line of a slower-than-light-speed object. The vertical time coordinate is scaled by formula_1 so that it has the same units (meters) as the horizontal space coordinate. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their world lines have a slope of \u00b11. In other words, every meter that a photon travels to the left or right requires approximately 3.3 nanoseconds of time.\nReference frames.\nTo gain insight in how spacetime coordinates measured by observers in different reference frames compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup with frames in a \"standard configuration.\" With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig.\u00a02-2, two Galilean reference frames (i.e. conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion. Frame S belongs to a first observer O, and frame S\u2032 (pronounced \"S\u00a0prime\") belongs to a second observer O\u2032.\nFig.\u00a02-3a redraws Fig.\u00a02-2 in a different orientation. Fig.\u00a02-3b illustrates a \"relativistic\" spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O. Since S and S\u2032 are in standard configuration, their origins coincide at times \"t\" = 0 in frame S and \"t\"\u2032 = 0 in frame S\u2032. The ct\u2032 axis passes through the events in frame S\u2032 which have \"x\"\u2032 = 0. But the points with \"x\"\u2032 = 0 are moving in the \"x\"-direction of frame S with velocity \"v\", so that they are not coincident with the \"ct\" axis at any time other than zero. Therefore, the ct\u2032 axis is tilted with respect to the \"ct\" axis by an angle \"\u03b8\" given by\n formula_38\nThe \"x\"\u2032 axis is also tilted with respect to the \"x\" axis. To determine the angle of this tilt, we recall that the slope of the world line of a light pulse is always\u00a0\u00b11. Fig.\u00a02-3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O\u2032. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at \"x\"\u2032 = 0, \"ct\"\u2032 = \u2212\"a\". The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated at distance \"a\" from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at \"x\"\u2032 = 0, \"ct\"\u2032 = \"a\" (event R).\nThe same events P, Q, R are plotted in Fig.\u00a02-3b in the frame of observer O. The light paths have slopes = 1 and\u00a0\u22121, so that \u25b3PQR forms a right triangle with PQ and QR both at 45 degrees to the \"x\" and \"ct\" axes. Since OP = OQ = OR, the angle between x\u2032 and x must also be \"\u03b8\".\nWhile the rest frame has space and time axes that meet at right angles, the moving frame is drawn with axes that meet at an acute angle. The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a Cartesian plane, and should be considered no stranger than the manner in which, on a Mercator projection of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.\nLight cone.\nIn Fig. 2\u20134, event\u00a0O is at the origin of a spacetime diagram, and the two diagonal lines represent all events that have zero spacetime interval with respect to the origin event. These two lines form what is called the \"light cone\" of the event\u00a0O, since adding a second spatial dimension (Fig.\u00a02-5) makes the appearance that of two right circular cones meeting with their apices at\u00a0O. One cone extends into the future (t&gt;0), the other into the past (t&lt;0).\nA light (double) cone divides spacetime into separate regions with respect to its apex. The interior of the future light cone consists of all events that are separated from the apex by more \"time\" (temporal distance) than necessary to cross their \"spatial distance\" at lightspeed; these events comprise the \"timelike future\" of the event\u00a0O. Likewise, the \"timelike past\" comprises the interior events of the past light cone. So in \"timelike intervals\" \u0394\"ct\" is greater than \u0394\"x\", making timelike intervals positive.\nThe region exterior to the light cone consists of events that are separated from the event\u00a0O by more \"space\" than can be crossed at lightspeed in the given \"time\". These events comprise the so-called \"spacelike\" region of the event\u00a0O, denoted \"Elsewhere\" in Fig.\u00a02-4. Events on the light cone itself are said to be \"lightlike\" (or \"null separated\") from\u00a0O. Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval, all observers will assign the same light cone to any given event, and thus will agree on this division of spacetime.\nThe light cone has an essential role within the concept of causality. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of\u00a0O to the position and time of D (Fig.\u00a02-4). It is hence possible for event\u00a0O to have a causal influence on event\u00a0D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, it is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g.\u00a0B or\u00a0C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either affect event\u00a0O, nor can they be affected by event\u00a0O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between event\u00a0O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.\nRelativity of simultaneity.\nAll observers will agree that for any given event, an event within the given event's future light cone occurs \"after\" the given event. Likewise, for any given event, an event within the given event's past light cone occurs \"before\" the given event. The before\u2013after relationship observed for timelike-separated events remains unchanged no matter what the reference frame of the observer, i.e. no matter how the observer may be moving. The situation is quite different for spacelike-separated events. Fig.\u00a02-4 was drawn from the reference frame of an observer moving at \"v\" = 0. From this reference frame, event\u00a0C is observed to occur after event\u00a0O, and event\u00a0B is observed to occur before event\u00a0O.\nFrom a different reference frame, the orderings of these non-causally-related events can be reversed. In particular, one notes that if two events are simultaneous in a particular reference frame, they are \"necessarily\" separated by a spacelike interval and thus are noncausally related. The observation that simultaneity is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame, is termed the relativity of simultaneity.\nFig. 2-6 illustrates the use of spacetime diagrams in the analysis of the relativity of simultaneity. The events in spacetime are invariant, but the coordinate frames transform as discussed above for Fig.\u00a02-3. The three events (A, B, C) are simultaneous from the reference frame of an observer moving at \"v\" = 0. From the reference frame of an observer moving at \"v\" = 0.3\"c\", the events appear to occur in the order C, B, A. From the reference frame of an observer moving at \"v\" = \u22120.5\"c\", the events appear to occur in the order A, B, C. The white line represents a \"plane of simultaneity\" being moved from the past of the observer to the future of the observer, highlighting events residing on it. The gray area is the light cone of the observer, which remains invariant.\nA spacelike spacetime interval gives the same distance that an observer would measure if the events being measured were simultaneous to the observer. A spacelike spacetime interval hence provides a measure of \"proper distance\", i.e. the true distance = formula_39 Likewise, a timelike spacetime interval gives the same measure of time as would be presented by the cumulative ticking of a clock that moves along a given world line. A timelike spacetime interval hence provides a measure of the \"proper time\" = formula_40\nInvariant hyperbola.\nIn Euclidean space (having spatial dimensions only), the set of points equidistant (using the Euclidean metric) from some point form a circle (in two dimensions) or a sphere (in three dimensions). In (1+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime (having one temporal and one spatial dimension), the points at some constant spacetime interval away from the origin (using the Minkowski metric) form curves given by the two equations\n formula_41\nwith formula_42some positive real constant. These equations describe two families of hyperbolae in an \"x\"\u2013\"ct\" spacetime diagram, which are termed \"invariant hyperbolae\".\nIn Fig.\u00a02-7a, each magenta hyperbola connects all events having some fixed spacelike separation from the origin, while the green hyperbolae connect events of equal timelike separation.\nThe magenta hyperbolae, which cross the \"x\" axis, are timelike curves, which is to say that these hyperbolae represent actual paths that can be traversed by (constantly accelerating) particles in spacetime: Between any two events on one hyperbola a causality relation is possible, because the inverse of the slope\u2014representing the necessary speed\u2014for all secants is less than formula_1. On the other hand, the green hyperbolae, which cross the \"ct\" axis, are spacelike curves because all intervals \"along\" these hyperbolae are spacelike intervals: No causality is possible between any two points on one of these hyperbolae, because all secants represent speeds larger than formula_1.\nFig.\u00a02-7b reflects the situation in (1+2)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime (one temporal and two spatial dimensions) with the corresponding hyperboloids. The invariant hyperbolae displaced by spacelike intervals from the origin generate hyperboloids of one sheet, while the invariant hyperbolae displaced by timelike intervals from the origin generate hyperboloids of two sheets.\nThe (1+2)-dimensional boundary between space- and time-like hyperboloids, established by the events forming a zero spacetime interval to the origin, is made up by degenerating the hyperboloids to the light cone. In (1+1)-dimensions the hyperbolae degenerate to the two grey 45\u00b0-lines depicted in Fig.\u00a02-7a.\nTime dilation and length contraction.\nFig. 2-8 illustrates the invariant hyperbola for all events that can be reached from the origin in a proper time of 5\u00a0meters (approximately ). Different world lines represent clocks moving at different speeds. A clock that is stationary with respect to the observer has a world line that is vertical, and the elapsed time measured by the observer is the same as the proper time. For a clock traveling at 0.3\u00a0\"c\", the elapsed time measured by the observer is 5.24\u00a0meters (), while for a clock traveling at 0.7\u00a0\"c\", the elapsed time measured by the observer is 7.00\u00a0meters ().\nThis illustrates the phenomenon known as time dilation. Clocks that travel faster take longer (in the observer frame) to tick out the same amount of proper time, and they travel further along the x\u2013axis within that proper time than they would have without time dilation. The measurement of time dilation by two observers in different inertial reference frames is mutual. If observer O measures the clocks of observer O\u2032 as running slower in his frame, observer O\u2032 in turn will measure the clocks of observer O as running slower.\nLength contraction, like time dilation, is a manifestation of the relativity of simultaneity. Measurement of length requires measurement of the spacetime interval between two events that are simultaneous in one's frame of reference. But events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are, in general, not simultaneous in other frames of reference.\nFig. 2-9 illustrates the motions of a 1\u00a0m rod that is traveling at 0.5\u00a0\"c\" along the \"x\" axis. The edges of the blue band represent the world lines of the rod's two endpoints. The invariant hyperbola illustrates events separated from the origin by a spacelike interval of 1\u00a0m. The endpoints O and B measured when \"t\"\u2032\u00a0=\u00a00 are simultaneous events in the S\u2032 frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the \"x\"-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod's \"world sheet\" onto the \"x\" axis yields the foreshortened length OC.\n(not illustrated) Drawing a vertical line through A so that it intersects the \"x\"\u2032 axis demonstrates that, even as OB is foreshortened from the point of view of observer O, OA is likewise foreshortened from the point of view of observer O\u2032. In the same way that each observer measures the other's clocks as running slow, each observer measures the other's rulers as being contracted.\nIn regards to mutual length contraction, Fig.\u00a02-9 illustrates that the primed and unprimed frames are mutually rotated by a hyperbolic angle (analogous to ordinary angles in Euclidean geometry). Because of this rotation, the projection of a primed meter-stick onto the unprimed \"x\"-axis is foreshortened, while the projection of an unprimed meter-stick onto the primed x\u2032-axis is likewise foreshortened.\nMutual time dilation and the twin paradox.\nMutual time dilation.\nMutual time dilation and length contraction tend to strike beginners as inherently self-contradictory concepts. If an observer in frame S measures a clock, at rest in frame S', as running slower than his', while S' is moving at speed \"v\" in S, then the principle of relativity requires that an observer in frame S' likewise measures a clock in frame S, moving at speed \u2212\"v\" in S', as running slower than hers. How two clocks can run \"both slower\" than the other, is an important question that \"goes to the heart of understanding special relativity.\"\nThis apparent contradiction stems from not correctly taking into account the different settings of the necessary, related measurements. These settings allow for a consistent explanation of the \"only apparent\" contradiction. It is not about the abstract ticking of two identical clocks, but about how to measure in one frame the temporal distance of two ticks of a moving clock. It turns out that in mutually observing the duration between ticks of clocks, each moving in the respective frame, different sets of clocks must be involved. In order to measure in frame S the tick duration of a moving clock W\u2032 (at rest in S\u2032), one uses \"two\" additional, synchronized clocks W1 and W2 at rest in two arbitrarily fixed points in S with the spatial distance \"d\".\nConversely, for judging in frame S\u2032 the temporal distance of two events on a moving clock W (at rest in S), one needs two clocks at rest in S\u2032.\nThe necessary recordings for the two judgements, with \"one moving clock\" and \"two clocks at rest\" in respectively S or S\u2032, involves two different sets, each with three clocks. Since there are different sets of clocks involved in the measurements, there is no inherent necessity that the measurements be reciprocally \"consistent\" such that, if one observer measures the moving clock to be slow, the other observer measures the other clock to be fast.\nFig. 2-10 illustrates the previous discussion of mutual time dilation with Minkowski diagrams. The upper picture reflects the measurements as seen from frame S \"at rest\" with unprimed, rectangular axes, and frame S\u2032 \"moving with \"v\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a00\", coordinatized by primed, oblique axes, slanted to the right; the lower picture shows frame S\u2032 \"at rest\" with primed, rectangular coordinates, and frame S \"moving with \u2212\"v\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a00\", with unprimed, oblique axes, slanted to the left.\nEach line drawn parallel to a spatial axis (\"x\", \"x\"\u2032) represents a line of simultaneity. All events on such a line have the same time value (\"ct\", \"ct\"\u2032). Likewise, each line drawn parallel to a temporal axis (\"ct\", \"ct\u2032\") represents a line of equal spatial coordinate values (\"x\", \"x\"\u2032).\n \nTo show the mutual time dilation immediately in the upper picture, the event \"D\" may be constructed as the event at \"x\"\u2032\u00a0=\u00a00 (the location of clock W\u2032 in S\u2032), that is simultaneous to \"C\" (\"OC\" has equal spacetime interval as \"OA\") in S\u2032. This shows that the time interval \"OD\" is longer than \"OA\", showing that the \"moving\" clock runs slower.\nIn the lower picture the frame S is moving with velocity \u2212\"v\" in the frame S\u2032 at rest. The worldline of clock W is the \"ct\"-axis (slanted to the left), the worldline of W\u20321 is the vertical \"ct\"\u2032-axis, and the worldline of W\u20322 is the vertical through event \"C\", with \"ct\"\u2032-coordinate \"D\". The invariant hyperbola through event \"C\" scales the time interval \"OC\" to \"OA\", which is shorter than \"OD\"; also, \"B\" is constructed (similar to \"D\" in the upper pictures) as simultaneous to \"A\" in S, at \"x\"\u00a0=\u00a00. The result \"OB\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\"OC\" corresponds again to above.\nThe word \"measure\" is important. In classical physics an observer cannot affect an observed object, but the object's state of motion \"can\" affect the observer's \"observations\" of the object.\nTwin paradox.\nMany introductions to special relativity illustrate the differences between Galilean relativity and special relativity by posing a series of \"paradoxes\". These paradoxes are, in fact, ill-posed problems, resulting from our unfamiliarity with velocities comparable to the speed of light. The remedy is to solve many problems in special relativity and to become familiar with its so-called counter-intuitive predictions. The geometrical approach to studying spacetime is considered one of the best methods for developing a modern intuition.\nThe twin paradox is a thought experiment involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each should find the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock. Nevertheless, the \"twin paradox\" is not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.\nThe impression that a paradox exists stems from a misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare all frames of reference to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin's frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, the difference between the twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.\nThese distinctions should result in a difference in the twins' ages. The spacetime diagram of Fig.\u00a02-11 presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the path integral) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.\nComplications arise if the twin paradox is analyzed from the traveling twin's point of view.\nWeiss's nomenclature, designating the stay-at-home twin as Terence and the traveling twin as Stella, is hereafter used.\nStella is not in an inertial frame. Given this fact, it is sometimes incorrectly stated that full resolution of the twin paradox requires general relativity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A pure SR analysis would be as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force. Figs.\u00a02-6 and 2-11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's \"x\"-axis (\"xy\"-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.\u00a02-11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, \"from Stella's point of view\", are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. \"But during the turnaround\" (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift takes place in the angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, at the end of her trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.\nAlthough general relativity is not required to analyze the twin paradox, application of the Equivalence Principle of general relativity does provide some additional insight into the subject. Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing her as if she were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of gravitational time dilation, his clock will appear to run fast, so much so that the net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together. The theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. Any theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.\nGravitation.\nThis introductory section has focused on the spacetime of special relativity, since it is the easiest to describe. Minkowski spacetime is flat, takes no account of gravity, is uniform throughout, and serves as nothing more than a static background for the events that take place in it. The presence of gravity greatly complicates the description of spacetime. In general relativity, spacetime is no longer a static background, but actively interacts with the physical systems that it contains. Spacetime curves in the presence of matter, can propagate waves, bends light, and exhibits a host of other phenomena. A few of these phenomena are described in the later sections of this article.\nBasic mathematics of spacetime.\nGalilean transformations.\nA basic goal is to be able to compare measurements made by observers in relative motion. If there is an observer O in frame S who has measured the time and space coordinates of an event, assigning this event three Cartesian coordinates and the time as measured on his lattice of synchronized clocks (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"t\") (see Fig.\u00a01-1). A second observer O\u2032 in a different frame S\u2032 measures the same event in her coordinate system and her lattice of synchronized clocks (\"x\"\u2032, \"y\"\u2032, \"z\"\u2032, \"t\"\u2032). With inertial frames, neither observer is under acceleration, and a simple set of equations allows us to relate coordinates (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"t\") to (\"x\"\u2032, \"y\"\u2032, \"z\"\u2032, \"t\"\u2032). Given that the two coordinate systems are in standard configuration, meaning that they are aligned with parallel (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") coordinates and that \"t\" = 0 when \"t\"\u2032 = 0, the coordinate transformation is as follows:\n formula_45\n formula_46\n formula_47\n formula_48\nFig. 3-1 illustrates that in Newton's theory, time is universal, not the velocity of light. Consider the following thought experiment: The red arrow illustrates a train that is moving at 0.4\u00a0c with respect to the platform. Within the train, a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed of 0.4\u00a0c in the frame of the train. The blue arrow illustrates that a person standing on the train tracks measures the bullet as traveling at 0.8\u00a0c. This is in accordance with our naive expectations.\nMore generally, assuming that frame S\u2032 is moving at velocity \"v\" with respect to frame S, then within frame S\u2032, observer O\u2032 measures an object moving with velocity \"u\"\u2032. Velocity \"u\" with respect to frame S, since \"x\" = \"ut\", \"x\"\u2032 = \"x\" \u2212 \"vt\", and \"t\" = \"t\"\u2032, can be written as \"x\"\u2032 = \"ut\" \u2212 \"vt\" = (\"u\" \u2212 \"v\")\"t\" = (\"u\" \u2212 \"v\")\"t\"\u2032. This leads to \"u\"\u2032 = \"x\"\u2032/\"t\"\u2032 and ultimately\n formula_49\u00a0\u00a0or\u00a0\u00a0formula_50\nwhich is the common-sense Galilean law for the addition of velocities.\nRelativistic composition of velocities.\nThe composition of velocities is quite different in relativistic spacetime. To reduce the complexity of the equations slightly, we introduce a common shorthand for the ratio of the speed of an object relative to light,\n formula_51\nFig. 3-2a illustrates a red train that is moving forward at a speed given by \"v\"/\"c\" = \"\u03b2\" = \"s\"/\"a\". From the primed frame of the train, a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed given by \"u\"\u2032/\"c\" = \"\u03b2\"\u2032 = \"n\"/\"m\", where the distance is measured along a line parallel to the red \"x\"\u2032 axis rather than parallel to the black \"x\" axis. What is the composite velocity \"u\" of the bullet relative to the platform, as represented by the blue arrow? Referring to Fig.\u00a03-2b:\nThe relativistic formula for addition of velocities presented above exhibits several important features:\nTime dilation and length contraction revisited.\nIt is straightforward to obtain quantitative expressions for time dilation and length contraction. Fig.\u00a03-3 is a composite image containing individual frames taken from two previous animations, simplified and relabeled for the purposes of this section.\nTo reduce the complexity of the equations slightly, there are a variety of different shorthand notations for \"ct\":\n formula_53 and formula_54 are common.\n One also sees very frequently the use of the convention formula_55\nIn Fig. 3-3a, segments \"OA\" and \"OK\" represent equal spacetime intervals. Time dilation is represented by the ratio \"OB\"/\"OK\". The invariant hyperbola has the equation \"w\" \n \u221a\"x\"2 + \"k\"2 where \"k\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"OK\", and the red line representing the world line of a particle in motion has the equation \"w\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"x\"/\"\u03b2\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"xc\"/\"v\". A bit of algebraic manipulation yields formula_56\nThe expression involving the square root symbol appears very frequently in relativity, and one over the expression is called the Lorentz factor, denoted by the Greek letter gamma formula_57:\n formula_58\nIf \"v\" is greater than or equal to \"c\", the expression for formula_57 becomes physically meaningless, implying that \"c\" is the maximum possible speed in nature. For any \"v\" greater than zero, the Lorentz factor will be greater than one, although the shape of the curve is such that for low speeds, the Lorentz factor is extremely close to one.\nIn Fig. 3-3b, segments \"OA\" and \"OK\" represent equal spacetime intervals. Length contraction is represented by the ratio \"OB\"/\"OK\". The invariant hyperbola has the equation \"x\" \n \u221a\"w\"2 + \"k\"2, where \"k\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"OK\", and the edges of the blue band representing the world lines of the endpoints of a rod in motion have slope 1/\"\u03b2\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"c\"/\"v\". Event\u00a0A has coordinates\n(\"x\",\u00a0\"w\")\u00a0=\u00a0(\"\u03b3k\",\u00a0\"\u03b3\u03b2k\"). Since the tangent line through A and B has the equation \"w\"\u00a0=\u00a0(\"x\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"OB\")/\"\u03b2\", we have \"\u03b3\u03b2k\"\u00a0=\u00a0(\"\u03b3k\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"OB\")/\"\u03b2\" and\n formula_60\nLorentz transformations.\nThe Galilean transformations and their consequent commonsense law of addition of velocities work well in our ordinary low-speed world of planes, cars and balls. Beginning in the mid-1800s, however, sensitive scientific instrumentation began finding anomalies that did not fit well with the ordinary addition of velocities.\nLorentz transformations are used to transform the coordinates of an event from one frame to another in special relativity.\nThe Lorentz factor appears in the Lorentz transformations:\n formula_61\nThe inverse Lorentz transformations are:\n formula_62\nWhen \"v\"\u00a0\u226a\u00a0\"c\" and \"x\" is small enough, the \"v\"2/\"c\"2 and \"vx\"/\"c\"2 terms approach zero, and the Lorentz transformations approximate to the Galilean transformations.\nformula_63 formula_64 etc., most often really mean formula_65 formula_66 etc. Although for brevity the Lorentz transformation equations are written without deltas, \"x\" means \u0394\"x\", etc. We are, in general, always concerned with the space and time \"differences\" between events.\nCalling one set of transformations the normal Lorentz transformations and the other the inverse transformations is misleading, since there is no intrinsic difference between the frames. Different authors call one or the other set of transformations the \"inverse\" set. The forwards and inverse transformations are trivially related to each other, since the \"S\" frame can only be moving forwards or reverse with respect to \"S\"\u2032. So inverting the equations simply entails switching the primed and unprimed variables and replacing \"v\" with \u2212\"v\".\n1).\nDeriving the Lorentz transformations.\nThere have been many dozens of derivations of the Lorentz transformations since Einstein's original work in 1905, each with its particular focus. Although Einstein's derivation was based on the invariance of the speed of light, there are other physical principles that may serve as starting points. Ultimately, these alternative starting points can be considered different expressions of the underlying principle of locality, which states that the influence that one particle exerts on another can not be transmitted instantaneously.\nThe derivation given here and illustrated in Fig.\u00a03-5 is based on one presented by Bais and makes use of previous results from the Relativistic Composition of Velocities, Time Dilation, and Length Contraction sections. Event\u00a0P has coordinates (\"w\",\u00a0\"x\") in the black \"rest system\" and coordinates (\"w\"\u2032,\u00a0\"x\"\u2032) in the red frame that is moving with velocity parameter \"\u03b2\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"v\"/\"c\". To determine \"w\"\u2032 and \"x\"\u2032 in terms of \"w\" and \"x\" (or the other way around) it is easier at first to derive the \"inverse\" Lorentz transformation.\nThe above equations are alternate expressions for the t and x equations of the inverse Lorentz transformation, as can be seen by substituting \"ct\" for \"w\", \"ct\"\u2032 for \"w\"\u2032, and \"v\"/\"c\" for \"\u03b2\". From the inverse transformation, the equations of the forwards transformation can be derived by solving for \"t\"\u2032 and \"x\"\u2032.\nLinearity of the Lorentz transformations.\nThe Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity, since \"x\"\u2032 and \"t\"\u2032 are obtained as linear combinations of \"x\" and \"t\", with no higher powers involved. The linearity of the transformation reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that was tacitly assumed in the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, but there is nothing absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.\nA result of linearity is that if two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially, the result is also a Lorentz transformation.\nDoppler effect.\nThe Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity, we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal Doppler effect), and (2) the motions are at right angles to the said line (transverse Doppler effect). We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.\nLongitudinal Doppler effect.\nThe classical Doppler analysis deals with waves that are propagating in a medium, such as sound waves or water ripples, and which are transmitted between sources and receivers that are moving towards or away from each other. The analysis of such waves depends on whether the source, the receiver, or both are moving relative to the medium. Given the scenario where the receiver is stationary with respect to the medium, and the source is moving directly away from the receiver at a speed of \"vs\" for a velocity parameter of \"\u03b2s\", the wavelength is increased, and the observed frequency \"f\" is given by\n formula_69\nOn the other hand, given the scenario where source is stationary, and the receiver is moving directly away from the source at a speed of \"vr\" for a velocity parameter of \"\u03b2r\", the wavelength is \"not\" changed, but the transmission velocity of the waves relative to the receiver is decreased, and the observed frequency \"f\" is given by\n formula_70\nLight, unlike sound or water ripples, does not propagate through a medium, and there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. Fig.\u00a03-6 illustrates a relativistic spacetime diagram showing a source separating from the receiver with a velocity parameter formula_71 so that the separation between source and receiver at time formula_72 is formula_73. Because of time dilation, formula_74 Since the slope of the green light ray is \u22121, formula_75 Hence, the relativistic Doppler effect is given by\n formula_76\nTransverse Doppler effect.\nSuppose that a source and a receiver, both approaching each other in uniform inertial motion along non-intersecting lines, are at their closest approach to each other. It would appear that the classical analysis predicts that the receiver detects no Doppler shift. Due to subtleties in the analysis, that expectation is not necessarily true. Nevertheless, when appropriately defined, transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. The subtleties are these:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn scenario (a), the point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time (i.e. dr/dt\u00a0=\u00a00 where \"r\" is the distance between receiver and source) and hence no longitudinal Doppler shift. The source observes the receiver as being illuminated by light of frequency \"f\"\u2032, but also observes the receiver as having a time-dilated clock. In frame\u00a0S, the receiver is therefore illuminated by blueshifted light of frequency\n formula_77\nIn scenario (b) the illustration shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver, even though the source has moved on. Because the source's clocks are time dilated as measured in frame S, and since dr/dt was equal to zero at this point, the light from the source, emitted from this closest point, is redshifted with frequency\n formula_78\nScenarios (c) and (d) can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments. In (c), the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of formula_57, and in (d), the light is redshifted. The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. However, if an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock, only the clock's instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation. (The converse, however, is not true.) Most reports of transverse Doppler shift refer to the effect as a redshift and analyze the effect in terms of scenarios (b) or (d).\nEnergy and momentum.\nExtending momentum to four dimensions.\nIn classical mechanics, the state of motion of a particle is characterized by its mass and its velocity. Linear momentum, the product of a particle's mass and velocity, is a vector quantity, possessing the same direction as the velocity: p\u00a0=\u00a0\"mv\". It is a \"conserved\" quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.\nIn relativistic mechanics, the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In exploring the properties of the spacetime momentum, we start, in Fig.\u00a03-8a, by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. \"p\"\u00a0=\u00a00, but the time component equals \"mc\".\nWe can obtain the transformed components of this vector in the moving frame by using the Lorentz transformations, or we can read it directly from the figure because we know that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, since the red axes are rescaled by gamma. Fig.\u00a03-8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches \"c\".\nWe will use this information shortly to obtain an expression for the four-momentum.\nMomentum of light.\nLight particles, or photons, travel at the speed of \"c\", the constant that is conventionally known as the \"speed of light\". This statement is not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a lightlike world line and, in appropriate units, have equal space and time components for every observer.\nA consequence of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum, and that their ratio is a constant: &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Rearranging, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and since for photons, the space and time components are equal, \"E\"/\"c\" must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.\nPhotons travel at the speed of light, yet have finite momentum and energy. For this to be so, the mass term in \"\u03b3mc\" must be zero, meaning that photons are massless particles. Infinity times zero is an ill-defined quantity, but \"E\"/\"c\" is well-defined.\nBy this analysis, if the energy of a photon equals \"E\" in the rest frame, it equals &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in a moving frame. This result can be derived by inspection of Fig.\u00a03-9 or by application of the Lorentz transformations, and is consistent with the analysis of Doppler effect given previously.\nMass\u2013energy relationship.\nConsideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to several important conclusions.\nAnother way of looking at the relationship between mass and energy is to consider a series expansion of \"\u03b3mc\"2 at low velocity:\n formula_80 formula_81\nThe second term is just an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle. Mass indeed appears to be another form of energy.\nThe concept of relativistic mass that Einstein introduced in 1905, \"m\"rel, although amply validated every day in particle accelerators around the globe (or indeed in any instrumentation whose use depends on high velocity particles, such as electron microscopes, old-fashioned color television sets, etc.), has nevertheless not proven to be a \"fruitful\" concept in physics in the sense that it is not a concept that has served as a basis for other theoretical development. Relativistic mass, for instance, plays no role in general relativity.\nFor this reason, as well as for pedagogical concerns, most physicists currently prefer a different terminology when referring to the relationship between mass and energy. \"Relativistic mass\" is a deprecated term. The term \"mass\" by itself refers to the rest mass or invariant mass, and is equal to the invariant length of the relativistic momentum vector. Expressed as a formula,\n formula_82\nThis formula applies to all particles, massless as well as massive. For photons where \"m\"rest equals zero, it yields, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nFour-momentum.\nBecause of the close relationship between mass and energy, the four-momentum (also called 4-momentum) is also called the energy\u2013momentum 4-vector. Using an uppercase \"P\" to represent the four-momentum and a lowercase p to denote the spatial momentum, the four-momentum may be written as\n formula_83 or alternatively,\n formula_84 using the convention that formula_85\nConservation laws.\nIn physics, conservation laws state that certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. In 1915, Emmy Noether discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The fact that physical processes do not care \"where\" in space they take place (space translation symmetry) yields conservation of momentum, the fact that such processes do not care \"when\" they take place (time translation symmetry) yields conservation of energy, and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.\nTotal momentum.\nTo understand how the Newtonian view of conservation of momentum needs to be modified in a relativistic context, we examine the problem of two colliding bodies limited to a single dimension.\nIn Newtonian mechanics, two extreme cases of this problem may be distinguished yielding mathematics of minimum complexity:\n (1) The two bodies rebound from each other in a completely elastic collision.\n (2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision.\nFor both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.\nIn case (2), two masses with momentums &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;\nand &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; collide to produce a single particle of conserved mass &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; traveling at the center of mass velocity of the original system, formula_86. The total momentum &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; is conserved.\nFig.\u00a03-10 illustrates the inelastic collision of two particles from a relativistic perspective. The time components &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; add up to total \"E/c\" of the resultant vector, meaning that energy is conserved. Likewise, the space components &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; add up to form \"p\" of the resultant vector. The four-momentum is, as expected, a conserved quantity. However, the invariant mass of the fused particle, given by the point where the invariant hyperbola of the total momentum intersects the energy axis, is not equal to the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles that collided. Indeed, it is larger than the sum of the individual masses: &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nLooking at the events of this scenario in reverse sequence, we see that non-conservation of mass is a common occurrence: when an unstable elementary particle spontaneously decays into two lighter particles, total energy is conserved, but the mass is not. Part of the mass is converted into kinetic energy.\nChoice of reference frames.\nThe freedom to choose any frame in which to perform an analysis allows us to pick one which may be particularly convenient. For analysis of momentum and energy problems, the most convenient frame is usually the \"center-of-momentum frame\" (also called the zero-momentum frame, or COM frame). This is the frame in which the space component of the system's total momentum is zero. Fig.\u00a03-11 illustrates the breakup of a high speed particle into two daughter particles. In the lab frame, the daughter particles are preferentially emitted in a direction oriented along the original particle's trajectory. In the COM frame, however, the two daughter particles are emitted in opposite directions, although their masses and the magnitude of their velocities are generally not the same.\nEnergy and momentum conservation.\nIn a Newtonian analysis of interacting particles, transformation between frames is simple because all that is necessary is to apply the Galilean transformation to all velocities. Since &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the momentum &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. If the total momentum of an interacting system of particles is observed to be conserved in one frame, it will likewise be observed to be conserved in any other frame.\nConservation of momentum in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that \"p\"\u00a0=\u00a00 both before and after collision. In the Newtonian analysis, conservation of mass dictates that &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. In the simplified, one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering, only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determined\u2014an energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely inelastic collision with total loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.\nNewtonian momenta, calculated as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The linear transformation of velocities &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is replaced by the highly nonlinear\n&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; so that a calculation demonstrating conservation of momentum in one frame will be invalid in other frames. Einstein was faced with either having to give up conservation of momentum, or to change the definition of momentum. This second option was what he chose.\nThe relativistic conservation law for energy and momentum replaces the three classical conservation laws for energy, momentum and mass. Mass is no longer conserved independently, because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy. This makes the relativistic conservation of energy a simpler concept than in nonrelativistic mechanics, because the total energy is conserved without any qualifications. Kinetic energy converted into heat or internal potential energy shows up as an increase in mass.\nExample: Because of the equivalence of mass and energy, elementary particle masses are customarily stated in energy units, where 1 MeV = 106 electron volts. A charged pion is a particle of mass 139.57\u00a0MeV (approx. 273 times the electron mass). It is unstable, and decays into a muon of mass 105.66\u00a0MeV (approx. 207 times the electron mass) and an antineutrino, which has an almost negligible mass. The difference between the pion mass and the muon mass is 33.91\u00a0MeV.\nFig.\u00a03-12a illustrates the energy\u2013momentum diagram for this decay reaction in the rest frame of the pion. Because of its negligible mass, a neutrino travels at very nearly the speed of light. The relativistic expression for its energy, like that of the photon, is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; which is also the value of the space component of its momentum. To conserve momentum, the muon has the same value of the space component of the neutrino's momentum, but in the opposite direction.\nAlgebraic analyses of the energetics of this decay reaction are available online, so Fig.\u00a03-12b presents instead a graphing calculator solution. The energy of the neutrino is 29.79\u00a0MeV, and the energy of the muon is 33.91 MeV \u2212 29.79 MeV = 4.12 MeV. Most of the energy is carried off by the near-zero-mass neutrino.\nTechnical topics.\nIs spacetime really curved?\nIn Poincar\u00e9's conventionalist views, the essential criteria according to which one should select a Euclidean versus non-Euclidean geometry would be economy and simplicity. A realist would say that Einstein discovered spacetime to be non-Euclidean. A conventionalist would say that Einstein merely found it \"more convenient\" to use non-Euclidean geometry. The conventionalist would maintain that Einstein's analysis said nothing about what the geometry of spacetime \"really\" is.\nSuch being said,\n# Is it possible to represent general relativity in terms of flat spacetime?\n# Are there any situations where a flat spacetime interpretation of general relativity may be \"more convenient\" than the usual curved spacetime interpretation?\nIn response to the first question, a number of authors including Deser, Grishchuk, Rosen, Weinberg, etc. have provided various formulations of gravitation as a field in a flat manifold. Those theories are variously called \"bimetric gravity\", the \"field-theoretical approach to general relativity\", and so forth. Kip Thorne has provided a popular review of these theories.\nThe flat spacetime paradigm posits that matter creates a gravitational field that causes rulers to shrink when they are turned from circumferential orientation to radial, and that causes the ticking rates of clocks to dilate. The flat spacetime paradigm is fully equivalent to the curved spacetime paradigm in that they both represent the same physical phenomena. However, their mathematical formulations are entirely different. Working physicists routinely switch between using curved and flat spacetime techniques depending on the requirements of the problem. The flat spacetime paradigm is convenient when performing approximate calculations in weak fields. Hence, flat spacetime techniques tend be used when solving gravitational wave problems, while curved spacetime techniques tend be used in the analysis of black holes.\nAsymptotic symmetries.\nThe spacetime symmetry group for Special Relativity is the Poincar\u00e9 group, which is a ten-dimensional group of three Lorentz boosts, three rotations, and four spacetime translations. It is logical to ask what symmetries if any might apply in General Relativity. A tractable case might be to consider the symmetries of spacetime as seen by observers located far away from all sources of the gravitational field. The naive expectation for asymptotically flat spacetime symmetries might be simply to extend and reproduce the symmetries of flat spacetime of special relativity, \"viz.\", the Poincar\u00e9 group.\nIn 1962 Hermann Bondi, M. G. van der Burg, A. W. Metzner and Rainer K. Sachs addressed this asymptotic symmetry problem in order to investigate the flow of energy at infinity due to propagating gravitational waves. Their first step was to decide on some physically sensible boundary conditions to place on the gravitational field at lightlike infinity to characterize what it means to say a metric is asymptotically flat, making no \"a priori\" assumptions about the nature of the asymptotic symmetry group\u2014not even the assumption that such a group exists. Then after designing what they considered to be the most sensible boundary conditions, they investigated the nature of the resulting asymptotic symmetry transformations that leave invariant the form of the boundary conditions appropriate for asymptotically flat gravitational fields.\nWhat they found was that the asymptotic symmetry transformations actually do form a group and the structure of this group does not depend on the particular gravitational field that happens to be present. This means that, as expected, one can separate the kinematics of spacetime from the dynamics of the gravitational field at least at spatial infinity. The puzzling surprise in 1962 was their discovery of a rich infinite-dimensional group (the so-called BMS group) as the asymptotic symmetry group, instead of the finite-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 group, which is a subgroup of the BMS group. Not only are the Lorentz transformations asymptotic symmetry transformations, there are also additional transformations that are not Lorentz transformations but are asymptotic symmetry transformations. In fact, they found an additional infinity of transformation generators known as \"supertranslations\". This implies the conclusion that General Relativity (GR) does \"not\" reduce to special relativity in the case of weak fields at long distances.\nCurved manifolds.\nFor physical reasons, a spacetime continuum is mathematically defined as a four-dimensional, smooth, connected Lorentzian manifold formula_87. This means the smooth Lorentz metric formula_88 has signature formula_89. The metric determines the \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;geometry of spacetime\", as well as determining the geodesics of particles and light beams. About each point (event) on this manifold, coordinate charts are used to represent observers in reference frames. Usually, Cartesian coordinates formula_90 are used. Moreover, for simplicity's sake, units of measurement are usually chosen such that the speed of light formula_1 is equal to 1.\nA reference frame (observer) can be identified with one of these coordinate charts; any such observer can describe any event formula_92. Another reference frame may be identified by a second coordinate chart about formula_92. Two observers (one in each reference frame) may describe the same event formula_92 but obtain different descriptions.\nUsually, many overlapping coordinate charts are needed to cover a manifold. Given two coordinate charts, one containing formula_92 (representing an observer) and another containing formula_96 (representing another observer), the intersection of the charts represents the region of spacetime in which both observers can measure physical quantities and hence compare results. The relation between the two sets of measurements is given by a non-singular coordinate transformation on this intersection. The idea of coordinate charts as local observers who can perform measurements in their vicinity also makes good physical sense, as this is how one actually collects physical data\u2014locally.\nFor example, two observers, one of whom is on Earth, but the other one who is on a fast rocket to Jupiter, may observe a comet crashing into Jupiter (this is the event formula_92). In general, they will disagree about the exact location and timing of this impact, i.e., they will have different 4-tuples formula_90 (as they are using different coordinate systems). Although their kinematic descriptions will differ, dynamical (physical) laws, such as momentum conservation and the first law of thermodynamics, will still hold. In fact, relativity theory requires more than this in the sense that it stipulates these (and all other physical) laws must take the same form in all coordinate systems. This introduces tensors into relativity, by which all physical quantities are represented.\nGeodesics are said to be timelike, null, or spacelike if the tangent vector to one point of the geodesic is of this nature. Paths of particles and light beams in spacetime are represented by timelike and null (lightlike) geodesics, respectively.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28760", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28760", "title": "SimCity (1989 video game)", "text": "1989 video game\nSimCity (also known as the retronyms Micropolis or SimCity Classic) is a city-building simulation video game developed by Will Wright, and released for several platforms from 1989 to 1991. \"SimCity\" features two-dimensional graphics and an overhead perspective. The game's objective is to create a city, develop residential and industrial areas, build infrastructure, and collect taxes for further city development. Importance is placed on increasing the population's standard of living, maintaining a balance between the different sectors, and monitoring the region's environmental situations to prevent the settlement from declining and going bankrupt.\n\"SimCity\" was independently developed by Will Wright, beginning in 1985; the game was not released until 1989. Because the game lacked any arcade or action elements that dominated the video game market in the 1980s, video game publishers declined to release the title for fear of its commercial failure until Broderbund eventually agreed to distribute it. Although the game initially sold poorly, positive feedback from the gaming press boosted its sales. After becoming a best-seller, \"SimCity\" was released on several other platforms, most notably on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1991. Its gameplay was significantly revised with Nintendo's involvement.\n\"SimCity\" sold 500,000 units for home computers and 1.98 million units for the SNES. The game was met with critical acclaim for its innovative and addictive gameplay despite the absence of action elements. Reviewers considered the game instructive and helpful toward the player's understanding of urban planning, politics, and economics. \"SimCity\" received numerous awards from news publishers and associations. The success of \"SimCity\" marked the beginning of the urban simulation genre of video games, as well as publisher Maxis' tradition of producing non-linear simulation games, one of which \u2013 \"The Sims\" \u2013 would surpass all its predecessors in popularity and become one of the best-selling franchises in the video game industry.\nGameplay.\nThe core concept of \"SimCity\" is to build and design a city without specific goals to achieve. The player may divide land into commercial, industrial, or residential zones, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take any other actions to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as \"Sims\", may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light, heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. The Sims make these choices based on such factors as traffic levels, availability of electrical power, crime levels, and proximity to other types of buildings\u2014for example, residential areas next to a power plant will seldom appreciate the highest grade of housing. In the Super NES version and later, the player can also build rewards when they are given, such as the mayor's mansion or a casino.\nThe player may face disasters including floods, tornadoes, fires (often from air disasters or shipwrecks), earthquakes and monster attacks. In addition, monsters and tornadoes can trigger train crashes by running into passing trains.\nScenarios.\nSimCity features goal-oriented, time-limited scenarios that are contingent on the player's performance and could result in either a win or a loss. The implementation of scenarios was suggested by Broderbund, as a means of transforming SimCity into a more traditional game format. This addition was intended to enhance the overall experience for players, by introducing clearly defined objectives and increasing the level of challenge in the game. In SimCity, the initial cities were modeled after real-world cities and endeavored to replicate their general layout. Although the majority of scenarios featured in the game exist within a fictional timeline or involve a city besieged by an imaginary catastrophe, a select few are based on genuine historical events. This incorporation of actual historical events adds a unique layer of realism to the game and enables players to engage with significant moments in history in a novel way.\nDevelopment.\n\"SimCity\" was developed by game designer Will Wright. While working on the game \"Raid on Bungeling Bay\", in which the player flies a helicopter dropping bombs on islands, Wright found he enjoyed designing the islands in the level editor rather than playing the actual game. This led him to develop increasingly sophisticated level editors. At the same time, Wright was cultivating a love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning and acknowledges the influence of System Dynamics which was developed by Jay Wright Forrester and whose book on the subject laid the foundations for what would become \"SimCity\". In addition, Wright also was inspired by reading \"The Seventh Sally\", a short story from \"The Cyberiad\" by Stanis\u0142aw Lem, in which an engineer encounters a deposed tyrant, and creates a miniature city with artificial citizens for the tyrant to oppress. The game reflected Wright's approval of mass transit and disapproval of nuclear power; Maxis president Jeff Braun stated \"We're pushing political agendas\".\nThe first version of the game was developed for the Commodore 64 in 1985; it was not published for another four years. The original working title of \"SimCity\" was \"Micropolis\". The game was unusual in that it could neither be won or lost; as a result, game publishers did not believe it was possible to market and sell such a game successfully. Broderbund declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, Braun, founder of the tiny software company Maxis, agreed to publish \"SimCity\" as one of two initial games for the company.\nWright and Braun returned to Broderbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when \"SimCity\" was near completion. After Broderbund executives Gary Carlston and Don Daglow saw \"SimCity\", they signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, \"SimCity\" was released for the Amiga and Macintosh platforms, followed by the IBM PC and Commodore 64 later in 1989.\nPorts and versions.\nAfter the original release on the Amiga and Macintosh, the game was released on the Commodore 64 and IBM PC compatibles, and afterward saw more releases for computers and video game consoles: Atari ST, Acorn Archimedes, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, EPOC32, mobile phone, Internet, Windows, FM Towns, OLPC XO-1 and News HyperLook on Sun Unix. The game is available as a multiplayer version for X11 Tcl/Tk on various Unix, Linux, DESQview and OS/2 operating systems.\nShortly after the game's initial release, Maxis released the SimCity Terrain Editor for the original versions of the game, which was sold as a mail-order add-on in North America but gained a standalone retail release in Europe. The Terrain Editor is a simple tool that allows the user to create maps with forest, land, and water portions. In 1990, Maxis developed two \"Graphics Sets\" packs for the MS-DOS and Amiga versions: \"Ancient Cities\" and \"Future Cities\". Each pack contained themed sets which changed the graphics and messages in the game to fit certain themes.\nIn 1991, an enhanced version of the game was released for Windows 3.0/3.1. It runs in the Windows GDI with new sounds and music, either PC-Speaker type or digital/MIDI type. In 1992, to coincide with other re-releases of their games, Maxis re-released the Windows version of SimCity as \"SimCity Classic\", which bundled the game with the MS-DOS version of the Terrain Editor. The Graphics Sets were also reissued to run on Windows 3.1 as well. \"SimCity Classic\" was re-released in 1993 as part of the \"SimClassics Volume 1\" compilation alongside \"SimAnt\" and \"SimLife\" for PC, Mac and Amiga. In 1994, a Windows 95 compatible version of the game titled \"SimCity: Enhanced CD-ROM\" was released by Interplay Productions, which included new 256-color graphics and sound, and FMV movies that would trigger events. It also bundled the Graphics Sets and an updated Terrain Editor together with the base game.\nSuper NES.\nThe Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) followed a mid-1989 call to Maxis co-founder Jeff Braun from Nintendo expressing interest in porting the game, as Nintendo developer Shigeru Miyamoto was very interested in how the game allowed the player to create their own world. Braun flew to Nintendo of America's headquarters to meet with chairman Howard Lincoln and president Minoru Arakawa. They offered Braun to do all the porting to the Super NES, paying Maxis $1 for every copy sold, and offering Braun a $1 million check for accepting the deal on the spot, which Braun accepted. During this development time, Miyamoto would work alongside Wright to develop means to bring the game to the console.\n\"SimCity\" for the Super NES features the same gameplay and scenario features; however, since it was developed and published by Nintendo, the company incorporated their own ideas. Instead of the Godzilla monster disaster, Bowser of the \"Super Mario\" series becomes the attacking monster, and once the city reaches a landmark 500,000 populace, the player receives a Mario statue that can be placed in the city. The Super NES port also features special buildings the player may receive as rewards, such as casinos, large parks, amusement parks, and expo centers; some of which would be incorporated into \"SimCity 2000\". A bank can be built which will allow a loan of $10,000 to be taken, but it must be paid back before another loan can be taken out. The game includes schools and hospitals, though they cannot be placed by the player; instead, the game will sometimes turn an empty residential lot into one. There are city classifications, such as becoming a metropolis of 100,000 people. It has some of the same pre-set scenarios in the PC and Mac versions and two new ones. One is in Las Vegas under attack by aliens and another is called Freeland. Freeland has no water, and no rewards for buildings are given. Also unique to the Super NES version is a character named \"Dr. Wright\" (whose physical appearance is based on Will Wright) who acts as an adviser to the player. Dr. Wright was inspired by Miyamoto, at time known to fans as \"Dr. Miyamoto\", and Nintendo had come to recognize the value of cartoonist mascots for games, leading to Dr. Wright's creation. The soundtrack was composed by Soyo Oka. The edition is featured as Nintendo's Player's Choice as a million-seller.\nIn August 1996, a version of the game entitled \"BS SimCity Machizukuri Taikai\" was broadcast to Japanese players via the Super Famicom's Satellaview subsystem. Later, a sequel titled \"SimCity 64\" was released for the 64DD, the Japan-only Nintendo 64 add-on.\nAccording to Chaim Gingold, a former Maxis employee, he believes that the time Wright spent with Miyamoto helped to influence the direction of \"SimCity 2000\".\nCancelled NES version.\nA version for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was announced alongside the Super NES version and had been showcased at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show, but the NES version was never properly released. However, prototype cartridges for the NES version were discovered in 2018, and one copy was obtained by video game preservationist Frank Cifaldi, who extensively documented its features compared to the original PC and Super NES versions. It featured a completely different soundtrack (also composed by Oka) from that of the Super NES version; besides \"Metropolis Theme\", a composition that Oka herself considers one of her best works.\n\"Micropolis\".\nIn January 2008, the \"SimCity\" source code was released as free software under the GPL-3.0-or-later license, renamed \"Micropolis\" (the game's original working title) for trademark reasons, and developed by Don Hopkins. The release of the source code was motivated by the One Laptop Per Child program. The \"Micropolis\" source code has been translated to C++, integrated with Python and interfaced with both GTK+ and OpenLaszlo.\nIn 2008, Maxis established an online browser-based version of \"SimCity\". A second browser-based version was later released under the name \"Micropolis\". In 2013, a browser-based version was released, ported using JavaScript and HTML5, as \"micropolisJS\".\nSince \"Micropolis\" is licensed under the GPL-3.0-or-later, users can do anything they want with it that conforms with the GPL-3.0-or-later\u00a0\u2013 the only restriction is that they cannot call it \"SimCity\" (along with a few other limitations to protect EA's trademarks). This allows other, differently named projects to be forked from the Micropolis source code. Improvements to the open-source code base that merit EA's approval may be incorporated into the official \"OLPC SimCity\" source code, to be distributed with the OLPC under the trademarked name \"OLPC SimCity\", but only after it has been reviewed and approved by EA.\nReception.\n\"SimCity\" was a financial success, selling one million copies by late 1992, including 500,000 for home computers and another 500,000 for the SNES. In the United States, it was the ninth best-selling computer game from 1993 to 1999, with another 830,000 units sold. The SNES version sold 1.98 million units worldwide, including 900,000 units in Japan. It was critically acclaimed and received significant recognition within a year after its initial release. As of December 1990, the game was reported to have won the following awards:\nIn addition, \"SimCity\" won the Origins Award for \"Best Military or Strategy Computer Game\" of 1989 in 1990, was named to \"Computer Gaming World\"'s Hall of Fame for games readers highly rated over time, and the multiplayer X11 version of the game was also nominated in 1992 as the Best Product of the Year in \"Unix World\". \"Macworld\" named the Macintosh version of \"SimCity\" the Best Simulation Game of 1989, putting it into the Macintosh Game Hall of Fame. \"Macworld\", in their review, praised its graphics as well as its strategic gameplay, calling it \"A challenging, dynamic game, realistic and unpredictable\", and notes how \"as the population grows the city's needs change.\" \"SimCity\" was named No. 4 \"Ten Greatest PC Game Ever\" by PC World in 2009. It was named one of the sixteen most influential games in history at Telespiel, a German technology and games trade show, in 2007. Sid Meier in 2008 named \"SimCity\" as one of the three most important innovations in videogame history, as it led to other games that encouraged players to create, not destroy. It was named No. 11 on IGN's 2009 \"Top 25 PC Games of All Time\" list. In 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"SimCity\" the 6th-best computer game ever released. In 2018, Complex rated SimCity 50th on its \"The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.\" In 1995, Total! listed SimCity 89th on their \"Top 100 SNES Games.\" IGN ranked the game 35th in its \"Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.\"\nMike Siggins reviewed \"SimCity\" for \"Games International\" magazine, and gave it 5 stars out of 5, and stated that \"Overall, \"SimCity\" must be ranked right up there in the all-time Amiga classics. It is the first title that I have come across to turn a 'serious' theme into a passable simulation while also making for an excellent game.\" \"Macworld\" called \"SimCity\" \"an intricate and intriguing game\".\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game a B+.\nJohnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for \"Computer Gaming World\", and stated that \"Dynamic is exactly the right word for this product. There is constant strategy involved in the placement of zones, road building, political decision-making, and damage control.\"\nIn 1991, \"PC Format\" named \"SimCity\" one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors called it \"a town planner's dream\".\nThe University of Southern California and University of Arizona used \"SimCity\" in urban planning and political science classes. Chuck Moss of \"The Detroit News\" found that Godzilla attacking the city in the 1972 Detroit scenario caused less destruction than the mayoralty of Coleman Young. In 1990 \"The Providence Journal\" invited five candidates for Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island to manage a \"SimCity\" town resembling the city. Victoria Lederberg blamed her close loss in the Democratic primary on the newspaper's description of her poor performance in the game; former mayor Buddy Cianci, the most successful player, won the election that year.\nThe \"SimCity Terrain Editor\" was reviewed in 1989 in \"Dragon\" No. 147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the expansion 4 out of 5 stars.\nThe ZX Spectrum version was voted number 4 in the \"Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time\".\nIn 2004, \"SimCity\" was inducted into GameSpot's list of the greatest games of all time.\nOn March 12, 2007, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"SimCity\" was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon. The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including \"SimCity\".\nLegacy.\n\"SimCity\" yielded several sequels. \"Sim\" games of many types were developed\u00a0\u2013 with Will Wright and Maxis developing myriad titles including \"SimEarth\", \"SimFarm\", \"SimTown\", \"Streets of SimCity\", \"SimCopter\", \"SimAnt\", \"SimLife\", \"\", \"SimTower\", \"SimPark\", \"SimSafari\", and \"The Sims\", which spawned its own series, as well as the unreleased \"SimsVille\" and \"SimMars.\" They also obtained licenses for some titles developed in Japan, such as \"SimTower\" and \"Let's Take The A-Train\" (released as \"A-Train\" outside Japan). \"Spore\", released in 2008, was originally going to be titled \"SimEverything\"\u00a0\u2013 a name that Will Wright thought might accurately describe what he was trying to achieve.\n\"SimCity\" inspired a new genre of video games. \"Software toys\" that were open-ended with no set objective were developed trying to duplicate \"SimCity\"'s success. The most successful was Wright's own \"The Sims\", which went on to be the best selling computer game of all time. The ideas pioneered in \"SimCity\" have been incorporated into real-world applications as well, as urban developers have recognized that the game's design was \"gamification\" of city planning by integrating numerous real-world systems for a city or region interacted to project growth or change. For example, VisitorVille simulates a city based on website statistics. Several real-world city improvement projects started with models inspired by \"SimCity\" prior to implementation, particularly with the onset of more connected smart cities.\nThe series also spawned a \"\" collectible card game, produced by Mayfair Games. Rick Swan reviewed \"SimCity: The Card Game\" for \"Dragon\" magazine No. 221 (September 1995). Swan says that \"While the card game doesn't scale the heights of the computer game, it comes close.\"\nDr. Wright from the Super NES version has made appearances in several video games. He is a non-player character in \"\", and an assist trophy in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28761", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28761", "title": "Sofonisba Anguissola", "text": "Italian painter (c. 1532\u20131625)\nSofonisba Anguissola (c.\u20091532\u00a0\u2013 16 November 1625), also known as Sophonisba Angussola or Sophonisba Anguisciola, was an Italian Renaissance painter born in Cremona to a relatively poor noble family. She received a well-rounded education that included the fine arts, and her apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art. As a young woman, Anguissola traveled to Rome where she was introduced to Michelangelo, who immediately recognized her talent, and to Milan, where she painted Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. The Spanish queen, Elizabeth of Valois, was a keen amateur painter and in 1559 Anguissola was recruited to go to Madrid as her tutor, with the rank of lady-in-waiting. She later became an official court painter to the king, Philip II, and adapted her style to the more formal requirements of official portraits for the Spanish court. After the Queen's death, Philip helped arrange an aristocratic marriage for her. She moved to Sicily, and later Pisa and Genoa, where she continued to practice as a leading portrait painter.\nHer most distinctive and attractive paintings are her portraits of herself and her family, which she painted before she moved to the Spanish court. In particular, her depictions of children were fresh and closely observed. At the Spanish court she painted formal state portraits in the prevailing official style, as one of the first, and most successful, of the relatively few female court painters. Later in her life she also painted religious subjects, although many of her religious paintings have been lost. In 1625, she died at age 93 in Palermo.\nAnguissola's example, as much as her oeuvre, had a lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists, and her great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists. Her paintings can be seen at galleries in Boston (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), Milwaukee (Milwaukee Art Museum), Bergamo, Brescia, Budapest, Madrid (Museo del Prado), Naples, and Siena, and at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.\nHer contemporary Giorgio Vasari wrote that Anguissola \"has shown greater application and better grace than any other woman of our age in her endeavors at drawing; she has thus succeeded not only in drawing, coloring and painting from nature, and copying excellently from others, but by herself has created rare and very beautiful paintings.\"\nFamily.\nThe origin and the name of the noble family are linked to an ancient Byzantine tradition, rich in historical details.\nAccording to this tradition, the Anguissolas are descended from the Constantinopolitan warlord Galvano Sordo or Galvano de Soardi/Sourdi (\u03a3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b4\u03b7, a family name still in use today in Greece, Constantinople and Smyrna). In 717, Galvano served in the army of the Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian, and \"with an ingenious artificial fire, contributed to liberate the city of Constantinople from the Saracens who had kept it besieged by land and sea\". This \"artificial fire\" was the so-called Greek fire, an incendiary weapon developed in the late 7th century, which was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of Constantinople from two Arab sieges, thus securing the Empire's survival.\nSince the shield of the Sourdi carried the effigy of an asp (in Latin: \"anguis\"), after Galvano's victory over the Umayyads, his brothers-in-arms and the people of Constantinople exclaimed: \"\"Anguis sola fecit victoriam\"!\", i.e.: \"The snake alone brought the victory!\" This saying became very popular, and Galvano himself was nicknamed \"Anguissola\". The Emperor eventually bestowed the Anguissola surname to all his descendants. In this regard, it has been suggested that the monogram depicted on Anguissola's miniature self-portrait may contain the family motto \"Anguis sola fecit victoriam\" or, more simply, the name of Anguissola's father, Amilcare.\nFleeing from a pestilence that raged in Constantinople, the descendants of the first Anguissola settled in Italy, intermarried with other noble families such as the Komnenoi, the Gonzagas, the Caracciolos, the Scottis and the Viscontis, and built autonomous estates in Piacenza, Cremona, Vicenza and other regions of Italy. The Anguissolas who settled in the Republic of Venice belonged to the patriciate of its capital, Venice from 1499 to 1612.\nChildhood and training.\nSofonisba Anguissola was born into a poor but ancient Italian noble family in Cremona, Lombardy in 1532, the oldest of seven children, six of whom were girls. Her father, Amilcare Anguissola, was a member of the Cremonese nobility, and her mother, Bianca Ponzone, was also of noble background. The family lived near the site of a famous 2nd century B.C. battle, the Battle of the Trebia, between the Romans and Carthaginians, and several members of the Anguissola family were named after ancient Carthaginian historical characters: Amilcare was named for the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca; he named his first daughter after the tragic Carthaginian figure Sophonisba and his only son Asdrubale after the warlord Hasdrubal Barca. Amilcare Anguissola, inspired by Baldassare Castiglione's book \"The Book of the Courtier\", encouraged all his daughters (Sofonisba, Elena, Lucia, Europa, Minerva and Anna Maria) to cultivate and perfect their talents. Four of her sisters (Elena, Lucia, Europa and Anna Maria) also became painters, but Anguissola was by far the most accomplished and renowned and taught her younger siblings. Elena (c.\u20091532 \u2013 1584) abandoned painting to become a nun. Both Anna Maria and Europa gave up art upon marrying, while Lucia (1536 or 1538 \u2013 c. 1565\u20131568), the best painter of Sophonisba's sisters, died young. The remaining sister, Minerva, became a writer and Latin scholar. Asdrubale, Sophonisba's brother, studied music and Latin, but not painting.\nHer aristocratic father made sure that Anguissola and her sisters received a well-rounded education that included the fine arts. Anguissola was fourteen when her father sent her and her sister Elena to study with Bernardino Campi, a respected portrait and religious painter of the Lombard school. When, in 1550, Campi moved to Milan, Anguissola continued her studies with painter Bernardino Gatti (known as Il Sojaro), a pupil of Correggio's. Anguissola's apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art. Dates are uncertain, but Anguissola probably continued her studies under Gatti for about three years (1551\u20131553).\nOne of Anguissola's most important early works was \"Bernardino Campi Painting Sofonisba Anguissola\" (c. 1550). The unusual double portrait depicts Anguissola's art teacher in the act of painting a portrait of her.\nIn 1554, at age twenty-two, Anguissola traveled to Rome, where she spent her time sketching various scenes and people. While in Rome, she was introduced to Michelangelo by another painter who was familiar with her work. Anguissola initially showed Michelangelo a drawing of a laughing girl, but the painter challenged her to draw a weeping boy, a subject which he felt would be more challenging. Anguissola drew \"Child Bitten by a Lobster\" and sent it back to Michelangelo, who immediately recognized her talent. Michelangelo subsequently gave Anguissola sketches from his notebooks to draw in her own style and offered advice on the results. For at least two years, Anguissola continued this informal study, receiving substantial guidance from Michelangelo.\nExperiences as a female artist.\nAnguissola's education and training had different implications from those of men, since men and women worked in separate spheres. Her training was not to help her into a profession where she would compete for commissions with male artists, but to make her a better wife, companion, and mother. Although Anguissola enjoyed significantly more encouragement and support than the average woman of her day, her social class did not allow her to transcend the constraints of her sex. Without the possibility of studying anatomy or drawing from life (it was considered unacceptable for a lady to view nudes), she could not undertake the complex multi-figure compositions required for large-scale religious or history paintings.\nInstead, she experimented with new styles of portraiture, setting subjects informally. Self-portraits and family members were her most frequent subjects, as seen in such paintings as \"Self-Portrait\" (1554, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), \"Portrait of Amilcare, Minerva and Asdrubale Anguissola\" (c. 1557\u20131558, Nivaagaards Malerisambling, Niv\u00e5, Denmark), and her most famous picture, \"The Game of Chess\" (1555, National Museum in Pozna\u0144), which depicted her sisters Lucia, Minerva and Europa. Painted when Anguissola was 23 years old, \"The Game of Chess\" is an intimate representation of an everyday family scene, combining elaborate formal clothing with very informal facial expressions, which was unusual for Italian art at this time. \"The Game of Chess\" explored a new kind of genre painting which places her sisters in a domestic setting instead of the formal or allegorical settings that were popular at the time. This painting has been regarded as a conversation piece, which is an informal portrait of a group engaging in lively conversation or some activity .\nAnguissola's self-portraits also offer evidence of what she thought her place was as a woman artist. Normally, men were seen as creative actors and women as passive objects, but in her self-portrait of 1556, Anguissola presents herself as the artist, separating herself from the role as the object to be painted. Additional pieces show how she rebels against the notion that women are objects, in essence an instrument to be played by men. Her self-portrait of 1561 show her playing an instrument, taking on a different role. In her later portraits she represents multiple statuses by using a double portrait image portraying herself as an artist or a wife. \nShe became well known outside of Italy, and in 1559 King Philip II of Spain asked her to be lady-in-waiting and art teacher to Queen Elisabeth of Valois, who was only 14 at the time. Queen Elisabeth of Valois and Anguissola became good friends, and when the Queen died nine years later, Anguissola left the court because she was so sad. She had painted the entire royal family and even the Pope commissioned Anguissola to do a portrait of the Queen.\nAt the Spanish Court.\nIn 1558, already established as a painter, Anguissola went to Milan, where she painted Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. He in turn recommended her to the Spanish king, Philip II. The following year, Anguissola was invited to join the Spanish Court, which was a turning point in her career.\nAnguissola was approximately 26 when she left Italy to join the Spanish court. In the winter of 1559\u20131560, she arrived in Madrid to serve as a court painter and lady-in-waiting to the new queen, Elisabeth of Valois, Philip's third wife, who was herself an amateur portraitist. Anguissola soon gained Elisabeth's admiration and confidence and spent the following years painting many official portraits for the court, including Philip II's sister, Joanna, and his son, Don Carlos.\nThese types of painting were far more demanding than the informal portraits upon which Anguissola had based her early reputation, as it took a tremendous amount of time and energy to render the many intricate designs of the fine fabrics and elaborate jewelry associated with royal subjects. Yet despite the challenge, Anguissola's paintings of Elisabeth of Valois \u2013 and later of Anne of Austria, Philip II's fourth wife \u2013 were vibrant and full of life.\nDuring her 14-year residence, she guided the artistic development of Queen Elisabeth, and influenced the art made by her two daughters, Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catherine Michaela. Anguissola painted a portrait of the King's sister, Margaret of Parma, for Pope Pius IV in 1561 and, after Queen Elisabeth's death in childbirth in 1568, painted the likeness of Anne of Austria, Philip's fourth wife. While she continued painting portraits at the court, the Althorp \"Self-Portrait\" is the \"only securely attributed work surviving from this period\". For the royal family, Anguissola produced detailed scenes of their lives that now hang in the Prado Museum. With the gifts and a dowry of 12,000 scudi she earned along with her salary as court painter and lady-in-waiting to the Queen, she amassed an admirable return from her craft.\nWhile in the service of Elisabeth of Valois, Anguissola worked closely with Alonso Sanchez Coello. So closely in fact, that the famous painting of the middle-aged King Philip II was long attributed to Coello or Juan Pantoja de la Cruz. Only recently has Anguissola been recognized as the painting's creator.\nPersonal life.\nAfter the death of Elisabeth of Valois in 1568, Philip II took a special interest in Anguissola's future. He had wished to marry her to one of the nobles in the Spanish Court. In 1571, when she was approaching the age of 40, Anguissola entered an arranged marriage to a Sicilian nobleman chosen for her by the Spanish court. Philip II paid a dowry of 12,000 scudi for her marriage to , son of the Prince of Patern\u00f2, Viceroy of Sicily. Fabrizio was said to be supportive of her painting. Anguissola and her husband left Spain with the King's permission, and are believed to have lived in Patern\u00f2 (near Catania) from 1573 to 1579, though some recent scholarship has suggested that the couple remained in Spain. She received a royal pension of 100 ducats that enabled her to continue working and tutoring would-be painters. Her private fortune also supported her family and brother Asdrubale following Amilcare Anguissola's financial decline and death. In Patern\u00f2 she painted and donated \"La Madonna dell'Itria\".\nAnguissola's husband died in 1579 under mysterious circumstances. Two years later, while traveling to Cremona by sea, she fell in love with the ship's captain, sea merchant Orazio Lomellino. Against the wishes of her brother, they married in Pisa on 24 December 1584 and lived in Genoa until 1620. She had no children, but maintained cordial relationships with her nieces and her stepson, Giulio.\nLater years.\nLomellino's fortune, plus a generous pension from Philip II, allowed Anguissola to paint freely and live comfortably. By now quite famous, Anguissola received many colleagues who came to visit and discuss the arts with her. Several of these were younger artists, eager to learn and mimic Anguissola's distinctive style.\nIn her later life, Anguissola painted not only portraits but religious themes, as she had done in the days of her youth, although many of the latter have been lost. She was the leading portrait painter in Genoa until she moved to Palermo in her last years. In 1620 she painted her last self-portrait.\nOn 12 July 1624, Anguissola was visited by the young Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, who recorded sketches from his visit to her in his sketchbook. Van Dyck, who believed her to be 96 years of age (she was actually about 92) noted that although \"her eyesight was weakened\", Anguissola was still mentally alert. Excerpts of the advice she gave him about painting survive from this visit, and he was said to have claimed that their conversation taught him more about the \"true principles\" of painting than anything else in his life. Van Dyck drew her portrait while visiting her. This last portrait made of Anguissola survives on public display at Knole. The next year, she returned to Sicily.\nAnguissola became a wealthy patron of the arts after the weakening of her sight. In 1625, she died at age 93 in Palermo.\nAnguissola's adoring second husband, who described her as small of frame, yet \"great among mortals\", buried her with honor in Palermo at the Church of San Giorgio dei Genovesi. Seven years later, on the anniversary of what would have been her 100th birthday, her husband placed an inscription on her tomb that read in part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Sofonisba, my wife, who is recorded among the illustrious women of the world, outstanding in portraying the images of man. Orazio Lomellino, in sorrow for the loss of his great love, in 1632, dedicated this little tribute to such a great woman.\u2014\u200a\nStyle.\nThe influence of Campi, whose reputation was based on portraiture, is evident in Anguissola's early works, such as the \"Self-Portrait\" (Florence, Uffizi). Her work was akin to the worldly tradition of Cremona, influenced greatly by the art of Parma and Mantua, in which even religious works were imbued with extreme delicacy and charm. From Gatti she seems to have absorbed elements reminiscent of Correggio, beginning a trend in Cremonese painting of the late 16th century. This new direction is reflected in \"Lucia, Minerva and Europa Anguissola Playing Chess\" (1555; National Museum in Pozna\u0144) in which portraiture merges into a quasi-genre scene, a characteristic derived from Brescian models.\nThe main body of Anguissola's earlier work consists of self-portraits (the many \"autoritratti\" reflect the fact that portraits of her were frequently requested due to her fame) and portraits of her family, which are considered by many to be her finest works.\nApproximately fifty works have been attributed to Anguissola. Her paintings can be seen at galleries in Baltimore (Walters Art Museum), Bergamo, Berlin (Gem\u00e4ldegalerie), Graz (Joanneum Alte Galerie), Madrid (Museo del Prado), Milan (Pinacoteca di Brera), Milwaukee (Milwaukee Art Museum), Naples (National Museum of Capodimonte), Pozna\u0144 (National Museum, Pozna\u0144), Siena (Pinacoteca Nazionale), Southampton (Southampton City Art Gallery), and Vienna (Kunsthistorisches Museum).\nHistorical significance.\nSofonisba Anguissola's oeuvre had a lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists. Her portrait of Queen Elisabeth of Valois with a zibellino (the pelt of a marten set with a head and feet of jewelled gold) was widely copied by many of the finest artists of the time, such as Peter Paul Rubens, while Caravaggio allegedly took inspiration from Anguissola's work for his \"Boy Bitten by a Lizard\".\nAnguissola is significant to feminist art historians. Although there has never been a period in Western history in which women were completely absent in the visual arts, Anguissola's great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists; Lavinia Fontana expressed in a letter written in 1579 that she and another woman, Irene di Spilimbergo, had \"set [their] heart[s] on learning how to paint\" after seeing one of Anguissola's portraits. Some of her more well-known successors include Lavinia Fontana, Barbara Longhi, Fede Galizia and Artemisia Gentileschi.\nA Cremonese school bears the name Liceo Statale Sofonisba Anguissola.\nAmerican artist Charles Willson Peale (1741\u20131827) named his daughter Sophonisba Angusciola (1786\u20131859; married name Sellers). She became a painter and a quilter whose works are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nCrater.\nOn 4 August 2017 a crater on Mercury was named after her.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has since been ported to numerous computer platforms, handheld devices, and even TiVo, with new versions as of 2016.\nHistory.\n\"SameGame\" was originally created as \"Chain Shot!\" in 1985 by Kuniaki Moribe. It was distributed for Fujitsu's FM-8 and FM-7 platforms in a Japanese monthly personal computer magazine called \"Gekkan ASCII\". In 1992, the game was ported as \"SameGame\" to Unix platforms by Eiji Fukumoto, to the NEC PC-9801 series by Wataru Yoshioka, and to Macintosh as \"ChainShot!\" by Eiichiro Mawatari. In 1993, it was ported to Windows 3.1 by Ikuo Hirohata. This version was translated into English by Hitoshi Ozawa, and is still available from his software archive.\nIn 1994, Takahiro Sumiya ported it to Macintosh. This version has some gameplay differences\u2014a choice of between two and five colors\u2014and is probably the most widely distributed of the original series. It was the basis for the \"Same Gnome\" and \"KSame\" variations created for Linux.\nIn 2001, Biedl et al. proved that deciding the solvability (whether all blocks can be removed) of 1-column (or 1-row) 2-colour Clickomania can be done in linear time. Deciding the solvability of 2-column, 5-colour Clickomania is NP-complete. Deciding the solvability of 5-column 3-colour Clickomania is also NP-complete. Follow-up work in 2015 by Adler et al. proved that deciding the solvability of Clickomania is hard even in the 2-column 2-colour case, as well as parameterized complexity results on determining whether an instance of size \"n\" is solvable in \"k\" or fewer clicks.\nGameplay.\nGame mechanics.\n\"SameGame\" is played on a rectangular field, typically initially filled with four or five kinds of blocks placed at random. By selecting a group of adjoining blocks of the same color, a player may remove them from the screen. Blocks that are no longer supported will fall down, and a column without any blocks will be trimmed away by other columns always sliding to one side (often the left). The goal of the game is to remove as many blocks from the playing field as possible.\nIn most versions, there are no time constraints during the game. However, some implementations gradually push the rows upward or drop blocks from above. Sometimes the player can control the number and timing of blocks that drop from above in certain ways. For example, on some implementations for the iOS, this can be done by shaking the device. The game ends if a timer runs out or if no more blocks can be removed. Some versions, including some versions for Windows Mobile, include both portrait and landscape orientations.\nVariations.\nIn one variation, the game starts with no blocks on the field. Blocks fall down to the playing field, and must be removed before they reach the top. If they reach the top and overflow, the game is over. In some variations, such as \"Bubble Bang\", circles or balls are used instead of blocks\u2014which alters the gameplay, as the balls form different shapes than square blocks.\nIn three-dimensional variants, the playing field is a cube (containing smaller cubes) instead of a rectangle, and the player has the ability to rotate the cube. \"Cubes\" for iPhone OS uses this approach.\nSome versions allow the player to rotate the playing field 90\u00a0degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise, which causes one of two things to happen:\nIn some variations, blocks can be removed when connected to blocks of the same color diagonally, not just horizontally and vertically. Some versions introduce new types of blocks. The different types of blocks interact in various ways with the play field; for example, one type might remove all the blocks in a row. An example of this is the \"Revenge mode\" in \"PocketPop Revenge\" (\"PocketFun\") for iPhone OS.\nScoring.\nMost versions of the game give formula_1 points for removing formula_2 tiles at once, where formula_3 or formula_4, depending on the implementation. For instance, \"Insane Game\" for Texas Instruments calculators uses formula_5; Ikuo Hirohata's implementation uses the formula formula_6. The \"Bubble Breaker\" implementation for Windows Mobile uses the formula_7 formula. The 2001 version released by Jeff Reno uses the formula formula_8.\nSome versions also offer a large bonus for removing all blocks from the screen, or leaving no more than a certain number of blocks. Others reduce the final score based on the number of blocks remaining at the end of the game. Some game versions award bonus points for clearing the field quickly, encouraging faster play. The faster the player finishes the level, the bigger the bonus. Still others offer combination, or \"chain\", bonuses for clearing the same color of blocks two or more times in succession.\nAnother scoring technique awards bonus points for each chain of a certain color that has a certain number of blocks (for example, two red blocks or 11 blue blocks). After receiving the bonus once, sometimes the bonus condition changes. \"BPop\" uses this scoring variation.\nSome versions have a simple scoring system: each block removed is worth one point, and there is no bonus for removing more than two blocks at a time. This is seen in the \"Same Pets\" and \"Same Hearths\" variants.\nGoal-based scoring.\nSome versions award scores based on the attainment of goals. This is typically seen in multi-level versions of the game. There are four primary scoring systems for such games.\nIn one variation, each level has a target score. The player's score starts at zero, and the player must reach the target score. At the beginning of each level, the player's score is reset to zero; the target score increases with each level.\nOther versions have a cumulative target score. In these versions, the player's score carries over from level to level. As a result, if the player substantially exceeds the target score on a given level, they may enter the subsequent level having already met that level's target score, as well. \"BPop\" has a cumulative target score.\nSome versions maintain the same target score for each level; such variations can be played indefinitely. In such games, the player typically loses due to poor planning or a lapse in concentration. Examples of such games are \"Same Pets\" and \"Same Hearths\".\nIn games without a goal score, like \"Bonkers for iPhone\" and SameGameBros for iPhone, the goal is to clear the level completely. The game ends when the player fails to do so.\nVisuals.\nBlocks typically appear as colored squares, circles, or spheres. Some variations use gradient shading to give the illusion of dimensionality. Other tile themes, or \"skins\", include animals, hearts, stars, faces, Lego blocks, and jelly bears. Designs may follow a theme, such as Christmas or monochrome. Most games have only one skin, but others allow choosing from multiple skins.\nThere is a special visual aspect in some versions; instead of separate blocks, games like \"iDrops\" and \"SameGameManiak\" feature bordered areas for adjacent blocks of the same color. Some have elaborate tile graphics, featuring pictures or patterns inside the tile, like \"KSame\" and \"Same GNOME\".\n The SameGame concept can be extended to a \"Reveal the picture\" game. A picture or photo is behind the blocks; it becomes increasingly visible as blocks are removed, until it is completely revealed. Examples include \"Same Pets\", \"Same Hearts\" and the Nissan Cube promotional app for iPhone.\n Some games feature animation of one or more game events, such as cleared tiles bursting or exploding, or scoring animations (\"BPop\", \"Bubblets Tilt\").\n Some versions display which blocks are selected with a border around them (\"BPop\"), jittering of the blocks (\"BPop\"), or an increase of the size of the selected blocks (\"Bubblets Tilt\"). If the blocks are deselected (usually by dragging away from them, or tapping another block chain or a single block), the highlight is removed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28764", "revid": "51007973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28764", "title": "Serotonin", "text": "Monoamine neurotransmitter\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox drug/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nSerotonin (), also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a monoamine neurotransmitter with a wide range of functions in both the central nervous system (CNS) and also peripheral tissues. It is involved in mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction. In the CNS, serotonin regulates mood, appetite, and sleep.\nMost of the body's serotonin\u2014about 90%\u2014is synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract by enterochromaffin cells, where it regulates intestinal movements. It is also produced in smaller amounts in the brainstem's raphe nuclei, the skin's Merkel cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, and taste receptor cells of the tongue. Once secreted, serotonin is taken up by platelets in the blood, which release it during clotting to promote vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. Around 8% of the body's serotonin is stored in platelets, and 1\u20132% is found in the CNS.\nSerotonin acts as both a vasoconstrictor and vasodilator depending on concentration and context, influencing hemostasis and blood pressure regulation. It plays a role in stimulating myenteric neurons and enhancing gastrointestinal motility through uptake and release cycles in platelets and surrounding tissue. Biochemically, serotonin is an indoleamine synthesized from tryptophan and metabolized primarily in the liver to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).\nSerotonin is targeted by several classes of antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which block reabsorption in the synapse to elevate its levels. It is found in nearly all bilateral animals, including insects, spiders and worms, and also occurs in fungi and plants. In plants and insect venom, it serves a defensive function by inducing pain. Serotonin released by pathogenic amoebae may cause diarrhea in the human gut, while its presence in seeds and fruits is thought to stimulate digestion and facilitate seed dispersal.\nMolecular structure.\nBiochemically, the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan, via the (rate-limiting) hydroxylation of the 5\u00a0position on the ring (forming the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan), and then decarboxylation to produce serotonin. Preferable conformations are defined via ethylamine chain, resulting in six different conformations.\nCrystal structure.\nSerotonin crystallizes in P212121 chiral space group forming different hydrogen-bonding interactions between serotonin molecules via N-H...O and O-H...N intermolecular bonds. Serotonin also forms several salts, including pharmaceutical formulation of serotonin adipate.\nBiological role.\nSerotonin is involved in numerous physiological processes, including sleep, thermoregulation, learning and memory, pain, (social) behavior, sexual activity, feeding, motor activity, neural development, and biological rhythms. In less complex animals, such as some invertebrates, serotonin regulates feeding and other processes. In plants serotonin synthesis seems to be associated with stress signals. Despite its longstanding prominence in pharmaceutical advertising, the claim that low serotonin levels cause depression is not supported by scientific evidence.\nCellular effects.\nSerotonin primarily acts through its receptors and its effects depend on which cells and tissues express these receptors.\nMetabolism involves first oxidation by monoamine oxidase to 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL). The rate-limiting step is hydride transfer from serotonin to the flavin cofactor. There follows oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the indole acetic-acid derivative. The latter is then excreted by the kidneys.\nReceptors.\nThe serotonin receptors are located on the cell membrane of nerve cells and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the endogenous ligand and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and psychedelic drugs. There are currently 14known serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1 (1A, 1B, 1D, 1E, 1F), 5-HT2 (2A, 2B, 2C), 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5 (5A, 5B), 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. Except for the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, all other 5-HT receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an intracellular second messenger cascade. The 5-HT5B receptor is present in rodents but not in humans.\nIn addition to the serotonin receptors, serotonin is an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) in some species. It is a weak TAAR1 partial agonist in rats, but is inactive at the TAAR1 in mice and humans.\nThe cryo-EM structures of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with serotonin, as well as with various serotonergic psychedelics, have been solved and published by Bryan L. Roth and colleagues.\nTermination.\nSerotonergic action is terminated primarily via uptake of 5-HT from the synapse. This is accomplished through the specific monoamine transporter for 5-HT, SERT, on the presynaptic neuron. Various agents can inhibit 5-HT reuptake, including cocaine, dextromethorphan (an antitussive), tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A 2006 study found that a significant portion of 5-HT's synaptic clearance is due to the selective activity of the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) which actively transports the molecule across the membrane and back into the presynaptic cell.\nIn contrast to the high affinity of SERT, the PMAT has been identified as a low-affinity transporter, with an apparent \"K\"m of 114 micromoles/l for serotonin, which is approximately 230 times higher than that of SERT. However, the PMAT, despite its relatively low serotonergic affinity, has a considerably higher transport \"capacity\" than SERT, \"resulting in roughly comparable uptake efficiencies to SERT ... in heterologous expression systems.\" The study also suggests that the administration of SSRIs such as fluoxetine and sertraline may be associated with an inhibitory effect on PMAT activity when used at higher than normal dosages (IC50 test values used in trials were 3\u20134 fold higher than typical prescriptive dosage).\nSerotonylation.\nSerotonin can also signal through a nonreceptor mechanism called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins. This process underlies serotonin's effects upon platelet-forming cells (thrombocytes) in which it links to the modification of signaling enzymes called GTPases that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by exocytosis. A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin.\nThe effects of serotonin upon vascular smooth muscle tone\u00a0\u2013 the biological function after which serotonin was originally named\u00a0\u2013 depend upon the serotonylation of proteins involved in the contractile apparatus of muscle cells.\nNervous system.\nThe neurons of the raphe nuclei are the principal source of 5-HT release in the brain. There are nine raphe nuclei, designated B1\u2013B9, which contain the majority of serotonin-containing neurons (some scientists chose to group the \"nuclei raphes lineares\" into one nucleus), all of which are located along the midline of the brainstem, and centered on the reticular formation. Axons from the neurons of the raphe nuclei form a neurotransmitter system reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the cerebellum and spinal cord, while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.\nIt is the dorsal part of the raphe nucleus that contains neurons projecting to the central nervous system. Serotonin-releasing neurons in this area receive input from a large number of areas, notably from prefrontal cortex, lateral habenula, preoptic area, substantia nigra and amygdala. These neurons are thought to communicate the expectation of rewards in the near future, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning.\nUltrastructure and function.\nThe serotonin nuclei may also be divided into two main groups, the rostral and caudal containing three and four nuclei respectively. The rostral group consists of the caudal linear nuclei (B8), the dorsal raphe nuclei (B6 and B7) and the median raphe nuclei (B5, B8 and B9), that project into multiple cortical and subcortical structures. The caudal group consists of the nucleus raphe magnus (B3), raphe obscurus nucleus (B2), raphe pallidus nucleus (B1), and lateral medullary reticular formation, that project into the brainstem.\nThe serotonergic pathway is involved in sensorimotor function, with pathways projecting both into cortical (Dorsal and Median Raphe Nuclei), subcortical, and spinal areas involved in motor activity. Pharmacological manipulation suggests that serotonergic activity increases with motor activity while firing rates of serotonergic neurons increase with intense visual stimuli. Animal models suggest that kainate signaling negatively regulates serotonin actions in the retina, with possible implications for the control of the visual system. The descending projections form a pathway that inhibits pain called the \"descending inhibitory pathway\" that may be relevant to a disorder such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and other pain disorders, and the efficacy of antidepressants in them.\nSerotonergic projections from the caudal nuclei are involved in regulating mood and emotion, and hypo- or hyper-serotonergic states may be involved in depression and sickness behavior.\nMicroanatomy.\nSerotonin is released into the synapse, or space between neurons, and diffuses over a relatively wide gap (&gt;20\u00a0nm) to activate 5-HT receptors located on the dendrites, cell bodies, and presynaptic terminals of adjacent neurons.\nWhen humans smell food, dopamine is released to increase the appetite. But, unlike in worms, serotonin does not increase anticipatory behaviour in humans; instead, the serotonin released while consuming activates 5-HT2C receptors on dopamine-producing cells. This halts their dopamine release, and thereby serotonin decreases appetite. Drugs that block 5-HT2C receptors make the body unable to recognize when it is no longer hungry or otherwise in need of nutrients, and are associated with weight gain, especially in people with a low number of receptors. The expression of 5-HT2C receptors in the hippocampus follows a diurnal rhythm, just as the serotonin release in the ventromedial nucleus, which is characterised by a peak at morning when the motivation to eat is strongest.\nIn macaques, alpha males have twice the level of serotonin in the brain as subordinate males and females (measured by the concentration of 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Dominance status and CSF serotonin levels appear to be positively correlated. When dominant males were removed from such groups, subordinate males begin competing for dominance. Once new dominance hierarchies were established, serotonin levels of the new dominant individuals also increased to double those in subordinate males and females. The reason why serotonin levels are only high in dominant males, but not dominant females has not yet been established.\nIn humans, levels of 5-HT1A receptor inhibition in the brain show negative correlation with aggression, and a mutation in the gene that codes for the 5-HT2A receptor may double the risk of suicide for those with that genotype. Serotonin in the brain is not usually degraded after use, but is collected by serotonergic neurons by serotonin transporters on their cell surfaces. Studies have revealed nearly 10% of total variance in anxiety-related personality depends on variations in the description of where, when and how many serotonin transporters the neurons should deploy.\nOutside the nervous system.\nDigestive tract (emetic).\nSerotonin regulates gastrointestinal (GI) function. The gut is surrounded by enterochromaffin cells, which release serotonin in response to food in the lumen. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the veins draining the gut collect excess serotonin. There are often serotonin abnormalities in gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.\nIf irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone that stimulate vomiting. Thus, drugs and toxins stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in the gut wall which can induce emesis. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to irradiation and cancer chemotherapy. Drugs that block 5HT3 are very effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.\nLungs.\nThe lung, including that of reptiles, contains specialized epithelial cells that occur as solitary cells or as clusters called neuroepithelial bodies or bronchial Kulchitsky cells or alternatively \"K cells\". These are enterochromaffin cells that like those in the gut release serotonin. Their function is probably vasoconstriction during hypoxia.\nSkin.\nSerotonin is also produced by Merkel cells which are part of the somatosensory system.\nBone metabolism.\nIn mice and humans, alterations in serotonin levels and signalling have been shown to regulate bone mass. Mice that lack brain serotonin have osteopenia, while mice that lack gut serotonin have high bone density. In humans, increased blood serotonin levels have been shown to be a significant negative predictor of low bone density. Serotonin can also be synthesized, albeit at very low levels, in the bone cells. It mediates its actions on bone cells using three different receptors. Through 5-HT1B receptors, it negatively regulates bone mass, while it does so positively through 5-HT2B receptors and 5-HT2C receptors. There is very delicate balance between physiological role of gut serotonin and its pathology. Increase in the extracellular content of serotonin results in a complex relay of signals in the osteoblasts culminating in FoxO1/ Creb and ATF4 dependent transcriptional events. Following the 2008 findings that gut serotonin regulates bone mass, the mechanistic investigations into what regulates serotonin synthesis from the gut in the regulation of bone mass have started. Piezo1 has been shown to sense RNA in the gut and relay this information through serotonin synthesis to the bone by acting as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) governing 5-HT production. Intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of mouse \"Piezo1\" profoundly disturbed gut peristalsis, impeded experimental colitis, and suppressed serum 5-HT levels. Because of systemic 5-HT deficiency, conditional knockout of \"Piezo1\" increased bone formation. Notably, fecal ssRNA was identified as a natural Piezo1 ligand, and ssRNA-stimulated 5-HT synthesis from the gut was evoked in a MyD88/TRIF-independent manner. Colonic infusion of RNase A suppressed gut motility and increased bone mass. These findings suggest gut ssRNA as a master determinant of systemic 5-HT levels, indicating the ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential prophylactic target for treatment of bone and gut disorders. Studies in 2008, 2010 and 2019 have opened the potential for serotonin research to treat bone mass disorders.\nOrgan development.\nSince serotonin signals resource availability it is not surprising that it affects organ development. Many human and animal studies have shown that nutrition in early life can influence, in adulthood, such things as body fatness, blood lipids, blood pressure, atherosclerosis, behavior, learning, and longevity. Rodent experiment shows that neonatal exposure to SSRIs makes persistent changes in the serotonergic transmission of the brain resulting in behavioral changes, which are reversed by treatment with antidepressants. By treating normal and knockout mice lacking the serotonin transporter with fluoxetine scientists showed that normal emotional reactions in adulthood, like a short latency to escape foot shocks and inclination to explore new environments were dependent on active serotonin transporters during the neonatal period.\nHuman serotonin can also act as a growth factor directly. Liver damage increases cellular expression of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, mediating liver compensatory regrowth (see ) Serotonin present in the blood then stimulates cellular growth to repair liver damage.\n5-HT2B receptors also activate osteocytes, which build up bone However, serotonin also inhibits osteoblasts, through 5-HT1B receptors.\nCardiovascular growth factor.\nSerotonin, in addition, evokes endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation and stimulates, through a 5-HT1B receptor-mediated mechanism, the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures. In blood, serotonin is collected from plasma by platelets, which store it. It is thus active wherever platelets bind in damaged tissue, as a vasoconstrictor to stop bleeding, and also as a fibrocyte mitotic (growth factor), to aid healing.\nAdipose tissue.\nSerotonin also regulates white and brown adipose tissue function, and adipocytes are capable of producing 5-HT separately from the gut. Serotonin increases lipogenesis through HTR2A in white adipose tissue, and suppressed thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue via Htr3.\nPharmacology.\nSeveral classes of drugs target the serotonin system, including some antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, analgesics, antimigraine drugs, oxytocics, antiemetics, appetite suppressants, and anticonvulsants, as well as psychedelics and entactogens.\nMechanism of action.\nAt rest, serotonin is stored within the vesicles of presynaptic neurons. When stimulated by nerve impulses, serotonin is released as a neurotransmitter into the synapse, reversibly binding to the postsynaptic receptor to induce a nerve impulse on the postsynaptic neuron. Serotonin can also bind to auto-receptors on the presynaptic neuron to regulate the synthesis and release of serotonin. Normally serotonin is taken back into the presynaptic neuron to stop its action, then reused or broken down by monoamine oxidase.\nAntidepressants.\nDrugs that alter serotonin levels are used in treating depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters (including serotonin), and therefore increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. MAOI therapy is associated with many adverse drug reactions, and patients are at risk of hypertensive emergency triggered by foods with high tyramine content, and certain drugs. Some drugs inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making it stay in the synaptic cleft longer. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. The newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have fewer side-effects and fewer interactions with other drugs.\nCertain SSRI medications have been shown to lower serotonin levels below the baseline after chronic use, despite initial increases. The \"5-HTTLPR\" gene codes for the number of serotonin transporters in the brain, with more serotonin transporters causing decreased duration and magnitude of serotonergic signaling. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (l/l) causing more serotonin transporters to be formed is also found to be more resilient against depression and anxiety.\nBesides their use in treating depression and anxiety, certain serotonergic antidepressants are also approved and used to treat fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome.\nAnxiolytics.\nAzapirone anxiolytics like buspirone and tandospirone act as serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists.\nAntipsychotics.\nMany antipsychotics bind to and modulate serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, among others. Activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and blockade of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the therapeutic antipsychotic effects of these agents, whereas antagonism of serotonin 5-HT2C receptors has been especially implicated in side effects of antipsychotics.\nAntimigraine agents.\nAntimigraine agents such as the triptans like sumatriptan act as agonists of the serotonin 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and/or 5-HT1F receptors. Earlier antimigraine agents were the ergoline derivatives and ergot-related drugs such as ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, and methysergide, which act as non-selective serotonin receptor agonists.\nOxytocics.\nCertain lysergamides like ergometrine and methylergometrine are used clinically as oxytocic agents. The oxytocic effects of these drugs are thought to most likely be mediated by agonism of serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in uterine smooth muscle tissue.\nAntiemetics.\nSome serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, are important antiemetic agents. They are particularly important in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting.\nAppetite suppressants.\nSome serotonin releasing agents, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and/or serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists, such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, chlorphentermine, sibutramine, and lorcaserin, have been approved and used as appetite suppressants for purposes of weight loss in the treatment of overweightness or obesity. Several of the preceding agents have been withdrawn from the market due to toxicity, such as cardiac fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension.\nAnticonvulsants.\nAlthough it was previously withdrawn from the market as an appetite suppressant, fenfluramine was reintroduced as an anticonvulsant for treatment of seizures in certain rare forms of epilepsy like Dravet syndrome and Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome. Selective serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists, like lorcaserin, bexicaserin, and BMB-101, are also being developed for this use.\nPsychedelics.\nSerotonergic psychedelics, including drugs like psilocybin (found in psilocybin mushrooms), dimethyltryptamine (DMT) (found in ayahuasca), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline (found in peyote cactus), and 5-MeO-DMT (found in \"Anadenanthera\" trees and the \"Bufo alvarius\" toad), are non-selective agonists of the serotonin receptors and mediate their hallucinogenic effects specifically by activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. This is evidenced by the fact that serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists and so-called \"trip killers\" like ketanserin block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics in humans, among many other findings. Some serotonergic psychedelics, like psilocin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT, are substituted tryptamines and are very similar in chemical structure to serotonin.\nSerotonin itself, despite acting as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, is thought to be non-hallucinogenic. The hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics appear to be mediated by activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors expressed in a population of cortical neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, unlike most serotonin and related receptors, are expressed intracellularly. In addition, the neurons containing them lack expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT), which normally transports serotonin from the extracellular space to the intracellular space within neurons. Serotonin itself is too hydrophilic to enter serotonergic neurons without the SERT, and hence these serotonin 5-HT2A receptors are inaccessible to serotonin. Conversely, serotonergic psychedelics are more lipophilic than serotonin and readily enter these neurons. In addition to explaining why serotonin does not show psychedelic effects, these findings may explain why drugs that increase serotonin levels, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and various other types of serotonergic agents, do not produce psychedelic effects. Artificial expression of the SERT in these medial prefrontal cortex neurons resulted in the serotonin releasing agent \"para\"-chloroamphetamine (PCA), which does not normally show psychedelic-like effects, being able to produce psychedelic-like effects in animals.\nAlthough serotonin itself is non-hallucinogenic, administration of very high doses of a serotonin precursor, like tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), or intracerebroventricular injection of high doses of serotonin directly into the brain, can produce psychedelic-like effects in animals. These psychedelic-like effects can be abolished by indolethylamine \"N\"-methyltransferase (INMT) inhibitors, which block conversion of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines into \"N\"-methylated tryptamines, including \"N\"-methylserotonin (NMS; norbufotenin), bufotenin (5-hydroxy-\"N\",\"N\"-dimethyltryptamine; 5-HO-DMT), \"N\"-methyltryptamine (NMT), and \"N\",\"N\"-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). These \"N\"-methyltryptamines are much more lipophilic than serotonin and, in contrast, are able to diffuse into serotonergic neurons and activate intracellular serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Another possible metabolite of serotonin with psychedelic-like effects in animals is 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT).\nDMT is a naturally occurring endogenous compound in the body. In relation to the fact that serotonin itself is unable to activate intracellular serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, it is possible that DMT might be the endogenous ligand of these receptors rather than serotonin.\nEntactogens.\nThe entactogen MDMA is a serotonin releasing agent and, while it also possesses other actions such as concomitant release of norepinephrine and dopamine and weak direct agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, its serotonin release plays a key role in its unique entactogenic effects. Entactogens like MDMA should be distinguished from other drugs such as stimulants like amphetamine and psychedelics like LSD, although MDMA itself also has some characteristics of both of these types of agents. Coadministration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which block the serotonin transporter (SERT) and prevent MDMA from inducing serotonin release, markedly reduce the subjective effects of MDMA, demonstrating the key role of serotonin in the effects of the drug. Serotonin releasing agents like MDMA achieve much greater increases in serotonin levels than SSRIs and have far more robust of subjective effects. Besides MDMA, many other entactogens also exist and are known.\nSerotonin syndrome.\nExtremely high levels of serotonin or activation of certain serotonin receptors can cause a condition known as serotonin syndrome, with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an overdose of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an SSRI with a MAOI, which may occur in therapeutic doses. However, serotonin syndrome can occur with overdose of certain serotonin receptor agonists, like the NBOMe series of serotonergic psychedelics.\nThe intensity of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome vary over a wide spectrum, and the milder forms are seen even at nontoxic levels. It is estimated that 14% of patients experiencing serotonin syndrome overdose on SSRIs; while the fatality rate is between 2% and 12%.\nCardiac fibrosis and other fibroses.\nSome serotonergic agonist drugs cause fibrosis anywhere in the body, particularly the syndrome of retroperitoneal fibrosis, as well as cardiac valve fibrosis.\nIn the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs (ergotamine and methysergide), the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, chlorphentermine, and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors. These include pergolide and cabergoline, but not the more dopamine-specific lisuride.\nAs with fenfluramine, some of these drugs have been withdrawn from the market after groups taking them showed a statistical increase of one or more of the side effects described. An example is pergolide. The drug was declining in use since it was reported in 2003 to be associated with cardiac fibrosis.\nTwo independent studies published in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" in January 2007 implicated pergolide, along with cabergoline, in causing valvular heart disease. As a result of this, the FDA removed pergolide from the United States market in March 2007. (Since cabergoline is not approved in the United States for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. Treatment for hyperprolactinemia requires lower doses than that for Parkinson's Disease, diminishing the risk of valvular heart disease).\nComparative biology and evolution.\nUnicellular organisms.\nSerotonin is used by a variety of single-cell organisms for various purposes. SSRIs have been found to be toxic to algae. The gastrointestinal parasite \"Entamoeba histolytica\" secretes serotonin, causing a sustained secretory diarrhea in some people. Patients infected with \"E. histolytica\" have been found to have highly elevated serum serotonin levels, which returned to normal following resolution of the infection. \"E. histolytica\" also responds to the presence of serotonin by becoming more virulent. This means serotonin secretion not only serves to increase the spread of entamoebas by giving the host diarrhea but also serves to coordinate their behaviour according to their population density, a phenomenon known as quorum sensing. Outside the gut of a host, there is nothing that the entamoebas provoke to release serotonin, hence the serotonin concentration is very low. Low serotonin signals to the entamoebas they are outside a host and they become less virulent to conserve energy. When they enter a new host, they multiply in the gut, and become more virulent as the enterochromaffine cells get provoked by them and the serotonin concentration increases.\nEdible plants and mushrooms.\nIn drying seeds, serotonin production is a way to get rid of the buildup of poisonous ammonia. The ammonia is collected and placed in the indole part of -tryptophan, which is then decarboxylated by tryptophan decarboxylase to give tryptamine, which is then hydroxylated by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, yielding serotonin.\nHowever, since serotonin is a major gastrointestinal tract modulator, it may be produced in the fruits of plants as a way of speeding the passage of seeds through the digestive tract, in the same way as many well-known seed and fruit associated laxatives. Serotonin is found in mushrooms, fruits, and vegetables. The highest values of 25\u2013400\u00a0mg/kg have been found in nuts of the walnut (\"Juglans\") and hickory (\"Carya\") genera. Serotonin concentrations of 3\u201330\u00a0mg/kg have been found in plantains, pineapples, banana, kiwifruit, plums, and tomatoes. Moderate levels from 0.1\u20133\u00a0mg/kg have been found in a wide range of tested vegetables.\nSerotonin is one compound of the poison contained in stinging nettles (\"Urtica dioica\"), where it causes pain on injection in the same manner as its presence in insect venoms. It is also naturally found in \"Paramuricea clavata\", or the Red Sea Fan.\nSerotonin and tryptophan have been found in chocolate with varying cocoa contents. The highest serotonin content (2.93\u00a0\u03bcg/g) was found in chocolate with 85% cocoa, and the highest tryptophan content (13.27\u201313.34\u00a0\u03bcg/g) was found in 70\u201385% cocoa. The intermediate in the synthesis from tryptophan to serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, was not found.\nRoot development in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is stimulated and modulated by serotonin \u2013 in various ways at various concentrations.\nSerotonin serves as a plant defense chemical against fungi. When infected with Fusarium crown rot (\"Fusarium pseudograminearum\"), wheat (\"Triticum aestivum\") greatly increases its production of tryptophan to synthesize new serotonin. The function of this is poorly understood but wheat also produces serotonin when infected by \"Stagonospora nodorum\" \u2013 in that case to retard spore production. The model cereal \"Brachypodium distachyon\" \u2013 used as a research substitute for wheat and other production cereals \u2013 also produces serotonin, coumaroyl-serotonin, and feruloyl-serotonin in response to \"F. graminearum\". This produces a slight antimicrobial effect. \"B.\u00a0distachyon\" produces more serotonin (and conjugates) in response to deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing \"F. graminearum\" than non-DON-producing. \"Solanum lycopersicum\" produces many AA conjugates \u2013 including several of serotonin \u2013 in its leaves, stems, and roots in response to \"Ralstonia solanacearum\" infection.\nSerotonin occurs in several hallucinogenic mushrooms of the genus \"Panaeolus\".\nInvertebrates.\nSerotonin functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals.\nNematodes.\nFor example, in the roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", which feeds on bacteria, serotonin is released as a signal in response to positive events, such as finding a new source of food or in male animals finding a female with which to mate. When a well-fed worm feels bacteria on its cuticle, dopamine is released, which slows it down; if it is starved, serotonin also is released, which slows the animal down further. This mechanism increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. The released serotonin activates the muscles used for feeding, while octopamine suppresses them. Serotonin diffuses to serotonin-sensitive neurons, which control the animal's perception of nutrient availability.\nDecapods.\nIf lobsters are injected with serotonin, they behave like dominant individuals whereas octopamine causes subordinate behavior. A crayfish that is frightened may flip its tail to flee, and the effect of serotonin on this behavior depends largely on the animal's social status. Serotonin inhibits the fleeing reaction in subordinates, but enhances it in socially dominant or isolated individuals. The reason for this is social experience alters the proportion between serotonin receptors (5-HT receptors) that have opposing effects on the fight-or-flight response. The effect of 5-HT1 receptors predominates in subordinate animals, while 5-HT2 receptors predominates in dominants.\nIn venoms.\nSerotonin is a common component of invertebrate venoms, salivary glands, nervous tissues, and various other tissues, across molluscs, insects, crustaceans, scorpions, various kinds of worms, and jellyfish. Adult \"Rhodnius prolixus\" \u2013 hematophagous on vertebrates \u2013 secrete lipocalins into the wound during feeding. In 2003 these lipocalins were demonstrated to sequester serotonin to prevent vasoconstriction (and possibly coagulation) in the host.\nInsects.\nSerotonin is evolutionarily conserved and appears across the animal kingdom. It is seen in insect processes in roles similar to in the human central nervous system, such as memory, appetite, sleep, and behavior. Some circuits in mushroom bodies are serotonergic. (See specific \"Drosophila\" example below, \u00a7Dipterans.)\nAcrididae.\nLocust swarming is initiated \"but not maintained\" by serotonin, with release being triggered by tactile contact between individuals. This transforms social preference from aversion to a gregarious state that enables coherent groups. Learning in flies and honeybees is affected by the presence of serotonin.\nRole in insecticides.\nInsect 5-HT receptors have similar sequences to the vertebrate versions, but pharmacological differences have been seen. Invertebrate drug response has been far less characterized than mammalian pharmacology and the potential for species selective insecticides has been discussed.\nHymenopterans.\nWasps and hornets have serotonin in their venom, which causes pain and inflammation as do scorpions. \"Pheidole dentata\" takes on more and more tasks in the colony as it gets older, which requires it to respond to more and more olfactory cues in the course of performing them. This olfactory response broadening was demonstrated to go along with increased serotonin and dopamine, but not octopamine in 2006.\nDipterans.\nIf flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently. In their crops it plays a vital role in digestive motility produced by contraction. Serotonin that acts on the crop is exogenous to the crop itself and 2012 research suggested that it probably originated in the serotonin neural plexus in the thoracic-abdominal synganglion. In 2011 a \"Drosophila\" serotonergic mushroom body was found to work in concert with \"Amnesiac\" to form memories. In 2007 serotonin was found to promote aggression in \"Diptera\", which was counteracted by neuropeptide F \u2013 a surprising find given that they both promote courtship, which is usually similar to aggression in most respects.\nVertebrates.\nSerotonin, also referred to as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter most known for its involvement in mood disorders in humans. It is also a widely present neuromodulator among vertebrates and invertebrates. Serotonin has been found having associations with many physiological systems such as cardiovascular, thermoregulation, and behavioral functions, including: circadian rhythm, appetite, aggressive and sexual behavior, sensorimotor reactivity and learning, and pain sensitivity. Serotonin's function in neurological systems along with specific behaviors among vertebrates found to be strongly associated with serotonin will be further discussed. Two relevant case studies are also mentioned regarding serotonin development involving teleost fish and mice.\nIn mammals, 5-HT is highly concentrated in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei. Lesser concentrated areas include other brain regions and the spinal cord. 5-HT neurons are also shown to be highly branched, indicating that they are structurally prominent for influencing multiple areas of the CNS at the same time, although this trend is exclusive solely to mammals.\n5-HT system in vertebrates.\nVertebrates are multicellular organisms in the phylum Chordata that possess a backbone and a nervous system. This includes mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, etc. In humans, the nervous system is composed of the central and peripheral nervous system, with little known about the specific mechanisms of neurotransmitters in most other vertebrates. However, it is known that while serotonin is involved in stress and behavioral responses, it is also important in cognitive functions. Brain organization in most vertebrates includes 5-HT cells in the hindbrain. In addition to this, 5-HT is often found in other sections of the brain in non-placental vertebrates, including the basal forebrain and pretectum. Since location of serotonin receptors contribute to behavioral responses, this suggests serotonin is part of specific pathways in non-placental vertebrates that are not present in amniotic organisms. Teleost fish and mice are organisms most often used to study the connection between serotonin and vertebrate behavior. Both organisms show similarities in the effect of serotonin on behavior, but differ in the mechanism in which the responses occur.\nDogs / canine species.\nThere are few studies of serotonin in dogs. One study reported serotonin values were higher at dawn than at dusk. In another study, serum 5-HT levels did not seem to be associated with dogs' behavioural response to a stressful situation. Urinary serotonin/creatinine ratio in bitches tended to be higher 4 weeks after surgery. In addition, serotonin was positively correlated with both cortisol and progesterone but not with testosterone after ovariohysterectomy.\nTeleost fish.\nLike non-placental vertebrates, teleost fish also possess 5-HT cells in other sections of the brain, including the basal forebrain. \"Danio rerio\" (zebra fish) are a species of teleost fish often used for studying serotonin within the brain. Despite much being unknown about serotonergic systems in vertebrates, the importance in moderating stress and social interaction is known. It is hypothesized that AVT and CRF cooperate with serotonin in the https://. These neuropeptides influence the plasticity of the teleost, affecting its ability to change and respond to its environment. Subordinate fish in social settings show a drastic increase in 5-HT concentrations. High levels of 5-HT long term influence the inhibition of aggression in subordinate fish.\nMice.\nResearchers at the Department of Pharmacology and Medical Chemistry used serotonergic drugs on male mice to study the effects of selected drugs on their behavior. Mice in isolation exhibit increased levels of agonistic behavior towards one another. Results found that serotonergic drugs reduce aggression in isolated mice while simultaneously increasing social interaction. Each of the treatments use a different mechanism for targeting aggression, but ultimately all have the same outcome. While the study shows that serotonergic drugs successfully target serotonin receptors, it does not show specifics of the mechanisms that affect behavior, as all types of drugs tended to reduce aggression in isolated male mice. Aggressive mice kept out of isolation may respond differently to changes in serotonin reuptake.\nBehavior.\nLike in humans, serotonin is involved in regulating behavior in most other vertebrates. This includes not only response and social behaviors, but also influencing mood. Defects in serotonin pathways can lead to intense variations in mood, as well as symptoms of mood disorders, which can be present in more than just humans.\nSocial interaction.\nOne of the most researched aspects of social interaction in which serotonin is involved is aggression. Aggression is regulated by the 5-HT system, as serotonin levels can both induce or inhibit aggressive behaviors, as seen in mice (see section on Mice) and crabs. While this is widely accepted, it is unknown if serotonin interacts directly or indirectly with parts of the brain influencing aggression and other behaviors. Studies of serotonin levels show that they drastically increase and decrease during social interactions, and they generally correlate with inhibiting or inciting aggressive behavior. The exact mechanism of serotonin influencing social behaviors is unknown, as pathways in the 5-HT system in various vertebrates can differ greatly.\nResponse to stimuli.\nSerotonin is important in environmental response pathways, along with other neurotransmitters. Specifically, it has been found to be involved in auditory processing in social settings, as primary sensory systems are connected to social interactions. Serotonin is found in the IC structure of the midbrain, which processes specie specific and non-specific social interactions and vocalizations. It also receives acoustic projections that convey signals to auditory processing regions. Research has proposed that serotonin shapes the auditory information being received by the IC and therefore is influential in the responses to auditory stimuli. This can influence how an organism responds to the sounds of predatory or other impactful species in their environment, as serotonin uptake can influence aggression or social interaction.\nMood.\nWe can describe mood not as specific to an emotional status, but as associated with a relatively long-lasting emotional state. Serotonin's association with mood is most known for various forms of depression and bipolar disorders in humans. Disorders caused by serotonergic activity potentially contribute to the many symptoms of major depression, such as overall mood, activity, suicidal thoughts and sexual and cognitive dysfunction. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) are a class of drugs demonstrated to be an effective treatment in major depressive disorder and are the most prescribed class of antidepressants. SSRI's function is to block the reuptake of serotonin, making more serotonin available to absorb by the receiving neuron. Animals have been studied for decades in order to understand depressive behavior among species. One of the most familiar studies, the forced swimming test (FST), was performed to measure potential antidepressant activity. Rats were placed in an inescapable container of water, at which point time spent immobile and number of active behaviors (such as splashing or climbing) were compared before and after a panel of anti-depressant drugs were administered. Antidepressants that selectively inhibit NE reuptake were shown to reduce immobility and selectively increase climbing without affecting swimming. However, results of the SSRI's also show reduced immobility but increased swimming without affecting climbing. This study demonstrated the importance of behavioral tests for antidepressants, as they can detect drugs with an effect on core behavior along with behavioral components of species.\nGrowth and reproduction.\nIn the nematode \"C.\u00a0elegans\", artificial depletion of serotonin or the increase of octopamine cues behavior typical of a low-food environment: \"C.\u00a0elegans\" becomes more active, and mating and egg-laying are suppressed, while the opposite occurs if serotonin is increased or octopamine is decreased in this animal. Serotonin is necessary for normal nematode male mating behavior, and the inclination to leave food to search for a mate. The serotonergic signaling used to adapt the worm's behaviour to fast changes in the environment affects insulin-like signaling and the TGF beta signaling pathway, which control long-term adaption.\nIn the fruit fly insulin both regulates blood sugar as well as acting as a growth factor. Thus, in the fruit fly, serotonergic neurons regulate the adult body size by affecting insulin secretion. Serotonin has also been identified as the trigger for swarm behavior in locusts. In humans, though insulin regulates blood sugar and IGF regulates growth, serotonin controls the release of both hormones, modulating insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas through serotonylation of GTPase signaling proteins. Exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy reduces fetal growth.\nGenetically altered \"C.\u00a0elegans\" worms that lack serotonin have an increased reproductive lifespan, may become obese, and sometimes present with arrested development at a dormant larval state.\nAging and age-related phenotypes.\nSerotonin is known to regulate aging, learning, and memory. The first evidence comes from the study of longevity in \"C.\u00a0elegans\". During early phase of aging, the level of serotonin increases, which alters locomotory behaviors and associative memory. The effect is restored by mutations and drugs (including mianserin and methiothepin) that inhibit serotonin receptors. The observation does not contradict with the notion that the serotonin level goes down in mammals and humans, which is typically seen in late but not early phase of aging.\nBiochemical mechanisms.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn animals and humans, serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid -tryptophan by a short metabolic pathway consisting of two enzymes, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC), and the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate. The TPH-mediated reaction is the rate-limiting step in the pathway.\nTPH has been shown to exist in two forms: TPH1, found in several tissues, and TPH2, which is a neuron-specific isoform.\nSerotonin can be synthesized from tryptophan in the lab using \"Aspergillus niger\" and \"Psilocybe coprophila\" as catalysts. The first phase to 5-hydroxytryptophan would require letting tryptophan sit in ethanol and water for 7 days, then mixing in enough HCl (or other acid) to bring the pH to 3, and then adding NaOH to make a pH of 13 for 1 hour. \"Aspergillus niger\" would be the catalyst for this first phase. The second phase to synthesizing tryptophan itself from the 5-hydroxytryptophan intermediate would require adding ethanol and water, and letting sit for 30 days this time. The next two steps would be the same as the first phase: adding HCl to make the pH = 3, and then adding NaOH to make the pH very basic at 13 for 1 hour. This phase uses the \"Psilocybe coprophila\" as the catalyst for the reaction.\nSerotonin taken orally does not pass into the serotonergic pathways of the central nervous system, because it does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, tryptophan and its metabolite 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), from which serotonin is synthesized, do cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. These agents are available as dietary supplements and in various foods, and may be effective serotonergic agents.\nOne product of serotonin breakdown is 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the urine. Serotonin and 5-HIAA are sometimes produced in excess amounts by certain tumors or cancers, and levels of these substances may be measured in the urine to test for these tumors.\nAnalytical chemistry.\nIndium tin oxide is recommended for the electrode material in electrochemical investigation of concentrations produced, detected, or consumed by microbes. A mass spectrometry technique was developed in 1994 to measure the molecular weight of both natural and synthetic serotonins.\nHistory and etymology.\nIt had been known to physiologists for over a century that a vasoconstrictor material appears in serum when blood was allowed to clot. In 1935, Italian Vittorio Erspamer, working in Pavia, showed an extract from enterochromaffin cells made intestines contract. Some believed it contained adrenaline, but two years later, Erspamer was able to show it was a previously unknown amine, which he named \"enteramine\". In 1948, Maurice M. Rapport, Arda Green, and Irvine Page of the Cleveland Clinic discovered a vasoconstrictor substance in blood serum, and since it was a serum agent affecting vascular tone, they named it serotonin.\nIn 1952, enteramine was shown to be the same substance as serotonin, and as the broad range of physiological roles was elucidated, the abbreviation 5-HT of the proper chemical name 5-hydroxytryptamine became the preferred name in the pharmacological field. Synonyms of serotonin include: 5-hydroxytriptamine, enteramine, substance DS, and 3-(\u03b2-aminoethyl)-5-hydroxyindole. In 1953, Betty Twarog and Page discovered serotonin in the central nervous system. Page regarded Erspamer's work on \"Octopus vulgaris\", \"Discoglossus pictus\", \"Hexaplex trunculus\", \"Bolinus brandaris\", \"Sepia\", \"Mytilus\", and \"Ostrea\" as valid and fundamental to understanding this newly identified substance, but regarded his earlier results in various models \u2013 especially those from rat blood \u2013 to be too confounded by the presence of other bioactive chemicals, including some other vasoactives.\nEffects in humans.\nSerotonin, given orally at a dose of 100mg, produced effects in humans including blood pressure changes, abdominal cramps, muscle aches, and a feeling of sedation. In contrast to psychedelic drugs like LSD, no hallucinogenic effects were reported. In other studies, serotonin, at low intravenous doses of 2 to 6mg, had no effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) readings in humans. In accordance with the preceding findings, it has been stated that administration of serotonin in humans produces no psychoactive effects that cannot be attributed to anxiety by its profound peripheral adverse effects including circulatory disturbance, other autonomic effects, and vomiting. Intracerebroventricular injection of serotonin has been studied in patient with severe psychiatric conditions, but little information about its psychoactive effects is provided.\nIt is thought that exogenous serotonin is too hydrophilic to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and has too poor of metabolic stability due to rapid metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO) such that it cannot produce drug-like central effects in humans with peripheral administration. However, close analogues of serotonin that are more lipophilic and metabolically stable, like bufotenin (\"N\",\"N\"-dimethylserotonin), 5-MeO-DMT (\"N\",\"N\",\"O\"-trimethylserotonin), and 5-MeO-AMT (\u03b1,\"O\"-dimethylserotonin), among many others, are active and produce pronounced centrally mediated effects in humans. These drugs are non-selective serotonin receptor agonists like serotonin and are serotonergic psychedelics due to activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. \u03b1-Methylserotonin is well-studied in preclinical research, but is not known to have been tested in humans.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28765", "revid": "5957417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28765", "title": "Lawrence Alma-Tadema", "text": "Dutch-born British painter (1836\u20131912)\nSir Lawrence Alma-Tadema ( ; born Lourens Alma Tadema, ; 8 January 1836 \u2013 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter who later settled in the United Kingdom, becoming the last officially recognised denizen in 1873. Born in Dronryp, the Netherlands, and trained at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium, he settled in London, England in 1870 and spent the rest of his life there. \nA painter of mostly classical subjects, he became famous for his depictions of the luxury and decadence of the Roman Empire, with languorous figures set in fabulous marbled interiors or against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean sea and sky. One of the most popular Victorian painters, Alma-Tadema was admired during his lifetime for his draftsmanship and accurate depictions of Classical antiquity, but his work fell out of fashion after his death, and only since the 1960s has it been appreciated for its importance within Victorian painting.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nAlma-Tadema was born on 8 January 1836 in the village of Dronryp in the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands. The surname \"Tadema\" is an old Frisian patronymic, meaning 'son of Tade', while the names \"Lourens\" and \"Alma\" came from his godfather. He was the sixth child of Pieter Jiltes Tadema (1797\u20131840), the village notary, and the third child of Hinke Dirks Brouwer (1800\u20131863). His father had three sons from a previous marriage. His parents' first child died young, and the second was Artje (1834\u20131876), Lourens' sister, for whom he had great affection.\nThe Tadema family moved in 1838 to the nearby city of Leeuwarden, where Pieter's position as a notary would be more lucrative. His father died when Lourens was four, leaving his mother with five children: Lourens, his sister, and three boys from his father's first marriage. His mother had artistic leanings and decided that drawing lessons should be incorporated into the children's education. He received his first art training with a local drawing master hired to teach his older half-brothers.\nIt was intended that the boy would become a lawyer; but in 1851 at the age of fifteen he suffered a physical and mental breakdown. Diagnosed as consumptive and given only a short time to live, he was allowed to spend his remaining days at his leisure, drawing and painting. Left to his own devices, he regained his health and decided to pursue a career as an artist.\nMove to Belgium.\nIn 1852, he entered the Royal Academy of Antwerp in Belgium where he studied early Dutch and Flemish art, under Gustaf Wappers. During Alma-Tadema's four years as a registered student at the academy, he won several awards. Before leaving the academy, towards the end of 1855, he became assistant to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray Merovingian subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for which the artist became known.\nDe Taeye\u2019s greatest influence on his young pupil was his interest in ancient civilisations, particularly the Egyptians, first displayed in \"The Dying Cleopatra\", begun in 1859 but later destroyed by the artist, and \"The Sad Father\" or \"The Unfavourable Oracle\" (Opus X), painted in 1858. Originally a large processional painting in an architectural setting, it was later cut down to a smaller scale to show only three figures; this reduced painting is now in the Johannesburg Art Gallery. Another section of \"The Sad Father\" was modified by the artist ten years later, in 1869, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1871 under the title \"The Grand Chamberlain to Sesostris the Great\". Of the large original painting, Sir Edmund William Gosse will later say: \"\u201cAs the first of a series of Egyptian pictures, some of which are to be counted among the highest expressions of Alma-Tadema\u2019s genius, The Unfavourable Oracle is a work of great interest.\u201d \"\nThe artist planned two other Egyptian-themed paintings in the years 1857 and 1858, named \"Going to the Oracle\" and \"The Contrary Oracle\", of which a number of preparatory drawings that were once in Gosse's possession survive to this day. These paintings were either never executed, or else destroyed, as during his student years Alma-Tadema frequently destroyed or painted over works that he was unhappy with.\nAs the artist's contemporary biographer Percy Cross Standing noted of Lawrence Alma-Tadema's early paintings of Egyptian subjects in particular, \"\u201cSo careful at all times about detail, he took extraordinary care in the preparation of his preliminary sketches for these pictures.\u201d\" When asked why he had chosen to paint Egyptian themes, Alma-Tadema said: \"\u201cWhere else should I have begun as soon as I had become acquainted with the life of the ancients? The first thing a child learns of ancient history is about the court of Pharaoh; and if we go back to the source of art and science, must we not return to Egypt?\u201d\"\nSeveral of his early Egyptian paintings contain precise depictions of objects and settings, which reflect the artist's close study of an important reference book of his era: Sir John Gardner Wilkinson's \"\u201cThe Manners and Customs of Ancient Egyptians\u201d\", published in 1837. Alma-Tadema left Taeye's studio in November 1858 returning to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where he began working with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio was one of the most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: \"The Education of the children of Clovis\" (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese. He collaborated with Hendrik Leys on the series of wall paintings in the Leys Hall on the second floor of Antwerp City Hall, which depict significant moments in the history of The Netherlands.\nAlma-Tadema took this criticism very seriously, and it led him to improve his technique and to become the world's foremost painter of marble and variegated granite. Despite any reproaches from his master, \"The Education of the Children of Clovis\" was well received by critics and artists alike and was eventually purchased and subsequently given to King Leopold of Belgium. In 1860 he befriended the Anglo-Dutch Dommersen family of artists in Utrecht.\nEarly works.\nMerovingian subjects were the painter's favourites up to the mid-1860s. However Merovingian subjects did not have a wide international appeal, so he switched to themes of life in ancient Egypt, which were more popular. In 1862 Alma-Tadema left Leys's studio and started his own career, establishing himself as a significant classical-subject artist.\nOn 3 January 1863 his invalid mother died, and on 24 September he was married, in Antwerp City Hall, to Marie-Pauline Gressin-Dumoulin de Boisgirard, the daughter of Eug\u00e8ne Gressin-Dumoulin, a French journalist living near Brussels. Nothing is known of their meeting and little of Pauline herself, as Alma-Tadema never spoke about her after her death in 1869. Her image appears in a number of oils, though he painted her portrait only three times, the most notable appearing in \"My studio\" (1867). The couple had three children. Their eldest and only son lived only a few months dying of smallpox. Their two daughters, Laurence (1865\u20131940) and Anna (1867\u20131943), both had artistic leanings: the former in literature, the latter in art. Neither would marry.\nAlma-Tadema and his wife spent their honeymoon in Florence, Rome, Naples and Pompeii. This, his first visit to Italy, developed his interest in depicting the life of ancient Greece and Rome, especially the latter since he found new inspiration in the ruins of Pompeii, which fascinated him and would inspire much of his work in the coming decades. There he met Geremia Discanno, an Italian painter who had been commissioned by archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli to reproduce the brightly painted frescoes being uncovered in the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum before they faded from exposure. He would consult Discanno a number of times before Discanno's death in 1907 to ensure his paintings of antiquity would reflect the lifestyle of residents of the Greco-Roman world accurately.\nDuring the summer of 1864, Tadema met Ernest Gambart, the most influential print publisher and art dealer of the period. Gambart was highly impressed with the work of Tadema, who was then painting \"Egyptian Chess Players\" (1865). The dealer, recognising at once the unusual gifts of the young painter, gave him an order for twenty-four pictures and arranged for three of Tadema's paintings to be shown in London. In 1865, Tadema relocated to Brussels where he was named a knight of the Order of Leopold.\nOn 28 May 1869, after years of ill health, Pauline died of smallpox at Schaerbeek in Belgium, aged 32. Her death left Tadema disconsolate and depressed. He ceased painting for nearly four months. His sister Artje, who lived with the family, helped with the two daughters then aged five and two. Artje took over the role of housekeeper and remained with the family until 1873 when she married.\nDuring the summer Tadema himself began to suffer from a medical problem which doctors in Brussels were unable to diagnose. Gambart eventually advised him to go to England for another medical opinion. Soon after his arrival in London in December 1869, Alma-Tadema was invited to the home of the painter Ford Madox Brown. There he met Laura Theresa Epps, who was seventeen years old, and fell in love with her at first sight.\nMove to England.\nThe outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870 encouraged Alma-Tadema to leave the continent and move to London. His infatuation with Laura Epps played a great part in his relocation to England and in addition Gambart felt that the move would be advantageous to the artist's career. In stating his reasons for the move, Tadema simply said \"I lost my first wife, a French lady with whom I married in 1863, in 1869. Having always had a great predilection for London, the only place where, up till then my work had met with buyers, I decided to leave the continent and go to settle in England, where I have found a true home.\"\nWith his small daughters and sister Artje, Alma-Tadema arrived in London at the beginning of September 1870. The painter wasted no time in contacting Laura, and it was arranged that he would give her painting lessons. During one of these, he proposed marriage. As he was then thirty-four and Laura was now only eighteen, her father was initially opposed to the idea. Dr Epps finally agreed on the condition that they should wait until they knew each other better. They married in July 1871. Laura, under her married name, also won a high reputation as an artist, and appears in numerous of Alma-Tadema's canvases after their marriage (\"The Women of Amphissa\" (1887) being a notable example). This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence. Anna became a painter and Laurence became a novelist.\nIn England he initially adopted the name \"Laurence Alma Tadema\" instead of \"Lourens Alma Tadema\" and later used the more English spelling \"Lawrence\" for his forename. He also incorporated \"Alma\" into his surname so that he appeared at the beginning of exhibition catalogues, under \"A\" rather than under \"T\". He did not actually hyphenate his last name, but it was done by others and this has since become the convention.\nVictorian painter.\nAfter his arrival in England, where he was to spend the rest of his life, Alma-Tadema's career was one of continued success. He became one of the most famous and highly paid artists of his time, acknowledged and rewarded. By 1871 he had met and befriended most of the major Pre-Raphaelite painters and it was in part due to their influence that the artist brightened his palette, varied his hues, and lightened his brushwork.\nIn 1872 Alma-Tadema organised his paintings into an identification system by including an opus number under his signature and assigning his earlier pictures numbers as well. \"Portrait of my sister, Artje\", painted in 1851, is numbered opus I, while two months before his death he completed \"Preparations in the Coliseum\", opus CCCCVIII. Such a system made it more difficult for fakes to be passed off as originals.\nIn 1873 Queen Victoria in Council by letters patent made Alma-Tadema and his wife the last British denizens, with some limited special rights otherwise only accorded to and enjoyed by British subjects; while the legal process has never been formally abolished, Alma-Tadema's case remains the last time it was applied. The previous year he and his wife made a journey on the continent that lasted five and a half months and took them through Brussels, Germany, and Italy. In Italy Alma-Tadema was able to take in the ancient ruins again; this time he purchased several photographs, mostly of the ruins, which began his immense collection of archival material used in the completion of future paintings. In January 1876, he rented a studio in Rome. The family returned to London in April, visiting the Paris Salon on their way back. In London he regularly met with fellow-artist Emil Fuchs.\nAmong the most important of his pictures during this period was \"An Audience at Agrippa's\" (1876). When an admirer of the painting offered to pay a substantial sum for a painting with a similar subject, Alma-Tadema simply turned the emperor around to show him leaving, in \"After the Audience\". On 19 June 1879, Alma-Tadema was made a Royal Academician. Three years later, a major retrospective of his entire oeuvre was organised at the Grosvenor Gallery in London, including 185 of his pictures.\nIn 1883 he returned to Rome and Pompeii, where further excavations had taken place since his last visit. He spent a significant amount of time studying the site, going there daily. These excursions gave him an ample source of subject matter as he began to further his knowledge of daily Roman life. At times, however, he integrated so many objects into his paintings that some said they resembled museum catalogues.\nOne of his most famous paintings is \"The Roses of Heliogabalus\" (1888) \u2013 based on an episode from the life of the debauched Roman emperor Elagabalus (Heliogabalus), the painting depicts the emperor suffocating his guests at an orgy under a cascade of rose petals. The blossoms depicted were sent weekly to the artist's London studio from the French Riviera for four months during the winter of 1887\u20131888.\nAmong Alma-Tadema's works of this period are: \"An Earthly Paradise\" (1891), \"Unconscious Rivals\" (1893) \"Spring\" (1894), \"The Coliseum\" (1896) and \"The Baths of Caracalla\" (1899). Although Alma-Tadema's fame rests on his paintings set in antiquity, he also painted portraits, landscapes and watercolours, and made some etchings himself. (Many more were made of his paintings by others).\nPersonality.\nFor all the quiet charm and erudition of his paintings, Alma-Tadema himself preserved a youthful sense of mischief. He was childlike in his practical jokes and in his sudden bursts of bad temper, which could as suddenly subside into an engaging smile. In his personal life, Alma-Tadema was an extrovert and had a warm personality. As a man, Lawrence Alma-Tadema was a robust, fun loving and rather portly gentleman. There was not a hint of the delicate artist about him; he was a cheerful lover of wine, women, and parties. \nHe has been said to have had most of the characteristics of a child, coupled with the traits of a consummate professional. A perfectionist, he remained in all respects a diligent, if somewhat obsessive and pedantic worker. He was an excellent businessman, and one of the wealthiest artists of the nineteenth century. Alma-Tadema was as firm in money matters as he was with the quality of his work.\nLater years.\nAlma-Tadema's output decreased with time, partly on account of health, but also because of his obsession with decorating his new home, to which he moved in 1883. Nevertheless, he continued to exhibit throughout the 1880s and 1890s, receiving accolades including the medal of Honour at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, election to an honorary membership of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1890, and the Great Gold Medal at the International Exposition in Brussels of 1897. In 1899, he was knighted by Britain, only the eighth artist from the Continent to receive this honour. He assisted with organizing the British section at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, as well as exhibiting two works that earned him the Grand Prix Diploma. He also assisted with the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904, where he was well received.\nDuring this time, Alma-Tadema was very active with theatre design and production, designing many costumes. He also began to design furniture, often modelled after Pompeian or Egyptian motifs, as well as illustrations, textiles, and picture frames. In late 1902 he visited Egypt. These other interests influenced his paintings, as he often incorporated some of his furniture designs and female costumes into the composition. Through his last period of creativity Alma-Tadema continued to produce paintings which repeated the successful formula of women on marble terraces overlooking the sea such as in \"Silver Favourites\" (1903). Between 1903 and his death, Alma-Tadema painted less but still produced ambitious paintings such as \"The Finding of Moses\" (1904).\nOn 15 August 1909 Alma-Tadema's wife, Laura, died at the age of fifty-seven. The grief-stricken widower outlived his second wife by less than three years. His last major composition was \"Preparation in the Coliseum\" (1912). In the summer of 1912, Alma-Tadema was accompanied by his daughter Anna to Kaiserhof Spa, Wiesbaden, Germany, to be treated for stomach ulcers. He died there on 28 June 1912 at the age of seventy-six. He was buried in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral in London.\nIn 1975, a blue plaque was unveiled in his honour. commemorates Alma-Tadema at 44 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, his home from 1886 until his death in 1912.\nStyle.\nAlma-Tadema's works are remarkable for their depiction of flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances like metals, pottery, and especially marble (leading to the nickname 'marbellous painter'). His work shows much of the fine execution and brilliant colour of the old Dutch masters.\nFrom early in his career, Alma-Tadema was particularly concerned with architectural accuracy, often painting objects from museums, such as the British Museum in London. He also took many images from books and amassed an enormous number of photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used to achieve the most precise detail in his painting.\nAlma-Tadema was a perfectionist, repeatedly reworking parts of paintings until he found them satisfactory. One story relates that after one of his paintings was rejected, he gave the canvas to a maid for a table cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line in his settings. He would often paint from life, using fresh flowers from across Europe and even Africa, rushing to paint the flowers before they withered. His commitment to veracity earned him recognition, but also led some critics to accuse him of pedantry.\nAlma-Tadema's work has been linked with that of European Symbolist painters. He influenced European painters such as Gustav Klimt and Fernand Khnopff, who incorporated classical motifs, as well as Alma-Tadema's unconventional compositional devices such as abrupt cut-off at the edge of the canvas. Like Alma-Tadema, they also employ coded imagery to suggest hidden meanings.\nReputation and sale prices.\nAlma-Tadema was one of the most popular painters of the Victorian era, and among the most financially successful, though never matching Edwin Henry Landseer. For over sixty years, he gave his audience exactly what they wanted: distinctive, elaborate paintings of beautiful people in classical settings. His detailed reconstructions of ancient Rome, with languid men and women posed against white marble in dazzling sunlight, provided his audience with a glimpse of an exotic world of titillating luxury and intimate drama. \nAs with other painters, the reproduction rights for prints were often worth more than the canvas. For example, a painting together with its rights may have been sold to Gambart for \u00a310,000 in 1874; then in 1903, when Alma-Tadema's prices were actually higher, it was sold again without rights for \u00a32,625. Typical prices were between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 in the 1880s, but at least three works sold for between \u00a35,250 and \u00a36,060 in the 1900s. Prices held well until the general collapse of the market for Victorian art in the early 1920s, when they fell to the hundreds, where they remained until the 1960s; by 1969 \u00a34,600 had been reached again (equivalent to about \u00a3700 in 1900, adjusted for inflation).\nThe last years of Alma-Tadema's life saw the rise of Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism and Futurism, all of which he disapproved. As his pupil John Collier wrote, 'it is impossible to reconcile the art of Alma-Tadema with that of Matisse, Gauguin and Picasso.' His artistic legacy almost vanished. As the taste of the public and the artistic elite turned to twentieth-century modernism, it became fashionable to denounce his style. John Ruskin declared him \"the worst painter of the 19th century\", and one critic considered his paintings \"about worthy enough to adorn bourbon boxes\". After this brief period of condemnation, he was consigned to obscurity for the next half century. \nOnly since the 1960s has Alma-Tadema's work been rediscovered for its historical importance in the evolution of English art. He is now regarded by art historians as one of the principal classical-subject painters of the nineteenth century, whose works demonstrate the care and exactitude of an era mesmerised by trying to visualise the past, some of which was being recovered through archaeological research.\nAlma-Tadema's highly detailed depictions of Roman life and architecture, based on meticulous archaeological research, led Hollywood directors to his paintings as models for their cinematic ancient world, in films such as D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), \"Ben Hur\" (1926), and \"Cleopatra\" (1934). The most notable was Cecil B. DeMille's epic \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956): its co-writer Jesse Lasky Jr. described how the director would spread out prints of Alma-Tadema paintings to guide his set designers. The design of the Oscar-winning Roman epic \"Gladiator\" (2000) took its main inspiration from his paintings, as well as that of the interior of Cair Paravel castle in \"\" (2005).\nIn 1962, New York art dealer Robert Isaacson mounted the first show of Alma-Tadema's work in fifty years, and by the late 1960s, the revival of interest in Victorian painting gained impetus with a number of well-attended exhibitions. Allen Funt, the creator and host of the American television show \"Candid Camera\", was a collector of Alma-Tadema paintings during the 20th century nadir of the artist's reputation; in a few years he bought 35 works, about ten per cent of Alma-Tadema's output. After Funt was robbed by his accountant, he was forced to sell his collection at Sotheby's London in November 1973. \nIn 1960, the Newman Gallery was unable to sell, or even give away, one of his most celebrated works, \"The Finding of Moses\" (1904). The initial purchaser had paid \u00a35,250 in 1904, and subsequent sales were for \u00a3861 in 1935, \u00a3265 in 1942, and it was \"bought in\" at \u00a3252 in 1960 (having failed to meet its reserve). But when the same picture was auctioned at Christies New York in May 1995, it sold for \u00a31.75 million. On 4 November 2010 it sold for $35,922,500 to an undisclosed bidder at Sotheby's New York, a new record for any Victorian artist. On 5 May 2011, the painting \"The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra: 41 BC\" was sold at the same house for $29.2 million.\nAlma-Tadema's \"The Tepidarium\" (1881) is included in the 2006 book \"1001 Paintings You Must See Before You Die\". Julian Treuherz, Keeper of Art Galleries at National Museums Liverpool, describes it as an \"exquisitely painted picture... [which] carries a strong erotic charge, rare for a Victorian painting of the nude\". \nArchives.\nThe Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham holds several archive collections relating to Alma-Tadema, including letters, artwork and photography.\nReferences and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28766", "revid": "42964511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28766", "title": "Surrealism", "text": "International cultural movement (1920s\u20131950s)\nSurrealism is an art and cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists aimed to allow the unconscious mind to express itself, often resulting in the depiction of illogical or dreamlike scenes and ideas. Its intention was, according to leader Andr\u00e9 Breton, to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality\", or \"surreality.\" It produced works of painting, writing, photography, theatre, filmmaking, music, comedy and other media as well.\nWorks of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and \"non sequitur\". However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost (for instance, of the \"pure psychic automatism\" Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto), with the works themselves being secondary, i.e., artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.\nThe term \"Surrealism\" originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, theatre, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social and cultural theories.\nFounding of the movement.\nThe word \"surrealism\" was first coined in March 1917 by Guillaume Apollinaire. He wrote in a letter to Paul Derm\u00e9e: \"All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used\" [\"Tout bien examin\u00e9, je crois en effet qu'il vaut mieux adopter surr\u00e9alisme que surnaturalisme que j'avais d'abord employ\u00e9\"].\nApollinaire used the term in his program notes for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, \"Parade\", which premiered 18 May 1917. \"Parade\" had a one-act scenario by Jean Cocteau and was performed with music by Erik Satie. Cocteau described the ballet as \"realistic\". Apollinaire went further, describing \"Parade\" as \"surrealistic\":\nThis new alliance\u2014I say new, because until now scenery and costumes were linked only by factitious bonds\u2014has given rise, in \"Parade\", to a kind of surrealism, which I consider to be the point of departure for a whole series of manifestations of the New Spirit that is making itself felt today and that will certainly appeal to our best minds. We may expect it to bring about profound changes in our arts and manners through universal joyfulness, for it is only natural, after all, that they keep pace with scientific and industrial progress. (Apollinaire, 1917)\nThe term was taken up again by Apollinaire, both as subtitle and in the preface to his play \"Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias: Drame surr\u00e9aliste\", which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917.\nWorld War I scattered the writers and artists who had been based in Paris, and in the interim, many became involved with Dada, believing that excessive rational thought and bourgeois values had brought the conflict of the war upon the world. The Dadaists protested with anti-art gatherings, performances, writings and art works. After the war, when they returned to Paris, the Dada activities continued.\nDuring the war, Andr\u00e9 Breton, who had trained in medicine and psychiatry, served in a neurological hospital where he used Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from shell-shock. Meeting the young writer Jacques Vach\u00e9, Breton felt that Vach\u00e9 was the spiritual son of writer and pataphysics founder Alfred Jarry. He admired the young writer's anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. Later Breton wrote, \"In literature, I was successively taken with Rimbaud, with Jarry, with Apollinaire, with Nouveau, with Lautr\u00e9amont, but it is Jacques Vach\u00e9 to whom I owe the most.\"\nBack in Paris, Breton joined in Dada activities and started the literary journal \"Litt\u00e9rature\" along with Louis Aragon and Philippe Soupault. They began experimenting with automatic writing\u2014spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts\u2014and published the writings, as well as accounts of dreams, in the magazine. Breton and Soupault continued writing evolving their techniques of automatism and published \"The Magnetic Fields\" (1920).\nBy October 1924, two rival Surrealist groups had formed to publish a Surrealist Manifesto. Each claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Appolinaire. One group, led by Yvan Goll consisted of Pierre Albert-Birot, Paul Derm\u00e9e, C\u00e9line Arnauld, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Marcel Arland, Joseph Delteil, Jean Painlev\u00e9 and Robert Delaunay, among others. The group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton claimed that automatism was a better tactic for societal change than those of Dada, as led by Tzara, who was now among their rivals. Breton's group grew to include writers and artists from various media such as Paul \u00c9luard, Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Ren\u00e9 Crevel, Robert Desnos, Jacques Baron, Max Morise, Pierre Naville, Roger Vitrac, Gala \u00c9luard, Max Ernst, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Man Ray, Hans Arp, Georges Malkine, Michel Leiris, Georges Limbour, Antonin Artaud, Raymond Queneau, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Joan Mir\u00f3, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Pr\u00e9vert, and Yves Tanguy, Dora Maar\nAs they developed their philosophy, they believed that Surrealism would advocate the idea that ordinary and depictive expressions are vital and important, but that the sense of their arrangement must be open to the full range of imagination according to the Hegelian Dialectic. They also looked to the Marxist dialectic and the work of such theorists as Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse.\nFreud's concepts of free association, dream analysis and accessing the unconscious were of crucial importance to the Surrealists in advancing their project to liberate the imagination. They embraced idiosyncrasy, while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. As Dal\u00ed later proclaimed, \"There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.\"\nBeside the use of dream analysis, they emphasized that \"one could combine inside the same frame, elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects.\" Breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto, taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet Pierre Reverdy, which said: \"a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities. The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant and true, the stronger the image will be\u2212the greater its emotional power and poetic reality.\"\nThe group aimed to revolutionize human experience, in its personal, cultural, social, and political aspects. They wanted to free people from false rationality, and restrictive customs and structures. Breton proclaimed that the true aim of Surrealism was \"long live the social revolution, and it alone!\" To this goal, at various times Surrealists aligned with communism and anarchism.\nIn 1924, two Surrealist factions declared their philosophy in two separate Surrealist Manifestos. That same year the Bureau of Surrealist Research was established and began publishing the journal \"La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste\".\nSurrealist Manifestos.\nLeading up to 1924, two rival surrealist groups had formed. Each group claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Apollinaire. One group, led by Yvan Goll, consisted of Pierre Albert-Birot, Paul Derm\u00e9e, C\u00e9line Arnauld, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Marcel Arland, Joseph Delteil, Jean Painlev\u00e9 and Robert Delaunay, among others.\nThe other group, led by Breton, included Aragon, Desnos, \u00c9luard, Baron, Crevel, Malkine, Jacques-Andr\u00e9 Boiffard and Jean Carrive, among others.\nYvan Goll published the \"Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme\", 1 October 1924, in his first and only issue of \"Surr\u00e9alisme\" two weeks prior to the release of Breton's \"Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme\", published by \u00c9ditions du Sagittaire, 15 October 1924.\nGoll and Breton clashed openly, at one point literally fighting, at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, over the rights to the term Surrealism. In the end, Breton won the battle through tactical and numerical superiority. Though the quarrel over the anteriority of Surrealism concluded with the victory of Breton, the history of surrealism from that moment would remain marked by fractures, resignations, and resounding excommunications, with each surrealist having their own view of the issue and goals, and accepting more or less the definitions laid out by Andr\u00e9 Breton.\nBreton's 1924 \"Surrealist Manifesto\" defines the purposes of Surrealism. He included citations of the influences on Surrealism, examples of Surrealist works, and discussion of Surrealist automatism. He provided the following definitions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dictionary: Surrealism, n. Pure psychic automatism, by which one proposes to express, either verbally, in writing, or by any other manner, the real functioning of thought. Dictation of thought in the absence of all control exercised by reason, outside of all aesthetic and moral preoccupation.\nEncyclopedia: Surrealism. Philosophy. Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations, in the omnipotence of dream, in the disinterested play of thought. It tends to ruin once and for all other psychic mechanisms and to substitute itself for them in solving all the principal problems of life.\nExpansion.\nThe movement in the mid-1920s was characterized by meetings in cafes where the Surrealists played collaborative drawing games, discussed the theories of Surrealism, and developed a variety of techniques such as automatic drawing. Breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the Surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and automatism. This caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as frottage, grattage and decalcomania.\nSoon more visual artists became involved, including Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Joan Mir\u00f3, Francis Picabia, Yves Tanguy, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Alberto Giacometti, Valentine Hugo, M\u00e9ret Oppenheim, Toyen, and Kansuke Yamamoto. Later, after the second World War, Enrico Donati, Vinicius Pradella and Denis Fabbri became involved as well. Though Breton admired Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp and courted them to join the movement, they remained peripheral. More writers also joined, including former Dadaist Tristan Tzara, Ren\u00e9 Char, and Georges Sadoul.\nIn 1925 an autonomous Surrealist group formed in Brussels. The group included the musician, poet, and artist E. L. T. Mesens, painter and writer Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Paul Noug\u00e9, Marcel Lecomte, and Andr\u00e9 Souris. In 1927 they were joined by the writer Louis Scutenaire. They corresponded regularly with the Paris group, and in 1927 both Goemans and Magritte moved to Paris and frequented Breton's circle. The artists, with their roots in Dada and Cubism, the abstraction of Wassily Kandinsky, Expressionism, and Post-Impressionism, also reached to older \"bloodlines\" or proto-surrealists such as Hieronymus Bosch, and the so-called primitive and naive arts.\nAndr\u00e9 Masson's automatic drawings of 1923 are often used as the point of the acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since they reflect the influence of the idea of the unconscious mind. Another example is Giacometti's 1925 \"Torso\", which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.\n In the second the influence of Mir\u00f3 and the drawing style of Picasso is visible with the use of fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as Pop art.\nGiorgio de Chirico, and his previous development of metaphysical art, was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism. Between 1911 and 1917, he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later. \"The Red Tower (La tour rouge)\" from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters. His 1914 \"The Nostalgia of the Poet (La Nostalgie du po\u00e8te)\" has the figure turned away from the viewer, and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation. He was also a writer whose novel \"Hebdomeros\" presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images. His images, including set designs for the Ballets Russes, would create a decorative form of Surrealism, and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind: Dal\u00ed and Magritte. He would, however, leave the Surrealist group in 1928.\nIn 1924, Mir\u00f3 and Masson applied Surrealism to painting. The first Surrealist exhibition, \"La Peinture Surrealiste\", was held at Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. It displayed works by Masson, Man Ray, Paul Klee, Mir\u00f3, and others. The show confirmed that Surrealism had a component in the visual arts (though it had been initially debated whether this was possible), and techniques from Dada, such as photomontage, were used. The following year, on March 26, 1926, Galerie Surr\u00e9aliste opened with an exhibition by Man Ray. Breton published \"Surrealism and Painting\" in 1928 which summarized the movement to that point, though he continued to update the work until the 1960s.\nSurrealist literature.\nThe first Surrealist work, according to leader Breton, was \"Les Chants de Maldoror\", and the first work written and published by his group of \"Surr\u00e9alistes\" was \"Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques\" (May\u2013June 1919). \"Litt\u00e9rature\" contained automatist works and accounts of dreams. The magazine and the portfolio both showed their disdain for literal meanings given to objects and focused rather on the undertones; the poetic undercurrents present. Not only did they give emphasis to the poetic undercurrents, but also to the connotations and the overtones which \"exist in ambiguous relationships to the visual images.\"\nBecause Surrealist writers seldom, if ever, appear to organize their thoughts and the images they present, some people find much of their work difficult to parse. This notion however is a superficial comprehension, prompted no doubt by Breton's initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality. But\u2014as in Breton's case\u2014much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very \"thought out\". Breton himself later admitted that automatic writing's centrality had been overstated, and other elements were introduced, especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue, since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches. Thus, such elements as collage were introduced, arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in Pierre Reverdy's poetry. And\u2014as in Magritte's case (where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage)\u2014the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself. Surrealism was meant to be always in flux\u2014to be more modern than modern\u2014and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose. Artists such as Max Ernst and his surrealist collages demonstrate this shift to a more modern art form that also comments on society.\nSurrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont, and for the line \"beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella\", and Arthur Rimbaud, two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.\nExamples of Surrealist literature are Artaud's \"Le P\u00e8se-Nerfs\" (1926), Aragon's \"Irene's Cunt\" (1927), P\u00e9ret's \"Death to the Pigs\" (1929), Crevel's \"Mr. Knife Miss Fork\" (1931), Sadegh Hedayat's \"The Blind Owl\" (1937), and Breton's \"Sur la route de San Romano\" (1948).\n\"La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste\" continued publication into 1929 with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but which also included reproductions of art, among them works by de Chirico, Ernst, Masson, and Man Ray. Other works included books, poems, pamphlets, automatic texts and theoretical tracts.\nSurrealist films.\nEarly films by Surrealists include:\nSurrealist photography.\nFamous Surrealist photographers are the French Dora Maar, the American Man Ray, the French/Hungarian Brassa\u00ef, French Claude Cahun and the Dutch Emiel van Moerkerken.\nSurrealist theatre.\nThe word \"surrealist\" was first used by Apollinaire to describe his 1917 play \"Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias\" (\"The Breasts of Tiresias\"), which was later adapted into an opera by Francis Poulenc.\nRoger Vitrac's \"The Mysteries of Love\" (1927) and \"Victor, or The Children Take Over\" (1928) are often considered the best examples of Surrealist theatre, despite his expulsion from the movement in 1926. The plays were staged at the Theatre Alfred Jarry, the theatre Vitrac co-founded with Antonin Artaud, another early Surrealist who was expelled from the movement.\nFollowing his collaboration with Vitrac, Artaud would extend Surrealist thought through his theory of the Theatre of Cruelty. Artaud rejected the majority of Western theatre as a perversion of its original intent, which he felt should be a mystical, metaphysical experience. Instead, he envisioned a theatre that would be immediate and direct, linking the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event, Artaud created in which emotions, feelings, and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically, creating a mythological, archetypal, allegorical vision, closely related to the world of dreams.\nThe Spanish playwright and director Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, also experimented with surrealism, particularly in his plays \"The Public\" (1930), \"When Five Years Pass\" (1931), and \"Play Without a Title\" (1935). Other surrealist plays include Aragon's \"Backs to the Wall\" (1925). Gertrude Stein's opera \"Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights\" (1938) has also been described as \"American Surrealism\", though it is also related to a theatrical form of cubism.\nSurrealist music.\nIn the 1920s several composers were influenced by Surrealism, or by individuals in the Surrealist movement. Among them were Bohuslav Martin\u016f, Andr\u00e9 Souris, Erik Satie, Francis Poulenc, and Edgard Var\u00e8se, who stated that his work \"Arcana\" was drawn from a dream sequence. Souris in particular was associated with the movement: he had a long relationship with Magritte, and worked on Paul Noug\u00e9's publication \"Adieu Marie\". Music by composers from across the twentieth century have been associated with surrealist principles, including Pierre Boulez, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Mauricio Kagel, Olivier Messiaen, and Thomas Ad\u00e8s.\nGermaine Tailleferre of the French group Les Six wrote several works which could be considered to be inspired by Surrealism, including the 1948 ballet \"Paris-Magie\" (scenario by Lise Deharme), the operas \"La Petite Sir\u00e8ne\" (book by Philippe Soupault) and \"Le Ma\u00eetre\" (book by Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco). Tailleferre also wrote popular songs to texts by Claude Marci, the wife of Henri Jeanson, whose portrait had been painted by Magritte in the 1930s.\nEven though Breton by 1946 responded rather negatively to the subject of music with his essay \"Silence is Golden\", later Surrealists, such as Paul Garon, have been interested in\u2014and found parallels to\u2014Surrealism in the improvisation of jazz and the blues. Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition included performances by David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards.\nSurrealism and international politics.\nSurrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world: in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices, in other places on political practices, and in other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics. During the 1930s, the Surrealist idea spread from Europe to North America, South America (founding of the \"Mandr\u00e1gora\" group in Chile in 1938), Central America, the Caribbean, and throughout Asia, as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change.\nPolitically, Surrealism was Trotskyist, communist, or anarchist. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the Surrealists as communist. Breton and his comrades supported Leon Trotsky and his International Left Opposition for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Some Surrealists, such as Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Mary Low, and Juan Bre\u00e1, aligned with forms of left communism. When the Dutch surrealist photographer Emiel van Moerkerken came to Breton, he did not want to sign the manifesto because he was not a Trotskyist. For Breton being a communist was not enough. Breton denied Van Moerkerken's pictures for a publication afterwards. This caused a split in surrealism. Others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies, like Wolfgang Paalen, who, after Trotsky's assassination in Mexico, prepared a schism between art and politics through his counter-surrealist art-magazine \"DYN\" and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists. Dal\u00ed supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco but cannot be said to represent a trend in Surrealism in this respect; in fact, he was considered, by Breton and his associates, to have betrayed and left Surrealism. Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Mary Low, Juan Bre\u00e1, and Spanish-native Eugenio Fern\u00e1ndez Granell joined the POUM during the Spanish Civil War.\nBreton's followers, along with the Communist Party, were working for the \"liberation of man\". However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the proletarian struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists.\nSurrealists have often sought to link their efforts with political ideals and activities. In the \"Declaration of January 27, 1925\", for example, members of the Paris-based Bureau of Surrealist Research (including Breton, Aragon and Artaud, as well as some two dozen others) declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. While this was initially a somewhat vague formulation, by the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. The foremost document of this tendency within Surrealism is the \"Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art\", published under the names of Breton and Diego Rivera, but actually co-authored by Breton and Leon Trotsky.\nHowever, in 1933 the Surrealists' assertion that a \"proletarian literature\" within a capitalist society was impossible led to their break with the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes R\u00e9volutionnaires, and the expulsion of Breton, \u00c9luard and Crevel from the Communist Party.\nIn 1925, the Paris Surrealist group and the extreme left of the French Communist Party came together to support Abd-el-Krim, leader of the Rif uprising against French colonialism in Morocco. In an open letter to writer and French ambassador to Japan, Paul Claudel, the Paris group announced:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We Surrealists pronounced ourselves in favour of changing the imperialist war, in its chronic and colonial form, into a civil war. Thus we placed our energies at the disposal of the revolution, of the proletariat and its struggles, and defined our attitude towards the colonial problem, and hence towards the colour question.\nThe anticolonial revolutionary and proletarian politics of \"Murderous Humanitarianism\" (1932) which was drafted mainly by Crevel, signed by Breton, \u00c9luard, P\u00e9ret, Tanguy, and the Martiniquan Surrealists Pierre Yoyotte and J.M. Monnerot perhaps makes it the original document of what is later called \"black Surrealism\", although it is the contact between Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire and Breton in the 1940s in Martinique that really lead to the communication of what is known as \"black Surrealism\".\nAnticolonial revolutionary writers in the N\u00e9gritude movement of Martinique, a French colony at the time, took up Surrealism as a revolutionary method \u2013 a critique of European culture and a radical subjective. This linked with other Surrealists and was very important for the subsequent development of Surrealism as a revolutionary praxis. The journal \"Tropiques\", featuring the work of C\u00e9saire along with Suzanne C\u00e9saire, Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nil, Lucie Th\u00e9s\u00e9e, Aristide Maug\u00e9e and others, was first published in 1941.\nIn 1938 Andr\u00e9 Breton traveled with his wife, the painter Jacqueline Lamba, to Mexico to meet Trotsky (staying as the guest of Diego Rivera's former wife Guadalupe Marin), and there he met Frida Kahlo and saw her paintings for the first time. Breton declared Kahlo to be an \"innate\" Surrealist painter.\nInternal politics.\nIn 1929 the satellite group associated with the journal \"Le Grand Jeu\", including Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, Maurice Henry and the Czech painter Josef Sima, was ostracized. Also in February, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and theoretical refinements included in the second \"manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme\" excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action, a list which included Leiris, Limbour, Morise, Baron, Queneau, Pr\u00e9vert, Desnos, Masson and Boiffard. Excluded members launched a counterattack, sharply criticizing Breton in the pamphlet \"Un Cadavre\", which featured a picture of Breton wearing a crown of thorns. The pamphlet drew upon an earlier act of subversion by likening Breton to Anatole France, whose unquestioned value Breton had challenged in 1924.\nThe disunion of 1929\u201330 and the effects of \"Un Cadavre\" had very little negative impact upon Surrealism as Breton saw it, since core figures such as Aragon, Crevel, Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel remained true to the idea of group action, at least for the time being. The success (or the controversy) of Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel's film \"L'Age d'Or\" in December 1930 had a regenerative effect, drawing a number of new recruits, and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s.\nDisgruntled surrealists moved to the periodical \"Documents\", edited by Georges Bataille, whose anti-idealist materialism formed a hybrid Surrealism intending to expose the base instincts of humans. To the dismay of many, \"Documents\" fizzled out in 1931, just as Surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam.\nThere were a number of reconciliations after this period of disunion, such as between Breton and Bataille, while Aragon left the group after committing himself to the French Communist Party in 1932. More members were ousted over the years for a variety of infractions, both political and personal, while others left in pursuit of their own style.\nBy the end of World War II, the surrealist group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\" Breton was consistent in his support for the francophone Anarchist Federation and he continued to offer his solidarity after the Platformists supporting Fontenis transformed the FA into the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Communiste Libertaire. He was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the FCL during the Algerian war when the FCL suffered severe repression and was forced underground. He sheltered Fontenis whilst he was in hiding. He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new F\u00e9d\u00e9ration anarchiste set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 60s alongside the FA.\nGolden age.\nThroughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in London and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Another English Surrealist group developed in Birmingham, meanwhile, and was distinguished by its opposition to the London surrealists and preferences for surrealism's French heartland. The two groups would reconcile later in the decade.\nDal\u00ed and Magritte created the most widely recognized images of the movement. Dal\u00ed joined the group in 1929 and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.\nSurrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth; stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, in order to evoke empathy from the viewer.\n1931 was a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: Magritte's \"Voice of Space (La Voix des airs)\" is an example of this process, where three large spheres representing bells hang above a landscape. Another Surrealist landscape from this same year is Yves Tanguy's \"\", with its molten forms and liquid shapes. Liquid shapes became the trademark of Dal\u00ed, particularly in his \"The Persistence of Memory\", which features the image of watches that sag as if they were melting.\nThe characteristics of this style\u2014a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological\u2014came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the modern period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be \"made whole with one's individuality\".\nBetween 1930 and 1933, the Surrealist Group in Paris issued the periodical \"Le Surr\u00e9alisme au service de la r\u00e9volution\" as the successor of \"La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste\".\nFrom 1936 through 1938 Wolfgang Paalen, Gordon Onslow Ford, and Roberto Matta joined the group. Paalen contributed Fumage and Onslow Ford Coulage as new pictorial automatic techniques.\nLong after personal, political and professional tensions fragmented the Surrealist group, Magritte and Dal\u00ed continued to define a visual program in the arts. This program reached beyond painting, to encompass photography as well, as can be seen from a Man Ray self-portrait, whose use of assemblage influenced Robert Rauschenberg's collage boxes.\nDuring the 1930s Peggy Guggenheim, an important American art collector, married Max Ernst and began promoting work by other Surrealists such as Yves Tanguy and the British artist John Tunnard.\nMajor exhibitions in the 1930s\nWorld War II and the Post War period.\nWorld War II created havoc not only for the general population of Europe but especially for the European artists and writers that opposed Fascism and Nazism. Many important artists fled to North America and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of Dadaistic humor in such artists as Rauschenberg sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of Pop Art, Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.\nThe Second World War overshadowed, for a time, almost all intellectual and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen was the first to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After a long trip through the forests of British Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine Dyn. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter Kay Sage. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine \"VVV\" with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist David Hare. However, it was the American poet, Charles Henri Ford, and his magazine \"View\" which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The \"View\" special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton's view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as Futurism and Cubism, to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.\nThough the war proved disruptive for Surrealism, the works continued. Many Surrealist artists continued to explore their vocabularies, including Magritte. Many members of the Surrealist movement continued to correspond and meet. While Dal\u00ed may have been excommunicated by Breton, he neither abandoned his themes from the 1930s, including references to the \"persistence of time\" in a later painting, nor did he become a depictive pompier. His classic period did not represent so sharp a break with the past as some descriptions of his work might portray, and some, such as Andr\u00e9 Thirion, argued that there were works of his after this period that continued to have some relevance for the movement. When the war reached Ireland with the Belfast Blitz in May 1941, Colin Middleton, who had experimented with surrealist themes in the 1930s, responded with a series of dark works reflecting the shocked state of the people of the city. These were exhibited at the Belfast Municipal Gallery and Museum after its restoration in 1943, following near destruction in the blitz.\nDuring the 1940s Surrealism's influence was also felt in England, America and the Netherlands where Gertrude Pape and her husband Theo van Baaren helped to popularize it in their publication The Clean Handkerchief. Mark Rothko took an interest in biomorphic figures, and in England Henry Moore, Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon and Paul Nash used or experimented with Surrealist techniques. However, Conroy Maddox, one of the first British Surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935, remained within the movement, and organized an exhibition of current Surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent Surrealism. Maddox's exhibition, titled \"Surrealism Unlimited\", was held in Paris and attracted international attention. He held his last one-man show in 2002, and died three years later. Magritte's work became more realistic in its depiction of actual objects, while maintaining the element of juxtaposition, such as in 1951's \"Personal Values (Les Valeurs Personnelles)\" and 1954's \"Empire of Light (L\u2019Empire des lumi\u00e8res)\". Magritte continued to produce works which have entered artistic vocabulary, such as \"Castle in the Pyrenees (Le Ch\u00e2teau des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es)\", which refers back to \"Voix\" from 1931, in its suspension over a landscape.\nOther figures from the Surrealist movement were expelled. Several of these artists, like Roberto Matta (by his own description) \"remained close to Surrealism\". Frida Kahlo should be mentioned. She had a New York solo exhibition in 1938 with 25 paintings, encouraged by Breton himself.\nAfter the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Endre Rozsda returned to Paris to continue creating his own word that had been transcended the surrealism. The preface to his first exhibition in the Furstenberg Gallery (1957) was written by Breton yet.\nMany new artists explicitly took up the Surrealist banner. Dorothea Tanning and Louise Bourgeois continued to work, for example, with Tanning's \"Rainy Day Canape\" from 1970. Duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret, including his installation depicting a woman realistically, viewed through a peephole: \u00c9tant_donn\u00e9s.\nBreton continued to write and espouse the importance of liberating the human mind, as with the publication \"The Tower of Light\" in 1952. Breton's return to France after the War, began a new phase of Surrealist activity in Paris, and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience. Breton insisted that Surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships, religious gestures and misery and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind.\nMajor exhibitions of the 1940s, '50s and '60s\nPost-Breton Surrealism.\nIn the 1960s, the artists and writers associated with the Situationist International were closely associated with Surrealism. While Guy Debord was critical of and distanced himself from Surrealism, others, such as Asger Jorn, were explicitly using Surrealist techniques and methods. The events of May 1968 in France included a number of Surrealist ideas, and among the slogans the students spray-painted on the walls of the Sorbonne were familiar Surrealist ones. Joan Mir\u00f3 would commemorate this in a painting titled \"May 1968.\" There were also groups who associated with both currents and were more attached to Surrealism, such as the Revolutionary Surrealist Group.\nDuring the 1980s, behind the Iron Curtain, Surrealism again entered into politics with an underground artistic opposition movement known as the Orange Alternative. The Orange Alternative was created in 1981 by Waldemar Fydrych (alias 'Major'), a graduate of history and art history at the University of Wroc\u0142aw. They used Surrealist symbolism and terminology in their large-scale happenings organized in the major Polish cities during the Jaruzelski regime and painted Surrealist graffiti on spots covering up anti-regime slogans. Major himself was the author of a \"Manifesto of Socialist Surrealism\". In this manifesto, he stated that the socialist (communist) system had become so Surrealistic that it could be seen as an expression of art itself.\nSurrealistic art also remains popular with museum patrons. The Guggenheim Museum in New York City held an exhibit, \"Two Private Eyes\", in 1999, and in 2001 Tate Modern held an exhibition of Surrealist art that attracted over 170,000 visitors. In 2002 the Met in New York City held a show, \"Desire Unbound\", and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris a show called \"La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste\".\nSurrealist groups and literary publications have continued to be active up to the present day, with groups such as the Chicago Surrealist Group, the Leeds Surrealist Group, Peculiar Mormyrid, and The Surrealist Group in Stockholm. Jan \u0160vankmajer of the Czech-Slovak Surrealists continues to make films and experiment with objects.\nImpact and influences.\nWhile Surrealism is typically associated with the arts, it has impacted many other fields. In this sense, Surrealism does not specifically refer only to self-identified \"Surrealists\", or those sanctioned by Breton, rather, it refers to a range of creative acts of revolt and efforts to liberate imagination. In addition to Surrealist theory being grounded in the ideas of Hegel, Marx and Freud, to its advocates its inherent dynamic is dialectical thought. Surrealist artists have also cited the alchemists, Dante, Hieronymus Bosch, the Marquis de Sade, Charles Fourier, Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont and Arthur Rimbaud as influences.\nMay 68.\nSurrealists believe that non-Western cultures also provide a continued source of inspiration for Surrealist activity because some may induce a better balance between instrumental reason and imagination in flight than Western culture. Surrealism has had an identifiable impact on radical and revolutionary politics, both directly \u2014 as in some Surrealists joining or allying themselves with radical political groups, movements and parties \u2014 and indirectly \u2014 through the way in which Surrealists emphasize the intimate link between freeing imagination and the mind, and liberation from repressive and archaic social structures. This was especially visible in the New Left of the 1960s and 1970s and the French revolt of May 1968, whose slogan \"All power to the imagination\" quoted by The Situationists and Enrag\u00e9s from the originally Marxist \"\"R\u00eav\u00e9\"-lutionary\" theory and praxis of Breton's French Surrealist group.\nPostmodernism and popular culture.\nMany significant literary movements in the later half of the 20th century were directly or indirectly influenced by Surrealism. This period is known as the Postmodern era; though there is no widely agreed upon central definition of Postmodernism, many themes and techniques commonly identified as Postmodern are nearly identical to Surrealism.\nFirst Papers of Surrealism presented the fathers of surrealism in an exhibition that represented the leading monumental step of the avant-gardes towards installation art. Many writers from and associated with the Beat Generation were influenced greatly by Surrealists. Philip Lamantia and Ted Joans are often categorized as both Beat and Surrealist writers. Many other Beat writers show significant evidence of Surrealist influence. A few examples include Bob Kaufman, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Artaud in particular was very influential to many of the Beats, but especially Ginsberg and Carl Solomon. Ginsberg cites Artaud's \"Van Gogh \u2013 The Man Suicided by Society\" as a direct influence on \"Howl\", along with Apollinaire's \"Zone\", Garc\u00eda Lorca's \"Ode to Walt Whitman\", and Schwitters' \"Priimiititiii\". The structure of Breton's \"Free Union\" had a significant influence on Ginsberg's \"Kaddish\". In Paris, Ginsberg and Corso met their heroes Tristan Tzara, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Benjamin P\u00e9ret, and to show their admiration Ginsberg kissed Duchamp's feet and Corso cut off Duchamp's tie.\nWilliam S. Burroughs, a core member of the Beat Generation and a postmodern novelist, developed the cut-up technique with former surrealist Brion Gysin\u2014in which chance is used to dictate the composition of a text from words cut out of other sources\u2014referring to it as the \"Surrealist Lark\" and recognizing its debt to the techniques of Tristan Tzara.\nPostmodern novelist Thomas Pynchon, who was also influenced by Beat fiction, experimented since the 1960s with the surrealist idea of startling juxtapositions; commenting on the \"necessity of managing this procedure with some degree of care and skill\", he added that \"any old combination of details will not do. Spike Jones Jr., whose father's orchestral recordings had a deep and indelible effect on me as a child, said once in an interview, 'One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.'\"\nMany other postmodern fiction writers have been directly influenced by Surrealism. Paul Auster, for example, has translated Surrealist poetry and said the Surrealists were \"a real discovery\" for him. Salman Rushdie, when called a Magical Realist, said he saw his work instead \"allied to surrealism\". David Lynch regarded as a surrealist filmmaker being quoted, \"David Lynch has once again risen to the spotlight as a champion of surrealism,\" in regard to his show \"Twin Peaks\". For the work of other postmodernists, such as Donald Barthelme and Robert Coover, a broad comparison to Surrealism is common.\nMagic realism, a popular technique among novelists of the latter half of the 20th century especially among Latin American writers, has some obvious similarities to Surrealism with its juxtaposition of the normal and the dream-like, as in the work of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. Carlos Fuentes was inspired by the revolutionary voice in Surrealist poetry and points to inspiration Breton and Artaud found in Fuentes' homeland, Mexico. Though Surrealism was a direct influence on Magic Realism in its early stages, many Magic Realist writers and critics, such as Amaryll Chanady and S. P. Ganguly, while acknowledging the similarities, cite the many differences obscured by the direct comparison of Magic Realism and Surrealism such as an interest in psychology and the artefacts of European culture they claim is not present in Magic Realism. A prominent example of a Magic Realist writer who points to Surrealism as an early influence is Alejo Carpentier who also later criticized Surrealism's delineation between real and unreal as not representing the true South American experience.\nSurrealist groups.\nSurrealist individuals and groups have carried on with Surrealism after the death of Andr\u00e9 Breton in 1966. The original Paris Surrealist Group was disbanded by member Jean Schuster in 1969, but another Parisian surrealist group was later formed. The current Surrealist Group of Paris has recently published the first issue of their new journal, \"Alcheringa\". The Group of Czech-Slovak Surrealists never disbanded, and continue to publish their journal \"Analogon\", which now spans almost 100 volumes.\nSurrealism and the theatre.\nSurrealist theatre and Artaud's \"Theatre of Cruelty\" were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic Martin Esslin called the \"Theatre of the Absurd\" (in his 1963 book of the same name). Though not an organized movement, Esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique; Esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the Surrealists. Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco in particular was fond of Surrealism, claiming at one point that Breton was one of the most important thinkers in history. Samuel Beckett was also fond of Surrealists, even translating much of the poetry into English. Other notable playwrights whom Esslin groups under the term, for example Arthur Adamov and Fernando Arrabal, were at some point members of the Surrealist group.\nAlice Farley is an American-born artist who became active during the 1970s in San Francisco after training in dance at the California Institute of the Arts. Farley uses vivid and elaborate costuming that she describes as \"the vehicles of transformation capable of making a character's thoughts visible\". Often collaborating with musicians such as Henry Threadgill, Farley explores the role of improvisation in dance, bringing in an automatic aspect to the productions. Farley has performed in a number of surrealist collaborations including the World Surrealist Exhibition in Chicago in 1976.\nAlleged precursors in older art.\nVarious much older artists are sometimes claimed as precursors of Surrealism. Foremost among these are Hieronymus Bosch and Giuseppe Arcimboldo, whom Dal\u00ed called the \"father of Surrealism.\" Apart from their followers, other artists who may be mentioned in this context include Joos de Momper, for some anthropomorphic landscapes. Many critics feel these works belong to fantastic art rather than having a significant connection with Surrealism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If formula_5, then formula_6. As for a system in static equilibrium, the acceleration equals zero, the system is either at rest, or its center of mass moves at constant velocity. \nThe application of the assumption of zero acceleration to the summation of moments acting on the system leads to formula_7, where formula_8 is the summation of all moments acting on the system, formula_9 is the moment of inertia of the mass and formula_10 is the angular acceleration of the system. For a system where formula_11, it is also true that formula_12\nTogether, the equations formula_13 (the 'first condition for equilibrium') and formula_7 (the 'second condition for equilibrium') can be used to solve for unknown quantities acting on the system.\nHistory.\nArchimedes (c.\u2009287\u2013c.\u2009212 BC) did pioneering work in statics.\nLater developments in the field of statics are found in works of Thebit.\nBackground.\nForce.\n\"Force\" is the action of one body on another. A force is either a push or a pull, and it tends to move a body in the direction of its action. The action of a force is characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its \"point of application\" (or \"point of contact\"). Thus, force is a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction as well as on the magnitude of the action.\nForces are classified as either contact or body forces. A contact force is produced by direct physical contact; an example is the force exerted on a body by a supporting surface. A body force is generated by virtue of the position of a body within a force field such as a gravitational, electric, or magnetic field and is independent of contact with any other body; an example of a body force is the weight of a body in the Earth's gravitational field.\nMoment of a force.\nIn addition to the tendency to move a body in the direction of its application, a force can also tend to rotate a body about an axis. The axis may be any line which neither intersects nor is parallel to the line of action of the force. This rotational tendency is known as \"moment of force\" (M). Moment is also referred to as \"torque\".\nMoment about a point.\nThe magnitude of the moment of a force at a point \"O\", is equal to the perpendicular distance from \"O\" to the line of action of \"F\", multiplied by the magnitude of the force: \"M\" = \"F\" \u00b7 \"d\", where\n \"F\" = the force applied\n \"d\" = the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force. This perpendicular distance is called the moment arm.\nThe direction of the moment is given by the right hand rule, where counter clockwise (CCW) is out of the page, and clockwise (CW) is into the page. The moment direction may be accounted for by using a stated sign convention, such as a plus sign (+) for counterclockwise moments and a minus sign (\u2212) for clockwise moments, or vice versa. Moments can be added together as vectors.\nIn vector format, the moment can be defined as the cross product between the radius vector, r (the vector from point O to the line of action), and the force vector, F:\nformula_15\nformula_16\nformula_17\nVarignon's theorem.\n\"Varignon's theorem\" states that the moment of a force about any point is equal to the sum of the moments of the components of the force about the same point.\nEquilibrium equations.\nThe static equilibrium of a particle is an important concept in statics. A particle is in equilibrium only if the resultant of all forces acting on the particle is equal to zero. In a rectangular coordinate system the equilibrium equations can be represented by three scalar equations, where the sums of forces in all three directions are equal to zero. An engineering application of this concept is determining the tensions of up to three cables under load, for example the forces exerted on each cable of a hoist lifting an object or of guy wires restraining a hot air balloon to the ground.\nMoment of inertia.\nIn classical mechanics, \"moment of inertia\", also called mass moment, rotational inertia, polar moment of inertia of mass, or the angular mass, (SI units kg\u00b7m\u00b2) is a measure of an object's resistance to changes to its rotation. It is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation. The moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in linear dynamics, describing the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity, torque and angular acceleration, and several other quantities. The symbols I and J are usually used to refer to the moment of inertia or polar moment of inertia.\nWhile a simple scalar treatment of the moment of inertia suffices for many situations, a more advanced tensor treatment allows the analysis of such complicated systems as spinning tops and gyroscopic motion.\nThe concept was introduced by Leonhard Euler in his 1765 book \"Theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum\"; he discussed the moment of inertia and many related concepts, such as the principal axis of inertia.\nApplications.\nSolids.\nStatics is used in the analysis of structures, for instance in architectural and structural engineering. \"Strength of materials\" is a related field of mechanics that relies heavily on the application of static equilibrium. A key concept is the center of gravity of a body at rest: it represents an imaginary point at which all the mass of a body resides. The position of the point relative to the foundations on which a body lies determines its stability in response to external forces. If the center of gravity exists outside the foundations, then the body is unstable because there is a torque acting: any small disturbance will cause the body to fall or topple. If the center of gravity exists within the foundations, the body is stable since no net torque acts on the body. If the center of gravity coincides with the foundations, then the body is said to be metastable.\nFluids.\n\"Hydrostatics\", also known as \"fluid statics\", is the study of fluids at rest (i.e. in static equilibrium). The characteristic of any fluid at rest is that the force exerted on any particle of the fluid is the same at all points at the same depth (or altitude) within the fluid. If the net force is greater than zero the fluid will move in the direction of the resulting force. This concept was first formulated in a slightly extended form by French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal in 1647 and became known as Pascal's law. It has many important applications in hydraulics. Archimedes, Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, Al-Khazini and Galileo Galilei were also major figures in the development of hydrostatics.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28769", "revid": "20468248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28769", "title": "Maritime transport", "text": "Transport of people or goods via waterways\nMaritime transport (or ocean transport) or more generally waterborne transport, is the transport of people (passengers) or goods (cargo) via waterways. Freight transport by watercraft has been widely used throughout recorded history, as it provides a higher-capacity mode of transportation for passengers and cargo than land transport, the latter typically being more costly per unit payload due to it being affected by terrain conditions and road/rail infrastructures. The advent of aviation during the 20th century has diminished the importance of sea travel for passengers, though it is still popular for short trips and pleasure cruises. Transport by watercraft is much cheaper than transport by aircraft or land vehicles (both road and rail), but is significantly slower for longer journeys and heavily dependent on adequate port facilities. Maritime transport accounts for roughly 80% of international trade, according to UNCTAD in 2020.\nMaritime transport can be realized over any distance as long as there are connecting bodies of water that are navigable to boats, ships or barges such as oceans, lakes, rivers and canals. Shipping may be for commerce, recreation, or military purposes, and is an important aspect of logistics in human societies since early shipbuilding and river engineering were developed, leading to canal ages in various civilizations. While extensive inland shipping is less critical today, the major waterways of the world including many canals are still very important and are integral parts of worldwide economies. Particularly, especially any material can be moved by water; however, water transport becomes impractical when material delivery is time-critical such as various types of perishable produce. Still, water transport is highly cost effective with regular schedulable cargoes, such as trans-oceanic shipping of consumer products\u00a0\u2013 and especially for heavy loads or bulk cargos, such as coal, coke, ores or grains. Arguably, the Industrial Revolution had its first impacts where cheap water transport by canal, navigations, or shipping by all types of watercraft on natural waterways supported cost-effective bulk transport.\nContainerization revolutionized maritime transport starting in the 1970s. \"General cargo\" includes goods packaged in boxes, cases, pallets, and barrels. When a cargo is carried in more than one mode, it is intermodal or co-modal.\nDescription.\nA nation's shipping fleet (variously called merchant navy, merchant marine, or merchant fleet) consists of the ships operated by civilian crews to transport passengers or cargo from one place to another. Merchant shipping also includes water transport over the river and canal systems connecting inland destinations, large and small. For example, during the early modern era, cities in the Hanseatic League began taming Northern Europe's rivers and harbors. Similarly, the Saint Lawrence Seaway connects the port cities on the Great Lakes in Canada and the United States with the Atlantic Ocean shipping routes, while the various Illinois canals connect the Great Lakes and Canada with New Orleans. Ores, coal, and grains can travel along the rivers of the American midwest to Pittsburgh or to Birmingham, Alabama. Professional mariners are known as merchant seamen, merchant sailors, and merchant mariners, or simply seamen, sailors, or mariners. The terms \"seaman\" or \"sailor\" may also refer to a member of a country's martial navy.\nAccording to the 2005 CIA World Factbook, the total number of merchant ships of at least 1,000 gross register tons in the world was 30,936. In 2010, it was 38,988, an increase of 26%, across many countries. As of December 2018[ [update]], a quarter of all merchant mariners were born in the Philippines.\nLiners and tramps.\nA ship may also be categorized as to how it is operated.\nShips and watercraft.\nShips and other watercraft are used for maritime transport. Types can be distinguished by propulsion, size or cargo type. Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow-draft areas, such as the Everglades, some craft, such as the hovercraft, are propelled by large pusher-prop fans.\nMost modern merchant ships can be placed in one of a few categories, such as:\nTypical in-transit times.\nA cargo ship sailing from a European port to a US one will typically take 10\u201312 days depending on water currents and other factors. To make container ship transport more economical, ship operators sometimes reduce cruising speed, thereby increasing transit time, to reduce fuel consumption, a strategy referred to as \"slow steaming\".\nHistory.\nMaritime transport began in prehistory: around 4000 BCE, when people living in river-valley and coastal societies, such as in Mesopotamia, developed basic watercraft to move people, food and goods along waterways. Over millennia, the invention of sails and refined hull-building techniques enabled increasingly complex seafaring, laying the foundations for ancient maritime trade routes and long-distance commerce. \nFor much of history, maritime trade relied on relatively simple ships transporting bulk cargo or loose goods (\u201cbreak-bulk\u201d cargo), loaded and unloaded manually at ports. With the rise of global trade in the 20th century, this labor-intensive method became a bottleneck for efficiency. \nFrom then onward, standardised containers and purpose-built container ships replaced much of the older trade methods, boosting the speed, scale, and reliability of international maritime freight and enabling interconnected global supply chains of today.\nProfessional mariners.\nA ship's complement can be divided into four categories: \nDeck department.\n Officer positions in the deck department include but not limited to the Master and his Chief, Second, and Third officers. The official classifications for unlicensed members of the deck department are Able Seaman and Ordinary Seaman.\nA common deck crew for a ship includes:\nA deck cadet is a person who is carrying out mandatory sea time to achieve their officer of the watch certificate. Their time on board is spent learning the operations and tasks of everyday life on a merchant vessel.\nEngine department.\nA ship's engine department consists of the members of a ship's crew that operate and maintain the propulsion and other systems on board the vessel. Engine staff also deal with the \"Hotel\" facilities on board, notably the sewage, lighting, air conditioning, and water systems. They deal with bulk fuel transfers, and require training in firefighting and first aid, as well as in dealing with the ship's boats and other nautical tasks- especially with cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems, though the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers. On LPG and LNG tankers, however, a cargo engineer works with the deck department during cargo operations, as well as being a watchkeeping engineer.\nA common engine crew for a ship includes:\nMany American ships also carry a motorman. Other possible positions include machinist, electrician, refrigeration engineer, and tankerman. Engine cadets are engineer trainees who are completing sea time necessary before they can obtain a watchkeeping license.\nSteward's department.\nA typical steward's department for a cargo ship would be composed of a chief steward, a chief cook, and a steward's assistant. All three positions are typically filled by unlicensed personnel. The chief steward directs, instructs, and assigns personnel performing such functions as preparing and serving meals; cleaning and maintaining officers' quarters and steward department areas; and receiving, issuing, and inventorying stores. On large passenger vessels, the Catering Department is headed by the chief purser and managed by assistant pursers. Although they enjoy the benefits of having officer rank, they generally progress through the ranks to become pursers. Under the pursers are the department heads \u2013 such as chief cook, head waiter, head barman etc. They are responsible for the administration of their own areas.\nThe chief steward also plans menus and compiles supply, overtime, and cost control records. They may requisition or purchase stores and equipment. They may bake bread, rolls, cakes, pies, and pastries. A chief steward's duties may overlap with those of the steward's assistant, the chief cook, and other Steward's Department crewmembers.\nIn the United States Merchant Marine, a chief steward must have a Merchant Mariner's Document issued by the United States Coast Guard. Because of international law, conventions, and agreements, all chief cooks who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries.\nOther departments.\nStaff officer positions on a ship, including junior assistant purser, senior assistant purser, purser, chief purser, medical doctor, professional nurse, marine physician sssistant, and hospital corpsman, are considered administrative positions and are therefore regulated by certificates of tegistry issued by the United States Coast Guard. Pilots are also merchant marine officers and are licensed by the Coast Guard. Formerly, there was also a radio department, headed by a chief radio officer and supported by a number of radio officers. Since the introduction of GMDSS (Satellite communications) and the subsequent exemptions from carrying radio officers if the vessel is so equipped, this department has fallen away, although many ships do still carry specialist radio officers, particularly passenger vessels. Many radio officers became 'electro-technical officers', and transferred into the engine department.\nLife at sea.\nMariners spend much of their life beyond the reach of land. They sometimes face dangerous conditions at sea or on lakes\u00a0\u2013 the fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts has a seaside memorial listing over 10,000 fishermen who lost their lives to the sea, and the Great Lakes have seen over 10,000 lost vessels since the 1800s, yet men and women still go to sea. For some, the attraction is a life unencumbered with the restraints of life ashore. Seagoing adventure and a chance to see the world also appeal to many seafarers. Whatever the calling, those who live and work at sea invariably confront social isolation.\nFindings by the Seafarer's International Research Center indicate a leading cause of mariners leaving the industry is \"almost invariably because they want to be with their families.\" U.S. merchant ships typically do not allow family members to accompany seafarers on voyages. Industry experts increasingly recognize isolation, stress, and fatigue as occupational hazards. Advocacy groups such as International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency, and the Nautical Institute are seeking improved international standards for mariners. Satellite phones have improved communication and efficiency aboard sea-faring ships. This technology has contributed to crew welfare, although both equipment and fees are expensive.\nOcean voyages are steeped in routine. Maritime tradition dictates that each day be divided into six four-hour periods. Three groups of watch keepers from the engine and deck departments work four hours on then have eight hours off watch keeping. However, there are many overtime jobs to be done daily. This cycle repeats endlessly, 24 hours a day while the ship is at sea. Members of the steward department typically are day workers who put in at least eight-hour shifts. Operations at sea, including repairs, safeguarding against piracy, securing cargo, underway replenishment, and other duties provide opportunities for overtime work. Service aboard ships typically extends for months at a time, followed by protracted shore leave. However, some seamen secure jobs on ships they like and stay aboard for years.\nThe quick turnaround of many modern ships, spending only a few hours in port, limits a seafarer's free-time ashore. Moreover, some foreign seamen entering U.S. ports from a watch list of 25 countries face restrictions on shore leave due to maritime security concerns. However, shore leave restrictions while in U.S. ports impact American seamen as well. For example, the International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots notes a trend of U.S. shipping terminal operators restricting seamen from traveling from the ship to the terminal gate. Furthermore, in cases where transit is allowed, special \"security fees\" are at times assessed.\nSuch restrictions on shore leave, coupled with reduced time in port, translate into longer periods at sea. Mariners report that extended periods at sea living and working with shipmates, who for the most part are strangers, takes getting used to. At the same time, there is an opportunity to meet people from other ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Recreational opportunities have improved aboard some U.S. ships, which may feature gyms and day rooms for watching movies, swapping sea stories, and other activities. And in some cases, especially tankers, it is possible for a mariner to be accompanied by members of his family. However, a mariner's off-duty time is largely a solitary affair, pursuing hobbies, reading, writing letters, and sleeping.\nOn modern ocean-going vessels, typically registered with a flag of convenience, life has changed immensely in the last 20 years. Most large vessels include a gym and often a swimming pool for use by the crew. Since the \"Exxon Valdez\" incident, the focus of leisure time activity has shifted from having officer and crew bars, to simply having lounge-style areas where officers or crew can sit to watch movies. With many companies now providing TVs and DVD players in cabins, and enforcing strict smoking policies, it is not surprising that the bar is now a much quieter place on most ships. In some instances games consoles are provided for the officers and crew. The officers enjoy a much higher standard of living on board ocean-going vessels.\nCrews are generally poorly paid, poorly qualified and have to complete contracts of approximately 9 months before returning home on leave. They often come from countries where the average industrial wage is still very low, such as the Philippines or India. Officers however, come from all over the world and it is not uncommon to mix the nationality of the officers on board ships. Officers are often the recipients of university degrees and have completed vast amounts of training to reach their rank. Officers benefit e.g. by having larger, more comfortable cabins and table service for their meals.\nContracts average at the 4-month mark for officers, with generous leave. Most ocean-going vessels now operate an unmanned engine room system allowing engineers to work days only. The engine room is computer controlled by night, although the duty engineer will make inspections during unmanned operation. Engineers work in a hot, humid, noisy atmosphere. Communication in the engine room is therefore by hand signals and lip-reading, and good teamwork often stands in place of any communication at all.\nInfrastructure.\nFor a port to efficiently send and receive cargo, it requires infrastructure: docks, bollards, pilings, cranes, bulk cargo handling equipment, and so on\u00a0\u2013 equipment and organization supporting the role of the facilities. From pier to pier these may differ, one dock handling intermodal transport needs (container-ships linked to rail by cranes); another bulk handling capabilities (such as conveyors, elevators, tanks, pumps) for loading and unloading bulk cargoes like grain, coal, or fuels. Others may be outfitted as passenger terminals or for mixed mode operations.\nGenerally, Harbors, seaports and marinas all host watercraft, and consist of components such as piers, wharfs, docks and roadsteads.\nEnvironmental impact.\nThe environmental impact of shipping includes greenhouse gas emissions, acoustic, and oil pollution. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that Carbon dioxide emissions from shipping were equal to 2.2% of the global human-made emissions in 2012 and expects them to rise 50 to 250 percent by 2050 if no action is taken. The IEA forecasts that ammonia will meet approximately 45% of shipping fuel demands by 2050.\nInnovation and development.\nThe global economy relies heavily on maritime transportation. Maritime transport accounts for over 80% of international trade, according to UNCTAD in 2021, and the percentage is even higher for most developing countries.In its Review of Maritime transport 2024, UNCTAD, points out that \u00ab the sector, whose greenhouse gas emissions have risen 20% over the last decade, operates an ageing fleet that runs almost exclusively on fossil fuels \u00bb. Besides, maritime trade is expected to grow 2.4% in 2023 and more than 2% between 2024 and 2028.\nTwo significant megatrends are observed in terms of maritime transport innovation, sustainability and digitalization. A report published by WIPO in 2025 show a steady increase of patents publication in maritime transportation, the majority of which being related to sustainable propulsion, followed by communication and security.\nTransitioning to more sustainable forms of propulsion will help reach decarbonization targets. Technological breakthroughs are advancing low and zero-emission solutions, including more sustainable carbon-based fuels, hydrogen, methanol, ammonia, electric propulsion, and optimizing energy consumption through efficient ship design. However, according to the report, scaling up production and ensuring the cost-effectiveness of carbon-neutral fuels remains a challenge. \nBetween 2000 and 2023, the number of published patent families in sustainable propulsion increased annually from less than 300 to more than 2,800. In this field, the most important area in terms of patent families is efficient ship design. This includes research activities focused on optimizing hull shape so as to minimize drag, designing efficient propellers or introducing air bubbles under the hull. China is the leader in efficient ship design, batteries and electric propulsion, and the South Korea has published the most patent families in hydrogen/fuel cell research and sustainable fuels. Another important research area is sustainable carbon-based fuels. The vast majority of patents in this area relate to liquified natural gas (LNG) fuels for ships.\nCommunication and Security technologies are making ships smarter and safer, with key research areas including navigation, device-to-device communication, low-latency communications, cloud platforms, and cybersecurity. Piracy and terror attacks remain a threat in international shipping, with global piracy and armed robbery incidents having increased in 2023 compared to 2022.\nAutomation and Circularity technologies could boost productivity and enable more energy-efficient ships, with key research themes including efficient material use, smart production and robotics technology, and recycling, but represent a very small area of patenting in the last decade.\nHuman-Machine-Interface technologies are emerging as useful tools to improve the way we interact with ships. However, all HMI technologies are still in the early stages of development with little adoption in shipping. Research areas include extended reality technologies, speech recognition technology, facial recognition, and touch displays.\nOver 70% of all Sea transport patents come from Asia, led by China (36%), the South Korea (25%) and Japan (9%). China's growth has been on an upward trajectory since 2016, whereas the increase from the South Korea started earlier in 2010 but since 2012 annual filings from Korean inventors have remained relatively stable. Denmark is the most dynamic European nation, followed by Finland, and France, although absolute patent numbers remain relatively small. Only 14% of patents are from Europe and 11% from North America. Top patents owners are companies or universities, such as Harbin Engineering University, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Wuhan University of Technology, Gaztransport &amp; Technigaz, Dalian Maritime University, or Dalian Maritime University. \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in the western part of Antigua, surrounding St. John's Harbour. The city is Antigua and Barbuda's primate city, having a population of 22,219. St. John's also tends to dominate the parish of Saint John, which composes much of the city's metropolitan area. From its establishment after the French invasion in 1666, the city has rapidly grown, eventually replacing Falmouth as the island's dominant city. \nAfter its establishment, St. John's became an official trading point in 1675. By 1689, St. John's had overtaken Falmouth in population. St. John's continued to grow throughout the 1700s, occasionally being impacted by a fire or hurricane. St. John's has largely been spared from armed conflict, although a large-scale slave revolt was planned in the city in 1736. \nSt. John's is not necessarily a tourist destination, as it primarily functions as the country's economic centre. St. John's is home to Antigua State College, the country's largest higher education institution, and an open campus of the University of the West Indies. St. John's is attempting to modernise its economy, being home to many convention centres and contemporary office buildings. St. John's is also home to the national library and most government agencies. St. John's is the origin of the All Saints Road corridor, in which most of the country's population lives. While St. John's completely dominates its metropolitan area, the city's economy has stimulated that of surrounding areas like Piggotts and Cedar Valley. While St. John's houses all three branches of government, no law has declared St. John's the official capital city. Most diplomatic missions are located in the nearby village of Marble Hill.\nHistory.\nPrior to its establishment, a small group of houses in what is now St. John's lined an area known as \"the Cove\", now St. John's Harbour. St. John's was laid out following the French invasion of 1666, due to the site's strategic location on St. John's Harbour. An act was passed to build a town on the harbour in April 1668. On 16 September 1675, a sitting of the island\u2019s legislature in Old Road established six places of trade, one of which being St. John\u2019s. This was a significant increase from the traditional two. By 1689, St. John\u2019s was as large as Falmouth. The remainder of the 1600s were largely peaceful, until 7 December 1710. On that date, Daniel Parke was killed after much of his assembly had nearly been expelled from St. John's to Parham. In 1736, a plan by St. John's resident Prince Klaas to turn Antigua into an independent African kingdom was discovered, resulting in his being killed. 132 other co-conspirators were also punished. The plot caused a large scare, and in 1741, barracks were built on Rat Island, and in 1753, in the centre of the town.\nIn 1768, the city was hit by a major fire. By this time, St. John's was also the seat of government of the British Leeward Islands, a title it maintained until the colony's permanent abolishment in 1959. In 1772 the island was hit by a hurricane, resulting in significant damage to the city's shipping industry. In 1782, the city was again damaged by a fire that occurred in one of the most densely populated parts of the city. In 1784, the city's night watch was established, and citizens of the city were subjected to a tax to pay for it. To prevent another fire, building regulations were also improved, with most public buildings being required to have brick walls and tiled or slate roofs. In 1786, another tax was established due to the prevalence of vermin, reptiles, prickly pear bushes lining the streets. The roads were also not paved at the time, nor were they kept clean. Gaming tables were also outlawed. In 1790, the parish vestry was granted the ability to tax traders, which impacted the city due to it being the parish's economic centre. In the early 1800s, the present-day Government House was built.\nDuring the late 1800s and early 1900s, St. John's once had an elected city council. The council no longer exists, and there is no longer a city-wide local government. In Downtown St. John's, the St. John's Development Corporation continues to handle a degree local government. St. John's is now the country's primate city, being home to around a quarter of its population, and about half of the population of the parish. St. John's was once home to an airstrip in the 1940s at the Old Runway area of Villa, but is now served by V. C. Bird International Airport.\nWhile no law explicitly states St. John's is the island's capital, the city is home to the Government Complex in the Botanical Gardens neighbourhood, which is home to the High Court, the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Parliament Building. The Parliament building was opened in 2006. The Labour Party largely dominates the city's politics, carrying the city in the 2023 election.\nGeography and climate.\nSt. John's was laid out on a gentle slope east of St. John's Harbour. The city is bordered by primarily flat land, allowing a large network of roads to converge in the city. Due to this gentle elevation gradient, wastewater runoff is common due to poor planning along with a high concentration of high concentration of clayey loam soil above a high water table. The high water table allows for an easy source of water for the city's wells. The gentle slope also allowed for ease in constructing roads and pedestrian walkways. The coastline of the city is prone to flooding due to its low elevation.\nNearby villages and settlements include St. Johnston. McKinnon's Pond is located just north of St. John's. Areas are the second-level administrative divisions of Antigua and Barbuda. St. John's was considered a first-level administrative division for the purposes of dividing the areas, and the areas tend to coincide with the neighbourhoods of the city.\nSt. John's has a Tropical savanna climate (Koppen: Aw) with summer-like weather year-round, with hot days and warm nights. Rainfall is at its highest during the months of September to November due to hurricane activity. On 12 August 1995, a temperature of was recorded, which was the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Antigua and Barbuda.\nDemographics.\nThe majority of the population of St. John's reflects that of the rest of Antigua: people of African and mixed European-African ancestry, with a European minority, including British and Portuguese. There is a population of Levantine Christian Arabs. St. John's is among the most impoverished locations in the country. This is due to a large number of immigrants from abroad, and many people from rural areas looking for work. Despite this influx, the population of the city has been declining for a few decades.\nEconomy.\nSt. John's is one of the most developed and cosmopolitan municipalities in the Lesser Antilles. The city is famous for its shopping malls as well as boutiques throughout the city, selling designer jewellery and haute-couture clothing. St. John's attracts tourists from the resorts on the island and from the cruise ships which dock in its harbour at Heritage Quay and Redcliffe Quay several times a week. These two quays are where the city's tourist activity is centred, with Redcliffe Quay having a good historic reputation, and Heritage Quay being significantly more modern and crowded. Botanical Gardens is the headquarters of the government of Antigua and Barbuda and the largest park area in the city. The investment banking industry has a strong presence in the city. Major world financial institutions have offices in St. John's. There is a market on the southwestern edge of the city where fresh produce, meats, and fresh fish are sold daily. The Antigua Rum Distillery is located at the Citadel and is the only rum distillery on the island.\nGovernment.\nSt John's is the home of the Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda. St John's is the capital of the Parish of Saint John.\nThe Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority has its headquarters on Factory Road in St. John's.\nSt John's is twinned with Waltham Forest borough in London, England.\nThe current Executive Director of the city centre is Craig B. Whyte, while the current City Manager is Carolyn Thomas-Parker.\nCulture.\nThere are several museums, including the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda and the Museum of Marine Art, a small facility containing fossilised bedrock, volcanic stones, petrified wood, a collection of more than 10,000 shells, and artefacts from English shipwrecks.\nJust east of St. John's is the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, a multi-use stadium in North Sound, that was created mostly for cricket matches, and has hosted the matches during the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The Antigua Recreation Ground, Antigua and Barbuda's national stadium, is located in St. John's.\nThe city's skyline is dominated by the white baroque towers of St. John's Cathedral.\nThe Botanical Garden is near the intersection of Factory Road and Independence Avenue. This small park's shaded benches and gazebo provide a quiet refuge from the bustle of activity of St. John's.\nSandy Island is a lighthouse located on a small island about 5\u00a0km off the coast leading the way to St. John's harbour.\nFort James stands at the entrance to St. John's harbour, across from Fort Barrington. Other fortifications on the island include Fort Berkeley, Fort George, Fort Charles, and Fort Shirley (Shirley Heights).\nGovernment House is the governor's residence, originally a 19th-century parsonage building. It is included on the World Monuments Fund's 2018 list of monuments at risk, following exposure to severe weather events.\nEducation.\nSt. John's is home to two medical schools \u2013 the American University of Antigua and University of Health Sciences Antigua. Secondary schools include Christ the King High School, Princess Margaret School and the Antigua Girls High School. Private grade schools include St. John's Lutheran School of the WELS\nTransportation.\nSt. John's is served by the V. C. Bird International Airport.\nFort Road Heliport is located in the city, on Fort Road.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales. Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals. Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape.\nPeitgen \"et al.\" explain the concept as such:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If parts of a figure are small replicas of the whole, then the figure is called \"self-similar\"...A figure is \"strictly self-similar\" if the figure can be decomposed into parts which are exact replicas of the whole. Any arbitrary part contains an exact replica of the whole figure.Since mathematically, a fractal may show self-similarity under arbitrary magnification, it is impossible to recreate this physically. Peitgen \"et al.\" suggest studying self-similarity using approximations:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis vocabulary was introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1964.\nSelf-affinity.\nIn mathematics, self-affinity is a feature of a fractal whose pieces are scaled by different amounts in the \"x\" and \"y\" directions. This means that to appreciate the self-similarity of these fractal objects, they have to be rescaled using an anisotropic affine transformation.\nDefinition.\nA compact topological space \"X\" is self-similar if there exists a finite set \"S\" indexing a set of non-surjective homeomorphisms formula_1 for which \nformula_2\nIf formula_3, we call \"X\" self-similar if it is the only non-empty subset of \"Y\" such that the equation above holds for formula_4. We call. \nformula_5\na \"self-similar structure\". The homeomorphisms may be iterated, resulting in an iterated function system. The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a monoid. When the set \"S\" has only two elements, the monoid is known as the dyadic monoid. The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite binary tree; more generally, if the set \"S\" has \"p\" elements, then the monoid may be represented as a p-adic tree.\nThe automorphisms of the dyadic monoid is the modular group; the automorphisms can be pictured as hyperbolic rotations of the binary tree.\nA more general notion than self-similarity is self-affinity.\nExamples.\nThe Cantor discontinuum is self-similar since any of its closed subsets is a continuous image of the discontinuum.\nThe Mandelbrot set is also self-similar around Misiurewicz points.\nSelf-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in teletraffic engineering, packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar. This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.\nSimilarly, stock market movements are described as displaying self-affinity, i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate affine transformation for the level of detail being shown. Andrew Lo describes stock market log return self-similarity in econometrics.\nFinite subdivision rules are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle.\nSome space filling curves, such as the Peano curve and Moore curve, also feature properties of self-similarity.\nIn cybernetics.\nThe viable system model of Stafford Beer is an organizational model with an affine self-similar hierarchy, where a given viable system is one element of the System One of a viable system one recursive level higher up, and for whom the elements of its System One are viable systems one recursive level lower down.\nIn nature.\nSelf-similarity can be found in nature, as well. Plants, such as Romanesco broccoli, exhibit strong self-similarity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is hard to establish the associated alcoholic content, since systematic records of brewing practice do not exist much before the Georgian era.\nIt was common for workers who engaged in laborious tasks to drink more than ten imperial pints (5.7 litres) of small beer a day to quench their thirst. Small beer was also consumed for its nutrition content. It might contain traces of wheat or bread suspended within it. \nBefore safe drinking water supply, it had the advantages for consumers that the brewing process sterilized it through boiling and the fermentation process and alcohol content helped preserve it and inhibit microbe growth.\nIn 17th century England, it was an excise class which was determined by its wholesale price. Between the years 1782 and 1802, table beer was said to define that which cost between six and eleven shillings per barrel and the tax on this class was around three shillings. Cheaper beer was considered \"small beer\" while the more expensive brands were classed as strong (big) beer. The differences between small beer and table beer were removed in 1802 because there was much fraudulent mixing of the types. \nSmall beer was socially acceptable in 18th-century England because of its lower alcohol content, allowing people to drink several glasses without becoming drunk. William Hogarth's portrait \"Beer Street\" (1751) shows a group of happy workers going about their business after drinking table beer. It became increasingly popular during the 19th century, displacing malt liquor as the drink of choice for families and servants.\nIn his \"A Plan for the Conduct of Female Education, in Boarding Schools\" published 1797, writer Erasmus Darwin agreed that \"For the drink of the more robust children water is preferable, and for the weaker ones, small beer ...\". Ruthin School's charter, signed by Elizabeth I, stipulates that small beer should be provided to all scholars, and larger educational establishments like Eton, Winchester, and Oxford University even ran their own breweries. \nTo a large extent, the role of small beer as an everyday drink was gradually overtaken in the British Isles by tea, as that became cheaper from the later 18th century.\nContemporary usage.\nSmall beer and small ale can also refer to beers made from the second runnings from the stronger beer (e.g., Scotch ale). Such beers can be as strong as a mild ale, but it depends on the strength of the original mash. This was an economic measure in household brewing in England until the 18th century, and still produced by some homebrewers. it is now only produced commercially in small quantities in Britain, and is not widely available in pubs or shops.\nIn Belgium, small or table beer is known as \"bi\u00e8re de table\" or \"tafelbier\" and many varieties are still brewed there. Breweries that still make this type of beer include De Es of Schalkhoven and Gigi of G\u00e9rouville in the Province of Luxembourg. In the US, a Vienna lager was a popular table beer before prohibition. Small beers are also produced in Germany and Switzerland albeit using local brewing methods.\nIn art and history.\nLiterature.\nMetaphorically, \"small beer\" means a trifle, or a thing of little importance.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The peninsula is bounded by the Curonian Lagoon to the north-east, the Vistula Lagoon in the southwest, the Pregolya River in the south, and the Deyma River in the east. As Sambia is surrounded on all sides by water, it is technically an island. Historically it formed an important part of the historic region of Prussia.\nEtymology.\nSambia is named after the Sambians, an extinct tribe of Old Prussians. \"Samland\" is the name for the peninsula in the Germanic languages. Polish and Latin speakers call the area \"Sambia\", while the Lithuanian name is \"Semba\".\nGeography and geology.\nBaedeker describes Sambia as \"a fertile and partly-wooded district, with several lakes, lying to the north of K\u00f6nigsberg\" (since 1946 Kaliningrad). The landscape is hilly in the west, with coastal bluffs and beaches, while in the east it is low-lying and flat. The sections of coast adjacent to the Curonian and Vistula Lagoons are often swampy. Due to the moderating influence of the Baltic Sea, the climate is more mild than regions of comparable latitude further east. The highest point at 111 meters, Galtgarben, is found two kilometers southeast of Kumachyovo ().\nGvardeysk () is located at the southeastern end of the peninsula where the Deyma branches off from the Pregolya, while Polessk () is found at the northeastern end, nearby where that river enters the Curonian Lagoon. The peninsula is connected to the Curonian Spit to the north, while it is separated from the Vistula Spit by the Strait of Baltiysk next to the port city of Baltiysk (). Sambia also includes two famous seaside resorts on its northern coast, Zelenogradsk () and Svetlogorsk ().\nAmber.\nAmber has been found in the area for over two thousand years, especially on the coast near Kaliningrad. History and legends tell of the ancient trade routes known as the Amber Road leading from the Old Prussian settlements of Kaup (in Sambia) and Truso (near Elbl\u0105g, near the mouth of the Vistula) southwards to the Black and Adriatic seas. In Imperial Germany, the right to collect amber was restricted to the Hohenzollern dynasty, and visitors to Sambia's beaches were forbidden to pick up any fragments they found. Beginning in the 19th century, amber was mined on an industrial scale by the Germans before 1945 and by the Soviets / Russians thereafter at Yantarny (former German name: \"Palmnicken\").\nHistory.\nReference to the Sambia Peninsula begins with Greek traveller Pytheas, referring to an amber island called \"Abalus\". The name probably described the whole lagoon area known in Finnic as AVA (open expanse = lagoon) and -LA (place of) Historic scholars could not find the mysterious amber island because the Sambia Peninsula did not look like an island since the whole Baltic area that was depressed by the Ice Age glaciers has been rising many meters in the last thousands of years and was no longer looking like an island by the 10th century. Based on finds of prehistoric amber carvings, nomadic boat using hunter gatherers were attracted to the area as early as 6,000 years ago,according to archeology.\nSambia was originally sparsely populated by the Sambians. The German Teutonic Knights conquered the region in the 13th century. The church administration was placed under the Bishopric of Samland, established in 1243. Settlers from the Holy Roman Empire began colonizing the region, and the Sambian Prussians gradually became assimilated. The peninsula was the last area in which the Old Prussian language was spoken before becoming extinct at the beginning of the 18th century.\nIn 1454, the region was incorporated by King Casimir IV Jagiellon to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. After the subsequent Thirteen Years' War, since 1466, it formed part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order. The peninsula became part of the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal duchy of the Kingdom of Poland, founded when Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the 37th Grand Master, secularized the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights in 1525. The Margraviate of Brandenburg inherited the duchy in 1618 under Polish overlordship.\nBecause the Duchy of Prussia failed to fulfill its feudal obligations as a vassal of Poland during the Polish\u2013Swedish wars, George William's rule in Prussia was suspended in 1635 and he was replaced by the Polish king by a viceroy, Jerzy Ossoli\u0144ski. However, under the Treaty of Sztumska Wie\u015b the Duchy (and so the Sambia peninsula) was given back to George William. In 1701 Hohenzollern ruler proclaimed the Kingdom of Prussia and Sambia became part of the newly formed Province of East Prussia in 1773. In 1871, the peninsula became part of the German Empire in the course of the unification of Germany. After World War I Sambia formed part of the East Prussian province of Weimar Germany.\nDuring World War II, the Germans operated two subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp, and the AGSSt Samland assembly center for Allied POWs in the region. The Polish resistance movement was active in the region, with its activities including espionage of German activity and distribution of Polish underground press.\nIn 1945 after World War II, the Soviet Union annexed northern East Prussia, including Sambia, while the southern part of the province became again part of Poland. Sambia became part of the Soviet Kaliningrad Oblast, named after the nearby city of Kaliningrad (historically ), and the new authorities expelled its German inhabitants in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement.\nThe Soviet Union gradually repopulated the Kaliningrad Oblast, including Sambia, with Russians and Belarusians. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, much of the district was a closed military area.\nKursenieki.\nWhile today the Kursenieki, also known as Kur\u0161ininkai are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kur\u0161ininkai settlement spanned from Memel (Klaip\u0117da) to Gda\u0144sk, Poland, including the coastline of the Sambian Peninsula. The Kur\u0161ininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kur\u0161ininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel, and other territories of East Prussia which would be later dropped.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28791", "revid": "44822735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28791", "title": "Sovereignty", "text": "Supreme authority within a territory\nSovereignty can generally be defined as supreme, independent control and lawmaking authority over a territory. It finds expression in the power to rule and make law. Sovereignty entails hierarchy within a state as well as external autonomy for states. In any state, sovereignty is assigned to the person, body or institution that has the ultimate authority over other people and to change existing laws. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme legitimate authority over some polity. Under international law, sovereign states are all considered equal, and no state can interfere with the internal affairs of another sovereign state. While Article 2(7) of the UN Charter explicitly recognizes the sovereignty of states, and in general there is a principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign states, the UN Security Council\u2019s Chapter VII powers clearly contemplate the use of force against a state when necessary to restore peace. Further, the recent Responsibility to Protect (R2P) authorizes the United Nations to take action to \u201cavert a humanitarian catastrophe\u201d within a state when that state\u2019s government cannot or will not act. \nA state is generally considered to have sovereignty over a territory when it has consistently exercised state authority there without objection from other states. \"De jure\" sovereignty refers to the legal right to do so; \"de facto\" sovereignty refers to the factual ability to do so. This can become an issue of special concern upon the failure of the usual expectation that \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" sovereignty exist at the place and time of concern, and reside within the same organization. \nEtymology.\nThe term arises from the unattested Vulgar Latin *\"superanus\" (itself a derived form of Latin \"super\" \u2013 \"over\") meaning \"chief\", \"ruler\". Its spelling, which has varied since the word's first appearance in English in the 14th century, was influenced by the English word \"reign\".\nConcepts.\nThe concept of sovereignty has had multiple conflicting components, varying definitions, and diverse and inconsistent applications throughout history. The current notion of state sovereignty contains four aspects: territory, population, authority and recognition. According to Stephen D. Krasner, the term could also be understood in four different ways:\nOften, these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the case \u2013 they are not affected by one another, and there are historical examples of states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being sovereign in another of these aspects. According to Immanuel Wallerstein, another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that it is a claim that must be recognized if it is to have any meaning: {There are two additional components of sovereignty that should be discussed, empirical sovereignty and juridical sovereignty. Empirical sovereignty deals with the legitimacy of who is in control of a state and the legitimacy of how they exercise their power. Tilly references an example where nobles in parts of Europe were allowed to engage in private rights and \"Ustages\", a constitution by Catalonia recognized that right which demonstrates empirical sovereignty. As David Samuel points out, this is an important aspect of a state because there has to be a designated individual or group of individuals that are acting on behalf of the people of the state. Juridical sovereignty emphasizes the importance of other states recognizing the rights of a state to exercise their control freely with little interference. For example, Jackson, Rosberg and Jones explain how the sovereignty and survival of African states were more largely influenced by legal recognition rather than material aid. Douglass North identifies that institutions want structure and these two forms of sovereignty can be a method for developing structure.\nFor a while, the United Nations highly valued juridical sovereignty and attempted to reinforce its principle often. More recently, the United Nations is shifting away and focusing on establishing empirical sovereignty. Michael Barnett notes that this is largely due to the effects of the post Cold War era because the United Nations believed that to have peaceful relations states should establish peace within their territory. As a matter of fact, theorists found that during the post Cold War era many people focused on how stronger internal structures promote inter-state peace. For instance, Zaum argues that many weak and impoverished countries that were affected by the Cold War were given assistance to develop their lacking sovereignty through this sub-concept of \"empirical statehood\".\nHistory.\nClassical.\nThe Roman jurist Ulpian observed that:\nUlpian was expressing the idea that the emperor exercised a rather absolute form of sovereignty that originated in the people, although he did not use the term expressly.\nMedieval.\nUlpian's statements were known in medieval Europe, but sovereignty was an important concept in medieval times. Medieval monarchs were \"not\" sovereign, at least not strongly so, because they were constrained by, and shared power with, their feudal aristocracy. Furthermore, both were strongly constrained by custom. Sovereignty existed during the Medieval period as the \"de jure\" rights of nobility and royalty.\nReformation.\nSovereignty reemerged as a concept in the late 16th century, a time when civil wars had created a craving for a stronger central authority when monarchs had begun to gather power onto their own hands at the expense of the nobility, and the modern nation state was emerging. Jean Bodin, partly in reaction to the chaos of the French wars of religion, presented theories of sovereignty calling for a strong central authority in the form of absolute monarchy. In his 1576 treatise \"Les Six Livres de la R\u00e9publique\" (\"Six Books of the Republic\") Bodin argued that it is inherent in the nature of the state that sovereignty must be:\nThe treatise is frequently viewed as the first European text theorizing state sovereignty.\nBodin rejected the notion of transference of sovereignty from people to the ruler (also known as \"the sovereign\"); natural law and divine law confer upon the sovereign the right to rule. And the sovereign is not above divine law or natural law. He is above (\"i.e.\" not bound by) only positive law, that is, laws made by humans. He emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law, the law of nature or reason, and the law that is common to all nations (jus gentium), as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign, who succeeds to sovereignty, and what limits the sovereign power. Thus, Bodin's sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being. The fact that the sovereign must obey divine and natural law imposes ethical constraints on him. Bodin also held that the \"lois royales\", the fundamental laws of the French monarchy which regulated matters such as succession, are natural laws and are binding on the French sovereign.\nDespite his commitment to absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a senate from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, and to use the Estates as a means of communicating with the people. Bodin believed that \"the most divine, most excellent, and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democratically\".\nAge of Enlightenment.\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, the idea of sovereignty gained both legal and moral force as the main Western description of the meaning and power of a State. In particular, the \"Social contract\" as a mechanism for establishing sovereignty was suggested and, by 1800, widely accepted, especially in the new United States and France, though also in Great Britain to a lesser extent.\nThomas Hobbes, in \"Leviathan\" (1651) put forward a conception of sovereignty similar to Bodin's, which had just achieved legal status in the \"Peace of Westphalia\", but for different reasons. He created the first modern version of the social contract (or contractarian) theory, arguing that to overcome the \"nasty, brutish and short\" quality of life without the cooperation of other human beings, people must join in a \"commonwealth\" and submit to a \"Soveraigne [\"sic\"] Power\" that can compel them to act in the common good. Hobbes was thus the first to write that relations between the people and the sovereign were based on negotiation rather than natural submission.10 His expediency argument attracted many of the early proponents of sovereignty. Hobbes strengthened the definition of sovereignty beyond either Westphalian or Bodin's, by saying that it must be:\nHobbes' hypothesis\u2014that the ruler's sovereignty is contracted to him by the people in return for his maintaining their physical safety\u2014led him to conclude that if and when the ruler fails, the people recover their ability to protect themselves by forming a new contract.\nHobbes's theories decisively shape the concept of sovereignty through the medium of social contract theories. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's (1712\u20131778) definition of popular sovereignty (with early antecedents in Francisco Su\u00e1rez's theory of the origin of power), provides that the people are the legitimate sovereign. Rousseau considered sovereignty to be inalienable; he condemned the distinction between the origin and the exercise of sovereignty, a distinction upon which constitutional monarchy or representative democracy is founded. John Locke, and Montesquieu are also key figures in the unfolding of the concept of sovereignty; their views differ with Rousseau and with Hobbes on this issue of alienability.\nThe second book of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Du Contrat Social, ou Principes du droit politique\" (1762) deals with sovereignty and its rights. Sovereignty, or the general will, is inalienable, for the will cannot be transmitted; it is indivisible since it is essentially general; it is infallible and always right, determined and limited in its power by the common interest; it acts through laws. Law is the decision of the general will regarding some object of common interest, but though the general will is always right and desires only good, its judgment is not always enlightened, and consequently does not always see wherein the common good lies; hence the necessity of the legislator. But the legislator has, of himself, no authority; he is only a guide who drafts and proposes laws, but the people alone (that is, the sovereign or general will) has authority to make and impose them.\nRousseau, in the \"Social Contract\"\nargued, \"the growth of the State giving the trustees of public authority more and means to abuse their power, the more the Government has to have force to contain the people, the more force the Sovereign should have in turn to contain the Government,\" with the understanding that the Sovereign is \"a collective being of wonder\" (Book II, Chapter I) resulting from \"the general will\" of the people, and that \"what any man, whoever he may be, orders on his own, is not a law\" (Book II, Chapter VI) \u2013 and predicated on the assumption that the people have an unbiased means by which to ascertain the general will. Thus the legal maxim, \"there is no law without a sovereign.\"\nAccording to Hendrik Spruyt, the sovereign state emerged as a response to changes in international trade (forming coalitions that wanted sovereign states) so that the sovereign state's emergence was not inevitable; \"it arose because of a particular conjuncture of social and political interests in Europe.\"\nOnce states are recognized as sovereign, they are rarely recolonized, merged, or dissolved.\nPost World War II world order.\nToday, no state is sovereign in the sense they were prior to the Second World War. Transnational governance agreements and institutions, the globalized economy, and pooled sovereignty unions such as the European union have eroded the sovereignty of traditional states. The centuries long movement which developed a global system of sovereign states came to an end when the excesses of World War II made it clear to nations that some curtailment of the rights of sovereign states was necessary if future cruelties and injustices were to be prevented. In the years immediately prior to the war, political theorist Carl Schmitt argued that sovereignty had supremacy over constitutional and international constraints arguing that states as sovereigns could not be judged and punished. After the Holocaust, the vast majority of states rejected the prior Westphalian permissiveness towards such supremacist power based sovereignty formulations and signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It was the first step towards circumscription of the powers of sovereign nations, soon followed by the Genocide Convention which legally required nations to punish genocide. Based on these and similar human rights agreements, beginning in 1990 there was a practical expression of this circumscription when the Westphalian principle of non-intervention was no longer observed for cases where the United Nations or another international organization endorsed a political or military action. Previously, actions in Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Cambodia or Liberia would have been regarded as illegitimate interference in internal affairs. In 2005, the revision of the concept of sovereignty was made explicit with the Responsibility to Protect agreement endorsed by all member states of the United Nations. If a state fails this responsibility either by perpetrating massive injustice or being incapable of protecting its citizens, then outsiders may assume that responsibility despite prior norms forbidding such interference in a nation's sovereignty.\nEuropean integration is the second form of post-world war change in the norms of sovereignty, representing a significant shift since member nations are no longer absolutely sovereign. Some theorists, such as Jacques Maritain and Bertrand de Jouvenel have attacked the legitimacy of the earlier concepts of sovereignty, with Maritain advocating that the concept be discarded entirely since it:\nEfforts to curtail absolute sovereignty have met with substantial resistance by sovereigntist movements in multiple countries who seek to \"take back control\" from such transnational governance groups and agreements, restoring the world to pre World War II norms of sovereignty.\nDefinition and types.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere exists perhaps no conception the meaning of which is more controversial than that of sovereignty. It is an indisputable fact that this conception, from the moment when it was introduced into political science until the present day, has never had a meaning which was universally agreed upon.\nLassa Oppenheim (30-03-1858 \u2013 07-10-1919), an authority on international law\nAbsoluteness.\nAn important factor of sovereignty is its degree of absoluteness. A sovereign power has absolute sovereignty when it is not restricted by a constitution, by the laws of its predecessors, or by custom, and no areas of law or policy are reserved as being outside its control. International law; policies and actions of neighboring states; cooperation and respect of the populace; means of enforcement; and resources to enact policy are factors that might limit sovereignty. For example, parents are not guaranteed the right to decide some matters in the upbringing of their children independent of societal regulation, and municipalities do not have unlimited jurisdiction in local matters, thus neither parents nor municipalities have absolute sovereignty. Theorists have diverged over the desirability of increased absoluteness.\nExclusivity.\nA key element of sovereignty in a legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction also described as the ultimate arbiter in all disputes on the territory. Specifically, the degree to which decisions made by a sovereign entity might be contradicted by another authority. Along these lines, the German sociologist Max Weber proposed that sovereignty is a community's monopoly on the legitimate use of force; and thus any group claiming the right to violence must either be brought under the yoke of the sovereign, proven illegitimate or otherwise contested and defeated for sovereignty to be genuine. International law, competing branches of government, and authorities reserved for subordinate entities (such as federated states or republics) represent legal infringements on exclusivity. Social institutions such as religious bodies, corporations, and competing political parties might represent \"de facto\" infringements on exclusivity.\n\"De jure\" and \"de facto\".\n\"De jure\", or legal, sovereignty concerns the expressed and institutionally recognised right to exercise control over a territory. \"De facto\" sovereignty means sovereignty exists in practice, irrespective of anything legally accepted as such, usually in writing. Cooperation and respect of the populace; control of resources in, or moved into, an area; means of enforcement and security; and ability to carry out various functions of state all represent measures of \"de facto\" sovereignty. When control is practiced predominantly by the military or police force it is considered \"coercive sovereignty\".\nSovereignty and independence.\nState sovereignty is sometimes viewed synonymously with independence, however, sovereignty can be transferred as a legal right whereas independence cannot. A state can achieve \"de facto\" independence long after acquiring sovereignty, such as in the case of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Additionally, independence can also be suspended when an entire region becomes subject to an occupation. For example, when Iraq was overrun by foreign forces in the Iraq War of 2003, Iraq had not been annexed by any country, so sovereignty over it had not been claimed by any foreign state (despite the facts on the ground). Alternatively, independence can be lost completely when sovereignty itself becomes the subject of dispute. The pre-World War II administrations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia maintained an exile existence (and considerable international recognition) whilst their territories were annexed by the Soviet Union and governed locally by their pro-Soviet functionaries. When in 1991 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia re-enacted independence, it was done so on the basis of continuity directly from the pre-Soviet republics.\nAnother complicated sovereignty scenario can arise when regime itself is the subject of dispute. In the case of Poland, the People's Republic of Poland which governed Poland from 1945 to 1989 is now seen to have been an illegal entity by the modern Polish administration. The post-1989 Polish state claims direct continuity from the Second Polish Republic which ended in 1939. For other reasons, however, Poland maintains its communist-era outline as opposed to its pre-World War II shape which included areas now in Belarus, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia and Ukraine but did not include some of its western regions that were then in Germany.\nAdditionally sovereignty can be achieved without independence, such as how the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic made the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic a sovereign entity within but not independent from the USSR.\nAt the opposite end of the scale, there is no dispute regarding the self-governance of certain self-proclaimed states such as the Republic of Kosovo or Somaliland (see List of states with limited recognition, but most of them are puppet states) since their governments neither answer to a bigger state nor is their governance subjected to supervision. The sovereignty (i.e. legal right to govern) however, is disputed in both cases as the first entity is claimed by Serbia and the second by Somalia.\nInternal.\nInternal sovereignty is the relationship between sovereign power and the political community. A central concern is legitimacy: by what right does a government exercise authority? Claims of legitimacy might refer to the divine right of kings, or to a social contract (i.e. popular sovereignty). Max Weber offered a first categorization of political authority and legitimacy with the categories of traditional, charismatic and legal-rational.\nWith \"sovereignty\" meaning holding supreme, independent authority over a region or state, \"internal sovereignty\" refers to the internal affairs of the state and the location of supreme power within it. A state that has internal sovereignty is one with a government that has been elected by the people and has the popular legitimacy. Internal sovereignty examines the internal affairs of a state and how it operates. It is important to have strong internal sovereignty to keeping order and peace. When you have weak internal sovereignty, organisations such as rebel groups will undermine the authority and disrupt the peace. The presence of a strong authority allows you to keep the agreement and enforce sanctions for the violation of laws. The ability for leadership to prevent these violations is a key variable in determining internal sovereignty. The lack of internal sovereignty can cause war in one of two ways: first, undermining the value of agreement by allowing costly violations; and second, requiring such large subsidies for implementation that they render war cheaper than peace. Leadership needs to be able to promise members, especially those like armies, police forces, or paramilitaries will abide by agreements. The presence of strong internal sovereignty allows a state to deter opposition groups in exchange for bargaining. While the operations and affairs within a state are relative to the level of sovereignty within that state, there is still an argument over who should hold the authority in a sovereign state.\nThis argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty. This discussion is between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty. An internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, final and independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens, groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believed sovereignty should be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch. They believed the overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single voice that could claim final authority. An example of an internal sovereign is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century; Louis XIV claimed that he was the state. Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchical rule in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public sovereignty. Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will. This means that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a central goal of the good of the people in mind. The idea of public sovereignty has often been the basis for modern democratic theory.\nModern internal sovereignty.\nWithin the modern governmental system, internal sovereignty is usually found in states that have public sovereignty and is rarely found within a state controlled by an internal sovereign. A form of government that is a little different from both is the UK parliament system. John Austin argued that sovereignty in the UK was vested neither in the Crown nor in the people but in the \"Queen-in-Parliament\". This is the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and is usually seen as the fundamental principle of the British constitution. With these principles of parliamentary sovereignty, majority control can gain access to unlimited constitutional authority, creating what has been called \"elective dictatorship\" or \"modern autocracy\". Public sovereignty in modern governments is a lot more common with examples like the US, Canada, Australia and India where the government is divided into different levels.\nExternal.\nExternal sovereignty concerns the relationship between sovereign power and other states. For example, the United Kingdom uses the following criterion when deciding under what conditions other states recognise a political entity as having sovereignty over some territory;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Sovereignty.\" A government which exercises de facto administrative control over a country and is not subordinate to any other government in that country or a foreign sovereign state.\n(\"The Arantzazu Mendi\", [1939] A.C. 256), Stroud's Judicial Dictionary\nExternal sovereignty is connected with questions of international law \u2013 such as when, if ever, is intervention by one country into another's territory permissible?\nFollowing the Thirty Years' War, a European religious conflict that embroiled much of the continent, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 established the notion of territorial sovereignty as a norm of noninterference in the affairs of other states, so-called Westphalian sovereignty, even though the treaty itself reaffirmed the multiple levels of the sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. This resulted as a natural extension of the older principle of \"cuius regio, eius religio\" (Whose realm, his religion), leaving the Roman Catholic Church with little ability to interfere with the internal affairs of many European states. It is a myth, however, that the Treaties of Westphalia created a new European order of equal sovereign states.\nIn international law, sovereignty means that a government possesses full control over affairs within a territorial or geographical area or limit. Determining whether a specific entity is sovereign is not an exact science, but often a matter of diplomatic dispute. There is usually an expectation that both \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" sovereignty rest in the same organisation at the place and time of concern. Foreign governments use varied criteria and political considerations when deciding whether or not to recognise the sovereignty of a state over a territory. Membership in the United Nations requires that \"[t]he admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be affected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.\"\nSovereignty may be recognized even when the sovereign body possesses no territory or its territory is under partial or total occupation by another power. The Holy See was in this position between the annexation in 1870 of the Papal States by Italy and the signing of the Lateran Treaties in 1929, a 59-year period during which it was recognised as sovereign by many (mostly Roman Catholic) states despite possessing no territory \u2013 a situation resolved when the Lateran Treaties granted the Holy See sovereignty over the Vatican City. Another case, \"sui generis\" is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the third sovereign entity inside Italian territory (after San Marino and the Vatican City State) and the second inside the Italian capital (since in 1869 the Palazzo di Malta and the Villa Malta receive extraterritorial rights, in this way becoming the only \"sovereign\" territorial possessions of the modern Order), which is the last existing heir to one of several once militarily significant, crusader states of sovereign military orders. In 1607 its Grand masters were also made Reichsf\u00fcrst (princes of the Holy Roman Empire) by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting them seats in the Reichstag, at the time the closest permanent equivalent to an UN-type general assembly; confirmed 1620. These sovereign rights were never deposed, only the territories were lost. Over 100 modern states maintain full diplomatic relations with the order, and the UN awarded it observer status.\nThe governments-in-exile of many European states (for instance, Norway, Netherlands or Czechoslovakia) during the Second World War were regarded as sovereign despite their territories being under foreign occupation; their governance resumed as soon as the occupation had ended. The government of Kuwait was in a similar situation \"vis-\u00e0-vis\" the Iraqi occupation of its country during 1990\u20131991. The government of Republic of China (ROC) was generally recognized as sovereign over China from 1911 to 1971 despite the 1949 victory of the Communists in the Chinese civil war and the retreat of the ROC to Taiwan. The ROC represented China at the United Nations until 1971, when the People's Republic of China obtained the UN seat.228 The ROC political status as a state became increasingly disputed; it became commonly known as Taiwan.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is commonly mistaken to be sovereign. It has been granted various degrees of special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, including Belgium, France, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and the US, and soon in Ireland. The Committee is a private organisation governed by Swiss law.\nShared and pooled.\nJust as the office of head of state can be vested jointly in several persons within a state, the sovereign jurisdiction over a single political territory can be shared jointly by two or more consenting powers, notably in the form of a condominium.\nLikewise the member states of international organizations may voluntarily bind themselves by treaty to a supranational organization, such as a continental union. In the case of the European Union member-states, this is called \"pooled sovereignty\".\nAnother example of shared and pooled sovereignty is the Acts of Union 1707 which created the unitary state now known as the United Kingdom. It was a full economic union, meaning the Scottish and English systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade were aligned. Nonetheless, Scotland and England never fully surrendered or pooled all of their governance sovereignty; they retained many of their previous national institutional features and characteristics, particularly relating to their legal, religious and educational systems. In 2012, the Scottish Government, created in 1998 through devolution in the United Kingdom, negotiated terms with the Government of the United Kingdom for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum which resulted in the people of Scotland deciding to continue the pooling of its sovereignty with the rest of the United Kingdom.\nNation-states.\nA community of people who claim the right of self-determination based on a common ethnicity, history and culture might seek to establish sovereignty over a region, thus creating a nation-state. Such nations are sometimes recognised as autonomous areas rather than as fully sovereign, independent states.\nFederations.\nIn a federal system of government, \"sovereignty\" also refers to powers which a constituent state or republic possesses independently of the national government. In a confederation, constituent entities retain the right to withdraw from the national body and the union is often more temporary than a federation.\nDifferent interpretations of state sovereignty in the United States of America, as it related to the expansion of slavery and fugitive slave laws, led to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Depending on the particular issue, sometimes both northern and southern states justified their political positions by appealing to state sovereignty. Fearing that slavery would be threatened by results of the 1860 presidential election, eleven slave states declared their independence from the federal Union and formed a new confederation. The United States government rejected the secessions as rebellion, declaring that secession from the Union by an individual state was unconstitutional, as the states were part of an indissoluble federation in Perpetual Union.\nSovereignty versus military occupation.\nIn situations related to war, or which have arisen as the result of war, most modern scholars still commonly fail to distinguish between holding sovereignty and exercising military occupation.\nIn regard to military occupation, international law prescribes the limits of the occupant's power. Occupation does not displace the sovereignty of the occupied state, though for the time being the occupant may exercise supreme governing authority. Nor does occupation effect any annexation or incorporation of the occupied territory into the territory or political structure of the occupant, and the occupant's constitution and laws do not extend of their own force to the occupied territory.\nTo a large extent, the original academic foundation for the concept of \"military occupation\" arose from On the Law of War and Peace (1625) by Hugo Grotius and The Law of Nations (1758) by Emmerich de Vattel. Binding international rules regarding the conduct of military occupation were more carefully codified in the 1907 Hague Convention (and accompanying Hague Regulations).\nIn 1946, the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal stated with regard to the Hague Convention on Land Warfare of 1907: \"The rules of land warfare expressed in the Convention undoubtedly represented an advance over existing International Law at the time of their adoption ... but by 1939 these rules ... were recognized by all civilized nations and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war.\"\nAcquisition.\nA number of modes for acquisition of sovereignty are presently or have historically been recognized in international law as lawful methods by which a state may acquire sovereignty over external territory. The classification of these modes originally derived from Roman property law and from the 15th and 16th century with the development of international law. The modes are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0full national jurisdiction and sovereignty\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0restrictions on national jurisdiction and sovereignty\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0international jurisdiction per common heritage of mankind\nJustifications.\nThere exist vastly differing views on the moral basis of sovereignty. A fundamental polarity is between theories which assert that sovereignty is vested directly in the sovereigns by divine or natural right, and theories which assert it originates from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those which assert that the people effectively transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes), and those which assert that the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).\nDuring the brief period of absolute monarchies in Europe, the divine right of kings was an important competing justification for the exercise of sovereignty. The Mandate of Heaven had similar implications in China for the justification of the Emperor's rule, though it was largely replaced with discussions of Western-style sovereignty by the late 19th century.\nA republic is a form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them, retain sovereignty over the government and where offices of state are not granted through heritage. A common modern definition of a republic is a government having a head of state who is not a monarch.\nDemocracy is based on the concept of \"popular sovereignty\". In a direct democracy the public plays an active role in shaping and deciding policy. Representative democracy permits a transfer of the exercise of sovereignty from the people to a legislative body or an executive (or to some combination of the legislature, executive and Judiciary). Many representative democracies provide limited direct democracy through referendum, initiative, and recall.\nParliamentary sovereignty refers to a representative democracy where the parliament is ultimately sovereign, rather than the executive power or the judiciary.\nViews.\nAccording to Matteo Laruffa \"sovereignty resides in every public action and policy as the exercise of executive powers by institutions open to the participation of citizens to the decision-making processes\"\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28800", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28800", "title": "Democratic Left Alliance (Poland)", "text": "Polish centre-left political party\nThe Democratic Left Alliance () was a social-democratic political party in Poland. It was formed on 9 July 1991 as an electoral alliance of centre-left parties, and became a single party on 15 April 1999. It was the major coalition party in Poland between 1993 and 1997, and between 2001 and 2005, with four Prime ministers coming from the party: J\u00f3zef Oleksy, W\u0142odzimierz Cimoszewicz, Leszek Miller and Marek Belka. It then faded into opposition, overshadowed by the rise of Civic Platform and Law and Justice.\nIn February 2020, the party initiated a process to merge with the Spring party, choosing the name New Left (), and changing to a more modern logo.\nThe party was a member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance.\nHistory.\nIdeology and support patterns.\nThe party can be classified as centre-left. However, during the 1990s, it managed to attract voters from the pro-market and even right-wing camp. The main support for SLD came from middle-rank state sector employees, retired people, former communist Polish United Workers Party (PZPR) and All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ) members and those who were unlikely to be frequent church-goers. The core of the coalition (Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland) rejected concepts such as lustration and de-communization, supported a parliamentarian regime with only the role of an arbiter for the president and criticized the right-wing camp for the introduction of religious education into school. The ex-communists criticized the economic reforms, pointing to the high social costs, without negating the reforms per se.\nCoalition.\nSdRP, SDU and some other socialist and social-democratic parties had formed the original Democratic Left Alliance as a centre-left coalition just prior to the nation's first free elections in 1991. In 1999 the coalition became a party but lost some members.\nAt the time, the coalition's membership drew mostly from the former PZPR. An alliance between the SLD and the Polish People's Party (PSL) ruled Poland in the years 1993\u20131997. However, the coalition lost power to the right-wing Solidarity Electoral Action in the 1997 election as the right-wing opposition was united this time and because of the decline of support for SLD's coalition partner PSL, though the SLD itself actually gained votes.\nElectoral victory.\nSLD formed a coalition with Labour Union before the 2001 Polish election and won it overwhelmingly at last by capturing about 5.3 million votes, 42% of the whole and won 200 of 460 seats in the Sejm and 75 of 100 in the Senate. After the elections, the coalition was joined by the Polish People's Party (PSL) in forming a government and Leszek Miller became the Prime Minister. In March 2003, the PSL left the coalition.\nRywin affair.\nBy 2004, the support for SLD in the polls had dropped from about 30% to just below 10%, and several high-ranking party members had been accused of taking part in high-profile political scandals by the mainstream press, including the Rywin affair, in which film producer Lew Rywin, claiming to be acting on behalf of the government, sought a bribe from the editor of the \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" newspaper in return for favourable amendments to a proposed new law on media ownership. Prime Minister Leszek Miller was obliged under Polish law to report the attempted bribery to the police when it was brought to his attention, but did not do so.\nOn 6 March 2004, Miller resigned as party leader and was replaced by Krzysztof Janik. On 26 March, the Sejm speaker Marek Borowski, together with other high-ranking SLD officials, announced the creation of a new centre-left party, the Social Democratic Party of Poland. On the next day, Leszek Miller announced he would step down as Prime Minister on 2 May 2004, the day after Poland joined the European Union. Miller proceeded to do so.\nDecline after Rywin-gate.\nIn the 2004 European Parliament election, it only received 9% of the votes, giving it 5 of 54 seats reserved for Poland in the European Parliament, as part of the Party of European Socialists.\nWojciech Olejniczak, the former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, was elected the president of SLD on 29 May 2004, succeeded J\u00f3zef Oleksy, who resigned from the post of Polish Prime Minister due to false accusations of links to the KGB.\nOpposition and decline: 2005 and after.\nThe 2004 European elections foreshadowed the SLD's huge defeat in the 2005 parliamentary election, in which it won only 11.3% of the vote. This gave the party 55 seats, barely a quarter of what it had had prior to the election. It also lost all of its senators. In late 2006, a centre-left political alliance called Left and Democrats was created, comprising SLD and smaller centre-left parties, the Labour Union, the Social Democratic Party of Poland, and the liberal Democratic Party \u2013 demokraci.pl. The coalition won a disappointing 13% in the 2007 parliamentary election and was dissolved soon after in April 2008. On 31 May 2008, Olejniczak was replaced by Grzegorz Napieralski as an SLD leader.\nIn the 2009 European election, the Democratic Left Alliance-Labor Union joint ticket received 12% of the vote and seven MEPs were elected as part of the newly retitled Socialists &amp; Democrats group.\nIn the 2011 parliamentary election, SLD received 8.24% of the vote which gave it 27 seats in the Sejm. After the elections, one of the party members, S\u0142awomir Kopyci\u0144ski, decided to leave SLD and join Palikot's Movement. On 10 December 2011, Leszek Miller was chosen to return as the party leader.\nIn the 2014 European elections, on 25 May 2014, the SLD received 9.4% of the national vote and returned four MEPs.\nIn July 2015, the SLD formed the United Left electoral alliance along with Your Movement (TR), Labour United (UP) and The Greens (PZ) and minor parties to contest the upcoming election.\nIn the 2015 parliamentary election held on 25 October 2015, the United Left list received 7.6% of the vote, below the 8% threshold (electoral alliances must win at least 8% of the vote, as opposed to the 5% for individual parties), leaving the SLD without parliamentary representation for the first time. Indeed, for the first time since the end of Communism, no centre-left parties won any seats in this election.\nIn 2017, the party withdrew from the Socialist International, while maintaining ties with the Progressive Alliance.\nFor the 2019 parliamentary election, SLD formed an alliance with Razem and Wiosna, known as The Left. In the 2019 parliamentary election, the alliance won 12.6% of the vote and 49 seats in the Sejm, with the SLD winning 24. Later, it was announced that the Democratic Left Alliance would form with the Spring new political party called the New Left. The creation was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVoter base.\nThe SLD is usually seen as the face of the standard Polish left, having achieved notable electoral success during the 90s and benefitting from a strongly organized network of local offices, which span 320 of Poland's 380 administrative counties. For this reason, it was often viewed as the go-to party for left-leaning Poles for the majority of Poland's modern history. The party's monopoly on mainstream left-wing economic ideas in Poland however ended, after the right-wing Law and Justice party adopted many economically interventionist positions, which led a considerable portion of economically left-wing Poles to vote for Law and Justice instead.\nBesides self-described left-wingers, the party enjoys the support of many members of the country's police and military, but its largest voting bloc resides among former PZPR members, government officials and civil servants during the PPR period, which are seen as the party's core supporters. The loyal support of this voting bloc enabled the SLD to remain the largest party of the Polish left, even throughout the scandals that rocked the party in the early 2000s.\nHowever, this electoral bloc was seen as unreliable by political observers, as despite the fact that it originally constituted a huge voting bloc, that segment of the population would inevitably shrink as its members steadily age. Following the passage of a \"degradation law\" by the ruling right-wing PiS party, which cut pensions and disability benefits to thousands of former bureaucrats, however, the party has undergone a revival, as more and more people's primary income came to be threatened by the new government policy. This led many of those affected to support the SLD, thus enlarging and mobilizing the formerly shrinking voting bloc.\nThe SLD nonetheless made a significant effort to broaden its political appeal by joining forces with two smaller left-wing parties in 2019, creating The Left political alliance, which poses itself as a 'modern' take on leftism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28803", "revid": "50922246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28803", "title": "Segmentation fault", "text": "Computer fault caused by access to restricted memory\nIn computing, a segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or access violation is a failure condition raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system (OS) that the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation). On standard x86 computers, this is a form of general protection fault. The operating system kernel will, in response, usually perform some corrective action, generally passing the fault on to the offending process by sending the process a signal. Processes can in some cases install a custom signal handler, allowing them to recover on their own, but otherwise the OS default signal handler is used, generally causing abnormal termination of the process (a program crash), and sometimes a core dump.\nSegmentation faults are a common class of error in programs written in languages like C that provide low-level memory access and few to no safety checks. They arise primarily due to errors in use of pointers for virtual memory addressing, particularly illegal access. Another type of memory access error is a bus error, which also has various causes, but is today much rarer; these occur primarily due to incorrect \"physical\" memory addressing, or due to misaligned memory access \u2013 these are memory references that the hardware \"cannot\" address, rather than references that a process is not \"allowed\" to address.\nMany programming languages have mechanisms designed to avoid segmentation faults and improve memory safety. For example, Rust employs an ownership-based model to ensure memory safety. Other languages, such as Lisp and Java, employ garbage collection, which avoids certain classes of memory errors that could lead to segmentation faults.\nOverview.\nA segmentation fault occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access, or attempts to access a memory location in a way that is not allowed (for example, attempting to write to a read-only location, or to overwrite part of the operating system).\nThe term \"segmentation\" has various uses in computing; in the context of \"segmentation fault\", it refers to the address space of a \"program.\" With memory protection, only the program's own address space is readable, and of this, only the stack and the read/write portion of the data segment of a program are writable, while read-only data allocated in the const segment and the code segment are not writable. Thus attempting to read outside of the program's address space, or writing to a read-only segment of the address space, results in a segmentation fault, hence the name.\nOn systems using hardware memory segmentation to provide virtual memory, a segmentation fault occurs when the hardware detects an attempt to refer to a non-existent segment, or to refer to a location outside the bounds of a segment, or to refer to a location in a fashion not allowed by the permissions granted for that segment. On systems using only paging, an invalid page fault generally leads to a segmentation fault, and segmentation faults and page faults are both faults raised by the virtual memory management system. Segmentation faults can also occur independently of page faults: illegal access to a valid page is a segmentation fault, but not an invalid page fault, and segmentation faults can occur in the middle of a page (hence no page fault), for example in a buffer overflow that stays within a page but illegally overwrites memory.\nAt the hardware level, the fault is initially raised by the memory management unit (MMU) on illegal access (if the referenced memory exists), as part of its memory protection feature, or an invalid page fault (if the referenced memory does not exist). If the problem is not an invalid logical address but instead an invalid physical address, a bus error is raised instead, though these are not always distinguished.\nAt the operating system level, this fault is caught and a signal is passed on to the offending process, activating the process's handler for that signal. Different operating systems have different signal names to indicate that a segmentation fault has occurred. On Unix-like operating systems, a signal called codice_1 (abbreviated from \"segmentation violation\") is sent to the offending process. On Microsoft Windows, the offending process receives a codice_2 exception.\nCauses.\nThe conditions under which segmentation violations occur and how they manifest themselves are specific to hardware and the operating system: different hardware raises different faults for given conditions, and different operating systems convert these to different signals that are passed on to processes. The proximate cause is a memory access violation, while the underlying cause is generally a software bug of some sort. Determining the root cause \u2013 debugging the bug \u2013 can be simple in some cases, where the program will consistently cause a segmentation fault (e.g., dereferencing a null pointer), while in other cases the bug can be difficult to reproduce and depend on memory allocation on each run (e.g., dereferencing a dangling pointer).\nThe following are some typical causes of a segmentation fault:\nThese in turn are often caused by programming errors that result in invalid memory access:\nIn C code, segmentation faults most often occur because of errors in pointer use, particularly in C dynamic memory allocation. Dereferencing a null pointer, which results in undefined behavior, will usually cause a segmentation fault. This is because a null pointer cannot be a valid memory address. On the other hand, wild pointers and dangling pointers point to memory that may or may not exist, and may or may not be readable or writable, and thus can result in transient bugs. For example:\nchar* p1 = NULL; // Null pointer\nchar* p2; // Wild pointer: not initialized at all.\nchar* p3 = (char*)malloc(10 * sizeof(char)); // Initialized pointer to allocated memory (assuming malloc did not fail)\nfree(p3); // p3 is now a dangling pointer, as memory has been freed\nDereferencing any of these variables could cause a segmentation fault: dereferencing the null pointer generally will cause a segfault, while reading from the wild pointer may instead result in random data but no segfault, and reading from the dangling pointer may result in valid data for a while, and then random data as it is overwritten.\nHandling.\nThe default action for a segmentation fault or bus error is abnormal termination of the process that triggered it. A core file may be generated to aid debugging, and other platform-dependent actions may also be performed. For example, Linux systems using the grsecurity patch may log SIGSEGV signals in order to monitor for possible intrusion attempts using buffer overflows.\nOn some systems, like Linux and Windows, it is possible for the program itself to handle a segmentation fault. Depending on the architecture and operating system, the running program can not only handle the event but may extract some information about its state like getting a stack trace, processor register values, the line of the source code when it was triggered, memory address that was invalidly accessed and whether the action was a read or a write.\nAlthough a segmentation fault generally means that the program has a bug that needs fixing, it is also possible to intentionally cause such failure for the purposes of testing, debugging and also to emulate platforms where direct access to memory is needed. On the latter case, the system must be able to allow the program to run even after the fault occurs. In this case, when the system allows, it is possible to handle the event and increment the processor program counter to \"jump\" over the failing instruction to continue the execution.\nExamples.\nWriting to read-only memory.\nWriting to read-only memory raises a segmentation fault. At the level of code errors, this occurs when the program writes to part of its own code segment or the read-only portion of the data segment, as these are loaded by the OS into read-only memory.\nHere is an example of ANSI C code that will generally cause a segmentation fault on platforms with memory protection. It attempts to modify a string literal, which is undefined behavior according to the ANSI C standard. Most compilers will not catch this at compile time, and instead compile this to executable code that will crash:\nint main(void) {\n char* s = \"hello world\";\n *s = 'H';\nWhen the program containing this code is compiled, the string \"hello world\" is placed in the rodata section of the program executable file: the read-only section of the data segment. When loaded, the operating system places it with other strings and constant data in a read-only segment of memory. When executed, a variable, codice_3, is set to point to the string's location, and an attempt is made to write an H character through the variable into the memory, causing a segmentation fault. Compiling such a program with a compiler that does not check for the assignment of read-only locations at compile time, and running it on a Unix-like operating system produces the following runtime error:\n$ gcc segfault.c -g -o segfault\n$ ./segfault\nSegmentation fault\nBacktrace of the core file from GDB:\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x1c0005c2 in main () at segfault.c:6\n6 *s = 'H';\nThis code can be corrected by using an array instead of a character pointer, as this allocates memory on stack and initializes it to the value of the string literal:\nchar s[] = \"hello world\";\ns[0] = 'H'; // equivalently, *s = 'H';\nEven though string literals should not be modified (this has undefined behavior in the C standard), in C they are of codice_4 type, so there is no implicit conversion in the original code (which points a codice_5 at that array), while in C++ they are of codice_6 type, and thus there is an implicit conversion, so compilers will generally catch this particular error.\nNull pointer dereference.\nIn C and C-like languages, null pointers are used to mean \"pointer to no object\" and as an error indicator, and dereferencing a null pointer (a read or write through a null pointer) is a very common program error. The C standard does not say that the null pointer is the same as the pointer to memory address\u00a00, though that may be the case in practice. Most operating systems map the null pointer's address such that accessing it causes a segmentation fault. This behavior is not guaranteed by the C standard. Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior in C, and a conforming implementation is allowed to assume that any pointer that is dereferenced is not null.\nint* ptr = NULL;\nprintf(\"%d\", *ptr);\nThis sample code creates a null pointer, and then tries to access its value (read the value). Doing so causes a segmentation fault at runtime on many operating systems.\nDereferencing a null pointer and then assigning to it (writing a value to a non-existent target) also usually causes a segmentation fault:\nint* ptr = NULL;\nThe following code includes a null pointer dereference, but when compiled will often not result in a segmentation fault, as the value is unused and thus the dereference will often be optimized away by dead code elimination:\nint* ptr = NULL;\nBuffer overflow.\nThe following code accesses the character array codice_3 beyond its upper boundary. Depending on the compiler and the processor, this may result in a segmentation fault.\nchar s[] = \"hello world\";\nchar c = s[20];\nStack overflow.\nAnother example is recursion without a base case:\nint main(void) {\n return main();\nwhich causes the stack to overflow which results in a segmentation fault. Infinite recursion may not necessarily result in a stack overflow depending on the language, optimizations performed by the compiler and the exact structure of a code. In this case, the behavior of unreachable code (the return statement) is undefined, so the compiler can eliminate it and use a tail call optimization that might result in no stack usage. Other optimizations could include translating the recursion into iteration, which given the structure of the example function would result in the program running forever, while probably not overflowing its stack.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is most commonly applied in digital signal processing and involves the analysis of mixtures of signals; the objective is to recover the original component signals from a mixture signal. The classical example of a source separation problem is the cocktail party problem, where a number of people are talking simultaneously in a room (for example, at a cocktail party), and a listener is trying to follow one of the discussions. The human brain can handle this sort of auditory source separation problem, but it is a difficult problem in digital signal processing.\nThis problem is in general highly underdetermined, but useful solutions can be derived under a surprising variety of conditions. Much of the early literature in this field focuses on the separation of temporal signals such as audio. However, blind signal separation is now routinely performed on multidimensional data, such as images and tensors, which may involve no time dimension whatsoever. \nSeveral approaches have been proposed for the solution of this problem but development is currently still very much in progress. Some of the more successful approaches are principal components analysis and independent component analysis, which work well when there are no delays or echoes present; that is, the problem is simplified a great deal. The field of computational auditory scene analysis attempts to achieve auditory source separation using an approach that is based on human hearing.\nThe human brain must also solve this problem in real time. In human perception this ability is commonly referred to as auditory scene analysis or the cocktail party effect.\nApplications.\nCocktail party problem.\nAt a cocktail party, there is a group of people talking at the same time. You have multiple microphones picking up mixed signals, but you want to isolate the speech of a single person. BSS can be used to separate the individual sources by using mixed signals. In the presence of noise, dedicated optimization criteria need to be used.\nImage processing.\nFigure 2 shows the basic concept of BSS. The individual source signals are shown as well as the mixed signals which are received signals. BSS is used to separate the mixed signals with only knowing mixed signals and nothing about original signal or how they were mixed. The separated signals are only approximations of the source signals. The separated images, were separated using Python and the Shogun toolbox using Joint Approximation Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (JADE) algorithm which is based on independent component analysis, ICA. This toolbox method can be used with multi-dimensions but for an easy visual aspect images(2-D) were used.\nMedical imaging.\nOne of the practical applications being researched in this area is medical imaging of the brain with magnetoencephalography (MEG). This kind of imaging involves careful measurements of magnetic fields outside the head which yield an accurate 3D-picture of the interior of the head. However, external sources of electromagnetic fields, such as a wristwatch on the subject's arm, will significantly degrade the accuracy of the measurement. Applying source separation techniques on the measured signals can help remove undesired artifacts from the signal.\nEEG.\nIn electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), the interference from muscle activity masks the desired signal from brain activity. BSS, however, can be used to separate the two so an accurate representation of brain activity may be achieved.\nMusic.\nAnother application is the separation of musical signals. For a stereo mix of relatively simple signals it is now possible to make a fairly accurate separation, although some artifacts remain.\nOthers.\nOther applications:\nMathematical representation.\nThe set of individual source signals, formula_1, is 'mixed' using a matrix, formula_2, to produce a set of 'mixed' signals, formula_3, as follows. Usually, formula_4 is equal to formula_5. If formula_6, then the system of equations is overdetermined and thus can be unmixed using a conventional linear method. If formula_7, the system is underdetermined and a non-linear method must be employed to recover the unmixed signals. The signals themselves can be multidimensional.\nformula_8\nThe above equation is effectively 'inverted' as follows. Blind source separation separates the set of mixed signals, formula_9, through the determination of an 'unmixing' matrix, formula_10, to 'recover' an approximation of the original signals, formula_11.\nformula_12\nApproaches.\nSince the chief difficulty of the problem is its underdetermination, methods for blind source separation generally seek to narrow the set of possible solutions in a way that is unlikely to exclude the desired solution. In one approach, exemplified by principal and independent component analysis, one seeks source signals that are minimally correlated or maximally independent in a probabilistic or information-theoretic sense. A second approach, exemplified by nonnegative matrix factorization, is to impose structural constraints on the source signals. These structural constraints may be derived from a generative model of the signal, but are more commonly heuristics justified by good empirical performance. A common theme in the second approach is to impose some kind of low-complexity constraint on the signal, such as sparsity in some basis for the signal space. This approach can be particularly effective if one requires not the whole signal, but merely its most salient features.\nMethods.\nThere are different methods of blind signal separation:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the students of Alonzo Church, Kleene, along with R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of mathematical logic known as recursion theory, which subsequently helped to provide the foundations of theoretical computer science. Kleene's work grounds the study of computable functions. A number of mathematical concepts are named after him: Kleene hierarchy, Kleene algebra, the Kleene star (Kleene closure), Kleene's recursion theorem and the Kleene fixed-point theorem. He also invented regular expressions in 1951 to describe McCulloch-Pitts neural networks, and made significant contributions to the foundations of mathematical intuitionism.\nBiography.\nKleene was born to Alice Lena Cole, a published poet, and Gustav Adolph Kleene, a professor of economics at Trinity College, in Hartford, Connecticut. Gustav's parents were immigrants from Germany.\nKleene was awarded a bachelor's degree from Amherst College in 1930. He was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1934, where his thesis, entitled \"A Theory of Positive Integers in Formal Logic\", was supervised by Alonzo Church. In the 1930s, he did important work on Church's lambda calculus. In 1935, he joined the mathematics department at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where he spent nearly all of his career. After two years as an instructor, he was appointed assistant professor in 1937. In the 1930s, Kleene laid the foundation for recursion theory, an area that would be his lifelong research interest.\nHe was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1939\u20131940. In 1941, he returned to Amherst College, where he spent one year as an associate professor of mathematics. In 1942, he married Nancy Elliott. In the same year he enlisted in the United States Navy Reserve as a lieutenant, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander by his discharge in 1946.\nIn 1946, Kleene returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, becoming a full professor in 1948 and the Cyrus C. MacDuffee professor of mathematics in 1964. He served two terms as the Chair of the Department of Mathematics and one term as the Chair of the Department of Numerical Analysis (later renamed the Department of Computer Science). He also served as Dean of the College of Letters and Science in 1969\u20131974. During his years at the University of Wisconsin he was thesis advisor to 13 Ph.D. students. He retired from the University of Wisconsin in 1979. In 1999 the mathematics library at the University of Wisconsin was renamed in his honor.\nKleene's teaching at Wisconsin resulted in three texts in mathematical logic, Kleene (1952), (1967), and Kleene and Vesley (1965). The first two are often cited and still in print. Kleene (1952) wrote alternative proofs to the G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems that enhanced their canonical status and made them easier to teach and understand. Kleene and Vesley (1965) is the classic American introduction to intuitionistic logic and mathematical intuitionism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] recursive function theory is of central importance in computer science. Kleene is responsible for many of the fundamental results in the area, including the Kleene normal form theorem (1936), the Kleene recursive theorem (1938), the development of the arithmetical and hyper-arithmetical hierarchies in the 1940s and 1950s, the Kleene-Post theory of degrees of unsolvability (1954), and higher-type recursion theory. which he began in the late 1950s and returned to in the late 1970s. [...] Beginning in the late 1940s, Kleene also worked in a second area, Brouwer's intuitionism. Using tools from recursion theory, he introduced recursive realizability, an important technique for interpreting intuitionistic statements. In the summer of 1951 at the Rand Corporation, he produced a major breakthrough in a third area when he gave an important characterization of events accepted by a finite automaton\u2014\u200a\nKleene served as president of the Association for Symbolic Logic, 1956\u20131958, and of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science, 1961. The importance of Kleene's work led to Daniel Dennett coining the saying, published in 1978, that \"Kleeneness is next to G\u00f6delness.\" In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.\nKleene and his wife Nancy Elliott had four children. He had a lifelong devotion to the family farm in Maine. An avid mountain climber, he had a strong interest in nature and the environment, and was active in many conservation causes.\nLegacy.\nAt each conference of the Symposium on Logic in Computer Science the Kleene Award, in honour of Stephen Cole Kleene, is given for the best student paper.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On this day, religious Jews remember the biblical stories describing the creation of the heaven and earth in six days and the redemption from slavery and the Exodus from Egypt. Since the Jewish religious calendar counts days from sunset to sunset, Shabbat begins in the evening of what on the civil calendar is Friday.\nShabbat observance entails refraining from work activities, often with great rigor, and engaging in restful activities to honor the day. Judaism's traditional position is that the unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution. Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the Abrahamic and many other religions.\nAccording to \"halakha\" (Jewish religious law), Shabbat is observed from a few minutes before the sun sets on Friday evening until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night, or an hour after sundown. Shabbat is ushered in by lighting candles and reciting blessings over wine and bread. Traditionally, three festive meals are eaten: The first one is held on Friday evening, the second is traditionally a lunch meal on Saturday, and the third is held later Saturday afternoon. The evening meal and the early afternoon meal typically begin with a blessing called \"kiddush\" (\"sanctification\"), said over a cup of wine.\nAt the third meal a \"kiddush\" is not performed, but the \"hamotzi\" blessing is recited and \"challah\" (braided bread) is eaten. In many communities, this meal is often eaten in the period after the afternoon prayers \"(Minchah\") are recited and shortly before Shabbat is formally ended with a \"Havdalah\" ritual.\nShabbat is a festive day when Jews exercise their freedom from the regular labours of everyday life. It offers an opportunity to contemplate the spiritual aspects of life and to spend time with family. The end of Shabbat is traditionally marked by a ritual called Havdalah, during which blessings are said over wine (or grape juice), aromatic spices, and Havdalah candle lighting, separating Shabbat from the rest of the week.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Shabbat\" derives from the Hebrew root \u05e9\u05be\u05d1\u05be\u05ea. Although frequently translated as \"rest\" (noun or verb), another accurate translation is \"ceasing [from work].\" The notion of active cessation from labour is also regarded as more consistent with an omnipotent God's activity on the seventh day of creation according to Genesis.\nOrigins.\nBabylon.\nA number of scholars propose a cognate Akkadian word \"\u0161apattu\" or \"\u0161abattu\", which refers to the day of the full moon. A lexicographic list found in the library of Ashurbanipal glosses \"\u0161abattu\" as \"[the gods'] day of the heart's rest\" (\"\u016bm n\u00fb\u1e2b libbi\"), although this probably refers to the appeasement of the gods' anger. Other scholars doubt that there is a connection between the biblical Sabbath and the Akkadian \"\u0161apattu\"/\"\u0161abattu\", as the two words may not have a common etymology and \"\u0161apattu\" refers almost exclusively to the fifteenth day of the month or the phenomenon of lunar alignment, not to the seventh day of a week.\nConnection to Sabbath observance has been suggested in the designation of the seventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eight days of a lunar month in an Assyrian religious calendar as a 'holy day', also called 'evil days' (meaning \"unsuitable\" for prohibited activities). The prohibitions on these days, spaced seven days apart (except the nineteenth), include abstaining from chariot riding, and the avoidance of eating meat by the King. On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to \"make a wish\", and at least the 28th was known as a \"rest-day\". This theory has also been challenged on the grounds that the 'evil days' did not always fall every seven days and did not entail a general cessation of work.\nThe \"Universal Jewish Encyclopedia\" advanced a theory of Assyriologists like Friedrich Delitzsch (and of Marcello Craveri) that Shabbat originally arose from the lunar cycle in the Babylonian calendar containing four weeks ending in a Sabbath, plus one or two additional unreckoned days per month. The difficulties of this theory include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week, and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as Sabbath in any language.\nEgypt.\nSeventh-day Shabbat did not originate with the Egyptians, to whom it was unknown; and other origin theories based on the day of Saturn, or on the planets generally, have also been abandoned.\nHebrew Bible.\nSabbath is given special status as a holy day at the very beginning of the Torah in Genesis 2:1-3. It is first commanded after the Exodus from Egypt, in Exodus 16:26 (relating to the cessation of manna) and in Exodus 16:29 (relating to the distance one may travel by foot on the Sabbath). It is also commanded in Exodus 20:8-11 (as one of the Ten Commandments). Sabbath is commanded and commended many more times in the Torah and Tanakh; double the normal number of animal sacrifices are to be offered on the day. Sabbath is also described by the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Amos, and Nehemiah in the bible.\nThe longstanding Jewish position is that the continuous observance of the seventh day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution. The origins of Shabbat and a seven-day week are not clear to scholars; the Mosaic tradition claims an origin from the Genesis creation narrative.\nThe first non-Biblical reference to Sabbath is in an ostracon found in excavations at Mesad Hashavyahu, which has been dated to approximately 630 BCE.\nStatus as a Jewish holy day.\nThe Tanakh and siddur describe Shabbat as having three purposes:\nJudaism accords Shabbat the status of a joyous holy day. In many ways, Jewish law gives Shabbat the status of being the most important holy day in the Hebrew calendar:\nRituals.\nWelcoming Shabbat.\nHonoring Shabbat (\"kavod Shabbat\") on Preparation Day (Friday) includes bathing, having a haircut and cleaning and beautifying the home (with flowers, for example).\nDays in the Jewish calendar start at nightfall, therefore many Jewish holidays begin at such time. According to Jewish law, Shabbat starts a few minutes before sunset. Candles are lit at this time. It is customary in many communities to light the candles 18 minutes before sundown (\"tosefet Shabbat\", although sometimes 36 minutes), and most printed Jewish calendars adhere to this custom.\nThe Kabbalat Shabbat service is a prayer service welcoming the arrival of Shabbat. Before Friday night dinner, it is customary to sing two songs, one \"greeting\" two Shabbat angels into the house (\"Shalom Aleichem\" -\"Peace Be Upon You\") and the other praising the woman of the house for all the work she has done over the past week ( -\"Woman Of Valour\"). After blessings over the wine and challah, a festive meal is served. Singing is traditional at Sabbath meals. In modern times, many composers have written sacred music for use during the Kabbalat Shabbat observance, including Robert Strassburg and Samuel Adler.\nAccording to rabbinic literature, God via the Torah commands Jews to \"observe\" (refrain from forbidden activity) and \"remember\" (with words, thoughts, and actions) Shabbat, and these two actions are symbolized by the customary two Shabbat candles. Candles are lit usually by the woman of the house (or else by a man who lives alone). Some families light more candles, sometimes in accordance with the number of children.\nOther rituals.\nShabbat is a day of celebration as well as prayer. It is customary to eat three festive meals: Dinner on Shabbat eve (Friday night), lunch on Shabbat day (Saturday), and a third meal (a \"Seudah shlishit\") in the late afternoon (Saturday). It is also customary to wear nice clothing (different from during the week) on Shabbat to honor the day.\nMany Jews attend synagogue services on Shabbat even if they do not do so during the week. Services are held on Shabbat eve (Friday night), Shabbat morning (Saturday morning), and late Shabbat afternoon (Saturday afternoon).\nWith the exception of Yom Kippur, days of public fasting are postponed or advanced if they coincide with Shabbat. Mourners sitting \"shivah\" (week of mourning subsequent to the death of a spouse or first-degree relative) outwardly conduct themselves normally for the duration of the day and are forbidden to display public signs of mourning.\nAlthough most Shabbat laws are restrictive, the fourth of the Ten Commandments in Exodus is taken by the Talmud and Maimonides to allude to the \"positive\" commandments of Shabbat. These include:\nEnding Shabbat.\n\"Havdalah\" (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4, \"separation\") is a Jewish religious ceremony that marks the symbolic end of Shabbat, and ushers in the new week. At the conclusion of Shabbat at nightfall, after the appearance of three stars in the sky, the \"havdalah\" blessings are recited over a cup of wine, and with the use of fragrant spices and a candle, usually braided. Some communities delay \"havdalah\" later into the night in order to prolong Shabbat. There are different customs regarding how much time one should wait after the stars have surfaced until the sabbath technically ends. Some people hold by 72 minutes later and other hold longer and shorter than that.\nProhibited activities.\nJewish law (halakha) prohibits doing any form of \"melakhah\" (\u05de\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05d0\u05db\u05b8\u05d4, plural \"melakhoth\") on Shabbat, unless an urgent human or medical need is life-threatening. Though \"melakhah\" is commonly translated as \"work\" in English, a better definition is \"deliberate activity\" or \"skill and craftmanship\". There are 39 categories of \"melakhah\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe 39 \"melakhoth\" are not so much activities as \"categories of activity\". For example, while \"winnowing\" usually refers exclusively to the separation of chaff from grain, and \"selecting\" refers exclusively to the separation of debris from grain, they refer in the Talmudic sense to any separation of intermixed materials which renders edible that which was inedible. Thus, filtering undrinkable water to make it drinkable falls under this category, as does picking small bones from fish (gefilte fish is one solution to this problem).\nThe categories of labors prohibited on Shabbat are exegetically derived\u00a0\u2013 on account of Biblical passages juxtaposing Shabbat observance () to making the Tabernacle ()\u00a0\u2013 that they are the kinds of work that were necessary for the construction of the Tabernacle. They are not explicitly listed in the Torah; the Mishnah observes that \"the laws of Shabbat ... are like mountains hanging by a hair, for they are little Scripture but many laws\". Many rabbinic scholars have pointed out that these labors have in common activity that is \"creative\", or that exercises control or dominion over one's environment.\nIn addition to the 39 \"melakhot\", additional activities were prohibited by the rabbis for various reasons.\nThe term \"shomer Shabbat\" is used for a person (or organization) who adheres to Shabbat laws consistently. The (strict) observance of the Sabbath is often seen as a benchmark for orthodoxy and indeed has legal bearing on the way a Jew is seen by an orthodox religious court regarding their affiliation to Judaism.\nSpecific applications.\nElectricity.\nOrthodox and some Conservative authorities rule that turning electric devices on or off is prohibited as a \"melakhah\"; however, authorities are not in agreement about exactly which one(s). One view is that tiny sparks are created in a switch when the circuit is closed, and this would constitute lighting a fire (category 37). If the appliance is purposed for light or heat (such as an incandescent bulb or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may be considered as a type of fire that falls under both lighting a fire (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11). Turning lights off would be extinguishing a fire (category 36). Another view is that completing an electrical circuit constitutes building (category 35) and turning off the circuit would be demolishing (category 34). Some schools of thought consider the use of electricity to be forbidden only by rabbinic injunction, rather than a \"melakhah\".\nA common solution to the problem of electricity involves preset timers (Shabbat clocks) for electric appliances, to turn them on and off automatically, with no human intervention on Shabbat itself. Some Conservative authorities reject altogether the arguments for prohibiting the use of electricity. Some Orthodox also hire a \"Shabbos goy\", a non-Jew (who must not be regularly employed by the household in question) to perform prohibited tasks (like operating light switches) on Shabbat.\nAutomobiles.\nOrthodox and many Conservative authorities completely prohibit the use of automobiles on Shabbat as a violation of multiple categories, including lighting a fire, extinguishing a fire, and transferring between domains (category 39). However, the Conservative movement's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards permits driving to a synagogue on Shabbat, as an emergency measure, on the grounds that if Jews lost contact with synagogue life, they would become lost to the Jewish people.\nA halakhically authorized Shabbat mode added to a power-operated mobility scooter may be used on the observance of Shabbat for those with walking limitations, often referred to as a Shabbat scooter. It is intended only for individuals whose limited mobility is dependent on a scooter or automobile consistently throughout the week.\nModifications.\nSeemingly \"forbidden\" acts may be performed by modifying technology such that no law is actually violated. In Sabbath mode, a \"Sabbath elevator\" will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without anyone having to press any buttons, which would normally be needed to work. (Dynamic braking is also disabled if it is normally used, i.e., shunting energy collected from downward travel, and thus the gravitational potential energy of passengers, into a resistor network.) However, many rabbinical authorities consider the use of such elevators by those who are otherwise capable as a violation of Shabbat, with such workarounds being for the benefit of the frail and handicapped and not being in the spirit of the day.\nMany observant Jews avoid the prohibition of carrying by use of an eruv. Others make their keys into a tie bar, part of a belt buckle, or a brooch, because a legitimate article of clothing or jewelry may be worn rather than carried. An elastic band with clips on both ends, and with keys placed between them as integral links, may be considered a belt.\nShabbat lamps have been developed to allow a light in a room to be turned on or off at will while the electricity remains on. A special mechanism blocks out the light when the off position is desired without violating Shabbat.\nThe Shabbos App is a proposed Android app claimed by its creators to enable Orthodox Jews, and all Jewish Sabbath-observers, to use a smartphone to text on the Jewish Sabbath. It has met with resistance from some authorities.\nPermissions.\nIf a human life is in danger (pikuach nefesh), then a Jew is not only allowed, but required, to violate any halakhic law that stands in the way of saving that person (excluding murder, idolatry, and forbidden sexual acts). The concept of life being in danger is interpreted broadly: for example, it is mandated that one violate Shabbat to bring a woman in active labor to a hospital. Lesser rabbinic restrictions are often violated under much less urgent circumstances (a patient who is ill but not critically so).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We did everything to save lives, despite Shabbat. People asked: \"Why are you here? There are no Jews here,\" but we are here because the Torah orders us to save lives ... We are desecrating Shabbat with pride.\nVarious other legal principles closely delineate which activities constitute desecration of Shabbat. Examples of these include the principle of \"shinui\" (\"change\" or \"deviation\"): A violation is not regarded as severe if the prohibited act was performed in a way that would be considered abnormal on a weekday. Examples include writing with one's nondominant hand, according to many rabbinic authorities. This legal principle operates \"bedi'avad\" (\"ex post facto\") and does not cause a forbidden activity to be permitted barring extenuating circumstances.\nReform and Reconstructionist views.\nGenerally, adherents of Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism believe that the individual Jew determines whether to follow Shabbat prohibitions or not. For example, some Jews might find activities, such as writing or cooking for leisure, to be enjoyable enhancements to Shabbat and its holiness, and therefore may encourage such practices. Many Reform Jews believe that what constitutes \"work\" is different for each person, and that only what the person considers \"work\" is forbidden. The radical Reform rabbi Samuel Holdheim advocated moving Sabbath to Sunday for many no longer observed it, a step taken by dozens of congregations in the United States in late 19th century.\nMore rabbinically traditional Reform and Reconstructionist Jews believe that these \"halakhoth\" in general may be valid, but that it is up to each individual to decide how and when to apply them. A small fraction of Jews in the Progressive Jewish community accept these laws in much the same way as Orthodox Jews.\nEncouraged activities.\nThe Talmud, especially in tractate Shabbat, defines rituals and activities to both \"remember\" and \"keep\" the Sabbath holy and to sanctify it at home and in the synagogue. In addition to refraining from creative work, the sanctification of the day through blessings over wine, the preparation of special Sabbath meals, and engaging in prayer and Torah study were required as an active part of Shabbat observance to promote intellectual activity and spiritual regeneration on the day of rest from physical creation. According to many scribes, half of the day should be devoted to Torah study and prayer. The Talmud states that the best food should be prepared for the Sabbath, for \"one who delights in the Sabbath is granted their heart's desires\" (BT, Shabbat 118a-b).\nAll Jewish denominations encourage the following activities on Shabbat:\nSpecial Shabbat.\nSpecial Shabbatot are the Shabbatot that precede important Jewish holidays: e.g., \"Shabbat HaGadol\" (Shabbat preceding Pesach), \"Shabbat Zachor\" (Shabbat preceding Purim), and \"Shabbat Shuvah\" (Shabbat between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur).\nIn other religions.\nChristianity.\nMost Christians do not observe Saturday Sabbath, but instead observe a weekly day of worship on Sunday, which is often called the \"Lord's Day\". Several Christian denominations, such as the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of God (7th Day), the Seventh Day Baptists, and others, observe seventh-day Sabbath. This observance is celebrated from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.\nSamaritans.\nSamaritans also observe Shabbat.\nIslam.\nAlthough Muslims do not observe Saturday Sabbath, the name of Saturday in the Islamic calendar, , is etymologically-related to its Hebrew name, likewise meaning 'rest.'\nLunar Sabbath.\nSome hold the biblical sabbath was not connected to a 7-day week like the Gregorian calendar. Instead the New Moon marks the starting point for counting and the shabbat falls consistently on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th of each month. Biblical text to support using the moon, a light in the heavens, to determine days include https://, https://, and https:// See references:\nRabbinic Jewish tradition and practice does not hold of this, holding the sabbath to be based on the days of creation, and hence a wholly separate cycle from the monthly cycle, which does not occur automatically and must be rededicated each month.

H. Munro, was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes macabre stories satirise Edwardian society and culture. He is considered by English teachers and scholars a master of the short story and is often compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker. Influenced by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, Munro himself influenced A. A. Milne, No\u00ebl Coward and P. G. Wodehouse.\nBesides his short stories (which were first published in newspapers, as was customary at the time, and then collected into several volumes), Munro wrote a full-length play, \"The Watched Pot\", in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, \"The Rise of the Russian Empire\" (the only book published under his own name); a short novel, \"The Unbearable Bassington\"; the episodic \"The Westminster Alice\" (a parliamentary parody of \"Alice in Wonderland\"); and \"When William Came\", subtitled \"A Story of London Under the Hohenzollerns\", a fantasy about a future German invasion and occupation of Britain.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nHector Hugh Munro was born in Akyab (now Sittwe), British Burma, which was then part of British India. Saki was the son of Charles Augustus Munro, an Inspector General for the Indian Imperial Police, and his wife, Mary Frances Mercer (1843\u20131872), the daughter of Rear Admiral Samuel Mercer. Her nephew Cecil William Mercer became a novelist under the name Dornford Yates.\nIn 1872, on a home visit to England, Mary Munro was charged by a cow, and the shock caused her to miscarry. She never recovered and soon died.\nAfter his wife's death Charles Munro sent his three children, Ethel Mary (born April 1868), Charles Arthur (born July 1869) and two-year-old Hector, home to England. The children were sent to Broadgate Villa, in Pilton near Barnstaple, North Devon, to be raised by their grandmother and paternal maiden aunts, Charlotte and Augusta, in a strict and puritanical household. It is said that his aunts were most likely models for some of his characters, notably the aunt in \"The Lumber Room\" and the guardian in \"Sredni Vashtar\": Munro's sister Ethel said that the aunt in \"The Lumber Room\" was an almost perfect portrait of Aunt Augusta. Munro and his siblings led slightly insular lives during their early years and were educated by governesses. At the age of 12 the young Hector Munro was educated at Pencarwick School in Exmouth and then as a boarder at Bedford School.\nIn 1887, after his retirement, his father returned from Burma and embarked upon a series of European travels with Hector and his siblings.\nHector followed his father in 1893 into the Indian Imperial Police and was posted to Burma, but successive bouts of fever caused his return home after only fifteen months.\nWriting career.\nIn 1896 he decided to move to London to make a living as a writer.\nMunro started his writing career as a journalist for newspapers such as \"The Westminster Gazette\", the \"Daily Express\", \"The Morning Post\", and magazines such as the \"Bystander\" and \"Outlook\". His first book, \"The Rise of the Russian Empire\", a historical study modelled upon Edward Gibbon's \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", appeared in 1900, under his real name, but proved to be something of a false start.\nWhile writing \"The Rise of the Russian Empire\", he made his first foray into short story writing and published a piece called \"Dogged\" in \"St Paul's\" on February 18, 1899 (Munro's sketch \"The Achievement of the Cat\" had appeared the day before in \"The Westminster Budget\".) He then moved into the world of political satire in 1900 with a collaboration with Francis Carruthers Gould entitled \"Alice in Westminster\". Gould produced the sketches, and Munro wrote the text accompanying them, using the pen name \"Saki\" for the first time. The series lampooned political figures of the day (\"Alice in Downing Street\" begins with the memorable line, \"'Have you ever seen an Ineptitude?'\" \u2013 referring to a zoomorphised Arthur Balfour), and was published in the Liberal \"Westminster Gazette\".\nIn 1902 he moved to \"The Morning Post\", described as one of the \"organs of intransigence\" by Stephen Koss, to work as a foreign correspondent, first in the Balkans, and then in Russia, where he was witness to the 1905 revolution in St. Petersburg. He then went on to Paris, before returning to London in 1908, where \"the agreeable life of a man of letters with a brilliant reputation awaited him\". In the intervening period \"Reginald\" had been published in 1904, the stories having first appeared in \"The Westminster Gazette\", and all this time he was writing sketches for \"The Morning Post\", the \"Bystander\" and \"The Westminster Gazette\". He kept a place in Mortimer Street, wrote, played bridge at the Cocoa Tree Club, and lived simply. \"Reginald in Russia\" appeared in 1910, \"The Chronicles of Clovis\" was published in 1911, and \"Beasts and Super-Beasts\" in 1914, along with other short stories that appeared in newspapers not published in collections in his lifetime.\nHe also produced two novels, \"The Unbearable Bassington\" (1912) and \"When William Came\" (1913).\nDeath.\nAt the start of the First World War Munro was 43 and officially over-age to enlist, but he refused a commission and joined the 2nd King Edward's Horse as an ordinary trooper. He later transferred to the 22nd (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (Kensington), in which he was promoted to lance sergeant. More than once he returned to the battlefield when officially too sick or injured. In November 1916 he was sheltering in a shell crater near Beaumont-Hamel, France, during the Battle of the Ancre, when he was killed by a German sniper. According to several sources, his last words were \"Put that bloody cigarette out!\"\nLegacy.\nMunro has no known grave. He is commemorated on Pier and Face 8C 9A and 16A of the Thiepval Memorial.\nIn 2003 English Heritage marked Munro's flat at 97 Mortimer Street, in Fitzrovia with a blue plaque.\nAfter his death, his sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers and wrote her own account of their childhood, which appeared at the beginning of \"The Square Egg and Other Sketches\" (1924). Rothay Reynolds, a close friend, wrote a relatively lengthy memoir in \"The Toys of Peace\" (1919), but aside from this, the only other biographies of Munro are \"Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro\" (1982) by A. J. Langguth, and \"The Unbearable Saki\" (2007) by Sandie Byrne. All later biographies have had to draw heavily upon Ethel's account of her brother's life.\nIn late 2020 two Saki stories, \"The Optimist\" (1912) and \"Mrs. Pendercoet's Lost Identity\" (1911), which had never been republished, collected, or noted in any academic publication on Saki, were rediscovered; they are now available online.\nIn 2021, Lora Sifurova, looking through the \"Morning Post\" and other London periodicals in Russian archives, rediscovered seven sketches and stories attributed to Munro or Saki.\nIn 2023, Bruce Gaston rediscovered a Clovis sketch, \"The Romance of Business\", published as part of an advertisement for Selfridge's in a 1914 issue of the \"Daily News and Leader\".\nSexuality.\nMunro was homosexual at a time when in Britain sexual activity between men was a crime. The Cleveland Street scandal (1889), followed by the imprisonment of Oscar Wilde (1895), meant \"that side of [Munro's] life had to be secret\".\nPen-name.\nThe pen name \"Saki\" (Persian: \", \": 'cupbearer') is a reference to a figure in Edward Fitzgerald's translation of the \"Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayyam\". This is confirmed both by his friend and editor Rothay Reynolds and by his sister, Ethel Munro. The is a symbolic and erotic figure in both Arabic and Persian wine poetry.\nSelected works.\nMuch of Saki's work contrasts the conventions and hypocrisies of Edwardian England with the ruthless but straightforward life-and-death struggles of nature. Writing in \"The Guardian\" to mark the centenary of Saki's death, Stephen Moss noted, \"In many of his stories, stuffy authority figures are set against forces of nature\u2014polecats, hyenas, tigers. Even if they are not eaten, the humans rarely have the best of it\".\n\"The Interlopers\".\n\"The Interlopers\" is a story about two men, Georg Znaeym and Ulrich von Gradwitz, whose families have fought over a forest in the eastern Carpathian Mountains for generations. Ulrich's family legally owns the land and so considers Georg an interloper when he hunts in the forest. But Georg, believing that the forest rightfully belongs to his family, hunts there often and believes that Ulrich is the real interloper for trying to stop him. One winter night, Ulrich catches Georg hunting in the forest. Neither man can shoot the other without warning, as they would soil their family's honour, so they hesitate to acknowledge one another. In an \"act of God\", a tree branch suddenly falls on each of them, trapping them both under a log. Gradually they realise the futility of their quarrel, become friends and end the feud. They then call out for their men's assistance and, after a brief period, Ulrich makes out nine or ten figures approaching over a hill. The story ends with Ulrich's realization that the approaching figures on the hill are actually hungry wolves. The wolves who hunt in packs as opposed to rivalries, it seems, are the true owners of the forest, while both humans are interlopers.\n\"Gabriel-Ernest\".\n\"Gabriel-Ernest\" starts with a warning: \"There is a wild beast in your woods \u2026\" Gabriel, a naked boy sunbathing by the river, is \"adopted\" by well-meaning townspeople. Lovely and charming, but also rather vague and distant, he seems bemused by his \"benefactors.\" Asked how he managed by himself in the woods, he replies that he hunts \"on four legs,\" which they take to mean that he has a dog. The climax comes when a small child disappears while walking home from Sunday school. A pursuit ensues, but Gabriel and the child disappear near a river. The only items found are Gabriel's clothes, and the two are never seen again. The story includes many of the author's favourite themes: good intentions gone awry, the banality of polite society, the attraction of the sinister, and the allure of the wild and the forbidden. There is also a recognition of basic decency, upheld when the story's protagonist 'flatly refuses' to subscribe to a Gabriel-Ernest memorial, for his supposedly gallant attempt to save a drowning child, and drowning himself, as well. Gabriel-Ernest was actually a werewolf who had eaten the child, then run off.\n\"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\".\nAt a railway station an arrogant and overbearing woman, Mrs Quabarl, mistakes the mischievous Lady Carlotta, who has been inadvertently left behind by a train, for the governess, Miss Hope, whom she has been expecting, Miss Hope having erred about the date of her arrival. Lady Carlotta decides not to correct the mistake, acknowledges herself as Miss Hope, a proponent of \"the Schartz-Metterklume method\" of making children understand history by acting it out themselves, and chooses the Rape of the Sabine Women (exemplified by a washerwoman's two girls) as the first lesson. After creating chaos for two days, she departs, explaining that her delayed luggage will include a leopard cub.\n\"The Toys of Peace\".\nPreferring not to give her young sons toy soldiers or guns, and having taken away their toy depicting the Siege of Adrianople, Eleanor instructs her brother Harvey to give them innovative \"peace toys\" as an Easter present. When the packages are opened young Bertie shouts \"It's a fort!\" and is disappointed when his uncle replies \"It's a municipal dustbin.\" The boys are initially baffled as to how to obtain any enjoyment from models of a school of art and a public library, or from little figures of John Stuart Mill, Felicia Hemans and Sir John Herschel. Youthful inventiveness finds a way, however, as the boys combine their history lessons on Louis XIV with a lurid and violent play-story about the invasion of Britain and the storming of the Young Women's Christian Association. The end of the story has Harvey reporting failure to Eleanor, explaining \"We have begun too late,\" not realising he was doomed to failure whenever he had begun.\n\"The Open Window\".\nFramton Nuttel, a nervous man, has come to stay in the country for his health. His sister, who thinks he should socialise while he is there, has given him letters of introduction to families in the neighbourhood whom she got to know during her stay. Framton goes to visit Mrs. Sappleton and, while waiting for her to come down, is entertained by her witty fifteen-year-old niece. The niece tells him that the French window is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs. Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day. When Mrs. Sappleton comes down she talks about her husband and her brothers, and how they are going to come back from shooting soon; Framton, believing that she is deranged, tries to distract her by explaining his health condition. Then, to his horror, Mrs. Sappleton points out that her husband and her brothers are coming, and he sees them walking towards the window with their dog. He thinks he is seeing ghosts and flees. Mrs. Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, at her husband and brothers' arrival, tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs ever since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in a newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him. The last line summarises the situation, saying of the niece, \"Romance at short notice was her speciality.\"\n\"The Unrest-Cure\".\nSaki's recurring hero Clovis Sangrail, a clever, mischievous young man, overhears the complacent middle-aged Huddle complaining of his own addiction to routine and aversion to change. Huddle's friend makes the wry suggestion that he needs an \"unrest-cure\" (the opposite of a rest cure), to be performed, if possible, in the home. Clovis takes it upon himself to \"help\" the man and his sister by involving them in an invented outrage (a supposed pogrom carried out by the local bishop) that will be a \"blot on the twentieth century\".\n\"Esm\u00e9\".\nA baroness tells Clovis a story about a hyena that she and her friend Constance encountered while out fox hunting. Later, the hyena follows them, stopping briefly to eat a gypsy child. Shortly after this, the hyena is killed by a motorcar. The baroness immediately claims the corpse as her beloved dog Esm\u00e9, and the guilty owner of the car gets his chauffeur to bury the animal and later sends her an emerald brooch to make up for her loss.\n\"Sredni Vashtar\".\nA sickly child named Conradin is raised by his aunt and guardian, Mrs De Ropp, who \"would never... have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin, though she might have been dimly aware that thwarting him 'for his good' was a duty which she did not find particularly irksome\". Conradin rebels against his aunt and her choking authority. He invents a religion in which his polecat ferret is imagined as a vengeful deity, and Conradin prays that \"Sredni Vashtar\" will deliver retribution upon De Ropp. When De Ropp attempts to dispose of the animal, it attacks and kills her. The entire household is shocked and alarmed; Conradin calmly butters another piece of toast.\n\"Tobermory\".\nAt a country-house party, one guest, Cornelius Appin, announces to the others that he has perfected a procedure for teaching animals human speech. He demonstrates this on his host's cat, Tobermory. Soon it is clear that animals are permitted to view and listen to many private things on the assumption that they will remain silent, such as the host Sir Wilfred's commentary on one guest's intelligence and the hope that she will buy his car, or the implied sexual activities of some of the other guests. The guests are angered, especially when Tobermory runs away to pursue a rival cat, but plans to poison him fail when Tobermory is instead killed by the rival cat. \"An archangel ecstatically proclaiming the Millennium, and then finding that it clashed unpardonably with Henley and would have to be indefinitely postponed, could hardly have felt more crestfallen than Cornelius Appin at the reception of his wonderful achievement.\" Appin is killed shortly afterwards when attempting to teach an elephant in a zoo in Dresden to speak German. His fellow house party guest, Clovis Sangrail (Saki's recurring hero), remarks that if he was teaching \"the poor beast\" irregular German verbs, he deserved no pity.\n\"The Bull\".\nTom Yorkfield, a farmer, receives a visit from his half-brother Laurence. Tom has no great liking for Laurence or respect for his profession as a painter of animals. Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him to be impressed, but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold a painting of a different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should be worth more than his real bull. This and Laurence's condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour because he knows that, however valuable Laurence's painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.\n\"The East Wing\".\nThis is a \"rediscovered\" short story that was previously cited as a play. A house party is beset by a fire in the middle of the night in the east wing of the house. Begged by their hostess to save \"my poor darling Eva\u2014Eva of the golden hair,\" Lucien demurs, on the grounds that he has never even met her. It is only on discovering that Eva is not a flesh-and-blood daughter but Mrs Gramplain's painting of the daughter she wished that she had had, and which she has faithfully updated with the passing years, that Lucien declares a willingness to forfeit his life to rescue her, since \"death in this case is more beautiful,\" a sentiment endorsed by the Major. As the two men disappear into the blaze, Mrs Gramplain recollects that she \"sent Eva to Exeter to be cleaned\". The two men have lost their lives for nothing.\nRadio.\nThe 5th broadcast of Orson Welles' series for CBS Radio, \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", from 8 August 1938, dramatises three short stories rather than one long story. The second of the three stories is \"The Open Window.\"\n\"The Open Window\" is also adapted (by John Allen) in the 1962 Golden Records release \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Ghost Stories for Young People\", a record album of six ghost stories for children.\nTobermory, The Interlopers, Sredni Vashtar, Gabriel Ernest and Mrs Packletide's Tiger were restaged in a modern day wealthy gated-community by BBC as \"Beasts on the Lawn\".&lt;ref name=\"penguin/9781445896618\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"bbc/b0120vy7\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nTelevision.\nA dramatisation of \"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\" was an episode in the series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" in 1960.\n\"Saki: The Improper Stories of H. H. Munro\" (a reference to the ending of \"The Story Teller\") was an eight-part series produced by Philip Mackie for Granada Television in 1962. Actors involved included Mark Burns as Clovis, Fenella Fielding as Mary Drakmanton, Heather Chasen as Agnes Huddle, Richard Vernon as the Major, Rosamund Greenwood as Veronique and Martita Hunt as Lady Bastable.\nJonathan Pryce read five short stories, \u201cThe Music on the Hill\u201d, \u201cSredni Vashtar\u201d, \u201cThe Penance\u201d, \u201cGabriel-Ernest\u201d and \u201cThe Hounds of Fate\u201d as part of the British children's supernatural television series \"Spine Chillers\" broadcast by BBC1 in 1980.\nA dramatisation of \"The Open Window\" was an episode in the series \"Tales of the Unexpected\" in 1984. The same story was also adapted as \"Ek Khula Hua Darwaza\" by Shyam Benegal as an episode in the 1986 Indian anthology television series \"Katha Sagar\", which also included the episode \"Saboon Ki Tikiya\" an adaptation of Munro's \"Dusk\" by Benegal.\n\"Who Killed Mrs De Ropp?\", a BBC TV production in 2007, starring Ben Daniels and Gemma Jones, showcased three of Saki's short stories, \"The Storyteller\", \"The Lumber Room\" and \"Sredni Vashtar\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the last of these, software inspection and software walkthroughs are also used. In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of a program's source code, and, in other cases, on some form of its object code.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Two leading approaches to resource certification have been Static Analysis (SA) and Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC). SA is algorithmic in nature: it focuses on a broad programming language of choice, and seeks to determine by syntactic means whether given programs in that language are feasible. In contrast, ICC attempts to create from the outset specialized programming languages or methods that delineate a complexity class. Thus, SA's focus is on compile time, making no demand on the programmer; whereas ICC is a language-design discipline.\"\u2014\u200a\nRationale.\nThe sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only consider the behaviour of individual statements and declarations, to those that include the complete source code of a program in their analysis. The uses of the information obtained from the analysis vary from highlighting possible coding errors (e.g., the lint tool) to formal methods that mathematically prove properties about a given program (e.g., its behaviour matches that of its specification).\nSoftware metrics and reverse engineering can be described as forms of static analysis. Deriving software metrics and static analysis are increasingly deployed together, especially in creation of embedded systems, by defining so-called \"software quality objectives\".\nA growing commercial use of static analysis is in the verification of properties of software used in safety-critical computer systems and\nlocating potentially vulnerable code. For example, the following industries have identified the use of static code analysis as a means of improving the quality of increasingly sophisticated and complex software:\nA study in 2012 by VDC Research reported that 28.7% of the embedded software engineers surveyed use static analysis tools and 39.7% expect to use them within 2 years.\nA study from 2010 found that 60% of the interviewed developers in European research projects made at least use of their basic IDE built-in static analyzers. However, only about 10% employed an additional other (and perhaps more advanced) analysis tool.\nIn the application security industry the name static application security testing (SAST) is also used. SAST is an important part of Security Development Lifecycles (SDLs) such as the SDL defined by Microsoft and a common practice in software companies.\nTool types.\nThe OMG (Object Management Group) published a study regarding the types of software analysis required for software quality measurement and assessment. This document on \"How to Deliver Resilient, Secure, Efficient, and Easily Changed IT Systems in Line with CISQ Recommendations\" describes three levels of software analysis.\nA further level of software analysis can be defined.\nFormal methods.\nFormal methods is the term applied to the analysis of software (and computer hardware) whose results are obtained purely through the use of rigorous mathematical methods. The mathematical techniques used include denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics, operational semantics, and abstract interpretation.\nBy a straightforward reduction to the halting problem, it is possible to prove that (for any Turing complete language), finding all possible run-time errors in an arbitrary program (or more generally any kind of violation of a specification on the final result of a program) is undecidable: there is no mechanical method that can always answer truthfully whether an arbitrary program may or may not exhibit runtime errors. This result dates from the works of Church, G\u00f6del and Turing in the 1930s (see: Halting problem and Rice's theorem). As with many undecidable questions, one can still attempt to give useful approximate solutions.\nSome of the implementation techniques of formal static analysis include:\nData-driven static analysis.\nData-driven static analysis leverages extensive codebases to infer coding rules and improve the accuracy of the analysis. For instance, one can use all Java open-source packages available on GitHub to learn good analysis strategies. The rule inference can use machine learning techniques. It is also possible to learn from a large amount of past fixes and warnings.\nRemediation.\nStatic analyzers produce warnings. For certain types of warnings, it is possible to design and implement automated remediation techniques. For example, Logozzo and Ball have proposed automated remediations for C# \"cccheck\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28812", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28812", "title": "Samuel Mudd", "text": "American physician implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln\nSamuel Alexander Mudd Sr. (December 20, 1833\u00a0\u2013 January 10, 1883) was an American physician who was imprisoned for conspiring with John Wilkes Booth concerning the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.\nMudd worked as a doctor and tobacco farmer in Southern Maryland. The Civil War seriously damaged his business, especially when Maryland abolished slavery in 1864. That year, he first met Booth, who was planning to kidnap Lincoln, and Mudd was seen in company with three of the conspirators. However, his part in the plot, if any, remains unclear.\nBooth fatally shot Lincoln on April 14, 1865, but was injured during his escape from the scene. He subsequently rode with conspirator David Herold to Mudd's home in the early hours of April 15 for surgery on his fractured leg before he crossed into Virginia. Sometime that day, Mudd must have learned of the assassination but did not report Booth's visit to the authorities for another 24 hours. This fact appeared to link him to the crime, as did his various changes of story under interrogation. A military commission found Mudd guilty of aiding and conspiring in a murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment, escaping execution by a single vote.\nMudd was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson and released from prison in 1869. Despite repeated attempts by family members and others to have it expunged, his conviction was never overturned.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Charles County, Maryland into a Roman Catholic family, Samuel Mudd was the fourth of 10\u00a0children of Henry Lowe and Sarah Ann (Reeves) Mudd. He grew up on Oak Hill, his father's tobacco plantation of several hundred acres, which was worked by 89 slaves and was located about southeast of Washington, D.C.https://\nAt age 15, after several years of home tutoring, Mudd went off to boarding school at St.\u00a0John's Literary Institute, now known as Saint John's Catholic Prep School, in Frederick, Maryland. Two years later, he enrolled at Georgetown College in the District of Columbia. He then studied medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, writing his thesis on dysentery.\nUpon graduation in 1856, Mudd returned to Charles County to practice medicine, marrying his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Frances Dyer, one year later.\nAs a wedding present, Mudd's father gave the couple of his best farmland and a new house named St. Catharine. While the house was under construction, the Mudds lived with Frankie's bachelor brother, Jeremiah Dyer, finally moving into their new home in 1859. They had nine children in all: four before Mudd's arrest and five more after his release from prison. To supplement his income from his medical practice, Mudd became a small-scale tobacco grower, using five slaves according to the 1860 census. Mudd believed that slavery was divinely ordained and wrote a letter to the theologian Orestes Brownson to that effect.https://\nWith the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Southern Maryland's slave system and the economy that it supported rapidly began to collapse. In 1863, the Union Army established Camp Stanton, just from the Mudd farm, to enlist black freedmen and runaway slaves. Six regiments totaling over 8,700\u00a0black soldiers, many from Southern Maryland, were trained there. In 1864, Maryland, which was exempt from Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, abolished slavery, making it difficult for growers like Mudd to operate their plantations. As a result, Mudd considered selling his farm and depending on his medical practice. As Mudd pondered his alternatives, he was introduced to someone who said he might be interested in buying his property: 26\u00a0year-old actor John Wilkes Booth.\nBooth connection.\nAccording to a statement made by associated conspirator George Atzerodt, discovered long after his death and recorded while he was in federal custody on May 1, 1865, Mudd knew in advance about Booth's plans; Atzerodt was sure the doctor knew, he said, because Booth had \"sent (as he told me) liquors and provisions ... about two weeks before the murder to Dr.\u00a0Mudd's.\"\nAlthough that is true, some historians believe there may have been other reasons behind Mudd's relationship with Booth. The trial brought forth many theories of Mudd's involvement in the assassination of Lincoln. One theory posits that Mudd was involved in a completely different conspiracy to gain an upper hand for the southern states. Prior to killing Lincoln, Booth had intended to kidnap the president and ransom him and other political affiliates of the Union for a large sum of money. This plan was in effect until the night of the assassination, when Booth met up with Atzerodt, David Herold, and Lewis Powell and disclosed the plot to assassinate the president instead. Following the assassination, Powell came forth by stating that Booth had not told him until this meeting and that the other men did not know about the plot until the night of the assassination. This supports the theory that Mudd may have been an accomplice to the plot to kidnap the president, but not a conspirator to the assassination.\nAfter Booth shot Lincoln on the night of April\u00a014, 1865, he broke his left fibula. According to his diary, this occurred when he jumped from the presidential box while fleeing Ford's Theater. The reliability of this diary is questionable, as Booth intended it more as a manifesto to be published, and he embellished other facts in it. One example is, \"I struck boldly and not as the papers say[...]I shouted sic semper before I fired.\" which is proven untrue by every eyewitness account of the assassination independently agreeing that Booth shouted after he fired. Furthermore, Booth and Herold told Mudd that Booth broke his leg falling from his horse afterward. If Mudd was indeed a part of the conspiracy, Booth would have no motivation to lie about this to Mudd.\nBooth met up with Herold and both men made for Virginia via southern Maryland. They stopped at Mudd's house around 4\u00a0AM on April\u00a015; Mudd splinted Booth's leg and gave him a shoe to wear. He also arranged for a carpenter, John Best, to make a pair of crutches for Booth. Booth paid Mudd $25 in greenbacks for his medical treatment. He and Herold spent between twelve and fifteen hours at Mudd's house. They slept in the front bedroom on the second floor. It is unclear whether Mudd had yet been informed that Booth had killed Lincoln.\nMudd went to Bryantown during the day on April\u00a015 to run errands; if he had not already heard the news of the assassination from Booth, he certainly learned of it on the trip. He returned home that evening, and accounts differ as to whether Booth and Herold had already left, whether Mudd met them as they were leaving, and whether they left at Mudd's urging and with his assistance.\nIt is certain that Mudd did not immediately contact the authorities. When questioned, he stated that he had not wanted to leave his family alone in the house in case the assassins returned and found him absent and his family unprotected. He waited until Mass the following day, Easter Sunday, when he asked his second cousin, Dr.\u00a0George Mudd, a resident of Bryantown, to notify the 13th New York Cavalry in Bryantown, under the command of Lieutenant David Dana. Mudd's delay in contacting the authorities drew suspicion and was a significant factor in tying him to the conspiracy. During his initial investigative interview on April\u00a018, Mudd stated that he had never seen either of the parties before. In his sworn statement of April\u00a022, he told about Booth's visit to Bryantown in November\u00a01864\nbut then said, \"I have never seen Booth since that time to my knowledge until last Saturday morning.\" Later testimony from Louis J. Weichmann revealed that Mudd hid his meeting with Booth in Washington in December\u00a01864. In prison, Mudd admitted the Washington meeting and said he ran into Booth by chance during a Christmas shopping trip. Mudd's failure to mention the meeting in his interview with detectives proved to be a big mistake: When Weichmann told the authorities of the meeting, they realized that Mudd had misled them and immediately began to treat him as a suspect, rather than a witness.\nDuring the conspiracy trial, Lieutenant Alexander Lovett testified\n \"On Friday, the 21st of April, I went to Mudd's again, for the purpose of arresting him. When he found we were going to search the house, he said something to his wife, and she went upstairs and brought down a boot. Mudd said he had cut it off the man's leg. I turned down the top of the boot, and saw the name 'J.\u00a0Wilkes' written in it.\"\nTrial.\nAfter Booth's death on April 26, 1865, Mudd was arrested and charged with conspiracy to murder Lincoln. Representative Frederick Stone was the senior defense counsel for Mudd. On May\u00a01, President Johnson ordered the formation of a nine-man military commission to try the conspirators. Mudd was represented by General Thomas Ewing Jr. The trial began on May\u00a010. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, David Herold, Samuel Mudd, Michael O'Laughlen, Edmund Spangler and Samuel Arnold were all charged with conspiring to murder Lincoln. The prosecution called 366\u00a0witnesses.\nThe defense sought to prove that Mudd was a loyal citizen, citing his self-description as a \"Union man\" and asserting that he was \"a deeply religious man, devoted to family, and a kind master to his slaves.\" The prosecution presented witnesses who testified that he had shot one of his slaves in the leg and threatened to send others to Richmond, Virginia, to assist in the construction of Confederate defenses. The prosecution also contended that he had been a member of a Confederate communications distribution agency and had sheltered Confederate soldiers on his plantation, and that he had been a member of a posse which captured runaway slaves and sent them to Richmond. Several of Mudd's former slaves testified that he had said on multiple occasions that President Lincoln ought to be shot. An acquaintance named Daniel Thomas also testified that in early 1865 Mudd had predicted that Lincoln and his cabinet \"would be killed in six or seven weeks\".\nOn June 29, Mudd was found guilty with the others. The testimony of Louis J. Weichmann was crucial in obtaining the convictions. According to historian Edward Steers, the testimony presented by former slaves was also crucial, but it faded from public memory. Mudd escaped execution by one vote and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Surratt, Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold were hanged at the Old Penitentiary at the Washington Arsenal on July\u00a07, 1865.\nImprisonment.\nMudd, O'Laughlen, Arnold, and Spangler were imprisoned at Fort Jefferson, in the Dry Tortugas, about west of Key West, Florida. The fort housed Union Army deserters and held about 600 prisoners when Mudd and the others arrived. Prisoners lived on the second tier of the fort, in unfinished, open-air gun rooms called casemates. Mudd and his three companions lived in the casemate directly above the fort's main entrance, called the sally port. In September 1865, two months after Mudd arrived, the control of Fort Jefferson was transferred from the 161st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment to the 82nd US Colored Troops.\nOn September 25, 1865, Mudd attempted to escape from Fort Jefferson by stowing away on the transport \"Thomas A. Scott\". He was quickly discovered and placed, along with Arnold, O'Laughlen, Spangler, and George St. Leger Grenfell, in a large empty ground-level gunroom that soldiers referred to as \"the dungeon\". The men were let out of the dungeon every working day for 12 hours and were required to wear leg irons. However, following a December 22 letter from his wife to President Johnson, the War Department ordered the discontinuance of the shackles and the move to better quarters, which was accomplished by January.\nAfter three months in the dungeon, Mudd and the others were returned to the general prison population. However, because of his attempted escape, Mudd lost his privilege of working in the prison hospital and was assigned to work in the prison carpentry shop with Spangler.\nThere was an outbreak of yellow fever in the fall of 1867 at the fort. O'Laughlen eventually died of it on September 23. The prison doctor died, and Mudd agreed to take over the position. He was able to help stem the spread of the disease. The soldiers in the fort wrote a petition to Johnson in October 1867 stating the degree of Mudd's assistance: \"He inspired the hopeless with courage and by his constant presence in the midst of danger and infection... [Many] doubtless owe their lives to the care and treatment they received at his hands.\" Probably as a reward for his work in the yellow fever epidemic, Mudd was reassigned from the carpentry shop to a clerical job in the Provost Marshal's office, where he remained until his pardon.\nLater life.\nThe influence of his defense attorney, Thomas Ewing Jr., who had connections in President Johnson's administration, was one reason why Mudd was pardoned by Johnson on February 8, 1869. He was released from prison on March 8, 1869, and returned to his home in Maryland on March 20, 1869. On March 2, 1869, three weeks after he pardoned Mudd, Johnson also pardoned Spangler and Arnold.\nWhen Mudd returned home, well-wishing friends and strangers, as well as inquiring newspaper reporters, besieged him. Mudd was very reluctant to talk to the press because he felt it had misquoted him in the past. He gave one interview to the \"New York Herald\" after his release but immediately regretted it, and complained that the article had several factual errors and misrepresented his work during the yellow fever epidemic. On the whole, though, Mudd continued to enjoy the support of his friends and neighbors. He resumed his medical practice and slowly brought the family farm back to productivity. In 1873, Spangler traveled to the Mudd farm, where Mudd and his wife welcomed him. Spangler lived with the Mudd family for about 18\u00a0months, earning his keep by doing carpentry, gardening, and other farm chores, until Spangler's death on February 7, 1875.\nMudd always had an interest in politics. In prison, he learned about political happenings by reading the newspapers that were sent to him. After his release, he again became active in community affairs. In 1874, he was elected chief officer of the local farmers association, the Bryantown Grange. In 1876, he was elected vice president of the local Democratic Tilden-Hendricks presidential election committee. Tilden lost that year to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in a hotly-disputed election. The next year, Mudd ran as a Democratic candidate for the Maryland House of Delegates, but was defeated by the popular Republican William Mitchell.\nMudd's ninth child, Mary Eleanor \"Nettie\" Mudd, was born in 1878. In 1880, the Port Tobacco \"Times\" reported that Mudd's barn which contained almost 8000\u00a0lb. of tobacco, two horses, a wagon, and farm implements was destroyed by fire.\nDeath.\nMudd was 49 years old when he died of pneumonia, on January 10, 1883, and was buried in the cemetery at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Bryantown, the same church where he had once met Booth.\nRehabilitation attempts.\nThe degree of Samuel Mudd's culpability has remained controversial. Some claim that Mudd was innocent of any wrongdoing, including Mudd's grandson Richard Mudd, and that he had merely been imprisoned for treating a man who came to his house late at night with a fractured leg. Over a century after the assassination, Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan both wrote letters to Richard Mudd in which they argued that his grandfather had committed no crime. However, others, including authors Edward Steers, Jr. and James Swanson, assert that there is evidence that Samuel Mudd visited Booth three times in the months before the failed kidnapping attempt.\nThe first time was November 1864 when Booth was looking for help in his kidnapping plot and was directed to Mudd by agents of the Confederate Secret Service. In December, Booth again met with Mudd and spent the night at his farm. Later that December, Mudd went to Washington and introduced Booth to Confederate agent John Surratt. Additionally, George Atzerodt testified that Booth sent supplies to Mudd's house in preparation for the kidnapping plan. Mudd lied to the authorities who came to his house after the assassination, claiming that he did not recognize the man who showed up on his doorstep in need of treatment, and giving them false information about where Booth and Herold went. He also hid the monogrammed boot that he had cut off Booth's injured leg behind a panel in his attic, but the thorough search of Mudd's house soon revealed this further piece of evidence which was later used against him.\nContradicting the above statement that Booth's boot was only found after a search is the testimony of Lieutenant Alexander Lovett that Mudd turned the boot over to him, saying he had cut it off of Booth's leg. Furthermore, direct trial testimonies of four witnesses during May 17, 1865 report the same thing. The testimonies are as follows:\nOne hypothesis is that Mudd was originally complicit in the kidnapping plot, likely as the person whom the conspirators would have turned to for medical treatment in case Lincoln was injured, and that Booth thus remembered the doctor and went to his house to get help in the early hours of April 15.126-129\nMudd's grandson Richard unsuccessfully tried to clear his grandfather's name of the stigma of aiding Booth. In 1951, he published \"The Mudd Family of the United States\", a two-volume history of the Mudd family beginning with Thomas Mudd, who arrived from England in 1665. A second edition was published in 1969. His papers detailed his attempts to clear his grandfather's name; they were donated to Georgetown University's Lauinger Library after his death in 2002. They are available to the public in the Special Collections Department.\nIn 1992, Representatives Steny Hoyer and Thomas W. Ewing introduced House Bill 1885 to overturn the conviction, but it failed in committee. Mudd then turned to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records, which recommended that the conviction be overturned on the basis that Mudd should have been tried by a civilian court. The recommendation was rejected by Acting Army Assistant Secretary William D. Clark. Mudd attempted several other legal venues, ending in 2003 when the US Supreme Court refused to hear the case because the deadline for filing had been missed.\nThe Dr. Samuel A. Mudd House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The house on the Booth's Escape Scenic Byway is operated today as a historic house museum.\nPortrayals.\nMudd's life was the subject of a 1936 film, \"The Prisoner of Shark Island\", directed by John Ford and scripted by Nunnally Johnson. Mudd was portrayed by Warner Baxter. Film critic Leonard Maltin in his \"Classic Movie Guide\" (2015) described Baxter's performance as \"superb\".\nA radio adaptation of \"The Prisoner of Shark Island\" aired, as an episode of the radio series Lux Radio Theater, with Gary Cooper as Dr.\u00a0Mudd, on May 2, 1938, in which significant dramatic license was used by introducing fictional characters and altering several of the known facts of the case for melodramatic expediency. For example, Fort Jefferson was never called \"Shark Island\".\nAnother production, with the same title, aired on the radio series Encore Theatre in 1946.\nAnother film, \"The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd\", was made in 1980, starring Dennis Weaver as Mudd. All of these productions espoused the point of view that Mudd was essentially innocent of any conspiracy.\nRoger Mudd (1928\u20132021), an Emmy Award-winning journalist, television host and former CBS, NBC, and PBS news anchor, was related to Samuel Mudd, but he was not a descendant, as has mistakenly been reported.\nSamuel Mudd's life was the subject of an episode of the TV western \"Laramie\", \"Time of the Traitor\" which aired in 1962.\nOn the episode \"Swiss Diplomacy\" on \"The West Wing\", the First Lady and cardiac surgeon, Dr. Abby Bartlet commented on the duty of a physician to treat an injured patient despite potential legal repercussions. She responded to Mudd's conviction: \"So that's the way it goes. You set the leg.\"\nSamuel Mudd's name is sometimes given as the origin of the phrase \"your name is mud,\" as in, for example, the 2007 feature film \"\". However, according to an online etymology dictionary, the phrase has its earliest known recorded instance in 1823, ten years before Mudd's birth, and it is based on an obsolete sense of the word \"mud\" meaning \"a stupid twaddling fellow.\"\nMudd was portrayed by Matt Walsh in the 2024 Apple TV+ miniseries series \"Manhunt\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28814", "revid": "13403767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28814", "title": "Secure Shell", "text": "Cryptographic network protocol\nThe Secure Shell Protocol (SSH Protocol) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.\nSSH was designed for Unix-like operating systems as a replacement for Telnet and unsecured remote Unix shell protocols, such as the Berkeley Remote Shell (rsh) and the related rlogin and rexec protocols, which all use insecure, plaintext methods of authentication, such as passwords.\nSince mechanisms like Telnet and Remote Shell are designed to access and operate remote computers, sending the authentication tokens (e.g. username and password) for this access to these computers across a public network in an unsecured way poses a great risk of third parties obtaining the password and achieving the same level of access to the remote system as the telnet user. Secure Shell mitigates this risk through the use of encryption mechanisms that are intended to hide the contents of the transmission from an observer, even if the observer has access to the entire data stream.\nFinnish computer scientist Tatu Yl\u00f6nen designed SSH in 1995 and provided an implementation in the form of two commands, ssh and slogin, as secure replacements for rsh and rlogin, respectively. Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer groups, producing several variants of implementation. The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The most commonly implemented software stack is OpenSSH, released in 1999 as open-source software by the OpenBSD developers. Implementations are distributed for all types of operating systems in common use, including embedded systems.\nSSH applications are based on a client\u2013server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server. SSH operates as a layered protocol suite comprising three principal hierarchical components: the \"transport layer\" provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity; the \"user authentication protocol\" validates the user to the server; and the \"connection protocol\" multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels.\nDefinition.\nSSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary.\nSSH may be used in several methodologies. In the simplest manner, both ends of a communication channel use automatically generated public-private key pairs to encrypt a network connection, and then use a password to authenticate the user.\nWhen the public-private key pair is generated by the user manually, the authentication is essentially performed when the key pair is created, and a session may then be opened automatically without a password prompt. In this scenario, the public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key, which the owner keeps private. While authentication is based on the private key, the key is never transferred through the network during authentication. SSH only verifies that the same person offering the public key also owns the matching private key.\nIn all versions of SSH it is important to verify unknown public keys, i.e. associate the public keys with identities, before accepting them as valid. Accepting an attacker's public key without validation will authorize an unauthorized attacker as a valid user.\nAuthentication: OpenSSH key management.\nOn Unix-like systems, the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user that is allowed to log in remotely, in the file codice_1. This file is respected by SSH only if it is not writable by anything apart from the owner and root. When the public key is present on the remote end and the matching private key is present on the local end, typing in the password is no longer required. However, for additional security the private key itself can be locked with a passphrase.\nThe private key can also be looked for in standard places, and its full path can be specified as a command line setting (the option codice_2 for ssh). The ssh-keygen utility produces the public and private keys, always in pairs.\nUse.\nSSH is typically used to log into a remote computer's shell or command-line interface (CLI) and to execute commands on a remote server. It also supports mechanisms for tunneling, forwarding of TCP ports and X11 connections and it can be used to transfer files using the associated SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).\nSSH uses the client\u2013server model. An SSH client program is typically used for establishing connections to an SSH daemon, such as sshd, accepting remote connections. Both are commonly present on most modern operating systems, including macOS, most distributions of Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and OpenVMS. Notably, versions of Windows prior to Windows 10 version 1709 do not include SSH by default, but proprietary, freeware and open source versions of various levels of complexity and completeness did and do exist (see Comparison of SSH clients). In 2018 Microsoft began porting the OpenSSH source code to Windows and in Windows 10 version 1709, an official Win32 port of OpenSSH is now available.\nFile managers for UNIX-like systems (e.g. Konqueror) can use the FISH protocol to provide a split-pane GUI with drag-and-drop. The open source Windows program WinSCP provides similar file management (synchronization, copy, remote delete) capability using PuTTY as a back-end. Both WinSCP and PuTTY are available packaged to run directly off a USB drive, without requiring installation on the client machine. Crostini on ChromeOS comes with OpenSSH by default. Setting up an SSH server in Windows typically involves enabling a feature in the Settings app.\nSSH is important in cloud computing to solve connectivity problems, avoiding the security issues of exposing a cloud-based virtual machine directly on the Internet. An SSH tunnel can provide a secure path over the Internet, through a firewall to a virtual machine.\nThe IANA has assigned TCP port 22, UDP port 22 and SCTP port 22 for this protocol. IANA had listed the standard TCP port 22 for SSH servers as one of the well-known ports as early as 2001. SSH can also be run using SCTP rather than TCP as the connection oriented transport layer protocol.\nHistorical development.\nVersion 1.\nIn 1995, Tatu Yl\u00f6nen, a researcher at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland designed the first version of the protocol (now called SSH-1) prompted by a password-sniffing attack at his university network. The goal of SSH was to replace the earlier rlogin, TELNET, FTP and rsh protocols, which did not provide strong authentication nor guarantee confidentiality. He chose the port number 22 because it is between codice_3 (port 23) and codice_4 (port 21).\nYl\u00f6nen released his implementation as freeware in July 1995, and the tool quickly gained in popularity. Towards the end of 1995, the SSH user base had grown to 20,000 users in fifty countries.\nIn December 1995, Yl\u00f6nen founded SSH Communications Security to market and develop SSH. The original version of the SSH software used various pieces of free software, such as GNU libgmp, but later versions released by SSH Communications Security evolved into increasingly proprietary software.\nIt was estimated that by 2000 the number of users had grown to 2 million.\nVersion 2.\nIn 2006, after being discussed in a working group named \"secsh\", a revised version of the SSH protocol, SSH-2 was adopted as a standard. This version offers improved security and new features, but is not compatible with SSH-1. For example, it introduces new key-exchange mechanisms like Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, improved data integrity checking via message authentication codes like MD5 or SHA-1, which can be negotiated between client and server. SSH-2 also adds stronger encryption methods like AES which eventually replaced weaker and compromised ciphers from the previous standard like 3DES. New features of SSH-2 include the ability to run any number of shell sessions over a single SSH connection. Due to SSH-2's superiority and popularity over SSH-1, some implementations such as libssh (v0.8.0+), Lsh and Dropbear eventually supported only the SSH-2 protocol.\nVersion 1.99.\nIn January 2006, well after version 2.1 was established, specified that an SSH server supporting 2.0 as well as prior versions should identify its protocol version as 1.99. This version number does not reflect a historical software revision, but a method to identify backward compatibility.\nOSSH and OpenSSH.\nIn 1999, developers, desiring availability of a free software version, restarted software development from the 1.2.12 release of the original SSH program, which was the last released under an open source license. This served as a code base for Bj\u00f6rn Gr\u00f6nvall's OSSH software. Shortly thereafter, OpenBSD developers forked Gr\u00f6nvall's code and created OpenSSH, which shipped with Release 2.6 of OpenBSD. From this version, a \"portability\" branch was formed to port OpenSSH to other operating systems.\nAs of 2005[ [update]], OpenSSH was the single most popular SSH implementation, being the default version in a large number of operating system distributions. OSSH meanwhile has become obsolete. OpenSSH continues to be maintained and supports the SSH-2 protocol, having expunged SSH-1 support from the codebase in the OpenSSH 7.6 release.\nFuture.\nIn 2023, an alternative to traditional SSH was proposed under the name SSH3 by PhD student Fran\u00e7ois Michel and Professor Olivier Bonaventure and its code has been made open source. This new version implements the original SSH Connection Protocol but operates on top of HTTP/3, which runs on QUIC. It offers multiple features such as:\nHowever, the name SSH3 is under discussion, and the project aims to rename itself to a more suitable name. The discussion stems from the fact that this new implementation significantly revises the SSH protocol, suggesting it should not be called SSH3.\nUses.\nSSH is a protocol that can be used for many applications across many platforms including most Unix variants (Linux, the BSDs including Apple's macOS, and Solaris), as well as Microsoft Windows. Some of the applications below may require features that are only available or compatible with specific SSH clients or servers. For example, using the SSH protocol to implement a VPN is possible, but presently only with the OpenSSH server and client implementation.\nFile transfer protocols.\nThe Secure Shell protocols are used in several file transfer mechanisms.\nArchitecture.\nThe SSH protocol has a layered architecture with three separate components:\nThis open architecture provides considerable flexibility, allowing the use of SSH for a variety of purposes beyond a secure shell. The functionality of the transport layer alone is comparable to Transport Layer Security (TLS); the user-authentication layer is highly extensible with custom authentication methods; and the connection layer provides the ability to multiplex many secondary sessions into a single SSH connection, a feature comparable to BEEP and not available in TLS.\nVulnerabilities.\nSSH-1.\nIn 1998, a vulnerability was described in SSH 1.5 which allowed the unauthorized insertion of content into an encrypted SSH stream due to insufficient data integrity protection from CRC-32 used in this version of the protocol. A fix known as SSH Compensation Attack Detector was introduced into most implementations. Many of these updated implementations contained a new integer overflow vulnerability that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH daemon, typically root.\nIn January 2001 a vulnerability was discovered that allows attackers to modify the last block of an IDEA-encrypted session. The same month, another vulnerability was discovered that allowed a malicious server to forward a client authentication to another server.\nSince SSH-1 has inherent design flaws which make it vulnerable, it is now generally considered obsolete and should be avoided by explicitly disabling fallback to SSH-1. Most modern servers and clients support SSH-2.\nCBC plaintext recovery.\nIn November 2008, a theoretical vulnerability was discovered for all versions of SSH which allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was encrypted using what was then the standard default encryption mode, CBC. The most straightforward solution is to use CTR, counter mode, instead of CBC mode, since this renders SSH resistant to the attack.\nSuspected decryption by NSA.\nOn December 28, 2014 \"Der Spiegel\" published classified information leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden which suggests that the National Security Agency may be able to decrypt some SSH traffic. The technical details associated with such a process were not disclosed. A 2017 analysis of the CIA hacking tools \"BothanSpy\" and \"Gyrfalcon\" suggested that the SSH protocol was not compromised.\nTerrapin attack.\nA novel man-in-the-middle attack against most current ssh implementations was discovered in 2023. It was named the Terrapin attack by its discoverers. However, the risk is mitigated by the requirement to intercept a genuine ssh session, and that the attack is restricted in its scope, fortuitously resulting mostly in failed connections. The ssh developers have stated that the major impact of the attack is to degrade the keystroke timing obfuscation features of ssh. The vulnerability was fixed in OpenSSH 9.6, but requires both client and server to be upgraded for the fix to be fully effective.\nStandards documentation.\nThe following RFC publications by the IETF \"secsh\" working group document SSH-2 as a proposed Internet standard.\nThe protocol specifications were later updated by the following publications:\nIn addition, the OpenSSH project includes several vendor protocol specifications/extensions:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was one of the first catchphrases from the series to enter the general lexicon.\nOrigin.\nThe death (on November 20, 1975) of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco during the first season of \"NBC's Saturday Night\" originated the phrase. Franco's presumed imminent death had been a headline story on NBC News and other news organizations for several weeks. On slow news days, United States network television newscasters sometimes noted that Franco was still alive.\nFollowing Franco's death, Chevy Chase, host of \"NBC's Saturday Night\"'s comedic news segment \"Weekend Update\", announced Franco's death and read a statement from former president Richard Nixon: \"General Franco was a loyal friend and ally of the United States. He earned worldwide respect for Spain through firmness and fairness.\" As an ironic counterpoint to this, a picture was displayed behind Chase, showing Franco giving the Nazi salute alongside Adolf Hitler.\nIn subsequent weeks, Chase developed the joke into a parody of the earlier news coverage of Franco's illness, treating his death as the top story. \"This breaking news just in\", Chase would announce\u00a0\u2013 \"Generalissimo Francisco Franco is \"still\" dead!\" Occasionally, Chase would change the wording slightly in attempts to keep the joke fresh, e.g. \"Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still valiantly holding on in his fight to remain dead.\" The joke was sometimes combined with another running gag in which Garrett Morris, \"head of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing\" would cup his hands around his mouth and shout the news as Chase read it. The gag ran until early 1977, with occasional callbacks in later seasons.\nLegacy.\nThe phrase has remained in use since Franco's death. James Taranto's \"Best of the Web Today\" column at OpinionJournal.com used the phrase as a tag for newspaper headlines that indicate something is still happening when it should be obvious. On February 8, 2007, during Jack Cafferty's segment on CNN's \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\" on the day of her death, he asked the host: \"Is Anna Nicole Smith still dead, Wolf?\" It was also used now and then on \"NBC News Overnight\" in the early 1980s, and Keith Olbermann occasionally used it on \"Countdown\". In 2013, it experienced a brief resurgence in a different context, when it began appearing on social media a few days after the death of Spanish filmmaker Jes\u00fas Franco.\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" used the headline \"General\u00edsimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead\u00a0\u2013 And His Statues Are Next\" on its front page March 2, 2009. The newspaper used it once again on its front page in the headline \"General\u00edsimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead\u00a0\u2013 But for some not dead enough\" on August 21, 2015, when it reported about critics calling to enforce a 2007 anti-Franco law in Madrid and to rename streets and plazas, after the last election had ended the 24-year reign of conservatives in the city council.\nAlthough \"SNL\"'s use is the most widely known, it is predated by the \"'John Garfield Still Dead' syndrome,\" which originated as a result of extensive coverage in the wake of actor John Garfield's death and funeral in 1952.\nAfter a brief \"in memoriam\" during \"SNL\"'s 40th Anniversary Special on February 15, 2015, Bill Murray ended the segment with the famous phrase which \"just came in from Spain.\"\nThe phrase is listed in \"The Oxford Dictionary of Catchphrases\".\nReferences.\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed his musicianship to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records.\nIssued at the start of the Great Depression, the records did not sell and did not lead to national recognition. Locally, House remained popular, and in the 1930s, together with Patton's associate Willie Brown, he was the leading musician of Coahoma County. There he was a formative influence on Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. In 1941 and 1942, House and the members of his band were recorded by Alan Lomax and John W. Work for the Library of Congress and Fisk University. The following year, he left the Delta for Rochester, New York, and gave up music.\nIn 1964, House was rediscovered and encouraged to return to music by figures such as Alan Wilson, co-founder of the band Canned Heat. The following year, House released \"Father of Folk Blues\" (1965). He relearned his repertoire and established a career as an entertainer, performing for young, mostly white audiences in coffeehouses, at folk festivals and on concert tours during the American folk music revival, billed as a \"folk blues\" singer. He recorded several albums and some informally taped concerts have also been issued as albums. In 2017, his single \"Preachin' the Blues\" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHouse was born in the hamlet of Lyon, north of Clarksdale, Mississippi, the second of three brothers, and lived in the rural Mississippi Delta until his parents separated when he was about seven or eight years old. His father, Eddie House Sr., was a musician, playing the tuba in a band with his brothers and sometimes playing the guitar. He was a church member but also a drinker; he left the church for a time as a result of his drinking, but then gave up alcohol and became a Baptist deacon. Young Eddie House adopted the family commitment to religion and churchgoing. He also absorbed the family love of music but confined himself to singing, showing no interest in the family instrumental band, and hostile to the blues on religious grounds.\nWhen House's parents separated, his mother took him to Tallulah, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi. When he was in his early teens, they moved to Algiers, New Orleans. Recalling these years, he would later speak of his hatred of blues and his passion for churchgoing (he described himself as \"churchy\" and \"churchified\"). At fifteen, while living in Algiers, he began preaching sermons.\nAt the age of nineteen, while living in the Delta, he married Carrie Martin, an older woman from New Orleans. This was a significant step for House; he married in church and against family opposition. The couple moved to her hometown of Centerville, Louisiana to help run her father's farm. After a couple of years, feeling used and disillusioned, House recalled, \"I left her hanging on the gatepost, with her father tellin' me to come back so we could plow some more.\" Around the same time, House's mother died. In later years, he was still angry about his marriage and said of Carrie, \"She wasn't nothin' but one of them New Orleans whores\".\nHouse's resentment of farming extended to the many menial jobs he took as a young adult. He moved frequently, on one occasion taking off to East Saint Louis to work in a steel plant. The one job he enjoyed was on a Louisiana horse ranch, which later he celebrated by wearing a cowboy hat in his performances. He found an escape from manual labor when, following a conversion experience (\"getting religion\") in his early twenties, he was accepted as a paid pastor, first in the Baptist Church and then in the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. However, he fell into habits that conflicted with his calling, drinking like his father and also womanizing. This led him, after several years of conflict, to leave the church, ceasing his full-time commitment although he continued to preach sermons from time to time.\nBlues performer.\nIn 1927, at the age of 25, House underwent a change of musical perspective as rapid and dramatic as a religious conversion. In a hamlet south of Clarksdale, he heard one of his drinking companions, either James McCoy or Willie Wilson (his recollections differed), playing bottleneck guitar, a style he had never heard before. He immediately changed his attitude about the blues, bought a guitar from a musician called Frank Hoskins and within weeks was playing with Hoskins, McCoy and Wilson. Two songs he learned from McCoy would later be among his best known, \"My Black Mama\" and \"Preachin' the Blues\". Another source of inspiration was Rube Lacey, a much better known performer who had recorded for Columbia Records in 1927 (no titles were released) and for Paramount Records in 1928 (two titles were released). In an astonishingly short time, with only these four musicians as models, House developed to a professional standard a blues style based on his religious singing and simple bottleneck guitar style.\nAround 1927 or 1928, he had been playing in a juke joint when a man went on a shooting spree, wounding House in the leg, and he allegedly shot the man dead. House received a 15-year sentence at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman Farm), of which he served two years between 1928 and 1929. He credited his re-examination and release to an appeal by his family, but also spoke of the intervention by the influential white planter for whom they worked. The date of the killing and the duration of his sentence are unclear; House gave different accounts to different interviewers, and searches by his biographer Daniel Beaumont found no details in the court records of Coahoma County or in the archive of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.\nUpon his release in 1929 or early 1930, House was strongly advised to leave Clarksdale and stay away. He walked to Jonestown and caught a train to the small town of Lula, Mississippi, sixteen miles north of Clarksdale and eight miles from the blues hub of Helena, Arkansas.\nCharley Patton.\nCoincidentally, the great star of Delta blues, Charley Patton, was also in virtual exile in Lula, having been expelled from his base on the Dockery Plantation. With his sideman Willie Brown, Patton dominated the local market for professional blues performance. Patton watched House busking when he arrived penniless at Lula station, but did not approach him. He observed House's showmanship attracting a crowd to the caf\u00e9 and bootleg whiskey business of a woman called Sara Knight. Patton invited House to be a regular musical partner with him and Brown. House formed a liaison with Knight, and both musicians profited from association with her bootlegging activities. The musical partnership is disputed by Patton's biographers Stephen Calt and Gayle Dean Wardlow. They consider that House's musicianship was too limited to play with Patton and Brown, who were also rumoured to be estranged at the time. They also cite one statement by House that he did not play for dances in Lula. Beaumont concluded that House became a friend of Patton's, traveling with him to gigs but playing separately.\nRecording.\nIn 1930, Art Laibly of Paramount Records traveled to Lula to persuade Patton to record several more sides in Grafton, Wisconsin. Along with Patton came House, Brown, and the pianist Louise Johnson, all of whom recorded sides for the label. House recorded nine songs during that session, eight of which were released, but they were commercial failures. He did not record again commercially for 35 years, but he continued to play with Patton and Brown, and with Brown after Patton's death in 1934. During this time, House worked as a tractor driver for various plantations in the Lake Cormorant area.\nAlan Lomax recorded House for the Library of Congress in 1941. Willie Brown, the mandolin player Fiddlin' Joe Martin, and the harmonica player Leroy Williams played with House on these recordings. Lomax returned to the area in 1942, where he recorded House once more.\nHouse then faded from the public view, moving to Rochester, New York, in 1943, and working as a railroad porter for the New York Central Railroad and as a chef.\nRediscovery.\nIn 1964, after a long search of the Mississippi Delta region by Nick Perls, Dick Waterman and Phil Spiro, House was \"rediscovered\" in Rochester, New York, working at a train station. He had been retired from the music business for many years and was unaware of the 1960s folk blues revival and international enthusiasm for his early recordings.\nHe subsequently toured extensively in the United States and Europe and recorded for CBS Records. Like Mississippi John Hurt, he was welcomed into the music scene of the 1960s and played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964, the New York Folk Festival in July 1965, and the October 1967 European tour of the American Folk Festival, along with Skip James and Bukka White.\nThe young guitarist Alan Wilson (later of Canned Heat) was a fan of House's. The producer John Hammond asked Wilson, who was just 22 years old, to teach \"Son House how to play like Son House,\" because Wilson had such a good knowledge of blues styles. House subsequently recorded the album \"Father of Folk Blues\", later reissued as a 2-CD set \"Father of Delta Blues: The Complete 1965 Sessions\". House performed with Wilson live, as can be heard on \"Levee Camp Moan\" on the album \"John the Revelator: The 1970 London Sessions\".\nHouse appeared in Seattle on March 19, 1968, arranged by the Seattle Folklore Society. The concert was recorded by Bob West and issued on Acola Records as a CD in 2006. The Arcola CD also included an interview of House recorded on November 15, 1969 in Seattle.\nIn the summer of 1970, House toured Europe once again, including an appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival; a recording of his London concerts was released by Liberty Records. He also played at the Two Days of Blues Festival in Toronto in 1974. On an appearance on the TV arts show \"Camera Three\", he was accompanied by the blues guitarist Buddy Guy.\nIll health plagued House in his later years, and in 1974 he retired once again. He later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he remained until his death from cancer of the larynx. He had been married five times and had two daughters, Beatrice and Sally. He was buried at the Mt. Hazel Cemetery. Members of the Detroit Blues Society raised money through benefit concerts to put a monument on his grave.\nHonors.\nIn 2007, House was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Tunica, Mississippi.\nIn 2017, his single \"Preachin' the Blues\" was inducted in to the Blues Hall of Fame.\nDiscography.\n78-RPM recordings\nRecorded in August 1930, in Grafton, Wisconsin, for Paramount Records\nRecordings for Library of Congress and Fisk University\nRecorded August 1941, at Clack Store, Lake Cormorant, Mississippi.\nThere are some railway noises in the background on some titles, as the store (which had electricity necessary for the recording) was close to a branch line between Lake Cormorant and Robinsonville.\nRecorded July 17, 1942, Robinsonville, Mississippi\nThe music from both sessions and most of the recorded interviews have been reissued on LP and CD.\nSingles\nOther albums\nThis list is incomplete.

{"id": "28822", "revid": "6046731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28822", "title": "Sex worker", "text": "Person who works in the sex industry\nA sex worker is a person who provides sex work, either on a regular or occasional basis. The term is used in reference to those who work in all areas of the sex industry. According to one view, sex work is voluntary \"and is seen as the commercial exchange of sex for money or goods\". Thus it differs from sexual exploitation, or the forcing of a person to commit sexual acts.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"sex worker\" was coined in 1978 by sex worker activist Carol Leigh. Its use became popularized after publication of the anthology, \"Sex Work: Writings By Women In The Sex Industry\" in 1987, edited by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Delacoste and Priscilla Alexander. The term \"sex worker\" has since spread into much wider use, including in academic publications, by NGOs and labor unions, and by governmental and intergovernmental agencies, such as the World Health Organization. The term is listed in the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster's Dictionary.\nThe term \"sex worker\" is used by some types of sex workers (i.e. prostitutes) to avoid invoking the stigma associated with the word \"prostitute\". Using the term \"sex worker\" rather than \"prostitute\" also allows more members of the sex industry to be represented and helps ensure that individuals who are actually prostitutes are not singled out and associated with the negative connotations of \"prostitute\". In addition, choosing to use the term \"sex worker\" rather than \"prostitute\" shows ownership over the individuals' career choices. Some argue that those who prefer the term \"sex worker\" wish to separate their occupation from their person. Describing someone as a sex worker recognizes that the individual may have many different facets, and are not necessarily defined by their job.\nThe term is strongly opposed, however, by many who are morally or politically opposed to the sex industry, such as social conservatives, anti-prostitution feminists, and other prohibitionists. Such groups view prostitution variously as a crime or as victimization, and see the term \"sex work\" as legitimizing criminal activity or exploitation as a type of labor.\nIn practice.\nSex work can take the form of prostitution, stripping or lap dancing, performance in pornography, phone or internet sex, or any other exchange of sexual services for financial or material gain. Sex workers who include sexual intercourse as part of their services are considered full-service sex workers. The variety in the tasks encompassed by sex work leads to a large range in both severity and nature of risks that sex workers face in their occupations. Sex workers can act independently as individuals, work for a company or corporation, or work as part of a brothel. All of the above can be undertaken either by free choice or by coercion, or, as some argue, along a continuum between conflict and agency. Sex workers may also be hired to be companions on a trip or to perform sexual services within the context of a trip; either of these can be voluntary or forced labor.\nMotivations.\nSex workers may be any gender and exchange sexual services or favors for money or other gifts. The motives of sex workers vary widely and can include debt, coercion, survival, or simply as a way to earn a living. Sexual empowerment is another possible reason why people engage in sex work. One Canadian study found that a quarter of the sex workers interviewed started sex work because they found it \"appealing\". The flexibility to choose hours of work and the ability to select one's own client base may also contribute to the appeal of sex work when compared to other service industry jobs. Sex work may also be a way to fund addiction. This line of work can be fueled by an individual's addiction to illegal substances before entering the industry or being introduced to these substances after entering the industry.\nFor camming services, motivations can vary when engaging in sex with real-life versus virtual partners. A 2023 study found that sex workers providing camming services were more likely to engage in sex with virtual partners for resources and specific types of sexual experiences (e.g., kink). In contrast, they engaged in sex more often with real-life partners for physical pleasure, motivated by the physical desirability of their partner, and to express love and commitment. However, for many other motivations, such as stress reduction, self-esteem boost, emotional expression, or utilitarian reasons, there were no significant differences in frequency of engagement with real-life versus virtual partners.\nThese motives also align with varying climates surrounding sex work in different communities and cultures. In some cases, sex work is linked to tourism. \nDemographics.\nTransgender people are more likely than the general population to do sex work, particularly trans women and trans people of color. In a study of female Indian sex workers, illiteracy and lower social status were more prevalent than among the general female population.\nOne study of sex work in Tijuana, Mexico, found that the majority of sex workers there are young, female, and heterosexual. Many of these studies attempt to use smaller samples of sex workers and pimps in order to extrapolate about larger populations of sex workers. One report on the underground sex trade in the United States used known data on the illegal drug and weapon trades and interviews with sex workers and pimps in order to draw conclusions about the number of sex workers in eight American cities. However, studies like this one can come under scrutiny for a perceived emphasis on the activities and perspectives of pimps and other sex work managers rather than those of sex work providers themselves. Another criticism is that sex trafficking may not be adequately assessed in relation to sex work in these studies.\nMany studies struggle to gain demographic information about the prevalence of sex work, as many countries or cities have laws prohibiting prostitution or other sex work. In addition, sex trafficking, or forced sex work, is also difficult to quantify due to its underground and covert nature. In addition, finding a representative sample of sex workers in a given city can be nearly impossible because the size of the population itself is unknown. Maintaining privacy and confidentiality in research is also difficult because many sex workers may face prosecution and other consequences if their identities are revealed.\nDiscrimination.\nSex workers may be stereotyped as deviant, hypersexual, sexually risky, and substance abusive. Sex workers may cope with this stigmatization in ways such as hiding their occupation from non-sex workers, social withdrawal, and creating a false self to perform at work. Sex-work-related stigma may help perpetuate rape culture and can lead to slut-shaming. \nAmong sex workers women were found overrepresented compared to gender parity.\nSex work is also often conflated with sex trafficking, despite the fact that most sex workers choose to consensually engage in the sex trade. For example, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act in the United States was passed to ostensibly protect victims of sex trafficking but included language making it illegal to advertise consensual sex online. Such laws have a significantly negative impact on sex workers.\nGlobally, sex workers encounter barriers in accessing health care, legislation, legal resources, and labor rights. In a study of U.S. sex workers, 43% of interview participants reported exposure to intimate partner violence, physical violence, armed physical violence, and sexual violence in the forms of sexual coercion and rape. In this same study, a sex worker reported, \"in this lifestyle, nothing's safe\". Sex workers may experience police abuse as well, as the police may use their authority to intimidate sex workers. Police officers in some countries have been reported to exploit street-based sex workers' fear of incarceration to force them to have sex with the police without payment, sometimes still arresting them after having coerced sex. Police may also compromise sex workers' safety, often holding sex workers responsible for crimes perpetrated against them because of the stigma attached to their occupation. There is growth in advocacy organizations to reduce and erase prejudice and stigma against sex work, and to provide more support and resources for sex workers.\nLegal dimensions of sex work.\nDepending on local law, sex workers' activities may be regulated, controlled, tolerated, or prohibited. In most countries, even those where sex work is legal, sex workers may be stigmatized and marginalized, which may prevent them from seeking legal redress for discrimination (e.g., racial discrimination by a strip club owner), non-payment by a client, assault or rape. Sex worker advocates have identified this as whorephobia.\nThe legality of different types of sex work varies within and between regions of the world. For example, while pornography is legal in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most parts of the US. However, in other regions of the world, both pornography and prostitution are illegal; in others, both are legal. One example of a country in which pornography, prostitution, and all professions encompassed under the umbrella of sex work are all legal is New Zealand. Under the Prostitution Reform Act of New Zealand, laws and regulations have been put into place in order to ensure the safety and protection of its sex workers. For example, since the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act, \"any person seeking to open a larger brothel, where more than four sex workers will be working requires a Brothel Operators Certificate, which certifies them as a suitable person to exercise control over sex workers in the workplace. [In addition,] sex workers operating in managed premises have access to labour rights and human rights protection and can pursue claims before the courts, like any other worker or employee.\" In regions where sex work is illegal, advocates for sex workers' rights argue that the covert nature of illegal prostitution is a barrier to access to legal resources. However, some who oppose the legalization of prostitution argue that sex work is inherently exploitative and can never be legalized or practiced in a way that respects the rights of those who perform it.\nThere are many arguments against legalizing prostitution/sex work. In one study, women involved in sex work were interviewed and asked if they thought it should be made legal. They answered that they thought it should not, as it would put women at higher risk from violent customers if it were considered legitimate work, and they would not want their friends or family entering the sex industry to earn money. Another argument is that legalizing sex work would increase the demand for it, and women should not be treated as sexual merchandise. A study showed that in countries that have legalized prostitution, there was an increase in human trafficking. The studies also showed that legalizing sex work led to an increase in sex trafficking, which is another reason people give for making sex work illegal. An argument against legalizing sex work is to keep children from being involved in this industry. Children who have been exploited suffer long-term negative consequences.\nThere are also arguments for legalizing prostitution/sex work. One major argument for legalizing prostitution is that women should have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. The government should not have a say in what they do for work, and if they want to sell their bodies it is their own decision. Another common argument for legalizing prostitution is that enforcing prostitution laws is a waste of money. Some believe prostitution will continue to persist despite whatever laws and regulations are implemented against it. In arguing for the decriminalization of sex work, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands expanded upon this argument in court when stating that, \"prostitution has existed for a long time and will continue to do so\u2026Prohibition is not the way to proceed\u2026One should allow for voluntary prostitution. The authorities can then regulate prostitution, [and] it can become healthy, safe, transparent, and cleansed from criminal side-effects.\" People who wish to legalize prostitution do not see enforcing laws against sex work as effective and think the money is better spent elsewhere. Many people also argue that legalization of prostitution will lead to less harm for the sex workers. They argue that the decriminalization of sex work will decrease the exploitation of sex workers by third parties such as pimps and managers. A final argument for the legalization of sex work is that prostitution laws are unconstitutional. Some argue that these laws go against people's rights to free speech and privacy.\nRisk reduction.\nRisk reduction in sex work is a highly debated topic. \"Abolitionism\" and \"nonabolitionism\" or \"empowerment\" are regarded as opposing ways in which risk reduction is approached. While abolitionism would call for an end to all sex work, empowerment would encourage the formation of networks among sex workers and enable them to prevent STIs and other health risks by communicating with each other. Both approaches aim to reduce rates of disease and other negative effects of sex work.\nIn addition, sex workers themselves have disputed the dichotomous nature of abolitionism and nonabolitionism, advocating instead a focus on sex workers' rights. In 1999, the Network of Sex Worker Projects claimed that historically, anti-trafficking measures have been more concerned with protecting 'innocent' women from becoming prostitutes than with ensuring the human rights of those in the sex industry. Penelope Saunders, a sex workers' rights advocate, claims that the sex workers' rights approach considers more of the historical context of sex work than either abolitionism or empowerment. In addition, Jo Doezema has written that the dichotomy of the voluntary and forced approaches to sex work has served to deny sex workers agency.\nHealth.\nSex workers are unlikely to disclose their work to healthcare providers. This can be due to embarrassment, fear of disapproval, or a disbelief that sex work can have effects on their health. The criminalization of sex work in many places can also lead to a reluctance to disclose for fear of being turned in for illegal activities. There are very few legal protections for sex workers due to criminalization; thus, in many cases, a sex worker reporting violence to a healthcare provider may not be able to take legal action against their aggressor.\nHealth risks of sex work relate primarily to sexually transmitted infections and to drug use. In one study, nearly 40% of sex workers who visited a health center reported illegal drug use. In general, transgender women sex workers have a higher risk of contracting HIV than cisgender male and female sex workers and transgender women who are not sex workers.\nThe reason transgender women are at higher risk for developing HIV is their combination of risk factors. They face biological, personal, relational, and structural risks that all increase their chances of getting HIV. Biological factors include incorrect condom usage because of erectile dysfunction from hormones taken to become more feminine and receptive anal intercourse without a condom which is a high risk for developing HIV. Personal factors include mental health issues that lead to increased sexual risk, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse provoked through lack of support, violence, etc. Structural risks include involvement in sex work being linked to poverty, substance abuse, and other factors that are more prevalent in transgender women based on their tendency to be socially marginalized and not accepted for challenging gender norms. The largest risk for HIV is unprotected sex with male partners, and studies have been emerging that show men who have sex with transgender women are more likely to use drugs than men that do not.\nCondom use is one way to mitigate the risk of contracting an STI. However, negotiating condom use with one's clients and partners is often an obstacle to practicing safer sex. While there is not much data on rates of violence against sex workers, many sex workers do not use condoms due to the fear of resistance and violence from clients. Some countries also have laws prohibiting condom possession; this reduces the likelihood that sex workers will use condoms. Increased organization and networking among sex workers has been shown to increase condom use by increasing access to and education about STI prevention. Brothels with strong workplace health practices, including the availability of condoms, have also increased condom use among their workers.\nHealth concerns of exotic dancers.\nIn order to protect themselves from the stigma of sex work, many dancers resort to othering themselves. Othering involves constructing oneself as superior to one's peers, and the dancer persona provides an internal boundary that separates the \"authentic\" from the stripper self. This practice creates a significant amount of stress for the dancers, in turn leading many to resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope. Since it is so widespread, the use of drugs has become normalized in the exotic dance scene. \nDespite this normalization, passing as nonusers, or covering as users of less maligned drugs, is necessary. This is because strippers concurrently attribute a strong moral constitution to those that resist the drug atmosphere; it is a testament to personal strength and willpower. It is also an occasion for dancers to \"other\" fellow strippers. Valorizing resistance to the drug space discursively positions \"good\" strippers against such a drug locale and indicates why dancers are motivated to closet hard drug use.Stigma causes strippers to hide their lifestyles from friends and family alienating themselves from a support system. Further, the stress of trying to hide their lifestyles from others due to fear of scrutiny affects the mental health of dancers.\nForced sex work.\nForced sex work is when an individual enters into any sex trade due to coercion rather than by choice. Forced sex work increases the likelihood that a sex worker will contract HIV/AIDS or another sexually transmitted infection, particularly when an individual enters sex work before the age of 18. In addition, even when sex workers do consent to certain sex acts, they are often forced or coerced into others (often anal intercourse) by clients. Sex workers may also experience strong resistance to condom use by their clients, which may extend into a lack of consent by the worker to any sexual act performed in the encounter; this risk is magnified when sex workers are trafficked or forced into sex work.\nForced sex work often involves deception - workers are told that they can make a living and are then not allowed to leave. This deception can cause ill effects on the mental health of many sex workers. In addition, an assessment of studies estimates that between 40% and 70% of sex workers face violence within a year. Currently, there is little support for migrant workers in many countries, including those who have been trafficked to a location for sex.\nAdvocacy.\nSex worker's rights advocates argue that sex workers should have the same basic human and labor rights as other working people. For example, the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work. Advocates also want to see changes in legal practices involving sex work, the Red Umbrella Project has pushed for the decriminalization of condoms and changes to New York's sex workers diversion program. Advocacy for the interests of sex workers can come from a variety of sources, including non-governmental organizations, labor rights organizations, governments, or sex workers themselves. In Latin America and the Caribbean, sex worker advocacy dates back to the late 19th century in Havana, Cuba. A catalyst in the movement being a newspaper published by Havana sex workers. This publication went by the name \"La Cebolla\", created by Las Horizontales. Each year in London, The Sexual Freedom Awards is held to honor the most notable advocates and pioneers of sexual freedom and sex workers' rights in the UK, where sex work is essentially legal.\nUnionization of sex work.\nThe unionization of sex workers is a recent development. The first organization within the contemporary sex workers' rights movement was Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics (COYOTE), founded in 1973 in San Francisco, California. Many organizations in Western countries were established in the decade after the founding of COYOTE. Currently, a small number of sex worker unions exist worldwide. One of the largest is the International Union of Sex Workers, headquartered in the United Kingdom. The IUSW advocates for the rights of all sex workers, whether they chose freely or were coerced to enter the trade, and promotes policies that benefit the interests of sex workers both in the UK and abroad. Many regions are home to sex worker unions, including Latin America, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Africa.\nIn unionizing, many sex workers face issues relating to communication and to the legality of sex work. Because sex work is illegal in many places where they wish to organize, it is difficult to communicate with other sex workers in order to organize. There is also concern with the legitimacy of sex work as a career and an activity that merits formal organizing, largely because of the sexism often present in sex work and the devaluation of sex work as not comparable to other paid labor and employment.\nA factor affecting the unionization of sex work is that many sex workers belong to populations that historically have not had a strong representation in labor unions. While this unionization can be viewed as a way of empowering sex workers and granting them agency within their profession, it is also criticized as implicitly lending its approval to sexism and power imbalances already present in sex work. Unionization also implies a submission to or operation within the systems of capitalism, which is of concern to some feminists.\nUnionizing exotic dancers.\nPerformers in general are problematic to categorize because they often exercise a high level of control over their work product, one characteristic of an independent contractor. Additionally, their work can be artistic in nature and often done on a freelance basis. Often, the work of performers does not possess the obvious attributes of employees such as regular working hours, places, or duties. Consequently, employers misclassify them because they are unsure of their workers' status, or they purposely misclassify them to take advantage of independent contractors' low costs. Exotic dance clubs are one such employer that purposely misclassifies their performers as independent contractors.\nThere are additional hurdles in terms of self-esteem and commitment to unionize. On the most basic level, dancers themselves must have the desire to unionize for collective action. For those who wish not to conform to group activity or want to remain independent, a union may seem as controlling as club management since joining a union would obligate them to pay dues and abide by decisions made through majority vote, with or without their personal approval.\nIn the \"Lusty Lady\" case study, this strip club was the first all-woman-managed club to successfully unionize in 1996. Some of the working conditions they were able to address included \"protest[ing] racist hiring practices, customers being allowed to videotape dancers without their consent via one-way mirrors, inconsistent disciplinary policies, lack of health benefits, and an overall dearth of job security\". Unionizing exotic dancers can certainly bring better work conditions and fair pay, but it is difficult to do at times because of their dubious employee categorization. Also, as is the case with many other unions, dancers are often reluctant to join them. This reluctance can be due to many factors, ranging from the cost of joining a union to the dancers believing they do not need union support because they will not be exotic dancers for a long enough period of time to justify joining a union.\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nNGOs often play a large role in outreach to sex workers, particularly in HIV and STI prevention efforts. However, NGO outreach to sex workers for HIV prevention is sometimes less coordinated and organized than similar HIV prevention programs targeted at different groups (such as men who have sex with men). This lack of organization may be due to the legal status of prostitution and other sex work in the country in question; in China, many sex work and drug abuse NGOs do not formally register with the government and thus run many of their programs on a small scale and discreetly.\nWhile some NGOs have increased their programming to improve conditions within the context of sex work, these programs are criticized at times due to their failure to dismantle the oppressive structures of prostitution, particularly forced trafficking. Some scholars believe that advocating for rights within the institution of prostitution is not enough; rather, programs that seek to empower sex workers must empower them to leave sex work as well as improve their rights within the context of sex work.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

He was a major French Symbolist poet, and his work anticipated and inspired several revolutionary artistic schools of the early 20th century, such as Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism.\nBiography.\nMallarm\u00e9 was born in Paris on 18 March 1842. He was a boarder at the \"Pensionnat des Fr\u00e8res des \u00e9coles chr\u00e9tiennes \u00e0 Passy\" between 6 or 9 October 1852 and March 1855. He worked as an English teacher and spent much of his life in relative poverty but was famed for his \"salons\", occasional gatherings of intellectuals at his house on the rue de Rome for discussions of poetry, art and philosophy. The group became known as \"les Mardistes,\" because they met on Tuesdays (in French, \"mardi\"), and through it Mallarm\u00e9 exerted considerable influence on the work of a generation of writers. For many years, those sessions, where Mallarm\u00e9 held court as judge, jester and king, were considered the heart of Paris intellectual life. Regular visitors included W. B. Yeats, Rainer Maria Rilke, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Stefan George, Paul Verlaine and many others. Along with other members of \"La Revue Blanche\" such as Jules Renard, Julien Benda and Ioannis Psycharis, Mallarm\u00e9 was a Dreyfusard.\nOn 10 August 1863, he married Maria Christina Gerhard. They had two children, Genevi\u00e8ve in 1864 and Anatole in 1871. Anatole died in 1879. Mallarm\u00e9 died in Valvins (present-day Vulaines-sur-Seine), near Fontainebleau, on September 9, 1898.\nStyle.\nMallarm\u00e9's earlier work owes a great deal to the style of Charles Baudelaire who was recognised as the forerunner of literary Symbolism. Mallarm\u00e9's later \"fin de si\u00e8cle\" style, on the other hand, anticipates many of the fusions between poetry and the other arts that were to blossom in the next century. Most of this later work explored the relationship between content and form, between the text and the arrangement of words and spaces on the page. This is particularly evident in his last major poem, \"Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n'abolira le hasard\" ('A roll of the dice will never abolish chance') of 1897.\nSome consider Mallarm\u00e9 one of the French poets most difficult to translate into English. The difficulty is due in part to the complex, multilayered nature of much of his work, but also to the important role that the sound of the words, rather than their meaning, plays in his poetry. When recited in French, his poems allow alternative meanings which are not evident on reading the work on the page. For example, Mallarm\u00e9's \"Sonnet en '-yx\"' opens with the phrase \"ses purs ongles\" ('her pure nails'), whose first syllables when spoken aloud sound very similar to the words \"c'est pur son\" ('it's pure sound'). Indeed, the 'pure sound' aspect of his poetry has been the subject of musical analysis and has inspired musical compositions. These phonetic ambiguities are very difficult to reproduce in a translation which must be faithful to the meaning of the words.\nInfluence.\nGeneral poetry.\nMallarm\u00e9's poetry has been the inspiration for several musical pieces, notably Claude Debussy's \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (1894), a free interpretation of Mallarm\u00e9's poem \"L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (1876), which creates powerful impressions by the use of striking but isolated phrases. Maurice Ravel set Mallarm\u00e9's poetry to music in \"Trois po\u00e8mes de Mallarm\u00e9\" (1913). Other composers to use his poetry in song include Darius Milhaud (\"Chansons bas de St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\", 1917) and Pierre Boulez (\"Pli selon pli\", 1957\u201362).\nMan Ray's last film, entitled \"Les Myst\u00e8res du Ch\u00e2teau de D\u00e9 (The Mystery of the Chateau of Dice)\" (1929), was greatly influenced by Mallarm\u00e9's work, prominently featuring the line \"A roll of the dice will never abolish chance\".\nMallarm\u00e9 is referred to extensively in the latter section of Joris-Karl Huysmans' , where Des Esseintes describes his fervour-infused enthusiasm for the poet: \"These were Mallarm\u00e9's masterpieces and also ranked among the masterpieces of prose poetry, for they combined a style so magnificently that in itself it was as soothing as a melancholy incantation, an intoxicating melody, with irresistibly suggestive thoughts, the soul-throbs of a sensitive artist whose quivering nerves vibrate with an intensity that fills you with a painful ecstasy.\" [p.\u00a0198, Robert Baldick translation]\nThe critic and translator Barbara Johnson has emphasized Mallarm\u00e9's influence on twentieth-century French criticism and theory: \"It was largely by learning the lesson of Mallarm\u00e9 that critics like Roland Barthes came to speak of 'the death of the author' in the making of literature. Rather than seeing the text as the emanation of an individual author's intentions, structuralists and deconstructors followed the paths and patterns of the linguistic signifier, paying new attention to syntax, spacing, intertextuality, sound, semantics, etymology, and even individual letters. The theoretical styles of Jacques Derrida, Julia Kristeva, Maurice Blanchot, and especially Jacques Lacan also owe a great deal to Mallarm\u00e9's 'critical poem.'\"\n\"Un coup de d\u00e9s\".\nIt has been suggested that \"much of Mallarm\u00e9's work influenced the conception of hypertext, with his purposeful use of blank space and careful placement of words on the page, allowing multiple non-linear readings of the text. This becomes very apparent in his work \"Un coup de d\u00e9s\".\"\nIn 1990, Greenhouse Review Press published D. J. Waldie's American translation of \"Un coup de d\u00e9s\" in a letterpress edition of 60 copies, its typography and format based on examination of the final (or near final) corrected proofs of the poem in the collection of Harvard's Houghton Library.\nPrior to 2004, \"Un coup de d\u00e9s\" was never published in the typography and format conceived by Mallarm\u00e9. In 2004, 90 copies on vellum of a new edition were published by Michel Pierson et Ptyx. This edition reconstructs the typography originally designed by Mallarm\u00e9 for the projected Vollard edition in 1897 and which was abandoned after the sudden death of the author in 1898. All the pages are printed in the format (38\u00a0cm by 28\u00a0cm) and in the typography chosen by the author. The reconstruction has been made from the proofs which are kept in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, taking into account the written corrections and wishes of Mallarm\u00e9 and correcting certain errors on the part of the printers Firmin-Didot.\nA copy of this edition is in the Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois-Mitterrand. Copies have been acquired by the Biblioth\u00e8que litt\u00e9raire Jacques-Doucet and University of California, Irvine, as well as by private collectors. A copy has been placed in the Museum St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Valvins, where Mallarm\u00e9 lived and died and where he made his final corrections on the proofs prior to the projected printing of the poem.\nIn 2012, the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux published \"The Number and the Siren\", a rigorous attempt at 'deciphering' the poem on the basis of a unique interpretation of the phrase 'the unique Number, which cannot be another.'\nIn 2015, Wave Books published \"A Roll of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance\", a dual-language edition of the poem, translated by Robert Bononno and Jeff Clark (designer). Another dual-language edition, translated by Henry Weinfield, was published by University of California Press in 1994.\nThe poet and visual artist Marcel Broodthaers created a purely graphical version of \"Un coup de d\u00e9s\", using Mallarm\u00e9's typographical layout but with the words replaced by black bars. In 2018, Apple Pie Editions published \"un coup de des jamais n'abolira le hasard: translations\" by Eric Zboya, an English edition that transforms the poem not only through erasure, but through graphic imaging software.\nReferences and sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability.) The term \"submarine\" is also sometimes used historically or informally to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, or to medium-sized or smaller vessels (such as the midget submarine and the wet sub). Submarines are referred to as \"boats\" rather than \"ships\" regardless of their size.\nAlthough experimental submarines had been built earlier, submarine design took off during the 19th century, and submarines were adopted by several navies. They were first used widely during World War I (1914\u20131918), and are now used in many navies, large and small. Their military uses include: attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military) or other submarines; aircraft carrier protection; blockade running; nuclear deterrence; stealth operations in denied areas when gathering intelligence and doing reconnaissance; denying or influencing enemy movements; conventional land attacks (for example, launching a cruise missile); and covert insertion of frogmen or special forces. Their civilian uses include: marine science; salvage; exploration; and facility inspection and maintenance. Submarines can be modified for specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions and undersea cable repair. They are also used in the tourism industry and in undersea archaeology. Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the bathyscaphe, which evolved from the diving bell.\nMost large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes. In modern submarines, this structure is called the \"sail\" in American usage and \"fin\" in European usage. A feature of earlier designs was the \"conning tower\": a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that enabled the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving, and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional design. Submarines dive and resurface by using diving planes and by changing the amount of water and air in ballast tanks to affect their buoyancy.\nSubmarines encompass a wide range of types and capabilities. They range from small, autonomous examples, such as one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours, to vessels that can remain submerged for six months, such as the Russian (the biggest submarines ever built). Submarines can work at depths that are greater than what is practicable (or even survivable) for human divers.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"submarine\" means 'underwater' or 'under-sea' (as in submarine canyon, submarine pipeline) though as a noun it generally refers to a vessel that can travel underwater. The term is a contraction of \"submarine boat\" and occurs as such in several languages, e.g. French (), and Spanish (), although others retain the original term, such as Dutch (), German (), Swedish (), and Russian (: ), all of which mean 'submarine boat'. By naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as \"boats\" rather than as \"ships\", regardless of their size. Although referred to informally as \"boats\", U.S. submarines employ the designation USS (United States Ship) at the beginning of their names, such as . In the Royal Navy, the designation HMS can refer to \"His Majesty's Ship\" or \"His Majesty's Submarine\", though the latter is sometimes rendered \"HMS/m\". Submarines are generally referred to as \"boats\" rather than \"ships\".\nEarly human-powered submersibles.\n16th and 17th centuries.\nAccording to a report in \"Opusculum Taisnieri\" published in 1562:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Two Greeks submerged and surfaced in the river Tagus near the City of Toledo several times in the presence of The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, without getting wet and with the flame they carried in their hands still alight.\nIn 1578, the English mathematician William Bourne recorded in his book \"Inventions or Devises\" one of the first plans for an underwater navigation vehicle. A few years later the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his \"Secret Inventions\" (1596) that \"These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform.\" It is unclear whether he carried out his idea.\nJer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont (1553\u20131613) created detailed designs for two types of air-renovated submersible vehicles. They were equipped with oars, autonomous floating snorkels worked by inner pumps, portholes and gloves used for the crew to manipulate underwater objects. Ayanaz planned to use them for warfare, using them to approach enemy ships undetected and set up timed gunpowder charges on their hulls.\nThe first submersible of whose construction there exists reliable information was designed and built in 1620 by Cornelis Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England. It was propelled by means of oars.\n18th century.\nBy the mid-18th century, over a dozen patents for submarines/submersible boats had been granted in England. In 1747, Nathaniel Symons patented and built the first known working example of the use of a ballast tank for submersion. His design used leather bags that could fill with water to submerge the craft. A mechanism was used to twist the water out of the bags and cause the boat to resurface. In 1749, the Gentlemen's Magazine reported that a similar design had initially been proposed by Giovanni Borelli in 1680. Further design improvement stagnated for over a century, until application of new technologies for propulsion and stability.\nThe first military submersible was (1775), a hand-powered acorn-shaped device designed by the American David Bushnell to accommodate a single person. It was the first verified submarine capable of independent underwater operation and movement, and the first to use screws for propulsion.\n19th century.\nIn 1800, France built , a human-powered submarine designed by American Robert Fulton. They gave up on the experiment in 1804, as did the British, when they reconsidered Fulton's submarine design.\nIn 1850, Wilhelm Bauer's was built in Germany. It remains the oldest known surviving submarine in the world.\nIn 1864, late in the American Civil War, the Confederate navy's became the first military submarine to sink an enemy vessel, the Union sloop-of-war , using a gun-powder-filled keg on a spar as a torpedo charge. The \"Hunley\" also sank. The explosion's shock waves may have killed its crew instantly, preventing them from pumping the bilge or propelling the submarine.\nIn 1866, was the first submarine to successfully dive, cruise underwater, and resurface under the crew's control. The design by German American Julius H. Kroehl (in German, \"Kr\u00f6hl\") incorporated elements that are still used in modern submarines.\nIn 1866, was built at the Chilean government's request by Karl Flach, a German engineer and immigrant. It was the fifth submarine built in the world and, along with a second submarine, was intended to defend the port of Valparaiso against attack by the Spanish Navy during the Chincha Islands War.\nMechanically powered submarines.\nSubmarines could not be put into widespread or routine service use by navies until suitable engines were developed. The era from 1863 to 1904 marked a pivotal time in submarine development, and several important technologies appeared. A number of nations built and used submarines. Diesel electric propulsion became the dominant power system and equipment such as the periscope became standardized. Countries conducted many experiments on effective tactics and weapons for submarines, which led to their large impact in World War I.\n1863\u20131904.\nThe first submarine not relying on human power for propulsion was the French (\"Diver\"), launched in 1863, which used compressed air at . Narc\u00eds Monturiol designed the first air-independent and combustion-powered submarine, , which was launched in Barcelona, Spain in 1864.\nThe submarine became feasible as potential weapon with the development of the Whitehead torpedo, designed in 1866 by British engineer Robert Whitehead, the first practical self-propelled torpedo. The spar torpedo that had been developed earlier by the Confederate States Navy was considered to be impracticable, as it was believed to have sunk both its intended target, and \"H. L. Hunley\", the submarine that deployed it.\nThe Irish inventor John Philip Holland built a model submarine in 1876 and in 1878 demonstrated the Holland I prototype. This was followed by a number of unsuccessful designs. In 1896, he designed the Holland Type VI submarine, which used internal combustion engine power on the surface and electric battery power underwater. Launched on 17 May 1897 at Navy Lt. Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey, \"Holland VI\" was purchased by the United States Navy on 11 April 1900, becoming the Navy's first commissioned submarine, christened .\nDiscussions between the English clergyman and inventor George Garrett and the Swedish industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt led to the first practical steam-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes and ready for military use. The first was \"Nordenfelt I\", a 56-tonne, vessel similar to Garrett's ill-fated (1879), with a range of , armed with a single torpedo, in 1885.\nA reliable means of propulsion for the submerged vessel was only made possible in the 1880s with the advent of the necessary electric battery technology. The first electrically powered boats were built by Isaac Peral y Caballero in Spain (who built ), Dupuy de L\u00f4me (who built ) and Gustave Z\u00e9d\u00e9 (who built \"Sir\u00e8ne\") in France, and James Franklin Waddington (who built \"Porpoise\") in England. Peral's design featured torpedoes and other systems that later became standard in submarines.\nCommissioned in June 1900, the French steam and electric employed the now typical double-hull design, with a pressure hull inside the outer shell. These 200-ton ships had a range of over underwater. The French submarine \"Aigrette\" in 1904 further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power. Large numbers of these submarines were built, with seventy-six completed before 1914.\nThe Royal Navy commissioned five s from Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness, under licence from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company from 1901 to 1903. Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company, the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new petrol engine.\nThese types of submarines were first used during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305. Due to the blockade at Port Arthur, the Russians sent their submarines to Vladivostok, where by 1 January 1905 there were seven boats, enough to create the world's first \"operational submarine fleet\". The new submarine fleet began patrols on 14 February, usually lasting for about 24 hours each. The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on 29 April 1905 when the Russian submarine \"Som\" was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats, but then withdrew.\nWorld War I.\nMilitary submarines first made a significant impact in World War I. Forces such as the U-boats of Germany saw action in the First Battle of the Atlantic, and were responsible for sinking , which was sunk as a result of unrestricted submarine warfare and is often cited among the reasons for the entry of the United States into the war.\nAt the outbreak of the war, Germany had only twenty submarines available for combat, although these included vessels of the diesel-engined \"U-19\" class, which had a sufficient range of and speed of to allow them to operate effectively around the entire British coast., By contrast, the Royal Navy had a total of 74 submarines, though of mixed effectiveness. In August 1914, a flotilla of ten U-boats sailed from their base in Heligoland to attack Royal Navy warships in the North Sea in the first submarine war patrol in history.\nThe U-boats' ability to function as practical war machines relied on new tactics, their numbers, and submarine technologies such as combination diesel\u2013electric power system developed in the preceding years. More submersibles than true submarines, U-boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines, submerging occasionally to attack under battery power. They were roughly triangular in cross-section, with a distinct keel to control rolling while surfaced, and a distinct bow. During World War I more than 5,000 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats.\nThe British responded to the German developments in submarine technology with the creation of the K-class submarines. However, these submarines were notoriously dangerous to operate due to their various design flaws and poor maneuverability.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Germany used submarines to devastating effect in the Battle of the Atlantic, where it attempted to cut Britain's supply routes by sinking more merchant ships than Britain could replace. These merchant ships were vital to supply Britain's population with food, industry with raw material, and armed forces with fuel and armaments. Although the U-boats had been updated in the interwar years, the major innovation was improved communications, encrypted using the Enigma cipher machine. This allowed for mass-attack naval tactics (\"Rudeltaktik\", commonly known as \"wolfpack\"), which ultimately ceased to be effective when the U-boat's Enigma was cracked. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats. Although successful early in the war, Germany's U-boat fleet suffered heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners out of 41,000, a casualty rate of about 70%.\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy operated the most varied fleet of submarines of any navy, including \"Kaiten\" crewed torpedoes, midget submarines ( and es), medium-range submarines, purpose-built supply submarines and long-range fleet submarines. They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II (s) and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft (s). They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled Type 95. Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.\nThe submarine force was the most effective anti-ship weapon in the American arsenal. Submarines, though only about 2 percent of the U.S. Navy, destroyed over 30 percent of the Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship and 11 cruisers. US submarines also destroyed over 60 percent of the Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan's ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort. Allied submarines in the Pacific War destroyed more Japanese shipping than all other weapons combined. This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy's failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation's merchant fleet.\nDuring World War II, 314\u00a0submarines served in the US Navy, of which nearly 260 were deployed to the Pacific. When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December 1941, 111 boats were in commission; 203 submarines from the , , and es were commissioned during the war. During the war, 52 US submarines were lost to all causes, with 48 directly due to hostilities. US submarines sank 1,560\u00a0enemy vessels, a total tonnage of 5.3\u00a0million tons (55% of the total sunk).\nThe Royal Navy Submarine Service was used primarily in the classic Axis blockade. Its major operating areas were around Norway, in the Mediterranean (against the Axis supply routes to North Africa), and in the Far East. In that war, British submarines sank 2 million tons of enemy shipping and 57 major warships, the latter including 35 submarines. Among these is the only documented instance of a submarine sinking another submarine while both were submerged. This occurred when engaged ; the \"Venturer\" crew manually computed a successful firing solution against a three-dimensionally maneuvering target using techniques which became the basis of modern torpedo computer targeting systems. Seventy-four British submarines were lost, the majority, forty-two, in the Mediterranean.\nCold-War military models.\nThe first launch of a cruise missile (SSM-N-8 Regulus) from a submarine occurred in July 1953, from the deck of , a World War II fleet boat modified to carry the missile with a nuclear warhead. \"Tunny\" and its sister boat, , were the United States' first nuclear deterrent patrol submarines. In the 1950s, nuclear power partially replaced diesel\u2013electric propulsion. Equipment was also developed to extract oxygen from sea water. These two innovations gave submarines the ability to remain submerged for weeks or months. Most of the naval submarines built since that time in the US, the Soviet Union (now Russia), the UK, and France have been powered by a nuclear reactor.\nIn 1959\u20131960, the first ballistic missile submarines were put into service by both the United States () and the Soviet Union () as part of the Cold War nuclear deterrent strategy.\nDuring the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union maintained large submarine fleets that engaged in cat-and-mouse games. The Soviet Union lost at least four submarines during this period: was lost in 1968 (a part of which the CIA retrieved from the ocean floor with the Howard Hughes-designed ship \"Glomar Explorer\"), in 1970, in 1986, and in 1989 (which held a depth record among military submarines\u2014). Many other Soviet subs, such as (the first Soviet nuclear submarine, and the first Soviet sub to reach the North Pole) were badly damaged by fire or radiation leaks. The US lost two nuclear submarines during this time: due to equipment failure during a test dive while at its operational limit, and due to unknown causes.\nDuring the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Pakistan Navy's sank the Indian frigate . This was the first sinking by a submarine since World War II. During the same war, , a \"Tench\"-class submarine on loan to Pakistan from the US, was sunk by the Indian Navy. It was the first submarine combat loss since World War II. In 1982 during the Falklands War, the Argentine cruiser was sunk by the British submarine , the first sinking by a nuclear-powered submarine in war. Some weeks later, on 16 June, during the Lebanon War, an unnamed Israeli submarine torpedoed and sank the Lebanese coaster \"Transit\", which was carrying 56 Palestinian refugees to Cyprus, in the belief that the vessel was evacuating anti-Israeli militias. The ship was hit by two torpedoes, managed to run aground but eventually sank. There were 25 dead, including her captain. The Israeli Navy disclosed the incident in November 2018.\nUsage.\nMilitary.\nBefore and during World War II, the primary role of the submarine was anti-surface ship warfare. Submarines would attack either on the surface using deck guns, or submerged using torpedoes. They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars, and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II.\nMine-laying submarines were developed in the early part of the 20th century. The facility was used in both World Wars. Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in special operations, for intelligence gathering, and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands, where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash-land so the submarines could rescue them. Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines.\nSubmarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface, although managed to sink with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged. The British developed a specialized anti-submarine submarine in WWI, the R class. After WWII, with the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively.\nThe development of submarine-launched ballistic missile and submarine-launched cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster bombs to nuclear weapons.\nThe primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean. Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made. Water is an excellent conductor of sound (much better than air), and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances. Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on stealth. Advanced propeller designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise, making them difficult to detect. It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines.\nActive sonar uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines. It has been used since WWII by surface ships, submarines and aircraft (via dropped buoys and helicopter \"dipping\" arrays), but it reveals the emitter's position, and is susceptible to counter-measures.\nA concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack. This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the 1982 Falklands War when the British nuclear-powered submarine sank the Argentine cruiser . After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack, and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war. An Argentine submarine remained at sea, however.\nCivilian.\nAlthough the majority of the world's submarines are military, there are some civilian submarines, which are used for tourism, exploration, oil and gas platform inspections, and pipeline surveys. Some are also used in illegal activities.\nThe Submarine Voyage ride opened at Disneyland in 1959, but although it ran under water, it was not a true submarine, as it ran on tracks and was open to the atmosphere. The first tourist submarine was , which went into service in 1964 at Expo64. By 1997, there were 45 tourist submarines operating around the world. Submarines with a crush depth in the range of are operated in several areas worldwide, typically with bottom depths around , with a carrying capacity of 50 to 100 passengers.\nIn a typical operation a surface vessel carries passengers to an offshore operating area and loads them into the submarine. The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures. To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft.\nA recent development is the deployment of so-called narco-submarines by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection. Although they occasionally deploy true submarines, most are self-propelled semi-submersibles, where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times. In September 2011, Colombian authorities seized a 16-meter-long submersible that could hold a crew of 5, costing about $2 million. The vessel belonged to FARC rebels and had the capacity to carry at least 7 tonnes of drugs.\nTechnology.\nBuoyancy and trim.\nAll surface ships, as well as surfaced submarines, are in a positively buoyant condition, weighing less than the volume of water they would displace if fully submerged. To submerge hydrostatically, a ship must have negative buoyancy, either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water. To control their displacement and weight, submarines have ballast tanks, which can hold varying amounts of water and air.\nFor general submersion or surfacing, submarines use the main ballast tanks (MBTs), which are ambient pressure tanks, filled with water to submerge or with air to surface. While submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines, these tanks are a section of the space between the light hull and the pressure hull. For more precise control of depth, submarines use smaller depth control tanks (DCTs)\u2014also called hard tanks (due to their ability to withstand higher pressure) or trim tanks. These are variable buoyancy pressure vessels, a type of buoyancy control device. The amount of water in depth control tanks can be adjusted to hydrostatically change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (mainly water density) change. Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine's center of gravity, to minimise the effect on trim, or separated along the length of the hull so they can also be used to adjust static trim by transfer of water between them.\nWhen submerged, the water pressure on a submarine's hull can reach for steel submarines and up to for titanium submarines like , while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged. This difference results in hull compression, which decreases displacement. Water density also marginally increases with depth, as the salinity and pressure are higher. This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression, so buoyancy decreases as depth increases. A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium, having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface. Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces.\nSubmarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired longitudinal trim, submarines use forward and aft trim tanks. Pumps move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pitching the sub up or down. A similar system may be used to maintain transverse trim.\nControl surfaces.\nThe hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several control surfaces, collectively known as diving planes or hydroplanes, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves longitudinally at sufficient speed. In the classic cruciform stern configuration, the horizontal stern planes serve the same purpose as the trim tanks, controlling the trim. Most submarines additionally have forward horizontal planes, normally placed on the bow until the 1960s but often on the sail on later designs, where they are closer to the center of gravity and can control depth with less effect on the trim.\nAn obvious way to configure the control surfaces at the stern of a submarine is to use vertical planes to control yaw and horizontal planes to control pitch, which gives them the shape of a cross when seen from astern of the vessel. In this configuration, which long remained the dominant one, the horizontal planes are used to control the trim and depth and the vertical planes to control sideways maneuvers, like the rudder of a surface ship.\nAlternatively, the rear control surfaces can be combined into what has become known as an X-stern or an X-form rudder. Although less intuitive, such a configuration has turned out to have several advantages over the traditional cruciform arrangement. First, it improves maneuverability, horizontally as well as vertically. Second, the control surfaces are less likely to get damaged when landing on, or departing from, the seabed as well as when mooring and unmooring alongside. Finally, it is safer in that one of the two diagonal lines can counteract the other with respect to vertical as well as horizontal motion if one of them accidentally gets stuck.\nThe x-stern was first tried in practice in the early 1960s on the USS \"Albacore\", an experimental submarine of the US Navy. While the arrangement was found to be advantageous, it was nevertheless not used on US production submarines that followed due to the fact that it requires the use of a computer to manipulate the control surfaces to the desired effect. Instead, the first to use an x-stern in standard operations was the Swedish Navy with its \"Sj\u00f6ormen\" class, the lead submarine of which was launched in 1967, before the \"Albacore\" had even finished her test runs. Since it turned out to work very well in practice, all subsequent classes of Swedish submarines (\"N\u00e4cken\", \"V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland\", \"Gotland\", and \"Blekinge\" class) have or will come with an x-rudder.\nThe Kockums shipyard responsible for the design of the x-stern on Swedish submarines eventually exported it to Australia with the \"Collins\" class as well as to Japan with the \"S\u014dry\u016b\" class. With the introduction of the type 212, the German and Italian Navies came to feature it as well. The US Navy with its \"Columbia\" class, the British Navy with its \"Dreadnought\" class, and the French Navy with its \"Barracuda\" class are all about to join the x-stern family. Hence, as judged by the situation in the early 2020s, the x-stern is about to become the dominant technology.\nWhen a submarine performs an emergency surfacing, all depth and trim control methods are used simultaneously, together with propelling the boat upwards. Such surfacing is very quick, so the vessel may even partially jump out of the water, potentially damaging submarine systems.\nHull.\nOverview.\nModern submarines are cigar-shaped. This design, also used in very early submarines, is sometimes called a \"teardrop hull\". It reduces hydrodynamic drag when the sub is submerged, but decreases the sea-keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced. Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time, their hull designs were a compromise. Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs, usually well below 10\u00a0kt (18\u00a0km/h), the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable. Late in World War II, when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged, hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise. was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an \"Albacore hull\") of modern submarines. On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound-absorbing rubber, or anechoic plating, to reduce detection.\nThe occupied pressure hulls of deep-diving submarines such as are spherical instead of cylindrical. This allows a more even distribution of stress and efficient use of materials to withstand external pressure as it gives the most internal volume for structural weight and is the most efficient shape to avoid buckling instability in compression. A frame is usually affixed to the outside of the pressure hull, providing attachment for ballast and trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, syntactic flotation foam, and lighting.\nA raised tower on top of a standard submarine accommodates the periscope and electronics masts, which can include radio, radar, electronic warfare, and other systems. It might also include a snorkel mast. In many early classes of submarines (see history), the control room, or \"conn\", was located inside this tower, which was known as the \"conning tower\". Since then, the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine, and the tower is now called the \"sail\" or \"fin\". The conn is distinct from the \"bridge\", a small open platform in the top of the sail, used for observation during surface operation.\n\"Bathtubs\" are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines. The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin. It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited freeboard, that is, they lie low in the water. Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel.\nSingle and double hulls.\nModern submarines and submersibles usually have, as did the earliest models, a single hull. Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside. This external hull, which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer hull (\"casing\" in the Royal Navy) or light hull, as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull, or pressure hull, which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.\nAs early as World War I, it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag at the surface, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem. This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two layered hulls: the internal strength hull for withstanding pressure, and an external fairing for hydrodynamic shape. Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial casing on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged. Germany went further with the Type XXI, a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation.\nAfter World War II, approaches split. The Soviet Union changed its designs, basing them on German developments. All post-World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a double hull structure. American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single-hull approach. They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern, which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape, but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer. Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity, stealth and range.\nPressure hull.\nThe pressure hull is generally constructed of thick high-strength steel with a complex structure and high strength reserve, and is separated by watertight bulkheads into several compartments. There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine, like the , which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the main hulls, all surrounded and supported by the outer light hydrodynamic hull. When submerged the pressure hull provides most of the buoyancy for the whole vessel.\nThe dive depth cannot be increased easily. Simply making the hull thicker increases the structural weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight, and increasing the diameter requires a proportional increase in thickness for the same material and architecture, ultimately resulting in a pressure hull that does not have sufficient buoyancy to support its own weight, as in a bathyscaphe. This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles, but not military submarines, which need to carry a large equipment, crew, and weapons load to fulfill their function. Construction materials with greater specific strength and specific modulus are needed.\nWWI submarines had hulls of carbon steel, with a maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength alloyed steel was introduced, allowing depths. High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with depths, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with titanium hulls. Titanium alloys can be stronger than steel, lighter, and most importantly, have higher immersed specific strength and specific modulus. Titanium is also not ferromagnetic, important for stealth. Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys. It has produced several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to for the , the deepest-diving combat submarine. An may have successfully operated at , though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems. Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle after many dive cycles. Despite its benefits, the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended. Deep-diving civilian submarines have used thick acrylic pressure hulls. Although the specific strength and specific modulus of acrylic are not very high, the density is only 1.18g/cm3, so it is only very slightly denser than water, and the buoyancy penalty of increased thickness is correspondingly low.\nThe deepest deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) to date is \"Trieste\". On 5 October 1959, \"Trieste\" departed San Diego for Guam aboard the freighter \"Santa Maria\" to participate in \"Project Nekton\", a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench. On 23 January 1960, \"Trieste\" reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant Don Walsh, USN. This was the first time a vessel, crewed or uncrewed, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of , although this was later revised to and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower, at .\nBuilding a pressure hull is difficult, as it must withstand pressures at its required diving depth. When the hull is perfectly round in cross-section, the pressure is evenly distributed, and causes only hull compression. If the shape is not perfect, the hull deflects more in some places and buckling instability is the usual failure mode. Inevitable minor deviations are resisted by stiffener rings, but even a one-inch (25\u00a0mm) deviation from roundness results in over 30 percent decrease of maximal hydrostatic load and consequently dive depth. The hull must therefore be constructed with high precision. All hull parts must be welded without defects, and all joints are checked multiple times with different methods, contributing to the high cost of modern submarines. (For example, each attack submarine costs US$2.6 billion, over US$200,000 per ton of displacement.)\nPropulsion.\nThe first submarines were propelled by humans. The first mechanically driven submarine was the 1863 French , which used compressed air for propulsion. Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish \"Ictineo II\" in 1864, which used a solution of zinc, manganese dioxide, and potassium chlorate to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine, while also providing oxygen for the crew. A similar system was not employed again until 1940 when the German Navy tested a hydrogen peroxide-based system, the Walter turbine, on the experimental V-80 submarine and later on the naval and type XVII submarines; the system was further developed for the British , completed in 1958.\nUntil the advent of nuclear marine propulsion, most 20th-century submarines used electric motors and batteries for running underwater and combustion engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline (petrol) engines but this quickly gave way to kerosene (paraffin) and then diesel engines because of reduced flammability and, with diesel, improved fuel-efficiency and thus also greater range. A combination of diesel and electric propulsion became the norm.\nInitially, the combustion engine and the electric motor were in most cases connected to the same shaft so that both could directly drive the propeller. The combustion engine was placed at the front end of the stern section with the electric motor behind it followed by the propeller shaft. The engine was connected to the motor by a clutch and the motor in turn connected to the propeller shaft by another clutch.\nWith only the rear clutch engaged, the electric motor could drive the propeller, as required for fully submerged operation. With both clutches engaged, the combustion engine could drive the propeller, as was possible when operating on the surface or, at a later stage, when snorkeling. The electric motor would in this case serve as a generator to charge the batteries or, if no charging was needed, be allowed to rotate freely. With only the front clutch engaged, the combustion engine could drive the electric motor as a generator for charging the batteries without simultaneously forcing the propeller to move.\nThe motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called \"group down\" and \"group up\", respectively).\nDiesel\u2013electric transmission.\nWhile most early submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the combustion engine and the propeller, an alternative solution was considered as well as implemented at a very early stage. That solution consists in first converting the work of the combustion engine into electric energy via a dedicated generator. This energy is then used to drive the propeller via the electric motor and, to the extent required, for charging the batteries. In this configuration, the electric motor is thus responsible for driving the propeller at all times, regardless of whether air is available so that the combustion engine can also be used or not.\nAmong the pioneers of this alternative solution was the very first submarine of the Swedish Navy, HSwMS \"Hajen\" (later renamed \"Ub no 1\"), launched in 1904. While its design was generally inspired by the first submarine commissioned by the US Navy, USS \"Holland\", it deviated from the latter in at least three significant ways: by adding a periscope, by replacing the gasoline engine by a semidiesel engine (a hot-bulb engine primarily meant to be fueled by kerosene, later replaced by a true diesel engine) and by severing the mechanical link between the combustion engine and the propeller by instead letting the former drive a dedicated generator. By so doing, it took three significant steps toward what was eventually to become the dominant technology for conventional (i.e., non-nuclear) submarines.\nIn the following years, the Swedish Navy added another seven submarines in three different classes (\"Undervattensb\u00e5ten No 2\", \"Laxen\", and \"Abborren\" class) using the same propulsion technology but fitted with true diesel engines rather than semidiesels from the outset. Since by that time, the technology was usually based on the diesel engine rather than some other type of combustion engine, it eventually came to be known as diesel\u2013electric transmission.\nLike many other early submarines, those initially designed in Sweden were quite small (less than 200 tonnes) and thus confined to littoral operation. When the Swedish Navy wanted to add larger vessels, capable of operating further from the shore, their designs were purchased from companies abroad that already had the required experience: first Italian (Fiat-Laurenti) and later German (A.G. Weser and IvS). As a side-effect, the diesel\u2013electric transmission was temporarily abandoned.\nHowever, diesel\u2013electric transmission was immediately reintroduced when Sweden began designing its own submarines again in the mid-1930s. From that point onwards, it has been consistently used for all new classes of Swedish submarines, albeit supplemented by air-independent propulsion (AIP) as provided by Stirling engines beginning with HMS \"N\u00e4cken\" in 1988.\nAnother early adopter of diesel\u2013electric transmission was the US Navy, whose Bureau of Engineering proposed its use in 1928. It was subsequently tried in the S-class submarines , , and before being put into production with the \"Porpoise\" class of the 1930s. From that point onwards, it continued to be used on most US conventional submarines.\nApart from the British U-class and some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy that used separate diesel generators for low speed running, few navies other than those of Sweden and the US made much use of diesel\u2013electric transmission before 1945. After World War II, by contrast, it gradually became the dominant mode of propulsion for conventional submarines. However, its adoption was not always swift. Notably, the Soviet Navy did not introduce diesel\u2013electric transmission on its conventional submarines until 1980 with its \"Paltus\" class.\nIf diesel\u2013electric transmission had only brought advantages and no disadvantages in comparison with a system that mechanically connects the diesel engine to the propeller, it would undoubtedly have become dominant much earlier. The disadvantages include the following:\nThe reason why diesel\u2013electric transmission has become the dominant alternative in spite of these disadvantages is of course that it also comes with many advantages and that, on balance, these have eventually been found to be more important. The advantages include the following:\nSnorkel.\nDuring World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the \"schnorchel\" (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines but did not see the need for them until rather late in the war. The \"schnorchel\" is a retractable pipe that supplies air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boat to cruise and recharge its batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth.\nEspecially as first implemented however, it turned out to be far from a perfect solution. There were problems with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather. Since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to , lest the device snap from stress. The \"schnorchel\" also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar, yet more difficult for the on-board sonar to detect signals from other vessels. Finally, allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the \"schnorchel\" mast could be detected beyond visual range.\nIn clear weather, diesel exhausts can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles, while \"periscope feather\" (the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water) is visible from far off in calm sea conditions. Modern radar is also capable of detecting a snorkel in calm sea conditions.\nThe problem of the diesels causing a vacuum in the submarine when the head valve is submerged still exists in later model diesel submarines but is mitigated by high-vacuum cut-off sensors that shut down the engines when the vacuum in the ship reaches a pre-set point. Modern snorkel induction masts have a fail-safe design using compressed air, controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the \"head valve\" open against the pull of a powerful spring. Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control, and shutting the \"head valve\" while it is submerged. US submarines did not adopt the use of snorkels until after WWII.\nAir-independent propulsion.\nDuring World War II, German Type XXI submarines (also known as \"Elektroboote\") were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods. Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead. At the end of the War, the British and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines that could run surfaced and submerged. The results were not encouraging. Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type (codenamed by NATO), they were considered unsuccessful.\nThe United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental midget submarine, X-1. It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957. X-1 was later converted to use diesel\u2013electric drive.\nToday several navies use air-independent propulsion. Notably Sweden uses Stirling technology on the and s. The Stirling engine is heated by burning diesel fuel with liquid oxygen from cryogenic tanks. A newer development in air-independent propulsion is hydrogen fuel cells, first used on the German Type 212 submarine, with nine 34\u00a0kW or two 120\u00a0kW cells. Fuel cells are also used in the new Spanish s although with the fuel stored as ethanol and then converted into hydrogen before use.\nOne new technology that is being introduced starting with the Japanese Navy's eleventh \"S\u014dry\u016b\"-class submarine (JS \"\u014cry\u016b\") is a more modern battery, the lithium-ion battery. These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries, and by changing out the lead-acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to AIP engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium-ion batteries, modern submarines can actually return to a \"pure\" diesel\u2013electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines.\nNuclear power.\nSteam power was resurrected in the 1950s with a nuclear-powered steam turbine driving a generator. By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen, the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores, as breathing air was recycled and fresh water distilled from seawater. More importantly, a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed. This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti-submarine weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine/generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down.\nNuclear power is now used in all large submarines, but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors, smaller submarines still use diesel\u2013electric propulsion. The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs. The US Navy, French Navy, and the British Royal Navy operate only nuclear submarines, which is explained by the need for distant operations. Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel\u2013electric submarines for defense. Most fleets have no nuclear submarines, due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology.\nDiesel\u2013electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo-machinery needed to operate the reactor, even at low power levels. Some nuclear submarines such as the American can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured, making them quieter than electric subs. A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity. Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship.\nSeveral serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. The reactor accident in 1961 resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation. The reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries. The accident in 1985 resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other radiation injuries.\nAlternative.\nOil-fired steam turbines powered the British K-class submarines, built during World War I and later, to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet. The K-class subs were not very successful, however.\nToward the end of the 20th century, some submarines\u2014such as the British \"Vanguard\" class\u2014began to be fitted with pump-jet propulsors instead of propellers. Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage.\nArmament.\nThe success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the torpedo, invented by Robert Whitehead in 1866. His invention (essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago), allowed the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war. Prior to the development and miniaturization of sonar sensitive enough to track a submerged submarine, attacks were exclusively restricted to ships and submarines operating near or at the surface. Targeting of unguided torpedoes was initially done by eye, but by World War II analog targeting computers began to proliferate, being able to calculate basic firing solutions. Nonetheless, multiple \"straight-running\" torpedoes could be required to ensure a target was hit. With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks a submarine could make was limited. To increase combat endurance starting in World War I submarines also functioned as submersible gunboats, using their deck guns against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships. The initial importance of these deck guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful Submarine Cruiser such as the French and the Royal Navy's and M-class submarines. With the arrival of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack. A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.\nThe ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as minelayers. Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose. Modern submarine-laid mines, such as the British Mark 5 Stonefish and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes.\nAfter World War II, both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine-launched cruise missiles such as the SSM-N-8 Regulus and P-5 Pyatyorka. Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles. They were the forerunners of modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines, for example, the US BGM-109 Tomahawk and Russian RPK-2 Viyuga and versions of surface-to-surface anti-ship missiles such as the Exocet and Harpoon, encapsulated for submarine launch. Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine's torpedo tubes, for example, missiles such as the anti-submarine SUBROC. With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads, the idea of the external launch tube was revived, usually for encapsulated missiles, with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls. Guided torpedoes also proliferated extensively during and after World War II, even further increasing the combat endurance and lethality of submarines and allowing them to engage other submarines at depth (with the latter now being one of the primary missions of the modern attack submarine).\nThe strategic mission of the SSM-N-8 and the P-5 was taken up by submarine-launched ballistic missile beginning with the US Navy's Polaris missile, and subsequently the Poseidon and Trident missiles.\nGermany is working on the torpedo tube-launched short-range IDAS missile, which can be used against ASW helicopters, as well as surface ships and coastal targets.\nSensors.\nA submarine can have a variety of sensors, depending on its missions. Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active sonars to locate targets. Active sonar relies on an audible \"ping\" to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine. Active systems are rarely used, as doing so reveals the sub's presence. Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array, normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub. The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems, as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators. Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array, as the towed array can not work in shallow depth and during maneuvering. In addition, sonar has a blind spot \"through\" the submarine, so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem. As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine, it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the thermocline at the proper depth; sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range. Global climate change and warmer oceans may complicate detecting submarines at depth in most places in the world.\nSubmarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft. Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets, as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range, revealing the submarine. Periscopes are rarely used, except for position fixes and to verify a contact's identity.\nCivilian submarines, such as the or the Russian \"Mir\" submersibles, rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate. The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about underwater, so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area.\nNavigation.\nEarly submarines had few navigation aids, but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems. Modern military submarines use an inertial guidance system for navigation while submerged, but drift error unavoidably builds over time. To counter this, the crew occasionally uses the Global Positioning System to obtain an accurate position. The periscope\u2014a retractable tube with a prism system that provides a view of the surface\u2014is only used occasionally in modern submarines, since the visibility range is short. The and s use photonics masts rather than hull-penetrating optical periscopes. These masts must still be deployed above the surface, and use electronic sensors for visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, and electromagnetic surveillance. One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar.\nCommunication.\nMilitary submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships. One is VLF (very low frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth, usually less than . ELF (extremely low frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach. A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.\nBy extending a radio mast, a submarine can also use a \"burst transmission\" technique. A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second, minimizing a submarine's risk of detection.\nTo communicate with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used. Gertrude is basically a sonar telephone. Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine. The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.\nCivilian submarines can use similar, albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area.\nLife support systems.\nWith nuclear power or air-independent propulsion, submarines can remain submerged for months at a time. Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on snorkel to recharge their batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing oxygen by electrolysis of fresh water (using a device called an \"Electrolytic Oxygen Generator\"). Emergency oxygen can be produced by burning sodium chlorate candles. Atmosphere control equipment includes a Carbon dioxide scrubber, which uses a spray of monoethanolamine (MEA) absorbent to remove the gas from the air, after which the MEA is heated in a boiler to release the CO2 which is then pumped overboard. Emergency scrubbing can also be done with lithium hydroxide, which is consumable. A machine that uses a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide (removed by the CO2 scrubber) and bonds hydrogen produced from the ship's storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, R-12 and R-114 refrigerants, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other gases. Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank. Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft). The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk.\nFresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a reverse osmosis unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting \"blackwater\" is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump. The blackwater-discharge system requires skill to operate, and isolation valves must be closed before discharge. The German Type VIIC boat was lost with casualties because of human error while using this system. Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in \"grey water\" tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.\nTrash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit (TDU), where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can. At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve. An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it, the cans atop the ice plug. The top breech door is shut, and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure, the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans. The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve.\nCrew.\nA typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40. The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time, without family contact, and in cramped conditions. Submarines normally maintain radio silence to avoid detection. Operating a submarine is dangerous, even in peacetime, and many submarines have been lost in accidents.\nWomen.\nMost navies prohibited women from serving on submarines, even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships. The Royal Norwegian Navy became the first navy to allow women on its submarine crews in 1985. The Royal Danish Navy allowed female submariners in 1988. Others followed suit including the Swedish Navy (1989), the Royal Australian Navy (1998), the Spanish Navy (1999), the German Navy (2001) and the Canadian Navy (2002). In 1995, Solveig Krey of the Royal Norwegian Navy became the first female officer to assume command on a military submarine, HNoMS \"Kobben\".\nOn 8 December 2011, British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced that the UK's ban on women in submarines was to be lifted from 2013. Previously there were fears that women were more at risk from a build-up of carbon dioxide in the submarine. But a study showed no medical reason to exclude women, though pregnant women would still be excluded. Similar dangers to the pregnant woman and her fetus barred women from submarine service in Sweden in 1983, when all other positions were made available for them in the Swedish Navy. Today, pregnant women are still not allowed to serve on submarines in Sweden. However, the policymakers thought that it was discriminatory with a general ban and demanded that women should be tried on their individual merits and have their suitability evaluated and compared to other candidates. Further, they noted that a woman complying with such high demands is unlikely to become pregnant. In May 2014, three women became the RN's first female submariners.\nWomen have served on US Navy surface ships since 1993, and as of 2011\u20132012[ [update]], began serving on submarines for the first time. Until presently, the Navy allowed only three exceptions to women being on board military submarines: female civilian technicians for a few days at most, women midshipmen on an overnight during summer training for Navy ROTC and Naval Academy, and family members for one-day dependent cruises. In 2009, senior officials, including then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Joint Chief of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, began the process of finding a way to implement women on submarines. The US Navy rescinded its \"no women on subs\" policy in 2010.\nBoth the US and British navies operate nuclear-powered submarines that deploy for periods of six months or longer. Other navies that permit women to serve on submarines operate conventionally powered submarines, which deploy for much shorter periods\u2014usually only for a few months. Prior to the change by the US, no nation using nuclear submarines permitted women to serve on board.\nIn 2011, the first class of female submarine officers graduated from Naval Submarine School's Submarine Officer Basic Course (SOBC) at the Naval Submarine Base New London. Additionally, more senior ranking and experienced female supply officers from the surface warfare specialty attended SOBC as well, proceeding to fleet Ballistic Missile (SSBN) and Guided Missile (SSGN) submarines along with the new female submarine line officers beginning in late 2011. By late 2011, several women were assigned to the \"Ohio\"-class ballistic missile submarine . On 15 October 2013, the US Navy announced that two of the smaller \"Virginia\"-class attack submarines, and , would have female crew-members by January 2015.\nIn 2020, Japan's national naval submarine academy accepted its first female candidate.\nAbandoning the vessel.\nIn an emergency, submarines can contact other ships to assist in rescue, and pick up the crew when they abandon ship. The crew can use escape sets such as the Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment to abandon the submarine via an escape trunk, which is a small airlock compartment that provides a route for crew to escape from a downed submarine at ambient pressure in small groups, while minimising the amount of water admitted to the submarine. The crew can avoid lung injury from over-expansion of air in the lungs due to the pressure change known as pulmonary barotrauma by maintaining an open airway and exhaling during the ascent. Following escape from a pressurized submarine, in which the air pressure is higher than atmospheric due to water ingress or other reasons, the crew is at risk of developing decompression sickness on return to surface pressure.\nAn alternative escape means is via a deep-submergence rescue vehicle that can dock onto the disabled submarine, establish a seal around the escape hatch, and transfer personnel at the same pressure as the interior of the submarine. If the submarine has been pressurised the survivors can lock into a decompression chamber on the submarine rescue ship and transfer under pressure for safe surface decompression.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral history\nCulture\nSubmarines before 1914\n1900/Russo-Japanese War 1904\u20131905\nWorld War II\nCold War"}
