{"id": "27037", "revid": "2059168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27037", "title": "Screwball comedy", "text": "Genre of comedy film\nScrewball comedy is a film subgenre of the romantic comedy genre that became popular during the Great Depression, beginning in the early 1930s and thriving until the early 1950s, that satirizes the traditional love story. It has secondary characteristics similar to film noir, distinguished by a female character who dominates the relationship with the male central character, whose masculinity is challenged, and the two engaging in a humorous battle of the sexes.\nThe genre also featured romantic attachments between members of different social classes, as in \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) and \"My Man Godfrey\" (1936).\nWhat sets the screwball comedy apart from the generic romantic comedy is that \"screwball comedy puts the emphasis on a funny spoofing of love, while the more traditional romantic comedy ultimately accents love.\" Other elements of the screwball comedy include fast-paced, overlapping repartee, farcical situations, escapist themes, physical battle of the sexes, disguise and masquerade, and plot lines involving courtship and marriage. Some comic plays are also described as screwball comedies.\nName.\nScrewball comedy gets its name from the screwball, a type of breaking pitch in baseball and fastpitch softball that moves in the opposite direction from all other breaking pitches. These features of the screwball pitch also describe the dynamics between the lead characters in screwball comedy films. According to Gehring (2008):\nStill, \"screwball\" comedy probably drew its name from the term's entertainingly unorthodox use in the national pastime. Before the term's application in 1930s film criticism, \"screwball\" had been used in baseball to describe both an oddball player and \"any pitched ball that moves in an unusual or unexpected way.\" Obviously, these characteristics also describe performers in screwball comedy films, from oddball Carole Lombard to the unusual or unexpected movement of Katharine Hepburn in \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938). As with the crazy period antics in baseball, screwball comedy uses nutty behavior as a prism through which to view a topsy-turvy period in American history.\nHistory.\nScrewball comedy has proved to be a popular and enduring film genre. \"Three-Cornered Moon\" (1933), starring Claudette Colbert, is often credited as the first true screwball, though \"Bombshell\" starring Jean Harlow followed it in the same year. Although many film scholars agree that its classic period had effectively ended by 1942, elements of the genre have persisted or have been paid homage to in later films. Other film scholars argue that the screwball comedy lives on.\nDuring the Great Depression, there was a general demand for films with a strong social class critique and hopeful, escapist-oriented themes. The screwball format arose largely due to the major film studios' desire to avoid censorship by the increasingly enforced Hays Code. Filmmakers resorted to handling these elements covertly to incorporate prohibited risqu\u00e9 elements into their plots. The verbal sparring between the sexes served as a stand-in for physical and sexual tension. Though some film scholars, such as William K. Everson, argue that \"screwball comedies were not so much rebelling against the Production Code as they were attacking\u00a0\u2013 and ridiculing\u00a0\u2013 the dull, lifeless respectability that the Code insisted on for family viewing.\"\nThe screwball comedy has close links with the theatrical genre of farce, and some comic plays are also described as screwball comedies. Other genres with which screwball comedy is associated include slapstick, situation comedy, romantic comedy and bedroom farce.\nCharacteristics.\nFilms that are definitive of the genre usually feature farcical situations, a combination of slapstick and fast-paced repartee, and show the struggle between economic classes. They also generally feature a self-confident and often stubborn central female protagonist and a plot involving courtship, marriage, or remarriage. These traits can be seen in both \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) and \"My Man Godfrey\" (1936). The film critic Andrew Sarris has defined the screwball comedy as \"a sex comedy without the sex.\"\nLike farce, screwball comedies often involve masquerades and disguises in which a character or characters resort to secrecy. Sometimes screwball comedies feature male characters cross-dressing, further contributing to elements of masquerade (\"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), \"Love Crazy\" (1941), \"I Was a Male War Bride\" (1949), and \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959)). At first, the couple seems mismatched and even hostile to each other, but eventually overcome their differences amusingly or entertainingly, leading to romance. Often, this mismatch comes about when the man is of a lower social class than the woman (\"It Happened One Night\" (1934), \"Bringing Up Baby\" and \"Holiday\", both 1938). The woman often plans the final romantic union from the outset, and the man is seemingly oblivious to this. In \"Bringing Up Baby,\" the woman tells a third party: \"He's the man I'm going to marry. He doesn't know it, but I am.\"\nThese pictures also offered a cultural escape valve: a safe battleground to explore serious issues such as class under a comedic and non-threatening framework. Class issues are a strong component of screwball comedies: the upper class is represented as idle, pampered, and having difficulty coping with the real world. By contrast, when lower-class people attempt to pass themselves off as upper class or otherwise insinuate themselves into high society, they can do so with relative ease (\"The Lady Eve\", 1941; \"My Man Godfrey\", 1936). Some critics believe that the portrayal of the upper class in \"It Happened One Night\" was brought about by the Great Depression, and the financially struggling moviegoing public's desire to see the upper class taught a lesson in humanity.\nAnother common element of the screwball comedy is fast-talking, witty repartee, such as in \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938) and \"His Girl Friday\" (1940). This stylistic device did not originate in the genre: it is also found in many of the old Hollywood cycles, including gangster films and traditional romantic comedies.\nScrewball comedies also tend to contain ridiculous, farcical situations, such as in \"Bringing Up Baby\", where a couple must take care of a pet leopard during much of the film. Slapstick elements are also frequently present, such as the numerous pratfalls Henry Fonda takes in \"The Lady Eve\" (1941).\nOne subgenre of screwball is known as the comedy of remarriage, in which characters divorce and then remarry one another (\"The Awful Truth\" (1937), \"His Girl Friday\" (1940), \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940)). Some scholars point to this frequent device as evidence of the shift in the American moral code, as it showed freer attitudes toward divorce (though the divorce always turns out to have been a mistake: \"You've got an old fashioned idea divorce is something that lasts forever, 'til death do us part.' Why divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays, Hildy, just a few words mumbled over you by a judge.\")\nAnother subgenre of screwball comedy is the woman chasing a man who is oblivious to or uninterested in her. Examples include Barbara Stanwyck chasing Henry Fonda (\"The Lady Eve\", 1941); Sonja Henie chasing John Payne (\"Sun Valley Serenade\", 1941, and \"Iceland\", 1942); Marion Davies chasing Antonio Moreno (\"The Cardboard Lover\", 1928); Marion Davies chasing Bing Crosby (\"Going Hollywood\", 1933); and Carole Lombard chasing William Powell (\"My Man Godfrey\", 1936).\nThe philosopher Stanley Cavell has noted that many classic screwball comedies turn on an interlude in the state of Connecticut (\"Bringing Up Baby\", \"The Lady Eve\", \"The Awful Truth\"). In \"Christmas in Connecticut\" (1945), the action moves to Connecticut and remains there for the duration of the film. New York City is also featured in a lot of screwball comedies, which critics have noted may be because of the economic diversity of the city and the ability to contrast different social classes during the Great Depression. The screwball comedies \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) and \"The Palm Beach Story\" (1942) also feature characters traveling to and from Florida by train. Trains, another staple of screwball comedies and romantic comedies from the era, are also featured prominently in \"Design for Living\" (1934), \"Twentieth Century\" (1934) and \"Vivacious Lady\" (1938).\nExamples from the classic period.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther films from this period in other genres incorporate elements of the screwball comedy. For example, Alfred Hitchcock's thriller \"The 39 Steps\" (1935) features the gimmick of a young couple who finds themselves handcuffed together and who eventually, almost despite themselves, fall in love with one another, and Woody Van Dyke's detective comedy \"The Thin Man\" (1934), which portrays a witty, urbane couple who trade barbs as they solve mysteries together. Some of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals of the 1930s also feature screwball comedy plots, such as \"The Gay Divorcee\" (1934), \"Top Hat\" (1935), and \"Carefree\" (1938), which costars Ralph Bellamy. The Eddie Cantor musicals \"Whoopee!\" (1930) and \"Roman Scandals\" (1933), and slapstick road movies such as \"Six of a Kind\" (1934) include screwball elements. Some of the Joe E. Brown comedies also fall into this category, particularly \"Broadminded\" (1931) and \"Earthworm Tractors\" (1936). Screwball comedies such as \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940) and \"Ball of Fire\" (1941) also received musical remakes, \"High Society\" (1956) and \"A Song is Born\" (1948). \nActors and actresses featured in or associated with screwball comedy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDirectors of screwball comedies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLater examples.\nLater films thought to have revived elements of the classic era screwball comedies include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nElements of classic screwball comedy often found in more recent films which might otherwise be classified as romantic comedies include the \"battle of the sexes\" (\"Down with Love\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\"), witty repartee (\"Down with Love\"), and the contrast between the wealthy and the middle class (\"You've Got Mail\", \"Two Weeks Notice\"). Many of Elvis Presley's films from the 1960s had drawn, consciously or unconsciously, the many characteristics of the screwball comedy genre. Some examples are \"Double Trouble\", \"Tickle Me\", \"Girl Happy\" and \"Live a Little, Love a Little\". Modern updates on screwball comedy are also sometimes categorized as black comedy (\"Intolerable Cruelty\", which also features a twist on the classic screwball element of divorce and remarriage). The Coen Brothers often include screwball elements in a film which may not otherwise be considered screwball or even a comedy.\nThe Golmaal films, a series of Hindi-language Indian films, has been described as a screwball comedy franchise.\nScrewball comedy elements in other media and genres.\nThe screwball film tradition influenced television sitcom and comedy drama genres. Notable screwball couples in television have included Sam and Diane in \"Cheers\", Maddie and David in \"Moonlighting\", and Joel and Maggie in \"Northern Exposure\". The comedy-drama series \"Gilmore Girls\" has been compared by scholars to the screwball comedy genre, particularly for its fast-paced repartee and emphasis on class divisions. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has stated that repartee was inspired by the Spencer-Tracy films.\nIn his 2008 production of the classic Beaumarchais comedy \"The Marriage of Figaro\", author William James Royce trimmed the five-act play down to three acts and labeled it a \"classic screwball comedy\". The playwright made Suzanne the central character, endowing her with all the feisty comedic strengths of her classic film counterparts. In his adaptation, entitled \"One Mad Day!\" (a play on Beaumarchais' original French title), Royce underscored all of the elements of the classic screwball comedy, suggesting that Beaumarchais may have had a hand in the origins of the genre.\nThe plot of \"Corrupting Dr. Nice\", a science fiction novel by John Kessel involving time travel, is modeled on films such as \"The Lady Eve\" and \"Bringing Up Baby\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27040", "revid": "48227547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27040", "title": "Schutzstaffel", "text": "Nazi paramilitary organisation (1925\u20131945)\nThe Schutzstaffel (; lit.\u2009'Protection Squadron'; SS; also stylised with SS runes as \u16cb\u16cb) was a major paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II.\nIt began with a small guard unit known as the \"Saal-Schutz\" (\"Hall Security\") made up of party volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (1929\u20131945) it grew from a small paramilitary formation during the Weimar Republic to one of the most powerful organisations in Nazi Germany. From the time of the Nazi Party's rise to power until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of security, mass surveillance, and state terrorism within Germany and German-occupied Europe.\nThe two main constituent groups were the \"Allgemeine SS\" (General SS) and \"Waffen-SS\" (Armed SS). The \"Allgemeine SS\" was responsible for enforcing the racial policy of Nazi Germany and general policing, whereas the \"Waffen-SS\" consisted of the combat units of the SS, with a sworn allegiance to Hitler. A third component of the SS, the \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\" (SS-TV; \"Death's Head Units\"), ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the Gestapo and the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD) organisations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralisation of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to Nazi ideology, and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.\nThe SS was the organisation most responsible for the genocidal murder of an estimated 6 million Jews and millions of other victims during the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939\u20131945). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labour. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the Nazi Party were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organisations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, was found guilty of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrigins.\nForerunner of the SS.\nBy 1923, the Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler had created a small volunteer guard unit known as the \"Saal-Schutz\" (Hall Security) to provide security at their meetings in Munich. The same year, Hitler ordered the formation of a small bodyguard unit dedicated to his personal service. He wished it to be separate from the \"suspect mass\" of the party, including the paramilitary \"Sturmabteilung\" (\"Storm Battalion\"; SA), which he did not trust. The new formation was designated the \"Stabswache\" (Staff Guard). Originally the unit was composed of eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Joseph Berchtold, and was modelled after the Erhardt Naval Brigade, a \"Freikorps\" of the time. The unit was renamed \"Sto\u00dftrupp\" (Shock Troops) in May 1923.\nThe \"Sto\u00dftrupp\" was abolished after the failed 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt by the Nazi Party to seize power in Munich. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organise a new bodyguard unit, the \"Schutzkommando\" (Protection Command). It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at party functions and events. That same year, the \"Schutzkommando\" was expanded to a national organisation and renamed successively the \"Sturmstaffel\" (Storm Squadron), and finally the \"Schutzstaffel\" (Protection Squad; SS). Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch). The new SS protected party leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.\nEarly commanders.\nSchreck, a founding member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS. This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.\nBetween 1925 and 1929, the SS was considered to be a small \"Gruppe\" (battalion) of the SA. Except in the Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth. As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed better organisational abilities than Heiden. The SS established a number of \"Gaue\" (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaue consisted of \"SS-Gau Berlin\", \"SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg\", \"SS-Gau Franken\", \"SS-Gau Niederbayern\", \"SS-Gau Rheinland-S\u00fcd\", and \"SS-Gau Sachsen\".\nHimmler appointed.\nWith Hitler's approval, Himmler assumed the position of \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" in January 1929. There are differing accounts of the reason for Heiden's dismissal from his position as head of the SS. The party announced that it was for \"family reasons\". Under Himmler, the SS expanded and gained a larger foothold. He considered the SS an elite, ideologically driven National Socialist organisation, a \"conflation of Teutonic knights, the Jesuits, and Japanese Samurai\". His ultimate aim was to turn the SS into the most powerful organisation in Germany and the most influential branch of the party. He expanded the SS to 3,000 members in his first year as its leader.\nIn 1929, the \"SS-Hauptamt\" (main SS office) was expanded and reorganised into five main offices dealing with general administration, personnel, finance, security, and race matters. At the same time, the SS-Gaue were divided into three \"SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereiche\" areas, namely the \"SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich Ost\", \"SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich West\", and \"SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich S\u00fcd\". The lower levels of the SS remained largely unchanged. Although officially still considered a sub-organisation of the SA and answerable to the \"Stabschef\" (SA Chief of Staff), it was also during this time that Himmler began to establish the independence of the SS from the SA. The SS grew in size and power due to its exclusive loyalty to Hitler, as opposed to the SA, which was seen as semi-independent and a threat to Hitler's hegemony over the party, mainly because they demanded a \"second revolution\" beyond the one that brought the Nazi Party to power. By the end of 1933, the membership of the SS reached 209,000. Under Himmler's leadership, the SS continued to gather greater power as more and more state and party functions were assigned to its jurisdiction. Over time the SS became answerable only to Hitler, a development typical of the organisational structure of the entire Nazi regime, where legal norms were replaced by actions undertaken under the (leader principle), where Hitler's will was considered to be above the law.\nIn the latter half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the creation of \"SS-Junkerschule\", institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad T\u00f6lz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.\nIdeology.\nThe SS was regarded as the Nazi Party's elite unit. In keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany, in the early days all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of Aryan ancestry back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800. Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to proving only the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the Nuremberg Laws. Other requirements were complete obedience to the \"F\u00fchrer\" and a commitment to the German people and nation. Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria. Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to Nazi Party doctrine.\nCommitment to SS ideology was emphasised throughout the recruitment, membership process, and training. Members of the SS were indoctrinated in the racial policy of Nazi Germany and were taught that it was necessary to remove from Germany people deemed by that policy as inferior. Esoteric rituals and the awarding of regalia and insignia for milestones in the SS man's career suffused SS members even further with Nazi ideology. Members were expected to renounce their Christian faith, and Christmas was replaced with a solstice celebration. Church weddings were replaced with SS \"Eheweihen\", a pagan ceremony invented by Himmler. These pseudo-religious rites and ceremonies often took place near SS-dedicated monuments or in special SS-designated places. In 1933, Himmler bought Wewelsburg, a castle in Westphalia. He initially intended it to be used as an SS training centre, but its role came to include hosting SS dinners and neo-pagan rituals.\nIn 1936, Himmler wrote in the pamphlet \"The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organisation\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We shall take care that never again in Germany, the heart of Europe, will the Jewish-Bolshevik revolution of subhumans be able to be kindled either from within or through emissaries from without.\nThe SS ideology included the application of brutality and terror as a solution to military and political issues. The SS stressed total loyalty and obedience to orders unto death. Hitler used this as a powerful tool to further his aims and those of the Nazi Party. The SS was entrusted with the commission of war crimes such as the murder of Jewish civilians. Himmler once wrote that an SS man \"hesitates not for a single instant, but executes unquestioningly...\" any \"F\u00fchrer-Befehl\" (\"F\u00fchrer\" order). Their official motto was \"Meine Ehre hei\u00dft Treue\" (My Honour is Loyalty).\nAs part of its race-centric functions during World War II, the SS oversaw the isolation and displacement of Jews from the populations of the conquered territories, seizing their assets and deporting them to concentration camps and ghettos, where they were used as slave labour or immediately murdered. Chosen to implement the Final Solution ordered by Hitler, the SS were the main group responsible for the institutional murder and democide of more than 20 million people during the Holocaust, including approximately 5.2 million to 6 million Jews and 10.5 million Slavs. A significant number of victims were members of other racial or ethnic groups such as the 258,000 Romani. The SS was involved in murdering people viewed as threats to race hygiene or Nazi ideology, including the mentally or physically disabled, homosexuals, and political dissidents. Members of trade unions and those perceived to be affiliated with groups that opposed the regime (religious, political, social, and otherwise), or those whose views were contradictory to the goals of the Nazi Party government, were rounded up in large numbers; these included clergy of all faiths, Jehovah's Witnesses, Freemasons, Communists, and Rotary Club members. According to the judgements rendered at the Nuremberg trials, as well as many war crimes investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organisation that carried out the Holocaust.\nPre-war Germany.\nAfter Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power on 30 January 1933, the SS was considered a state organisation and a branch of the government. Law enforcement gradually became the purview of the SS, and many SS organisations became \"de facto\" government agencies.\nThe SS established a police state within Nazi Germany, using the secret state police and security forces under Himmler's control to suppress resistance to Hitler. In his role as Minister President of Prussia, Hermann G\u00f6ring had in 1933 created a Prussian secret police force, the \"Geheime Staatspolizei\" or Gestapo, and appointed Rudolf Diels as its head. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, G\u00f6ring handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934. Also on that date, in a departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler named his deputy and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Reinhard Heydrich chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Heydrich also continued as head of the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD; security service).\nThe Gestapo's transfer to Himmler was a prelude to the Night of the Long Knives, in which most of the SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the murders. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an elite corps of the Nazi Party, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" now became his actual rank\u00a0\u2013 and the highest rank in the SS, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was \"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\"). As Himmler's position and authority grew, so in effect did his rank.\nOn 17 June 1936, all police forces throughout Germany were united under the purview of Himmler and the SS. Himmler and Heydrich thus became two of the most powerful men in the country's administration. Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, \"Kriminalpolizei\" (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and \"Ordnungspolizei\" (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In his capacity as police chief, Himmler was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick. In practice, since the SS answered only to Hitler, the de facto merger of the SS and the police made the police independent of Frick's control. In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the \"Sicherheitspolizei\" (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.\nDuring \"Kristallnacht\" (9\u201310 November 1938), SS security services clandestinely coordinated violence against Jews as the SS, Gestapo, SD, Kripo, SiPo, and regular police did what they could to ensure that while Jewish synagogues and community centres were destroyed, Jewish-owned businesses and housing remained intact so that they could later be seized. In the end, thousands of Jewish businesses, homes, and graveyards were vandalised and looted, particularly by members of the SA. Some 500 to 1,000 synagogues were destroyed, mostly by arson. On 11 November, Heydrich reported a death toll of 36 people, but later assessments put the number of deaths at up to two thousand. On Hitler's orders, around 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps by 16 November. As many as 2,500 of these people died in the following months. It was at this point that the SS state began in earnest its campaign of terror against political and religious opponents, who they imprisoned without trial or judicial oversight for the sake of \"security, re-education, or prevention\".\nIn September 1939, the authority of the SS expanded further when the senior SS officer in each military district also became its chief of police. Most of these SS and police leaders held the rank of SS-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" or above and answered directly to Himmler in all SS matters within their district. Their role was to police the population and oversee the activities of the SS men within their district. By declaring an emergency, they could bypass the district administrative offices for the SS, SD, SiPo, \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\" (SS-TV; concentration camp guards), and Orpo, thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups.\nHitler's personal bodyguards.\nAs the SS grew in size and importance, so too did Hitler's personal protection forces. Three main SS groups were assigned to protect Hitler. In 1933, his larger personal bodyguard unit (previously the 1st SS-Standarte) was called to Berlin to replace the Army Chancellery Guard, assigned to protect the Chancellor of Germany. Sepp Dietrich commanded the new unit, previously known as SS-Stabswache Berlin; the name was changed to \"SS-Sonderkommando Berlin\". In November 1933, the name was changed to \"Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\". In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\" (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the F\u00fchrer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich Chancellery and the new Reich Chancellery. The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events. At the Berghof, Hitler's residence in the Obersalzberg, a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone.\nFrom 1941 forward, the \"Leibstandarte\" became four distinct entities, the \"Waffen-SS\" division (unconnected to Hitler's protection but a formation of the \"Waffen-SS\"), the Berlin Chancellory Guard, the SS security regiment assigned to the Obersalzberg, and a Munich-based bodyguard unit which protected Hitler when he visited his apartment and the Brown House Nazi Party headquarters in Munich. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.\nTwo other SS units composed the inner ring of Hitler's protection. The \"SS-Begleitkommando des F\u00fchrers\" (Escort Command of the F\u00fchrer), formed in February 1932, served as Hitler's protection escort while he was travelling. This unit consisted of eight men who served around the clock protecting Hitler in shifts. Later the \"SS-Begleitkommando\" was expanded and became known as the \"F\u00fchrerbegleitkommando\" (\"F\u00fchrer\" Escort Command; FBK). It continued under separate command and remained responsible for Hitler's protection. The \"F\u00fchrer Schutzkommando\" (\"F\u00fchrer\" Protection Command; FSK) was a protection unit founded by Himmler in March 1933. Originally it was only charged with protecting Hitler while he was inside the borders of Bavaria. In early 1934, they replaced the \"SS-Begleitkommando\" for Hitler's protection throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the \"Reichssicherheitsdienst\" (Reich Security Service; RSD) in August 1935. Johann Rattenhuber, chief of the RSD, for the most part, took his orders directly from Hitler. The current FBK chief acted as his deputy. Wherever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and FBK would be present. RSD men patrolled the grounds and FBK men provided close security protection inside. The RSD and FBK worked together for security and personal protection during Hitler's trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. By March 1938, both units wore the standard field grey uniform of the SS. The RSD uniform had the SD diamond on the lower left sleeve.\nConcentration camps founded.\nThe SS was closely associated with Nazi Germany's concentration camp system. On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed SS-\"Oberf\u00fchrer\" Theodor Eicke as commandant of Dachau concentration camp, one of the first Nazi concentration camps. It was created to consolidate the many small camps that had been set up by various police agencies and the Nazi Party to house political prisoners. The organisational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\" (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the \"Death's Head Units\", the SS-TV was first organised as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps. Six concentration camps housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race. The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the Nazi regime; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror.\nSS in World War II.\nBy the outbreak of World War\u00a0II, the SS had consolidated into its final form, which comprised three main organisations: the \"Allgemeine SS\", \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\", and the \"Waffen-SS\", which was founded in 1934 as the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe\" (SS-VT) and renamed in 1940. The \"Waffen-SS\" evolved into a second German army alongside the \"Wehrmacht\" and operated in tandem with them, especially with the \"Heer\" (German Army). However, it never obtained total \"independence of command\", nor was it ever a \"serious rival\" to the German Army. Members were never able to join the ranks of the German High Command and it was dependent on the army for heavy weaponry and equipment. Although SS ranks generally had equivalents in the other services, the SS rank system did not copy the terms and ranks used by the \"Wehrmacht\"'s branches. Instead, it used the ranks established by the post-World War I \"Freikorps\" and the SA. This was primarily done to emphasise the SS as being independent of the \"Wehrmacht\".\nInvasion of Poland.\nIn the September 1939 invasion of Poland, the LSSAH and SS-VT fought as separate mobile infantry regiments. The LSSAH became notorious for torching villages without military justification. Members of the LSSAH committed war crimes in numerous towns, including the murder of 50 Polish Jews in B\u0142onie and the massacre of 200 civilians, including children, who were machine-gunned in Z\u0142oczew. Shootings also took place in Boles\u0142awiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, M\u0142awa, and W\u0142oc\u0142awek. Some senior members of the \"Wehrmacht\" were not convinced the units were fully prepared for combat. Its units took unnecessary risks and had a higher casualty rate than the army. \"Generaloberst\" Fedor von Bock was quite critical; following an April 1940 visit of the \"SS-Totenkopf\" division, he found their battle training was \"insufficient\". Hitler thought the criticism was typical of the army's \"outmoded conception of chivalry.\" In its defence, the SS insisted that its armed formations had been hampered by having to fight piecemeal and were improperly equipped by the army.\nAfter the invasion, Hitler entrusted the SS with extermination actions codenamed Operation Tannenberg and AB-Aktion to remove potential leaders who could form a resistance to German occupation. The murders were committed by \"Einsatzgruppen\" (task forces; deployment groups), assisted by local paramilitary groups. Men for the \"Einsatzgruppen\" units were drawn from the SS, the SD, and the police. Seven \"Einsatzgruppen\" were deployed in Poland, and four were particularly active in carrying out mass killings. Victims included Polish nationalists, Roman Catholic clergy, Jews, members of the nobility and intelligentsia, as well as activists, scholars, teachers, and former officers. By the end of 1939, SS units aided by ethnic German auxiliaries had murdered approximately 50,000 Poles, including 7,000 Polish Jews, with broader estimates of Polish civilian deaths reaching up to 65,000 during this period. \"Einsatzgruppe\" Woyrsch began large-scale shootings, especially of Jews, in towns such as Tarn\u00f3w and Katowice and Sosnowiec during the first weeks of September 1939. When the army leadership registered complaints about the brutality being meted out by the \"Einsatzgruppen\", Heydrich informed them that he was acting \"in accordance with the special order of the \"F\u00fchrer\".\"\nSatisfied with their performance in Poland, Hitler allowed further expansion of the armed SS formations but insisted new units remain under the operational control of the army. While the \"SS-Leibstandarte\" remained an independent regiment functioning as Hitler's personal bodyguards, the other regiments\u2014\"SS-Deutschland\", \"SS-Germania,\" and \"SS-Der F\u00fchrer\"\u2014were combined to form the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungs-Division\". A second SS division, the \"SS-Totenkopf\", was formed from SS-TV concentration camp guards, and a third, the \"SS-Polizei\", was created from police volunteers. The SS gained control over its own recruitment, logistics, and supply systems for its armed formations at this time. The SS, Gestapo, and SD were in charge of the provisional military administration in Poland until the appointment of Hans Frank as Governor-General on 26 October 1939.\nBattle of France.\nOn 10 May 1940, Hitler launched the Battle of France, a major offensive against France and the Low Countries. The SS supplied two of the 89 divisions employed. The LSSAH and elements of the SS-VT participated in the ground invasion of the Netherlands. Simultaneously, airborne troops were dropped to capture key Dutch airfields, bridges, and railways. In the five-day campaign, the LSSAH linked up with army units and airborne troops after several clashes with Dutch defenders.\nSS troops did not take part in the thrust through the Ardennes and the river Meuse. Instead, the \"SS-Totenkopf\" was summoned from the army reserve to fight in support of \"Generalmajor\" Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division as they advanced toward the English Channel. On 21 May, the British launched an armoured counterattack against the flanks of the 7th Panzer Division and \"SS-Totenkopf\". The Germans then trapped the British and French troops in a huge pocket at Dunkirk. On 27 May, 4 Company \"SS-Totenkopf\" perpetrated the Le Paradis massacre, where 97 men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment were machine-gunned after surrendering, with survivors finished off with bayonets. Two men survived. By 28 May the \"SS-Leibstandarte\" had taken Wormhout, from Dunkirk. There, soldiers of the 2nd Battalion were responsible for the Wormhoudt massacre, where 81 British and French soldiers were murdered after they surrendered. According to historian Charles Sydnor, the \"fanatical recklessness in the assault, suicidal defence against enemy attacks, and savage atrocities committed in the face of frustrated objectives\" exhibited by the \"SS-Totenkopf\" division during the invasion were typical of the SS troops as a whole.\nAt the close of the campaign, Hitler expressed his pleasure with the performance of the \"SS-Leibstandarte\", telling them: \"Henceforth it will be an honour for you, who bear my name, to lead every German attack.\" The SS-VT was renamed the \"Waffen-SS\" in a speech made by Hitler in July 1940. Hitler then authorised the enlistment of \"people perceived to be of related stock\", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes, and Finns volunteered to fight in the \"Waffen-SS\" under the command of German officers. They were brought together to form the new division \"SS-Wiking\". In January 1941, the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungs\" Division was renamed \"SS-Reich\" Division (Motorised), and was renamed as the 2nd SS Panzer Division \"Das Reich\" when it was reorganised as a \"Panzergrenadier\" division in 1942.\nCampaign in the Balkans.\nIn April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and \"Das Reich\" were attached to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the \"Das Reich\" division, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. In some cases, they were joined by the \"Wehrmacht\". Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist mass murder. Serbia became the second country (after Estonia) declared \"Judenfrei\" (free of Jews).\nIn Greece, the \"Wehrmacht\" and \"Waffen-SS\" encountered resistance from the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and the Greek Army. The fighting was intensified by the mountainous terrain, with its heavily defended narrow passes. The LSSAH was at the forefront of the German push. The BEF evacuated by sea to Crete, but had to flee again in late May when the Germans arrived. Like Yugoslavia, the conquest of Greece brought its Jews into danger, as the Nazis immediately took a variety of measures against them. Initially confined in ghettos, most were transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in March 1943, where they were murdered in the gas chambers on arrival. Of Greece's 80,000 Jews, only 20 per cent survived the war.\nWar in the east.\nOn 22 June 1941, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. The expanding war and the need to control occupied territories provided the conditions for Himmler to further consolidate the police and military organs of the SS. Rapid acquisition of vast territories in the East placed considerable strain on the SS police organisations as they struggled to adjust to the changing security challenges.\nThe 1st and 2nd SS Infantry Brigades, which had been formed from surplus concentration camp guards of the SS-TV, and the SS Cavalry Brigade moved into the Soviet Union behind the advancing armies. At first, they fought Soviet partisans, but by the autumn of 1941, they left the anti-partisan role to other units and actively took part in the Holocaust. While assisting the \"Einsatzgruppen\", they formed firing parties that participated in the liquidation of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.\nOn 31 July 1941, G\u00f6ring gave Heydrich written authorisation to ensure the cooperation of administrative leaders of various government departments to undertake genocide of the Jews in territories under German control. Heydrich was instrumental in carrying out these exterminations, as the Gestapo was ready to organise deportations in the West and his \"Einsatzgruppen\" were already conducting extensive murder operations in the East. On 20 January 1942, Heydrich chaired a meeting, called the Wannsee Conference, to discuss the implementation of the plan.\nDuring battles in the Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the \"Waffen-SS\" suffered enormous casualties. The LSSAH and \"Das Reich\" lost over half their troops to illness and combat casualties. In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept soldiers that did not fit the original SS racial profile. In early 1942, \"SS-Leibstandarte\", \"SS-Totenkopf\", and \"SS-Das Reich\" were withdrawn to the West to refit and were converted to \"Panzergrenadier\" divisions. The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March.\nThe Holocaust.\nThe SS was built on a culture of violence, which was exhibited in its most extreme form by the mass murder of civilians and prisoners of war on the Eastern Front. Augmented by personnel from the Kripo, Orpo (Order Police), and \"Waffen-SS\", the \"Einsatzgruppen\" reached a total strength of 3,000 men. \"Einsatzgruppen\" A, B, and C were attached to Army Groups North, Centre, and South; \"Einsatzgruppe\" D was assigned to the 11th Army. The \"Einsatzgruppe\" for Special Purposes operated in eastern Poland starting in July 1941. Historian Richard Rhodes describes them as being \"outside the bounds of morality\"; they were \"judge, jury and executioner all in one\", with the authority to kill anyone at their discretion. Following Operation Barbarossa, these \"Einsatzgruppen\" units, together with the \"Waffen-SS\" and Order Police as well as with assistance from the \"Wehrmacht\", engaged in the mass murder of the Jewish population in occupied eastern Poland and the Soviet Union. The greatest extent of \"Einsatzgruppen\" action occurred in 1941 and 1942 in Ukraine and Russia. Before the invasion there were five million registered Jews throughout the Soviet Union, with three million of those residing in the territories occupied by the Germans; by the time the war ended, over two million of these had been murdered.\nThe extermination activities of the \"Einsatzgruppen\" generally followed a standard procedure, with the \"Einsatzgruppen\" chief contacting the nearest \"Wehrmacht\" unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially, the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on the mental health of his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of murder should be found, which led to the introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, as they regarded removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them to have been unpleasant. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.\nAnti-partisan operations.\nIn response to the army's difficulties in dealing with Soviet partisans, Hitler decided in July 1942 to transfer anti-partisan operations to the police. This placed the matter under Himmler's purview. As Hitler had ordered on 8 July 1941 that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, the term \"anti-partisan operations\" was used as a euphemism for the murder of Jews as well as actual combat against resistance elements. In July 1942 Himmler ordered that the term \"partisan\" should no longer be used; instead resisters to Nazi rule would be described as \"bandits\".\nHimmler set the SS and SD to work on developing additional anti-partisan tactics and launched a propaganda campaign. Sometime in June 1943, Himmler issued the \"Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung\" (bandit fighting) order, simultaneously announcing the existence of the \"Bandenkampfverb\u00e4nde\" (bandit fighting formations), with \"SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski as its chief. Employing troops primarily from the SS police and \"Waffen-SS\", the \"Bandenkampfverb\u00e4nde\" had four principal operational components: propaganda, centralised control and coordination of security operations, training of troops, and battle operations. Once the \"Wehrmacht\" had secured territorial objectives, the \"Bandenkampfverb\u00e4nde\" first secured communications facilities, roads, railways, and waterways. Thereafter, they secured rural communities and economic installations such as factories and administrative buildings. An additional priority was securing agricultural and forestry resources. The SS oversaw the collection of the harvest, which was deemed critical to strategic operations. Any Jews in the area were rounded up and killed. Communists and people of Asiatic descent were killed presumptively under the assumption that they were Soviet agents.\nDeath camps.\nAfter the start of the war, Himmler intensified the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.\nIntensification of the killing operations took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of \"Einsatzgruppen\" for mass murders. Victims at these new extermination camps were killed with the use of carbon monoxide gas from automobile engines. During Operation Reinhard, run by officers from the \"Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\", who were sworn to secrecy, three extermination camps were built in occupied Poland: Be\u0142\u017cec (operational by March 1942), Sobib\u00f3r (operational by May 1942), and Treblinka (operational by July 1942), with squads of Trawniki men (Eastern European collaborators) overseeing hundreds of \"Sonderkommando\" prisoners, who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves. On Himmler's orders, by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.\nFor administrative reasons, all concentration camp guards and administrative staff became full members of the \"Waffen-SS\" in 1942. The concentration camps were placed under the command of the \"SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt\" (SS Main Economic and Administrative Office; WVHA) under Oswald Pohl. Richard Gl\u00fccks served as the Inspector of Concentration Camps, which in 1942 became office \"D\" under the WVHA. Exploitation and extermination became a balancing act as the military situation deteriorated. The labour needs of the war economy, especially for skilled workers, meant that some Jews escaped the genocide. On 30 October 1942, due to severe labour shortages in Germany, Himmler ordered that large numbers of able-bodied people in Nazi-occupied Soviet territories be taken prisoner and sent to Germany as forced labour.\nBy 1944, the SS-TV had been organised into three divisions: staff of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members in and out of the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded \"Waffen-SS\" members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organisation liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nBusiness empire.\nIn 1934, Himmler founded the first SS business venture, \"Nordland-Verlag\", a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased Allach Porcelain, which then began to produce SS memorabilia. Because of the labour shortage and a desire for financial gain, the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labour. Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's \"Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt\" (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939. Even then, most of the enterprises did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for their business experience, and the workers were starving. In July 1940 Pohl established the \"Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH\" (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns. Eventually, the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.\nIn May 1941 the VuWHA founded the \"Deutsche Ausr\u00fcstungswerke\" GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), which was created to integrate the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each had at least one factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing labourers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III\u2013Monowitz. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. The life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. This was typical of the camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labour.\nIn 1942, Himmler consolidated all of the offices for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (\"Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt\"; WVHA). The entire concentration camp system was placed under the authority of the WVHA. The SS owned Sudetenquell GmbH, a mineral water producer in the Sudetenland. By 1944, the SS had purchased 75 per cent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly. Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned \"Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke\" (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST). In the occupied Eastern territories, the SS acquired a monopoly in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks. The DWB also founded the \"Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke\" (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and \"Deutsche Edelm\u00f6bel\" GmbH (German Noble Furniture). These operated in factories the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles.\nThe SS owned experimental farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, clothing and uniform factories, and small arms factories. Under the direction of the WVHA, the SS sold camp labour to various factories at a rate of three to six \"Reichsmarks\" per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings. The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as of silver, of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114\u00a0kg of pearls. According to Nazi legislation, Jewish property belonged to the state, but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal gain or took seized foodstuffs and alcohol to sell on the black market.\nMilitary reversals.\nOn 5 July 1943, the Germans launched the Battle of Kursk, an offensive designed to eliminate the Kursk salient. Three SS armored divisions of the II SS Panzer Corps (1. SS \"LSSAH\", 2. SS \"Das Reich\" and 3. SS \"Totenkopf\") participated alongside Wehrmacht Panzer divisions. Due to stiff Soviet resistance, Hitler halted the attack by the evening of 12 July. On 17 July he called off the operation and ordered a withdrawal. Thereafter, the Germans were forced onto the defensive as the Red Army began the liberation of Western Russia. The losses incurred by the \"Waffen-SS\" and the \"Wehrmacht\" during the Battle of Kursk occurred nearly simultaneously with the Allied assault into Italy, opening a two-front war for Germany.\nNormandy landings.\nAlarmed by the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler had ordered the construction of fortifications he called the Atlantic Wall all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. Concrete gun emplacements were constructed at strategic points along the coast, and wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles were placed on the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. In addition to several static infantry divisions, eleven panzer and \"Panzergrenadier\" divisions were deployed nearby. Four of these formations were \"Waffen-SS\" divisions. In addition, the \"SS-Das Reich\" was located in Southern France, the LSSAH was in Belgium refitting after fighting in the Soviet Union, and the newly formed panzer division \"SS-Hitlerjugend\", consisting of 17- and 18-year-old Hitler Youth members supported by combat veterans and experienced NCOs, was stationed west of Paris. The creation of the \"SS-Hitlerjugend\" was a sign of Hitler's desperation for more troops, especially ones with unquestioning obedience.\nThe Normandy landings took place beginning on 6 June 1944. The 21st Panzer Division under \"Generalmajor\" Edgar Feuchtinger, positioned south of Caen, was the only panzer division close to the beaches. The division included 146 tanks and 50 assault guns, plus supporting infantry and artillery. At 02:00, \"Generalleutnant\" Wilhelm Richter, commander of the 716th Static Infantry Division, ordered the 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime, on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne. \"SS-Hitlerjugend\" began to deploy in the afternoon of 6 June, with its units undertaking defensive actions the following day. They also took part in the Battle for Caen (June\u2013August 1944). On 7\u20138 and 17 June, members of the \"SS-Hitlerjugend\" shot and killed twenty Canadian prisoners of war in the Ardenne Abbey massacre.\nThe Allies continued to make progress in the liberation of France, and on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter-offensive (Operation L\u00fcttich) from Vire towards Avranches. The operation included LSSAH, \"Das Reich\", 2nd, and 116th Panzer Divisions, with support from infantry and elements of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division \"G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen\" under \"SS-Oberstgruppenf\u00fchrer\" Paul Hausser. These forces were to mount an offensive near Mortain and drive west through Avranches to the coast. The Allied forces were prepared for this offensive, and an air assault on the combined German units proved devastating. On 21 August, 50,000 German troops, including most of the LSSAH, were encircled by the Allies in the Falaise Pocket. Remnants of the LSSAH which escaped were withdrawn to Germany for refitting. Paris was liberated on 25 August, and the last of the German forces withdrew over the Seine by the end of August, ending the Normandy campaign.\nBattle for Germany.\n\"Waffen-SS\" units that had survived the summer campaigns were withdrawn from the front line to refit. Two of them, the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, did so in the Arnhem region of Holland in early September 1944. Coincidentally, on 17 September, the Allies launched in the same area Operation Market Garden, a combined airborne and land operation designed to seize control of the lower Rhine. The 9th and 10th Panzers were among the units that repulsed the attack.\nIn December 1944, Hitler launched the Ardennes Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Bulge, a significant counterattack against the western Allies through the Ardennes with the aim of reaching Antwerp while encircling the Allied armies in the area. The offensive began with an artillery barrage shortly before dawn on 16 December. Spearheading the attack were two panzer armies composed largely of \"Waffen-SS\" divisions. The battlegroups found advancing through the forests and wooded hills of the Ardennes difficult in the winter weather, but they initially made good progress in the northern sector. They soon encountered strong resistance from the US 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions. By 23 December, the weather improved enough for Allied air forces to attack the German forces and their supply columns, causing fuel shortages. In increasingly difficult conditions, the German advance slowed and was stopped. Hitler's failed offensive cost 700 tanks and most of their remaining mobile forces in the west, as well as most of their irreplaceable reserves of manpower and materiel.\nDuring the battle, SS-\"Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Joachim Peiper left a path of destruction, which included \"Waffen-SS\" soldiers under his command murdering American POWs and unarmed Belgian civilians in the Malmedy massacre. Captured SS soldiers who were part of \"Kampfgruppe Peiper\" were tried during the Malmedy massacre trial following the war for this massacre and several others in the area. Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper was imprisoned for eleven years for his role in the murders.\nIn the east, the Red Army resumed its offensive on 12 January 1945. German forces were outnumbered twenty to one in aircraft, eleven to one in infantry, and seven to one in tanks on the Eastern Front. By the end of the month, the Red Army had made bridgeheads across the Oder, the last geographic obstacle before Berlin. The western Allies continued to advance as well, but not as rapidly as the Red Army. The Panzer Corps conducted a successful defensive operation on 17\u201324 February at the Hron River, stalling the Allied advance towards Vienna. The 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Corps made their way towards Austria but were slowed by damaged railways.\nBudapest fell on 13 February. Hitler ordered Dietrich's 6th Panzer Army to move into Hungary to protect the Nagykanizsa oilfields and refineries, which he deemed the most strategically valuable fuel reserves on the Eastern Front. \"Fr\u00fchlingserwachsen\" (Operation Spring Awakening), the final German offensive in the east, took place in early March. German forces attacked near Lake Balaton, with 6th Panzer Army advancing north towards Budapest and 2nd Panzer Army moving east and south. Dietrich's forces at first made good progress, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance brought them to a halt. By 16 March, the battle was lost. Enraged by the defeat, Hitler ordered the \"Waffen-SS\" units involved to remove their cuff titles as a mark of disgrace. Dietrich refused to carry out the order.\nBy this time, on both the Eastern and Western Front, the activities of the SS were becoming clear to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun. Allied troops were filled with disbelief and repugnance at the evidence of Nazi brutality in the camps.\nOn 9 April 1945, K\u00f6nigsberg fell to the Red Army, and on 13 April Dietrich's SS unit was forced out of Vienna. The Battle of Berlin began at 03:30 on 16 April with a massive artillery barrage. Within the week, fighting was taking place inside the city. Among the many elements defending Berlin were French, Latvian, and Scandinavian \"Waffen-SS\" troops. Hitler, now residing in the \"F\u00fchrerbunker\" under the Reich Chancellery, continued to hope that his remaining SS soldiers could rescue the capital. In spite of the hopelessness of the situation, members of the SS patrolling the city continued to shoot or hang soldiers and civilians for what they considered to be acts of cowardice or defeatism. The Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May, two days after Hitler committed suicide. As members of SS expected little mercy from the Red Army, they attempted to move westward to surrender to the western Allies instead.\nSS units and branches.\nReich Security Main Office.\nHeydrich held the title of \"Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD\" (Chief of the Security Police and SD) until 27 September 1939, when he became chief of the newly established Reich Security Main Office (RSHA). From that point forward, the RSHA was in charge of SS security services. It had under its command the SD, Kripo, and Gestapo, as well as several offices to handle finance, administration, and supply. Heinrich M\u00fcller, who had been chief of operations for the Gestapo, was appointed Gestapo chief at this time. Arthur Nebe was chief of the Kripo, and the two branches of SD were commanded by a series of SS officers, including Otto Ohlendorf and Walter Schellenberg. The SD was considered an elite branch of the SS, and its members were better educated and typically more ambitious than those within the ranks of the \"Allgemeine SS\". Members of the SD were specially trained in criminology, intelligence, and counterintelligence. They also gained a reputation for ruthlessness and unwavering commitment to Nazi ideology.\nHeydrich was attacked in Prague on 27 May 1942 by a British-trained team of Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been sent by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile to assassinate him in Operation Anthropoid. He died from his injuries a week later. Himmler ran the RSHA personally until 30 January 1943, when Heydrich's positions were taken over by Kaltenbrunner.\n\"SS-Sonderkommandos\".\nBeginning in 1938 and throughout World War II, the SS enacted a procedure where offices and units of the SS could form smaller sub-units, known as \"SS-Sonderkommandos\", to carry out special tasks, including large-scale murder operations. The use of \"SS-Sonderkommandos\" was widespread. According to former SS-\"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Wilhelm H\u00f6ttl, not even the SS leadership knew how many \"SS-Sonderkommandos\" were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, especially on the Eastern Front.\nAn \"SS-Sonderkommando\" unit led by SS-\"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Herbert Lange murdered 1,201 psychiatric patients at the Tiegenhof psychiatric hospital in the Free City of Danzig, 1,100 patients in Owi\u0144ska, 2,750 patients at Ko\u015bcian, and 1,558 patients at Dzia\u0142dowo, as well as hundreds of Poles at Fort VII, where the mobile gas van and gassing bunker were developed. In 1941\u201342, \"SS-Sonderkommando Lange\" set up and managed the first extermination camp, at Che\u0142mno, where 152,000 Jews were killed using gas vans.\nAfter the Battle of Stalingrad ended in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war and ordered the formation of \" Sonderkommando\" 1005, a special task force under SS-\"Standartenf\u00fchrer\" Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.\nThe \"Eichmann Sonderkommando\" was a task force headed by Adolf Eichmann that arrived in Budapest on 19 March 1944, the same day that Axis forces invaded Hungary. Their task was to take a direct role in the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The \"SS-Sonderkommandos\" enlisted the aid of antisemitic elements from the Hungarian gendarmerie and pro-German administrators from within the Hungarian Interior Ministry. Round-ups began on 16 April, and from 14 May, four trains of 3,000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres from the gas chambers. Between 10 and 25 per cent of the people on each train were chosen as forced labourers; the rest were killed within hours of arrival. Under international pressure, the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944, by which time over 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had been murdered.\n\"Einsatzgruppen\".\nThe \"Einsatzgruppen\" had its origins in the ad hoc \"Einsatzkommando\" formed by Heydrich following the \"Anschluss\" in Austria in March 1938. Two units of \"Einsatzgruppen\" were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary because of the Munich Agreement, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. The \"Einsatzgruppen\" also followed \"Wehrmacht\" troops and killed potential partisans. Similar groups were used in 1939 for the occupation of Czechoslovakia.\nHitler felt that the planned extermination of the Jews was too difficult and important to be entrusted to the military. In 1941 the \"Einsatzgruppen\" were sent into the Soviet Union to begin large-scale genocide of Jews, Romani people, and communists. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the \"Einsatzgruppen\" and related agencies murdered more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews. The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the \"Einsatzgruppen\" was at Babi Yar outside Kiev, where 33,771 Jews were massacred in a single operation on 29\u201330 September 1941. In the Rumbula massacre (November\u2013December 1941), 25,000 victims from the Riga ghetto were murdered. In another set of mass shootings (December 1941 \u2013 January 1942), the \"Einsatzgruppe\" massacred over 10,000 Jews at Drobytsky Yar in Kharkov.\nThe last \"Einsatzgruppen\" were disbanded in mid-1944 (although some continued to exist on paper until 1945) due to the German retreat on both fronts and the consequent inability to continue extermination activities. Former \"Einsatzgruppen\" members were either assigned duties in the \"Waffen-SS\" or concentration camps. Twenty-four \"Einsatzgruppen\" commanders were tried for war crimes following the war.\nSS Court Main Office.\nThe SS Court Main Office (\"Hauptamt SS-Gericht\") was an internal legal system for conducting investigations, trials, and punishment of the SS and police. It had more than 600 lawyers on staff in the main offices in Berlin and Munich. Proceedings were conducted at 38 regional SS courts throughout Germany. It was the only authority authorised to try SS personnel, except for SS members who were on active duty in the \"Wehrmacht\" (in such cases, the SS member in question was tried by a standard military tribunal). Its creation placed the SS beyond the reach of civilian legal authority. Himmler personally intervened as he saw fit regarding convictions and punishment. Historian Karl Dietrich Bracher describes this court system as one factor in the creation of the Nazi totalitarian police state, as it removed objective legal procedures, rendering citizens defenceless against the \"summary justice of the SS terror.\"\nSS Cavalry.\nShortly after Hitler seized power in 1933, most horse riding associations were taken over by the SA and SS. Members received combat training to serve in the \"Reiter-SS\" (SS Cavalry Corps). The first SS cavalry regiment, designated \"SS-Totenkopf Reitstandarte 1\", was formed in September 1939. Commanded by then SS-\"Standartenf\u00fchrer\" Hermann Fegelein, the unit was assigned to Poland, where they took part in the extermination of Polish intelligentsia. Additional squadrons were added in May 1940, for a total of fourteen.\nThe unit was split into two regiments in December 1939, with Fegelein in charge of both. By March 1941 their strength was 3,500 men. In July 1941, they were assigned to the Pripyat Marshes massacres, tasked with rounding up and exterminating Jews and partisans in the Pripyat swamps. The two regiments were amalgamated into the SS Cavalry Brigade on 31 July, twelve days after the operation started. Fegelein's final report, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, and 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken. Historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses in November 1941 in the Battle of Moscow, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons. Fegelein was appointed as commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" on 20 April 1943. This unit saw service in the Soviet Union in attacks on partisans and civilians. In addition, SS Cavalry regiments served in Croatia and Hungary.\nSS Medical Corps.\nThe SS Medical Corps were initially known as the \"Sanit\u00e4tsstaffel\" (sanitary units). After 1931, the SS formed the headquarters office \"Amt\" V as the central office for SS medical units. An SS medical academy was established in Berlin in 1938 to train \"Waffen-SS\" physicians. SS medical personnel did not often provide actual medical care; their primary responsibility was medicalised genocide. At Auschwitz, about three quarters of new arrivals, including almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit were killed within hours of arrival. In their role as \"Desinfektoren\" (disinfectors), SS doctors also made selections among existing prisoners as to their fitness to work and supervised the murder of those deemed unfit. Inmates in deteriorating health were examined by SS doctors, who decided whether or not they would be able to recover in less than two weeks. Those too ill or injured to recover in that time frame were killed.\nAt Auschwitz, the actual delivery of gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most well-known SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned to do so in the hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.\nOther SS units.\n\"Ahnenerbe\".\nThe \"Ahnenerbe\" (Ancestral Heritage Organisation) was founded in 1935 by Himmler and became part of the SS in 1939. It was an umbrella agency for more than fifty organisations tasked with studying German racial identity and ancient Germanic traditions and language. The agency sponsored archaeological expeditions in Germany, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Tibet, and elsewhere to search for evidence of Aryan roots, influence, and superiority. Further planned expeditions were postponed indefinitely at the start of the war.\n\"SS-Helferinnenkorps\".\nThe \"SS-Helferinnenkorps\" (lit.\u2009'SS Women\u2019s Auxiliary Corps') were female auxiliary members of the \"Waffen-SS\". The organization was created to free men for combat by assigning women to non-combat support roles such as administration, communications, and logistics. Established in 1942 under the direction of Ernst Sachs, it was Himmler's intention to create a \"sister organisation to the Schutzstaffel\". Around 10,000 women served in the \"SS-Helferinnenkorps\", in addition to 15,000 police auxiliaries. They were present in diverse areas, from the offices of the Reich Security Main Office in Berlin to the concentration camps.\nIn 1942, Himmler set up the \"Reichsschule f\u00fcr SS Helferinnen\" (Reich School for SS Helpers) in Oberehnheim to train women in communications, again to free up men for combat roles. Himmler intended to replace all female civilian employees in his service with \"SS-Helferinnen\" members, as they were selected and trained according to Nazi ideology. The school was closed on 22 November 1944 due to the Allied advance.\n\"SS-Gefolge\".\nThe \"SS-Gefolge\" (lit.\u2009'SS entourage') served as civilian employees without formal SS membership or combat training. They were affiliated with the \"Waffen-SS\". Their roles were primarily administrative, working as guards and auxiliaries in concentration camps, with 3,517 female guards (comprising 10% of the total in January 1945), including around 200 at Auschwitz. Often trained at Ravensbr\u00fcck, they took loyalty oaths and enforced camp policies tied to The Holocaust, sterilization, and euthanasia, and supervised prisoners, aiding Nazi racial policies.\nForeign legions and volunteers.\nBeginning in 1940, Himmler opened up \"Waffen-SS\" recruiting to ethnic Germans that were not German citizens. In March 1941, the SS Main Office established the \"Germanische Leitstelle\" (Germanic Guidance Office) to establish \"Waffen-SS\" recruiting offices in Nazi-occupied Europe. The majority of the resulting foreign \"Waffen-SS\" units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix \"Waffen\" instead of SS. Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions, the \"SS-Wiking\" and \"SS-Nordland\". Swiss German speakers joined in substantial numbers. Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the \"SS-Nederland\" legion, and their Walloon compatriots joined the \"SS-Wallonien\". By the end of 1943 about a quarter of the SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe, and by June 1944, half the \"Waffen-SS\" were foreign nationals.\nAdditional \"Waffen-SS\" units were added from the Ukrainians, Albanians from Kosovo, Serbians, Croatians, Turkic, Caucasians, Cossack, and Tatars. The Ukrainians and Tatars, who had suffered persecution under Joseph Stalin, were likely motivated primarily by opposition to the Soviet government rather than ideological agreement with the SS. The exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini was made an SS-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" by Himmler in May 1943. He subsequently used antisemitism and anti-Serb racism to recruit a \"Waffen-SS\" division of Bosnian Muslims, the \"SS-Handschar\". The year-long Soviet occupation of the Baltic states at the beginning of World War II resulted in volunteers for Latvian and Estonian \"Waffen-SS\" units. The Estonian Legion had 1,280 volunteers under training by the end of 1942. Approximately 25,000 men served in the Estonian SS division, with thousands more conscripted into Police Front battalions and border guard units. Most of the Estonians were fighting primarily to regain their independence and as many as 15,000 of them died fighting alongside the Germans. In early 1944, Himmler even contacted Pohl to suggest releasing Muslim prisoners from concentration camps to supplement his SS troops.\nThe Indian Legion was a \"Wehrmacht\" unit formed in August 1942 chiefly from disaffected Indian soldiers of the British Indian Army captured in the North African Campaign. In August 1944 it was transferred to the auspices of the \"Waffen-SS\" as the \"Indische Freiwilligen-Legion der Waffen-SS\". There was also a French volunteer division, \"SS-Charlemagne\", which was formed in 1944 mainly from the remnants of the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and French \"Sturmbrigade\".\nRanks and uniforms.\nThe SS established its own symbolism, rituals, customs, ranks, and uniforms to set itself apart from other organisations. Before 1929, the SS wore the same brown uniform as the SA, with the addition of a black tie and a black cap with a \"Totenkopf\" (death's head) skull and bones symbol, moving to an all-black uniform in 1932. In 1935, the SS combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey for everyday wear. The SS also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with camouflage patterns. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labour. Many were produced in concentration camps.\nHitler and the Nazi Party understood the power of emblems and insignia to influence public opinion. The stylised lightning bolt logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of runes from a set of 18 Armanen runes created by Guido von List in 1906. It is similar to the ancient Sowil\u014d rune, which symbolises the sun, but was renamed as \"Sig\" (victory) in List's iconography. The \"Totenkopf\" symbolised the wearer's willingness to fight unto the death, and also served to frighten the enemy.\nSS membership estimates 1925\u20131945.\nAfter 1933 a career in the SS became increasingly attractive to Germany's social elite, who began joining the movement in great numbers, usually motivated by political opportunism. By 1938 about one-third of the SS leadership were members of the upper middle class. The trend reversed after the first Soviet counter-offensive of 1942.\nSS offices.\nBy 1942 all activities of the SS were managed through twelve main offices.\nAustrian SS.\nThe term \"Austrian SS\" is often used to describe that portion of the SS membership from Austria, but it was never a recognised branch of the SS. In contrast to SS members from other countries, who were grouped into either the Germanic-SS or the Foreign Legions of the \"Waffen-SS\", Austrian SS members were regular SS personnel. It was technically under the command of the SS in Germany but often acted independently concerning Austrian affairs. The Austrian SS was founded in 1930 and by 1934 was acting as a covert force to bring about the \"Anschluss\" with Germany, which occurred in March 1938. Early Austrian SS leaders were Kaltenbrunner and Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Austrian SS members served in every branch of the SS. Austrians constituted 8 per cent of Nazi Germany's population and 13 per cent of the SS; 40 per cent of the staff and 75 per cent of commanders at death camps were Austrian.\nAfter the \"Anschluss\", the Austrian SS was folded into \"SS-Oberabschnitt Donau\". The third regiment of the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe\" (\"Der F\u00fchrer\") and the fourth \"Totenkopf\" regiment (\"Ostmark\") were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass arrests of potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the \"Anschluss\". Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the \"Anschluss\". Before the invasion of the Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest of the camps in the Greater German Reich.\nThe Hotel Metropole was transformed into the headquarters for the Gestapo in Vienna in April 1938. With a staff of 900 (80 per cent of whom were recruited from the Austrian police), it was the largest Gestapo office outside Berlin. An estimated 50,000 people were interrogated or tortured there. The Gestapo in Vienna was headed by Franz Josef Huber, who also served as chief of the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna. Although its de facto leaders were Adolf Eichmann and later Alois Brunner, Huber was nevertheless responsible for the mass deportation of Austrian Jews.\nPost-war activity and aftermath.\nFollowing Nazi Germany's collapse, the SS ceased to exist. Numerous members of the SS, many of them still committed Nazis, remained at large in Germany and across Europe. On 21 May 1945, the British captured Himmler, who was in disguise and carrying a fraudulent passport. At an internment camp near L\u00fcneburg, he committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule. Several other leading members of the SS fled, but some were quickly captured. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA and the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief upon Himmler's suicide, was captured and arrested in the Bavarian Alps. He was among the 22 defendants put on trial at the International Military Tribunal in 1945\u201346.\nSome SS members were subject to summary execution, torture, and beatings at the hands of freed prisoners, displaced persons, or Allied soldiers. American soldiers of the 157th Regiment, who entered the concentration camp at Dachau in April 1945 and viewed the acts committed by the SS, shot some of the remaining SS camp guards. On 15 April 1945, British troops entered Bergen-Belsen. They placed the SS guards on starvation rations, made them work without breaks, forced them to deal with the remaining corpses, and stabbed them with bayonets or struck them with their rifle butts if they slowed their pace. Some members of the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps delivered captured SS camp guards to displaced person camps, where they knew they would be subject to summary execution.\nInternational Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.\nThe Allies commenced legal proceedings against captured Nazis, establishing the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945. The first war crimes trial of 24 prominent figures such as G\u00f6ring, Albert Speer, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945. They were accused of four counts: conspiracy, waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law. Twelve received the death penalty, including Kaltenbrunner, who was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946. The former commandant at Auschwitz, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, who testified on behalf of Kaltenbrunner and others, was tried and executed in 1947.\nAdditional SS trials and convictions followed. Many defendants attempted to exculpate themselves using the excuse that they were merely following superior orders, which they had to obey unconditionally as part of their sworn oath and duty. The courts did not find this to be a legitimate defence. A trial of 40 SS officers and guards from Auschwitz took place in Krak\u00f3w in November 1947. Most were found guilty, and 23 received the death penalty. The twelve subsequent Nuremberg trials took place in 1946\u20131949; also, an estimated 37,000 members of the SS were tried and convicted in Soviet courts. Sentences included hangings and long terms of hard labour. Piotr Cywi\u0144ski, director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, estimates that of the 70,000 members of the SS involved in crimes in concentration camps, only about 1,650 to 1,700 were tried after the war. The International Military Tribunal declared the SS a criminal organisation in 1946.\nEscapes.\nAfter the war, many former Nazis fled to South America, especially to Argentina, where they were welcomed by Juan Per\u00f3n's regime. In the 1950s, former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that Buenos Aires resident Ricardo Klement was, in fact, Adolf Eichmann, who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organisation directed by Bishop Alois Hudal, an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies, then living in Italy. Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, he was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Eichmann was quoted as having stated, \"I will jump into my grave laughing because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews [or Reich enemies, as he later claimed to have said] on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction.\" Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka, also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal's network. He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was sentenced to life in prison in 1970. He died in 1971.\nMengele, worried that his capture would mean a death sentence, fled Germany on 17 April 1949. Assisted by a network of former SS members, he travelled to Genoa, where he obtained a passport under the alias \"Helmut Gregor\" from the International Committee of the Red Cross. He sailed to Argentina in July. Aware that he was still a wanted man, he moved to Paraguay in 1958 and Brazil in 1960. In both instances he was assisted by former \"Luftwaffe\" pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel. Mengele suffered a stroke while swimming and drowned in 1979.\nThousands of Nazis, including former SS members such as Trawniki guard Jakob Reimer and Circassian collaborator Tscherim Soobzokov, fled to the United States under the guise of refugees, sometimes using forged documents. Other SS men, such as Soobzokov, SD officer Wilhelm H\u00f6ttl, Eichmann aide Otto von Bolschwing, and accused war criminal Theodor Saevecke, were employed by American intelligence agencies against the Soviets. As CIA officer Harry Rositzke noted, \"It was a visceral business of using any bastard so long as he was anti-Communist.\u00a0... The eagerness or desire to enlist collaborators means that sure, you didn't look at their credentials too closely.\" Similarly, the Soviets used SS personnel after the war; Operation Theo, for instance, disseminated \"subversive rumours\" in Allied-occupied Germany.\nSimon Wiesenthal and others have speculated about the existence of a Nazi fugitive network code-named ODESSA (an acronym for \"Organisation der ehemaligen SS-Angeh\u00f6rigen\", Organisation of former SS members) that allegedly helped war criminals find refuge in Latin America. British writer Gitta Sereny, who conducted interviews with SS men, considers the story untrue and attributes the escapes to postwar chaos and Hudal's Vatican-based network. While the existence of ODESSA remains unproven, Sereny notes that \"there certainly were various kinds of Nazi aid organisations after the war\u2014it would have been astonishing if there hadn't been.\"\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27045", "revid": "50236370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27045", "title": "New Wave (science fiction)", "text": "Movement in science fiction\n \nThe New Wave was a science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, characterized by a great degree of experimentation with the form and content of stories, often influenced by the styles of non-science fiction literature, and an emphasis on the psychological and social sciences as opposed to the physical sciences. New Wave authors often considered themselves as part of the modernist tradition of fiction, and the New Wave was conceived as a deliberate change from the traditions of the science fiction characteristic of pulp magazines, which many of the writers involved considered irrelevant or unambitious.\nThe most prominent source of New Wave science fiction was the British magazine \"New Worlds\", edited by Michael Moorcock, who became editor during 1964. In the United States, Judith Merril's anthologies and Harlan Ellison's 1967 anthology \"Dangerous Visions\" are often considered as the best early representations of the movement. Worldwide, Ursula K. Le Guin, Stanis\u0142aw Lem, J. G. Ballard, Samuel R. Delany, Roger Zelazny, Joanna Russ, James Tiptree Jr. (a pseudonym of Alice Bradley Sheldon), Thomas M. Disch and Brian Aldiss were also major writers associated with the movement. Moorcock wanted writers to borrow from the genre's techniques but encouraged writers to develop their own styles. Apart from Moorcock and Ballard, authors included Hilary Bailey, Barrington Bayley, M. John Harrison, Pamela Zoline, Rachel Pollack and Christopher Priest.\nThe New Wave was influenced by postmodernism, surrealism, the politics of the 1960s, such as the controversy concerning the Vietnam War, and by social trends such as the drug subculture, sexual liberation, and environmentalism. Although the New Wave was critiqued for the self-absorption of some of its writers, it was influential in the development of subsequent movements, including cyberpunk and slipstream. Authors like Michael Chabon and Hari Kunzru are also considered among later authors of New Wave fiction.\nOrigins and use of the term.\nOrigins.\nThe phrase \"New Wave\" was used generally for new artistic fashions during the 1960s, imitating the term \"nouvelle vague\" used for certain French cinematic styles. P. Schuyler Miller, the regular book reviewer of \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\", first used it in the November 1961 issue to describe a new generation of British authors: \"It's a moot question whether Carnell discovered the \u2018big names\u2019 of British science fiction\u2014Wyndham, Clarke, Russell, Christopher\u2014or whether they discovered him. Whatever the answer, there is no question at all about the \u2018new wave\u2019: Tubb, Aldiss, and to get to my point, Kenneth Bulmer and John Brunner\".\nSubsequent usage.\nThe term 'New Wave' has been incorporated into the concept of New Wave Fabulism, a form of magic realism \"which often blend a realist or postmodern aesthetic with nonrealistic interruptions, in which alternative technologies, ontologies, social structures, or biological forms make their way in to otherwise realistic plots\".:76 New Wave Fabulism itself has been related to the slipstream literary genre, an interface between mainstream or postmodern fiction and science fiction.\nThe concept of a 'new wave' has been applied to science fiction in other countries, including for some Arabic science fiction, with Ahmed Khaled Tawfik's best-selling novel \"Utopia\" being considered a prominent example, and Chinese science fiction, where it has been applied to some of the work of Wang Jinkang and Liu Cixin, including Liu's \"Remembrance of Earth's Past\" trilogy (2006\u20132010), works that emphasize China's increase of power, the development myth, and posthumanity.\nDescription.\nThe early proponents of New Wave considered it to be a major change from the genre's past, and that is the way that it was experienced by many readers during the late 1960s and early 1970s. New Wave writers often considered themselves as part of the modernist and then postmodernist traditions and sometimes mocked the traditions of older science fiction, which many of them regarded as stodgy, adolescent and badly written. Many also rejected the content of the Golden Age of Science Fiction; rejecting an emphasis on physical science and adventures in outer space, they preferred to examine human psychology, subjectivity, dreams, and the unconscious. Nonetheless, during the New Wave period, traditional types of science fiction continued to appear, and in Rob Latham's opinion, the broader genre had absorbed the New Wave's agenda and mostly neutralized it by the conclusion of the 1970s.\nFormat.\nThe New Wave coincided with a major change in the production and distribution of science fiction, as the pulp magazine era was replaced by the book market; it was in a sense also a reaction against typical pulp magazine styles.\nTopics.\nThe New Wave interacted with a number of themes during the 1960s and 1970s, including sexuality; drug culture, especially the work of William S. Burroughs and the use of psychedelic drugs; and the popularity of environmentalism. J. G. Ballard's themes included alienation, social isolation, class discrimination, and the end of civilization, in settings ranging from a single apartment block (\"High Rise\") to entire worlds. Rob Latham noted that several of J. G. Ballard's works of the 1960s (e.g., the quartet begun by \"The Wind from Nowhere\" [1960]), engaged with the concept of eco-catastrophe, as did Disch's \"The Genocides\" and Ursula K. Le Guin's short novel \"The Word for World Is Forest\". The latter, with its description of the use of napalm on indigenous people, was also influenced by Le Guin's perceptions of the Vietnam War, and both emphasized anti-technocratic fatalism instead of imperial hegemony via technology, with the New Wave later interacting with feminism, ecological activism and postcolonial rhetoric. \nOne characteristic of New Wave authors was a fascination with entropy, i.e. with the idea that the world and the universe tend to disorder and must eventually end in \"heat death\". The New Wave also engaged with utopia, a common theme of science fiction, offering more nuanced interpretations.:74\u201380\nStyle.\nTransformation of style was part of the basis of the New Wave fashion.:286 Combined with controversial topics, it introduced innovations of form, style, and aesthetics, involving more literary ambitions and experimental use of language, with significantly less emphasis on physical science or technological themes in its content. For example, in the story \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\" (1963), Roger Zelazny introduces numerous literary allusions, complex onomastic patterns, multiple meanings, and innovative themes, and other Zelazny works, such as \"The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth\" (1965) and \"He Who Shapes\" (1966) involve literary self-reflexivity, playful collocations, and neologisms. In stories like \"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman, Harlan Ellison is considered as using gonzo-style syntax. Many New Wave authors used obscenity and vulgarity intensely or frequently. Concerning visual aspects, some scenes of J. G. Ballard's novels reference the surrealist paintings of Max Ernst and Salvador Dal\u00ed.\nDifferences between American and British New Waves.\nThe British and American New Wave trends overlapped but were somewhat different. Judith Merril noted that New Wave SF was being called \"the New Thing\". In a 1967 article for \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" she contrasted the SF New Wave of England and the United States, writing:\nThey call it the New Thing. The people who call it that mostly don't like it, and the only general agreements they seem to have are that Ballard is its Demon and I am its prophetess\u2014and that it is what is wrong with Tom Disch, and with British s-f in general... The American counterpart is less cohesive as a \"school\" or \"movement\": it has had no single publication in which to concentrate its development, and was, in fact, till recently, all but excluded from the regular s-f magazines. But for the same reasons, it is more diffuse and perhaps more widespread.:105\nThe science fiction academic Edward James also discussed differences between the British and American SF New Wave. He believed that the former was, due to J. G. Ballard and Michael Moorcock, associated mainly with a specific magazine with a set programme that had little subsequent influence. James noted additionally that even the London-based American writers of the time, such as Samuel R. Delany, Thomas M. Disch, and John Sladek, had their own agendas. James asserted the American New Wave did not reach the status of a \"movement\" but was rather a concordance of talent that introduced new ideas and better standards to the authoring of science fiction, including through the first three seasons of \"\". In his opinion, \"...the American New Wave ushered in a great expansion of the field and of its readership... it is clear that the rise in literary and imaginative standards associated with the late 1960s contributed a great deal to some of the most original writers of the 1970s, including John Crowley, Joe Haldeman, Ursula K. Le Guin, James Tiptree, Jr., and John Varley.\"176\nHistory.\nInfluences and predecessors.\nThough the New Wave began during the 1960s, some of its tenets can be found in H. L. Gold's editorship of \"Galaxy\", which began publication in 1950. James Gunn described Gold's emphasis as being \"not on the adventurer, the inventor, the engineer, or the scientist, but on the average citizen,\" and according to SF historian David Kyle, Gold's work would result in the New Wave.:119-120\nThe New Wave was partly a rejection of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Algis Budrys in 1965 wrote of the \"recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940s\u2014- the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface\". The New Wave was not defined as a development from the science fiction which came before it, but initially reacted against it. New Wave writers did not operate as an organized group, but some of them felt the tropes of the pulp magazine and Golden Age periods had become over-used, and should be abandoned: J. G. Ballard stated in 1962 that \"science fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extra-terrestrial life forms, (and) galactic wars\", and Brian Aldiss said in \"\" that \"the props of SF are few: rocket ships, telepathy, robots, time travel...like coins, they become debased by over-circulation.\" Harry Harrison summarised the period by saying \"old barriers were coming down, pulp taboos were being forgotten, new themes and new manners of writing were being explored\".\nNew Wave writers began to use non-science fiction literary themes, such as the example of beat writer William S. Burroughs\u2014New Wave authors Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer and Barrington J. Bayley wrote pastiches of his work (\"The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod\" and \"The Four Colour Problem\", respectively), while J. G. Ballard published an admiring essay in an issue of \"New Worlds\". Burroughs' use of experimentation such as the cut-up technique and his use of science fiction tropes in new manners proved the extent to which prose fiction could seem revolutionary, and some New Wave writers sought to emulate this style.\nUrsula K. Le Guin, one of the newer writers to be published during the 1960s, describes the transition to the New Wave era thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Without in the least dismissing or belittling earlier writers and work, I think it is fair to say that science fiction changed around 1960, and that the change tended toward an increase in the number of writers and readers, the breadth of subject, the depth of treatment, the sophistication of language and technique, and the political and literary consciousness of the writing. The sixties in science fiction were an exciting period for both established and new writers and readers. All the doors seemed to be opening.\nOther writers and works seen as preluding or transitioning to the New Wave include Ray Bradbury's \"The Martian Chronicles,\" Walter M. Miller's 1959 \"A Canticle for Leibowitz,\" Cyril M. Kornbluth and Frederik Pohl's anti-hyper-consumerist \"The Space Merchants\" (1952), Kurt Vonnegut's mocking \"Player Piano\" (1952) and \"The Sirens of Titan\" (1959), Theodore Sturgeon's humanist \"More Than Human\" (1953) and the hermaphrodite society of \"Venus Plus X\" (1960), and Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's human-extraterrestrial sexual encounters in \"The Lovers\" (1952) and \"Strange Relations\" (1960).\nBeginnings.\nThere is not any consensus about a precise beginning for the New Wave\u2014British author Adam Roberts refers to Alfred Bester as having single-handedly invented the genre, and in the introduction to a collection of Leigh Brackett's short fiction, Michael Moorcock referred to her as one of the genre's \"true godmothers\". Algis Budrys said that in New Wave writers \"there are echoes... of Philip K. Dick, Walter Miller, Jr. and, by all odds, Fritz Leiber\". However, it is accepted by many critics that the New Wave began in England with the magazine \"New Worlds\" and Michael Moorcock. who was appointed editor in 1964 (first issue number 142, May and June); Moorcock was editor until 1973. While the American magazines \"Amazing Stories\" and \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\" had from the start printed unusually literary stories, Moorcock made that into a more definite policy, and he sought to use the magazine to \"define a new avant-garde role\" for science fiction by the use of \"new literary techniques and modes of expression\".:251-252 No other science fiction magazine was made to differ as consistently from traditional science fiction as much as \"New Worlds\". By the time it ceased regular publication it had rejected identification with the genre of science fiction itself, styling itself as an experimental literary journal. In the United States, the best known representation of the genre is probably the 1967 anthology \"Dangerous Visions\", edited by Harlan Ellison.\nAccording to Brian W. Aldiss, during Moorcock's editorship of \"New Worlds\", \"galactic wars went out; drugs came in; there were fewer encounters with aliens, more in the bedroom. Experimentation in prose styles became one of the orders of the day, and the baleful influence of William Burroughs often threatened to gain the upper hand.\" Judith Merril observed, \"...this magazine [\"New Worlds\"] was the publishing thermometer of the trend that was dubbed \"the New Wave\". In the United States the trend created an intense, incredible controversy. In Britain people either found it of interest or they didn't, but in the States it was heresy on the one hand and wonderful revolution on the other.\"\nBrooks Landon, professor of English at the University of Iowa, says of \"Dangerous Visions\" that it\nwas innovative and influential before it had any readers simply because it was the first big original anthology of SF, offering prices to its writers that were competitive with the magazines. The readers soon followed, however, attracted by 33 stories by SF writers both well-established and relatively unheard of. These writers responded to editor Harlan Ellison's call for stories that could not be published elsewhere or had never been written in the face of almost certain censorship by SF editors... [T]o SF readers, especially in the United States, \"Dangerous Visions\" certainly felt like a revolution... \"Dangerous Visions\" marks an emblematic turning point for American SF.\nAs an anthologist and speaker Merril with other authors advocated a reestablishment of science fiction within the literary mainstream and better literary standards. Her \"incredible controversy\" is characterized by David Hartwell in the opening sentence of a book chapter entitled \"New Wave: The Great War of the 1960s\": \"Conflict and argument are an enduring presence in the SF world, but literary politics has yielded to open warfare on the largest scale only once.\" The changes were more than the experimental and explicitly provocative as inspired by Burroughs; in coherence with the literary \"nouvelle vague\", although not in close association to it, and addressing a less restricted pool of readers, the New Wave was reversing the standard hero's attitude toward action and science. It illustrated egotism\u2014often by depriving the plot of motivation toward a rational explanation.:87\nIn 1962 Ballard wrote:\nI've often wondered why s-f shows so little of the experimental enthusiasm which has characterized painting, music and the cinema during the last four or five decades, particularly as these have become wholeheartedly speculative, more and more concerned with the creation of new states of mind, constructing fresh symbols and languages where the old cease to be valid... The biggest developments of the immediate future will take place, not on the Moon or Mars, but on Earth, and it is \"inner space\", not outer, that need to be explored. The only truly alien planet is Earth. In the past the scientific bias of s-f has been towards the physical sciences\u2014rocketry, electronics, cybernetics\u2014and the emphasis should switch to the biological sciences. Accuracy, that last refuge of the unimaginative, doesn't matter a hoot... It is that \"inner\" space-suit which is still needed, and it is up to science fiction to build it! \nIn 1963 Moorcock wrote, \n\"Let's have a quick look at what a lot of science fiction lacks. Briefly, these are some of the qualities I miss on the whole\u2014passion, subtlety, irony, original characterization, original and good style, a sense of involvement in human affairs, colour, density, depth, and, on the whole, real feeling from the writer...\"\nRoger Luckhurst pointed out that J. G. Ballard's 1962 essay, \"Which Way to Inner Space?\" \"showed the influence of media theorist Marshall McLuhan and the 'anti-psychiatry' of R. D. Laing.\" Luckhurst traces the influence of both these thinkers in Ballard's fiction, in particular \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" (1970).\nAfter Ellison's \"Dangerous Visions\", Judith Merril contributed to this fiction in the United States by editing the anthology \"England Swings SF: Stories of Speculative Fiction\" (Doubleday 1968).\nThe New Wave also had political associations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Most of the 'classic' writers had begun writing before the Second World War, and were reaching middle age by the early 1960s; the writers of the so-called New Wave were mostly born during or after the war, and were not only reacting against the sf writers of the past, but playing their part in the general youth revolution of the 1960s which had such profound effects upon Western culture. It is no accident that the New Wave began in Britain at the time of the Beatles, and took off in the United States at the time of the hippies\u2014both, therefore at a time of cultural innovation and generational shake-up...\nEric S. Raymond observed:\nThe New Wave's inventors (notably Michael Moorcock, J. G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss) were British socialists and Marxists who rejected individualism, linear exposition, happy endings, scientific rigor and the U.S.'s cultural hegemony over the SF field in one fell swoop. The New Wave's later American exponents were strongly associated with the New Left and opposition to the Vietnam War, leading to some rancorous public disputes in which politics was tangled together with definitional questions about the nature of SF and the direction of the field.\nFor example, Judith Merril, \"one of the most visible\u2014and voluble\u2014apostles of the New Wave in 1960s sf\":251 remembers her return from England to the United States: \"So I went home ardently looking for a revolution. I kept searching until the Chicago Democratic Convention in 1968. I went to Chicago partly to seek out a revolution, if there was one happening, and partly because my seventeen-year-old daughter... wanted to go.\" Merril said later, \"At the end of the Convention week, the taste of America was sour in all our mouths\"; she soon became a political refugee living in Canada.\nRoger Luckhurst disagreed with critics who perceived the New Wave mainly in terms of difference (he gives the example of Thomas Clareson), suggesting that such a model \"doesn't quite seem to map onto the American scene, even though the wider conflicts of the 1960s liberalization in universities, the civil rights movement and the cultural contradictions inherent in consumer society were starker and certainly more violent than in Britain.\" In particular, he noted:\nThe young turks within SF also had an ossified 'ancient regime' to topple: John Campbell's intolerant right-wing editorials for \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (which he renamed \"Analog\" in 1960) teetered on the self parody. In 1970, when the campus revolt against American involvement in Vietnam reached its height and resulted in the National Guard shooting four students dead in Kent State University, Campbell editorialized that the 'punishment was due', and rioters should expect to be met with lethal force. Vietnam famously divided the SF community to the extent that, in 1968, 'Galaxy' magazine carried two adverts, one signed by writers in favour and one by those against the war. Caution is needed when assessing any literary movement, particularly regarding transitions. Science fiction writer Bruce Sterling, reacting to his association with another SF movement in the 1980s, remarked, \"When did the New Wave SF end? Who was the last New Wave SF writer? You can't be a New Wave SF writer today. You can recite the numbers of them: Ballard, Ellison, Spinrad, Delaney, blah, blah, blah. What about a transitional figure like Zelazny? A literary movement isn't an army. You don't wear a uniform and swear allegiance. It's just a group of people trying to develop a sensibility.\"\nSimilarly, Rob Latham observed:\n...indeed, one of the central ways the New Wave was experienced, in the US and Britain, was as a \"liberated\" outburst of erotic expression, often counterpoised, by advocates of the \"New Thing\" (as Merril called it), with the priggish Puritanism of the Golden Age. Yet this stark contrast, while not unreasonable, tends ultimately, as do most of the historical distinctions drawn between the New Wave and its predecessors, to overemphasize rupture at the expense of continuity, effectively \"disappearing\" some of the pioneering trends in 1950s sf that paved the way for the New Wave's innovations.\nHowever, Darren Harris-Fain of Shawnee State University emphasized New Wave in terms of difference:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The split between the New Wave and everyone else in American SF during the late 1960s was nearly as dramatic as the division at the same time between young protesters and what they called \"the establishment,\" and in fact, the political views of the younger writers, often prominent in their work, reflect many contemporary concerns. New Wave accused what became de facto the old wave of being old-fashioned, patriarchal, imperialistic, and obsessed with technology; many of the more established writers thought the New Wave shallow, said that its literary innovations were not innovations at all (which in fact, outside of SF, they were not), and accused it of betraying SF's grand view of humanity's role in the universe. Both assertions were largely exaggerations, of course, and in the next decade both trends would merge into a synthesis of styles and concerns. However, in 1970 the issue was far from settled and would remain a source of contention for the next few years.\nDecline.\nIn the August 1970 issue of the \"SFWA Forum\", a publication for Science Fiction Writers of America members, Harlan Ellison stated that the New Wave furore, which had flourished during the late 1960s, appeared to have been \"blissfully laid to rest\". He also claimed that there was no real conflict between writers:\nIt was all a manufactured controversy, staged by fans to hype their own participation in the genre. Their total misunderstanding of what was happening (not unusual for fans, as history... shows us) managed to stir up a great deal of pointless animosity and if it had any real effect I suspect it was in the unfortunate area of causing certain writers to feel they were unable to keep up and consequently they slowed their writing output.\nLatham however remarks that Ellison's analysis \"obscures Ellison's own prominent role\u2014and that of other professional authors and editors such as Judith Merril, Michael Moorcock, Lester Del Rey, Frederik Pohl, and Donald A. Wollheim\u2014in fomenting the conflict...\"\nFor Roger Luckhurst, the closing of \"New Worlds\" magazine in 1970 (one of many years it closed) \"marked the containment of New Wave experiment with the rest of the counter-culture. The various limping manifestations of New World across the 1970s... demonstrated the posthumous nature of its avant-gardism.\"\nBy the early 1970s, a number of writers and readers were commenting about the differences between the winners of the Nebula Awards, which had been created in 1965 by the SFWA and were awarded by professional writers, and winners of the Hugo Awards, awarded by fans at the annual World Science Fiction Convention, with some arguing that this indicated that many authors were alienated from the sentiments of their readers: \"While some writers and fans continued to argue about the New Wave until the end of the 1970s\u2014in \"The World of Science Fiction, 1926\u20131976: The History of a Subculture\", for instance, Lester Del Ray devotes several pages to castigating the movement\u2014for the most part the controversy died down as the decade wore on.\"\nImpact.\nIn a 1979 essay, Professor Patrick Parrinder, commenting on the nature of science fiction, noted that \"any meaningful act of defamiliarization can only be relative, since it is not possible for man to imagine what is utterly alien to him; the utterly alien would also be meaningless.\" He also states, \"Within SF, however, it is not necessary to break with the wider conventions of prose narrative in order to produce work that is validly experimental. The 'New Wave' writing of the 1960s, with its fragmented and surrealistic forms, has not made a lasting impact, because it cast its net too wide. To reform SF one must challenge the conventions of the genre on their own terms.\"\nOthers ascribe a more important, though still limited, effect. Veteran science fiction writer Jack Williamson (1908\u20132006) when asked in 1991: \"Did the [New] Wave's emphasis on experimentalism and its conscious efforts to make SF more 'literary' have any kind of permanent effects on the field?\" replied:\nAfter it subsided\u2014it's old hat now\u2014it probably left us with a sharpened awareness of language and a keener interest in literary experiment. It did wash up occasional bits of beauty and power. For example, it helped launch the careers of such writers as [Samuel R.] Chip Delany, Brian Aldiss, and Harlan Ellison, all of whom seem to have gone on their own highly individualistic directions. But the key point here is that New Wave SF failed to move people. I'm not sure if this failure was due to its pessimistic themes or to people feeling the stuff was too pretentious. But it never really grabbed hold of people's imaginations.\nHartwell observed that \"there is something efficacious in sf's marginality and always tenuous self-identity\u2014its ambiguous generic distinction from other literary categories\u2014and, perhaps more importantly, in its distinction from what has variously been called realist, mainstream, or mundane fiction.\" Hartwell maintained that after the New Wave, science fiction had still managed to retain this \"marginality and tenuous self-identity\":\nThe British and American New Wave in common would have denied the genre status of SF entirely and ended the continual development of new specialized words and phrases common to the body of SF, without which SF would be indistinguishable from mundane fiction in its entirety (rather than only out on the borders of experimental SF, which is properly indistinguishable from any other experimental literature). The denial of special or genre status is ultimately the cause of the failure of the New Wave to achieve popularity, which, if it had become truly dominant, would have destroyed SF as a separate field.\nScientific and technological themes were more important than literary trends to Campbell, and some major \"Astounding\" contributors Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, and L. Sprague de Camp had scientific or engineering educations. Asimov said in 1967 \"I hope that when the New Wave has deposited its froth and receded, the vast and solid shore of \"science\" fiction will appear once more\". Yet, Asimov himself was to illustrate just how that \"SF shore\" did indeed re-emerge\u2014- but changed. A biographer noted that during the 1960s:\n...stories and novels that Asimov must not have liked and must have felt were not part of the science fiction he had helped to shape were winning acclaim and awards. He also must have felt that science fiction no longer needed him. His science fiction writing... became even more desultory and casual.\nAsimov's return to serious writing in 1972 with \"The Gods Themselves\" (when much of the debate about the New Wave had dissipated) was an act of courage...\nDarren Harris-Fain observed on this resumption of writing SF by Asimov that\n...the novel [\"The Gods Themselves\"] is noteworthy for how it both shows that Asimov was indeed the same writer in the 1970s that he had been in the 1950s and that he nonetheless had been affected by the New Wave even if he was never part of it. His depiction of an alien m\u00e9nage a trois, complete with homoerotic scenes between the two males, marks an interesting departure from his earlier fiction, in which sex of any sort is conspicuously absent. Also there is some minor experimentation with structure.\nOther themes dealt with in the novel are concerns for the environment and \"human stupidity and the delusional belief in human superiority\", both frequent topics in New Wave SF.\nStill other commentators ascribe a much greater effect to the New Wave. Commenting in 2002 on the publication of the 35th Anniversary edition of Ellison's \"Dangerous Visions\" anthology, the critic Greg L. Johnson remarked that\n...if the New Wave did not entirely revolutionize the way SF was written, (the exploration of an invented world through the use of an adventure plot remains the prototypical SF story outline), they did succeed in pushing the boundaries of what could be considered SF, and their use of stylistic innovations from outside SF helped raise standards. It became less easy for writers to get away with stock characters spouting wooden dialogue laced with technical jargon. Such stories still exist, and are still published, but are no longer typical of the field.\nAsimov agreed that \"on the whole, the New Wave was a good thing\". He described several \"interesting side effects\" of the New Wave. Non-American SF became more prominent and the genre became an international phenomenon. Other changes noted were that \"the New Wave encouraged more and more women to begin reading and writing science fiction... The broadening of science fiction meant that it was approaching the 'mainstream'... in style and content. It also meant that increasing numbers of mainstream novelists were recognizing the importance of changing technology and the popularity of science fiction, and were incorporating science fiction motifs into their own novels.\"\nCritic Rob Latham identifies three trends that associated New Wave with the emergence of cyberpunk during the 1980s. He said that changes of technology as well as an economic recession constricted the market for science fiction, generating a \"widespread\" malaise among fans, while established writers were forced to reduce their output (or, like Isaac Asimov, shifted their emphasis to other subjects); finally, editors encouraged new methods that earlier ones tended to discourage.\nCriticisms.\nMoorcock, Ballard, and others engendered some animosity to their writings. When reviewing ', Lester del Rey described it as \"the first of the New Wave-Thing movies, with the usual empty symbolism\". When reviewing ', Algis Budrys mocked Ellison's \" 'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\" and two other stories as \"rudimentary social consciousness... deep stuff\" and insufficient for \"an outstanding science-fiction story\". Hartwell noted Budrys's \"ringing scorn and righteous indignation\" that year in \"one of the classic diatribes against Ballard and the new mode of SF then emergent\": \nA story by J. G. Ballard, as you know, calls for people who don't think. One begins with characters who regard the physical universe as a mysterious and arbitrary place, and who would not dream of trying to understand its actual laws. Furthermore, to be the protagonist of a J. G. Ballard novel, or anything more than a very minor character therein, you must have cut yourself off from the entire body of scientific education. In this way, when the world disaster\u2014be it wind or water\u2014comes upon you, you are under absolutely no obligation to do anything about it but sit and worship it. Even more further, some force has acted to remove from the face of the world all people who might impose good sense or rational behavior on you...\nBudrys in \"Galaxy\", when reviewing a collection of recent stories from the magazine, said in 1965 that \"There is this sense in this book... that modern science fiction reflects a dissatisfaction with things as they are, sometimes to the verge of indignation, but also retains optimism about the eventual outcome\". Despite his criticism of Ballard and Aldiss (\"the least talented\" of the four), Budrys called them, Roger Zelazny, and Samuel R. Delany \"an earthshaking new kind\" of writers. Asimov said in 1967 of the New Wave, \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\", but Budrys that year warned that the four would soon leave those \"still reading everything from the viewpoint of the 1944 \"Astounding\"... nothing but a complete collection of yellowed, crumble-edged bewilderment\".\nWhile acknowledging the New Wave's \"energy, high talent and dedication\", and stating that it \"may in fact be the shape of tomorrow's science fiction generally \u2014 hell, it may be the shape of today's science fiction\", as examples of the fashion Budrys much preferred Zelazny's \"This Immortal\" to Thomas Disch's \"The Genocides\". Predicting that Zelazny's career would be more important and lasting than Disch's, he described the latter's book as \"unflaggingly derivative of\" the New Wave and filled with \"dumb, resigned victims\" who \"run, hide, slither, grope and die\", like Ballard's \"The Drowned World\" but unlike \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" (\"about people who do something about their troubles\"). Writing in \"The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of\", Disch observed that \"Literary movements tend to be compounded, in various proportions, of the genius of two or three genuinely original talents, some few other capable or established writers who have been co-opted or gone along for the ride, the apprentice work of epigones and wannabes, and a great deal of hype. My sense of the New Wave, with twenty-five years of hindsight, is that its irreducible nucleus was the dyad of J. G. Ballard and Michael Moorcock...\"\nAuthors and works.\nThe New Wave was not a formal organization with a fixed membership. Thomas M. Disch, for instance, rejected his association with some other New Wave authors.:425 Nonetheless, it is possible to associate specific authors and works, especially anthologies, with the fashion. Michael Moorcock, J. G. Ballard, and Brian Aldiss are considered principal writers of the New Wave. Judith Merril's annual anthologies (1957\u20131968) \"were the first heralds of the coming of the [New Wave] cult,\":105 and Damon Knight's \"Orbit\" series and Harlan Ellison's \"Dangerous Visions\" featured American writers inspired by British writers as well as British authors. Among the stories Ellison printed in \"Dangerous Visions\" were Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's \"Riders of the Purple Wage\", Norman Spinrad's \"Carcinoma Angels\", Samuel R. Delany's \"Aye, and Gomorrah\" and stories by Brian Aldiss, J. G. Ballard, John Brunner, David R. Bunch, Philip K. Dick, Sonya Dorman, Carol Emshwiller, John Sladek, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny.\nAlfred Bester was championed by New Wave writers and is seen as a major influence. Thomas M. Disch's work is associated with the New Wave, and \"The Genocides\" has been seen as emblematic of the genre, as has the 1971 Disch anthology of eco-catastrophe stories \"The Ruins of Earth\". Critic John Clute wrote of M. John Harrison's early writing that it \"...reveals its New-Wave provenance in narrative discontinuities and subheads after the fashion of J. G. Ballard\".\nBrian Aldiss's \"Barefoot in the Head\" (1969) and Norman Spinrad's \"No Direction Home\" (1971) are seen as illustrative of the effect of the drug culture, especially psychedelics, on New Wave. On the topic of entropy, Ballard provided \"an explicitly cosmological vision of entropic decline of the universe\" in \"The Voices of Time\", which provided a typology of ideas that subsequent New Wave writers developed in different contexts, with one of the best instances being Pamela Zoline's \"The Heat Death of the Universe\". Like other writers for \"New Worlds\", Zoline used \"science-fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly 'ordinary' scenes of life\", and by doing so produced \"altered perceptions of reality in the reader\". New Wave works engaging with utopia, gender, and sexuality include Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" (1969), Joanna Russ's \"The Female Man\" (1975), and Marge Piercy's \"Woman on the Edge of Time\" (1976).:82\u201385 In Robert Silverberg's story \"The Man in the Maze\", in a reversal typical of the New Wave, Silverberg portrays a disabled man using an alien labyrinthine city to reject abled society. Samuel R. Delany's \"Babel-17\" (1966) provides an example of a New Wave work engaging with Sapir-Whorfian linguistic relativity, as does Ian Watson's \"The Embedding\" (1973).:86\u201387\nTwo examples of New Wave writers using utopia as a theme are Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia\" (1974) and Samuel R. Delany's \"Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia\" (1976),:74\u201380 while John Brunner is a primary exponent of dystopian New Wave science fiction.\nExamples of modernism in New Wave include Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Joycean \"Riders of the Purple Wage\" (1967), John Brunner's \"Stand on Zanzibar\" (1968), which is written in the style of John Don Passos's \"U.S.A.\" trilogy (1930\u20131936), and Thomas Disch's \"Camp Concentration\", which includes a stream of literary references, including to Thomas Mann.:61\u201362 The influence of postmodernism in New Wave can be seen in Brian Aldiss's \"Report on Probability A\", Philip K. Dick's \"Ubik\", J. G. Ballard's collection \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", and Samuel R. Delany's \"Dhalgren\" and \"Triton\".:66\u201367\nThe majority of stories in Ben Bova's \"The Best of the Nebulas\", such as Roger Zelazny's \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\", are considered as being by New Wave writers or as involving New Wave techniques. \"The Martian Time-Slip\" (1964) and other works by Philip K. Dick are viewed as New Wave.\nBrian Aldiss, Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Norman Spinrad, and Roger Zelazny are writers whose work, though not necessarily considered New Wave at the time of publication, later became associated with the term. Of later authors, some of the work of Joanna Russ is considered to bear stylistic resemblance to New Wave.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Common names for the principal (largest) administrative divisions include: states (subnational states, rather than sovereign states), provinces, lands, oblasts and regions. These in turn are often subdivided into smaller administrative units known by names such as comarcas, raions or districts, which are further subdivided into municipalities, communes or communities constituting the smallest units of subdivision (the local governments). Some administrative division names (such as departments, cantons, prefectures, counties or governorates) can be used for principal, second-level, or third-level divisions.\nThe levels of administrative divisions and their structure largely varies by country (and sometimes within a single country). Usually the smaller the country is (by area or population), the fewer levels of administrative divisions it has. For example, Vatican City does not have any administrative subdivisions, and Monaco has only one level (both are city-states), while such countries as France and Pakistan have five levels each. The United States is composed of states, possessions, territories, and a federal district, each with varying numbers of subdivisions.\nThe principal administrative division of a country is sometimes called the \"\"first-level\" (or \"first-order\") administrative division\" or \"first administrative level\". Its next subdivision might be called \"second-level administrative division\" or \"second administrative level\" and so on. An alternative terminology is provided by the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics which terms the principal division as the second level or NUTS-2.\nAdministrative divisions are conceptually separate from dependent territories, with the former being an integral part of the state and the other being only under some lesser form of control. However, the term \"administrative division\" can include dependent territories as well as accepted administrative divisions (for example, in geographical databases).\nCommunities united in a federation under a federal government are more specifically known as federated states. A federated state may be referred to as a province, region, canton, land, governorate, oblast, emirate, or country. Administrative units that are not federated or confederated but enjoy a greater degree of autonomy or self-government than other territories within the same country can be considered autonomous regions or de facto constituent states of that country. This relationship is by some authors called a federacy or asymmetric federalism. An example is the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan within Uzbekistan.\nExamples.\nTerminology.\nDue to variations in their use worldwide, consistency in the translation of terms from non-English to English is sometimes difficult to maintain. In many of the following terms originating from British cultural influence, areas of relatively low mean population density might bear a title of an entity one would expect to be either larger or smaller. There is no fixed rule, for \"all politics is local\" as is perhaps well demonstrated by their relative lack of systemic order.\nIn the realm of self-government, any of these can and does occur along a stretch of road\u2014which for the most part is passing through rural, unsettled countryside. Since the terms are administrative political divisions of the local regional government, their exact relationship and definitions are subject to home rule considerations, tradition, as well as state statute law and local governmental (administrative) definition and control. In British cultural legacy, some territorial entities began with fairly expansive counties which encompass an appreciably large area, but were divided over time into a number of smaller entities.\nWithin those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the county seat. Some of the world's larger cities culturally, if not officially, span several counties, and those crossing state or provincial boundaries have much in common culturally as well, but are rarely incorporated within the same municipal government. Many sister cities share a water boundary, which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties. For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as one large city, while locally they each are quite culturally different and occupy different counties.\nList.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUrban or rural regions.\nGeneral terms for these incorporated places include \"municipality\", \"settlement\", \"locality\", and \"populated place\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before it is registered, it is common practice (with some legal standing) to use the service mark symbol \u2120 (a superscript SM).\nUsage.\nA service mark differs from a trademark in that the mark is used on the advertising of the service rather than on the packaging or delivery of the service, since there is generally no \"package\" to place the mark on, which is the practice for trademarks. For example, a private carrier can paint its service mark on its vehicles, such as on planes or buses. Personal service providers can place their service marks on their delivery vehicles, such as on the trucks of plumbers or on moving vans. However, if the service deals with communications, it is possible to use a service mark consisting of a sound (a sound trademark) in the process of delivering the service. This has been done in the case of AT&amp;T, which uses a tone sound followed by a woman speaking the company's name to identify its long-distance service; MGM, which uses the sound of a tiger's roar; and RKO Pictures, which used a Morse code signal for their motion pictures.\nUnder United States law, service marks have a different standard of use in order to count as a use in commerce, which is necessary to complete registration and to stop infringement by competitors. A trademark normally needs to be used on or directly in association with the sale of goods, such as on a store display. As services are not defined by a concrete product, use of a service mark on the uniforms or vehicles of service providers or in advertisements is instead accepted as a use in commerce. However, like trademarks, service marks must pass a test of distinctiveness for it to be qualified as a service mark. For example, Thrifty, Inc. attempted to submit a service mark application that described aspects of their business (uniforms, buildings, certain vehicles) as \"being blue\". The application was rejected for not being specific enough, and the rejection was upheld on appeal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the creator of the \"Dilbert\" comic strip and of several nonfiction works of business, commentary, and satire. Adams worked in various corporate roles before he became a full-time cartoonist in 1995. By the mid-1990s, \"Dilbert\", created in 1989, had gained national prominence in the United States and began to reach a worldwide audience, remaining popular throughout the following decades and spawning several books written by Adams. From the mid-10s onwards, Adams emerged as an independent commentator of events and politics, in the furtherance of conservative views.\nAdams writes in a satirical way about the social and psychological landscape of white-collar workers in modern corporations. In addition, Adams has written books in various other areas, including the pandeistic spiritual novella \"God's Debris\" and books on political and management topics, including \"Loserthink\".\nIn February 2023, \"Dilbert\" was dropped by numerous newspapers and its distributor, Andrews McMeel Syndication, after Adams called black Americans that disagreed with \"It's okay to be white\" a \"hate group\" and said white Americans should \"get the hell away from\" them. Adams later said this was a use of hyperbole. Adams then relaunched the strip as a webcomic on his locals.com website.\nEarly life and education.\nAdams was born on June 8, 1957, in Windham, New York, the son of Paul and Virginia (n\u00e9e Vining) Adams. He has described himself as \"about half German\" and has English, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry. In 2016, Adams said he had a small amount of Native American ancestry, but later discovered via 23andme genetic testing that he does not have any detectable Native American genetic markers. He was a fan of \"Peanuts\" comics while growing up and started drawing comics at age 6. He won a drawing competition at age 11.\nAdams graduated from Windham-Ashland-Jewett Central School in 1975 and was the valedictorian of his class of 39 students. He earned a BA in economics from Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York in 1979. He then moved to California and started work. In 1986, he earned an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. Adams took Dale Carnegie Training and called it \"life changing\".\nCareer.\nOffice worker.\nAdams worked closely with telecommunications engineers at Crocker National Bank in San Francisco between 1979 and 1986. Upon joining the organization, he first worked as a teller. After four months in which he was twice held up at gunpoint, he entered a management training program. His positions included management trainee, computer programmer, budget analyst, commercial lender, product manager, and supervisor.\nHe later shifted to work at Pacific Bell. To devote time to building a new career, he woke up every day at 4 a.m. and spent time on various endeavors; cartooning proved to be the most successful of them. Adams created \"Dilbert\" during this period of personal exploration. The \"Dilbert\" name was suggested by his former boss, Mike Goodwin. Dogbert, originally named Dildog, was loosely based on his family's deceased pet beagle Lucy. His submissions of \"Dilbert\" and other comic panels to various publications, including \"The New Yorker\" and \"Playboy\", were not published, but an inspirational letter from a fan persuaded Adams to keep trying. He worked at Pacific Bell between 1986 and June 30, 1995, and the personalities he encountered there inspired many of his \"Dilbert\" characters. In 1989, while still employed at Pacific Bell, Adams launched \"Dilbert\" with United Media. To maintain his income, he continued to draw his cartoons during the early morning hours. His first payment for \"Dilbert\" was a monthly royalty check of $368.62. \"Dilbert\" gradually became more popular. It was syndicated in 100 newspapers in 1991 and 400 by 1994. Adams attributed his success to his idea of including his email address in the panels, which resulted in feedback and suggestions from readers.\nFull-time cartoonist and author.\nAdams' success grew, and he became a full-time cartoonist as \"Dilbert\" reached 800 newspapers. In 1996, his first business book, \"The Dilbert Principle\", was released. It expounded on his concept of the Dilbert principle.\nIn 1997, Adams won the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Newspaper Comic Strip. Logitech CEO Pierluigi Zappacosta invited Adams to impersonate a management consultant, which he did wearing a wig and false mustache. He tricked Logitech managers into adopting a mission statement that Adams described as \"so impossibly complicated that it has no real content whatsoever\". His writing in \"San Jose Mercury News West Magazine\" regarding the incident earned him an Orwell Award. By 2000, the comic was in 2,000 newspapers in 57 countries and 19 languages.\nHis comic strips were adapted as a \"Dilbert\" TV series, which debuted in January 1999 and ran for two seasons on UPN. Adams served as executive producer and showrunner, along with \"Seinfeld\" writer Larry Charles. The show earned a Primetime Emmy Award in 1999. Adams later said that the show had been canceled because he was white and UPN had decided to shift toward African-American viewers.\nIn addition to his cartoon work, Adams has written books in various other areas, including self-improvement and religion. His book \"God's Debris\" (2001) lays out a theory of pandeism, in which God blows itself up to see what will happen, which becomes the cause of our universe. In \"The Religion War\" (2004), Adams suggests that followers of theistic religions such as Christianity and Islam are subconsciously aware that their beliefs are false, and that this awareness is reflected in their consistently acting as if these religions, and their threats of damnation for sinners, are untrue. In a 2017 interview, Adams said that his books on religion, not \"Dilbert\", would be his ultimate legacy.\nOn a February 22, 2023 livestream of his \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams\" program, Adams reacted to a poll that asked if respondents agreed that \"it's okay to be white\", a phrase described by the Anti-Defamation League as associated with the white supremacist movement. The poll showed 26% of black respondents disagreed with the statement and 21% were not sure. Adams, upset that nearly half did not agree, described black people as a \"hate group\" and said \"the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people; just get the fuck away.\"\nIn response to these and other related comments, \"Dilbert\" was dropped by numerous newspapers across the country, including the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"USA Today\"-affiliated newspapers. Andrews McMeel Syndication, the distributor of \"Dilbert\", announced on February 27, 2023, that it was severing all ties with Adams. Portfolio, his book publisher, announced it was dropping his non-\"Dilbert\" book that was scheduled for release that September. Adams defended his remarks as hyperbole and as taken out of context in reportage; he disavowed racism and asserted that nobody would disagree with what he said were his main points: don't discriminate and avoid things that look like they will put you at risk. On March 13, Adams relaunched \"Dilbert\" as \"Dilbert Reborn\" on the subscription website Locals, minus the earlier Dilbert comics.\nOn November 15 2025, he reported that he would no longer draw his strip because his right hand has focal dystonia and his left hand is semi-paralyzed, but would still be the writer of Dilbert. Instead his art director would take over as the artist.\n\"Real Coffee with Scott Adams\".\nIn 2015, Adams wrote blog posts predicting that Donald Trump had a 98 percent chance of winning the presidency based on his persuasion skills, and he started writing about Trump's persuasion techniques. His pieces on this topic grew popular, so he started writing about it regularly. Adams soon developed this as a daily video presentation called \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams\", distributed to Periscope, YouTube, and ScottAdamsSays.com.\n\"Real Coffee with Scott Adams\" has featured guests such as Naval Ravikant, Ed Latimore, Dave Rubin, Erik Finman, Greg Gutfeld, Matt Gaetz, Ben Askren, Carpe Donktum, Steve Hsu, Michael Shellenberger, Carson Griffith, Shiva Ayyadurai, James Nortey, Clint Morgan, and Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg. In 2018, Kanye West shared multiple clips on Twitter from a \"Coffee\" episode titled: \"Scott Adams tells you how Kanye showed the way to The Golden Age. With Coffee.\" In 2020, President Trump retweeted an episode where Adams mocked Joe Biden.\nAdams offers paid subscriptions for exclusive content on Locals. In 2020, Adams said: \"For context, I expect my Dilbert income to largely disappear in the next year as newspapers close up forever. The coronavirus sped up that inevitable trend. Like many of you, I'm reinventing my life for a post-coronavirus world. The Locals platform is a big part of that.\"\nOther.\nAdams started Scott Adams Foods, Inc. in 1999, which made the Dilberito and Protein Chef. First announced in \"The Dilbert Future\" and introduced in 1999, the Dilberito was a vegetarian microwave burrito that came in flavors of Mexican, Indian, Barbecue, and Garlic &amp; Herb. It was sold through some health food stores. Adams' inspiration for the product was that \"diet is the number one cause of health-related problems in the world. I figured I could put a dent in that problem and make some money at the same time.\" He aimed to create a healthy food product that also had mass appeal, a concept he called \"the blue jeans of food\". A Flash game titled \"Dilberito\" was developed and published by Blam! Video Game Development in 2000 for Scott Adams Foods. The product failed to catch on in the market, leading Adams \"several years and several million dollars later\" to sell off his intellectual property and exit the business. Adams himself noted, \"[t]he mineral fortification was hard to disguise, and because of the veggie and legume content, three bites of the Dilberito made you fart so hard your intestines formed a tail.\" \"The New York Times\" noted the burrito \"could have been designed only by a food technologist or by someone who eats lunch without much thought to taste.\" Adams sold off his intellectual property in \"Scott Adams Foods\" when the Dilberito failed in the marketplace in 2003. He was a restaurateur starting in 1997, but exited that business before 2017.\nAdams co-founded the service WhenHub, which has been described by Gizmodo as \"similar to Cameo ... except instead of pre-recorded messages from movie stars and rappers, it offers live chats with a range of subject-matter experts\". In 2019, Adams briefly received negative media attention when during the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting he posted a tweet suggesting that witnesses download the WhenHub app and \"set your price to take calls\". He later apologized, saying the message was \"poorly worded\". As of 2024,[ [update]] the WhenHub website is inactive.\nHe had a cameo in \"Review\", a third-season episode of the TV series \"NewsRadio\", in which Matthew Brock (played by Andy Dick) becomes an obsessed \"Dilbert\" fan. Adams is credited as \"Guy in line behind Dave and Joe in first scene\".\nAdams has been a guest on podcasts including \"Making Sense with Sam Harris, The Tim Ferriss Show, The James Altucher Show, The Ben Shapiro Show, The Rubin Report\",\" Real Talk with Zuby\" and \"The David Pakman Show.\" He has appeared on \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Commonwealth Club of California, Fox News and Berkeley Haas. Adams was interviewed for Mike Cernovich's documentaries \"Silenced\" (2016) and \"Hoaxed\" (2019).\nPolitical views.\nAdams has often commented on political and social matters, although he said in 2016, \"I don't vote and I am not a member of a political party.\" As of 2008, Adams identified his views on social issues as \"[leaning] libertarian, minus the crazy stuff.\" After endorsing Mitt Romney for the 2012 presidential election, Adams endorsed Donald Trump in the following election. During that election, he wrote extensively on Trump, praising his persuasion skills and later described his support for Trump as a factor in ending his public speaking career, as well as negatively impacting his income and friendships. He also spoke against Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton, expressing concerns that Clinton's candidacy would lower the status of men in America. In 2017, Adams described his views as supporting left-wing policies he perceived as realistic.\nAdams has made various predictions about politics. Early in the 2016 election, Adams predicted Trump would win based on his analysis of how persuasive the candidates were. As Trump gained momentum, Adams' election analysis gained media and popular attention. Later (incorrect) predictions repeatedly featured in \"Politico\" magazine's annual lists of \"Worst Predictions\", including that one of Trump, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden would die from COVID-19 by the end of 2020, that \"Republicans will be hunted\" if Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and that the 2024 presidential election would result in a \"landslide\" of claims the election was rigged and the results ultimately overturned in Trump's favor by the Supreme Court.\nAfter a 2022 mass shooting, Adams opined that society leaves parents of troubled teenage boys with only two options: to either watch people die or murder their own son. He said his comments were inspired by his own stepson, who became addicted to drugs at the age of 14 and later died of a fentanyl overdose. Adams has stressed his opposition to being considered pro-masking and pro-COVID-19 vaccines, and he believes that people unvaccinated against COVID-19 \"came out the best\" compared to vaccinated people.\nIn a 2006 blog post, Adams asked if official figures of the number of deaths in the Holocaust were based on methodologically sound research. In 2023, Adams suggested the 2017 Unite the Right rally was \"an American intel op against Trump.\" In 2020, Adams said that the \"Dilbert\" TV show was cancelled because he was white and UPN had decided to focus on an African-American audience, and that he had been discriminated against. In a series of comic strips in September 2022, \"Dilbert\" parodied environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) strategies. Part of the plotline involved a black character who \"identif[ied] as white\" and the company management asking him if he could also identify as gay.\nPersonal life.\nIn the early 1990s, the little finger of Adams' right hand would spasm when he tried to draw, and he was diagnosed with focal dystonia. By doing a conditioning exercise, he was able to cure himself. Yet, in late 2004, his focal dystonia returned, which affected his ability to draw for lengthy periods. Since 2014, he has been drawing on a graphics tablet, and has since switched from using his right hand to his left. He also had spasmodic dysphonia, a condition that causes the vocal cords to behave abnormally. In July 2008 he underwent surgery to reroute the nerve connections to his vocal cords and his voice reached new levels of functionality.\nAdams married Shelly Miles aboard a yacht, the \"Galaxy Commodore\", on July 22, 2006, in San Francisco Bay, in a ceremony conducted by the ship's captain. The two had met at a gym in Pleasanton, California, where Miles was an employee and Adams was a customer. Adams was stepfather to Miles' two children, Savannah and Justin, the latter of whom died of a fentanyl overdose in 2018 at age 18. Adams and Miles divorced in 2014, and Adams said the two remained friends, with Miles moving only one block away after their separation.\nOn Christmas Day in 2019, Adams announced on his podcast that he was engaged to Kristina Basham, and later revealed that they had married on July 11, 2020. Basham, a model and baker, has two daughters and is a vice president at WhenHub. On March 10, 2022, Adams announced on his YouTube podcast that he and Basham were getting divorced.\nAdams claims he is trained as a hypnotist. He credits affirmations for many of his achievements, including scoring in the ninety-fourth percentile on a difficult qualification exam for business school and creating \"Dilbert\"'s success. He states that the affirmations give him focus. He has described a method he has used that he says gave him success: he pictured in his mind what he wanted and wrote it down 15 times a day on a piece of paper. This technique is used by Dogbert in a 1989 \"Dilbert\" strip.\nAdams continues to live in Pleasanton, California, and is active in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nHealth.\nOn May 19, 2025, Adams revealed on his daily podcast \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams\" that he has prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, and that he only has a short time left to live. He has stated that the cancer has spread to his spine, which has caused him to use a walker due to the immense pain. He noted that his taking the anti-parasitic medications ivermectin and fenbendazole to treat the cancer did not work. In June 2025, he revealed he had prepared for physician assisted suicide through the California End of Life Option Act, and had planned to go through with it on June 29 or June 30, after his stepdaughter's wedding, as the pain was too much to handle. He then discovered that by taking common testosterone blocker pills, his pain unexpectedly went away, and his PSA levels dropped 90%, which would give him weeks, months, or even some years extra.\nIn November the same year, he announced his health was suddenly declining rapidly again, and took to social media to ask President Trump for help to get access to the cancer drug Pluvicto. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replied saying \"How do I reach you? The President wants to help.\"\nRecognition.\nAdams has received recognition for his work, including the National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award and Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 1997 for his work on \"Dilbert\". He climbed the https:// Ranking of the 50 most influential management thinkers, placing 31st in 2001, 27th in 2003, 12th in 2005, and 21st in 2007. He received the Orwell Award in 1998 for his participation in \"Mission Impertinent\" for \"San Jose Mercury News West Magazine\".\nPublications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27058", "revid": "1071014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27058", "title": "Steel", "text": "Alloy of iron and carbon\nSteel is an alloy of iron and carbon that demonstrates improved mechanical properties compared to the pure form of iron. Due to its high elastic modulus, yield strength, fracture strength and low raw material cost, steel is one of the most commonly manufactured materials in the world. Steel is used in structures (as concrete reinforcing rods or steel beams), in bridges, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, bicycles, machines, electrical appliances, furniture, and weapons.\nIron is always the main element in steel, but other elements are used to produce various grades of steel, demonstrating altered material, mechanical, and microstructural properties. Stainless steels, for example, typically contain 18% chromium and exhibit improved corrosion and oxidation resistance versus their carbon steel counterpart. Galvanized steel is coated in a layer of zinc to achieve a similar effect. Under atmospheric pressures, steels generally take on two crystalline forms: body-centered cubic and face-centered cubic; however, depending on the thermal history and alloying, the microstructure may contain the distorted martensite phase or the carbon-rich cementite phase, which are tetragonal and orthorhombic, respectively. In the case of alloyed iron, the strengthening is primarily due to the introduction of carbon in the primarily-iron lattice, inhibiting deformation under mechanical stress. Alloying may also induce additional phases that affect the mechanical properties. In most cases, the engineered mechanical properties are at the expense of the ductility and elongation of the pure iron state, which decrease upon the addition of carbon.\nSteel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast furnace and production of crucible steel. This was followed by the Bessemer process in England in the mid-19th century, and then by the open-hearth furnace. With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced steel began. Mild steel replaced wrought iron. The German states were the major steel producers in Europe in the 19th century. American steel production was centred in Pittsburgh; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; and Cleveland until the late 20th century. Currently, world steel production is centered in China, which produced 54% of the world's steel in 2023.\nFurther refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product. Today, more than 1.6 billion\u00a0tons of steel are produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations. The modern steel industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the world, but also one of the most energy and greenhouse gas emission intense industries, contributing 8% of global emissions. However, steel is also very reusable: it is one of the world's most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of over 60% globally.\nDefinitions and related materials.\nThe noun \"steel\" originates from the Proto-Germanic adjective or 'made of steel', which is related to or 'standing firm'.\nThe carbon content of steel is between 0.02% and 2.14% by weight for plain carbon steel (iron-carbon alloys). Alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements, most frequently considered undesirable, are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulphur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper.\nPlain iron\u2013carbon alloys with a higher than 2.1% carbon content are known as cast iron. With modern steelmaking techniques such as powder metal forming, it is possible to make very high-carbon (and other alloy material) steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good castability properties. Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make malleable iron or ductile iron objects. Steel is distinguishable from wrought iron (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon A (&lt;0.1 %) but large amounts of slag (around 1\u20132%).\nMaterial properties.\nOrigins and production.\nIron is commonly found in the Earth's crust in the form of an ore, usually an iron oxide, such as magnetite or hematite. Iron is extracted from iron ore under reductive conditions, where oxygen reacts with carbon in the fuel to produce carbon monoxide, which then reduces the iron oxide into metallic iron. This process, known as smelting, was first applied to metals with lower melting points, such as tin, which melts at about , and copper, which melts at about , and the combination, bronze, which has a melting point lower than . In comparison, iron melts at about , a temperature not attainable at the start of the Iron Age. Small quantities of iron were smelted in ancient times in a semi-liquid state by repeatedly heating the ore in a charcoal fire and then welding the resulting clumps together with a hammer. The process eliminated much of the impurities, resulting in the production of wrought iron. As furnaces reached higher temperatures due to bellows improvements leading to increased airflow, iron with higher carbon contents were able to be produced. Unlike copper and tin, liquid or solid iron dissolves carbon quite readily.\nAll of these temperatures could be reached with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond , it is important that smelting takes place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy (pig iron) that retains too much carbon to be called steel. The excess carbon and other impurities are removed via further processing.\nOther materials are often added to the iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with the desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.\nTo inhibit corrosion, at least 11% chromium can be added to steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; this is known as stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high-speed steel. The addition of lead and sulphur decrease grain size, thereby making the steel easier to turn, but also more brittle and prone to corrosion. Such alloys are nevertheless frequently used for components such as nuts, bolts, and washers in applications where toughness and corrosion resistance are not paramount. For the most part, however, p-block elements such as sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and lead are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are therefore removed from steel during the melting processing.\nProperties.\nThe density of steel varies based on the alloying constituents but usually ranges between , or .\nEven in a narrow range of concentrations of mixtures of carbon and iron that make steel, several different metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel. At room temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centred cubic (BCC) structure called alpha iron or \u03b1-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005% at and 0.021 wt% at . The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite. At 910\u00a0\u00b0C, pure iron transforms into a face-centred cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or \u03b3-iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1% (38 times that of ferrite), at , which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron. When carbon moves out of solution with iron, it forms a very hard, but brittle material called cementite (Fe3C).\nWhen steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a eutectoid steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with a small percentage of carbon in solution. The two, cementite and ferrite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percentage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeutectoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.\nAs the rate of cooling is increased the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face-centred austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centred tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy barrier which prevents transformation from austenite to martensite. There is no compositional change, so the atoms generally retain their same neighbours.\nMartensite has a lower density (it expands during the cooling) than does austenite, so that the transformation between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally take the form of compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.\nHeat treatment.\nThere are many types of heat treating processes available to steel, such as annealing, quenching, and tempering.\nAnnealing is the process of heating the steel to a sufficiently high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.\nQuenching involves heating the steel to create the austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, which is just a specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite, and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.\nProduction.\nWhen iron is smelted from its ore, it contains more carbon than is desirable. To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added. This proccess is called refinement, where oxygen is injected into the molten iron to burn off exess carbon. In the past, steel facilities would cast the raw steel product into ingots which would be stored until use in further refinement processes that resulted in the finished product. In modern facilities, the initial product is close to the final composition and is continuously cast into long slabs, cut and shaped into bars and extrusions and heat treated to produce a final product. Today, approximately 96% of steel is continuously cast, while only 4% is produced as ingots.\nThe ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, billets, or blooms. Slabs are hot or cold rolled into sheet metal or plates. Billets are hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire. Blooms are hot or cold rolled into structural steel, such as I-beams and rails. In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one assembly line, with ore coming in and finished steel products coming out. Sometimes after a steel's final rolling, it is heat treated for strength; however, this is relatively rare.\nHistory.\nAncient.\nSteel was known in antiquity and was produced in bloomeries and crucibles.\nThe earliest known production of steel is seen in pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kaleh\u00f6y\u00fck) which are nearly 4,000 years old, dating from 1800\u00a0BC.\nWootz steel was developed in Southern India and Sri Lanka in the 1st millennium BCE. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Large-scale wootz steel production in India using crucibles occurred by the sixth century\u00a0BC, the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy.\nHigh-carbon steel was produced in Britain at Broxmouth Hillfort from 490 to 375 BC, and ultrahigh-carbon steel was produced in the Netherlands from the 2nd to 4th centuries AD. The Roman author Horace identifies steel weapons such as the \"falcata\" in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military.\nThe Chinese of the Warring States period (403\u2013221\u00a0BC) had quench-hardened steel, while Chinese of the Han dynasty (202\u00a0BC \u2013 AD\u00a0220) created steel by melting together wrought iron with cast iron, thus producing a carbon-intermediate steel by the 1st century\u00a0AD.\nThere is evidence that carbon steel was made in Western Tanzania by the ancestors of the Haya people as early as 2,000 years ago by a complex process of \"pre-heating\" allowing temperatures inside a furnace to reach 1300 to 1400\u00a0\u00b0C.\nWootz and Damascus.\nEvidence of the earliest production of high carbon steel in South Asia is found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu, the Golconda area in Telangana and Karnataka, regions of India, as well as in Samanalawewa and Dehigaha Alakanda, regions of Sri Lanka. This came to be known as wootz steel, produced in South India by about the sixth century\u00a0BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326\u00a0BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic, and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Roman, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time \u2013 what they called \"Seric iron\". A 200\u00a0BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century\u00a0AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400\u2013500\u00a0BC.\nThe manufacture of wootz steel and Damascus steel, famous for its durability and ability to hold an edge, may have been taken by the Arabs from Persia, who took it from India. In 327\u00a0BC, Alexander the Great was rewarded by the defeated King Porus, not with gold or silver but with 30\u00a0pounds of steel. The Greek alchemist Zosimos of Panopolis attested to the Indian origin of wootz steel, stating that \"Indians made high quality swords by melting soft iron in crucibles.\" A recent study has speculated that carbon nanotubes were included in its structure, which might explain some of its legendary qualities, though, given the technology of that time, such qualities were produced by chance rather than by design. Natural wind was used where the soil containing iron was heated by the use of wood. The ancient Sinhalese managed to extract a ton of steel for every 2\u00a0tons of soil, a remarkable feat at the time. One such furnace was found in Samanalawewa and archaeologists were able to produce steel as the ancients did.\nCrucible steel, formed by slowly heating and cooling pure iron and carbon (typically in the form of charcoal) in a crucible, was produced in Merv by the 9th to 10th century\u00a0AD. In the 11th century, there is evidence of the production of steel in Song China using two techniques: a \"berganesque\" method that produced inferior, inhomogeneous steel, and a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that used partial decarburization via repeated forging under a cold blast.\nModern.\nSince the 17th century, the first step in European steel production has been the smelting of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.\nProcesses starting from bar iron.\nIn these processes, pig iron made from raw iron ore was refined (fined) in a finery forge to produce bar iron, which was then used in steel-making.\nThe production of steel by the cementation process was described in a treatise published in Prague in 1574 and was in use in Nuremberg from 1601. A similar process for case hardening armour and files was described in a book published in Naples in 1589. The process was introduced to England in about 1614 and used to produce such steel by Sir Basil Brooke at Coalbrookdale during the 1610s.\nThe raw material for this process were bars of iron. During the 17th century, it was realized that the best steel came from oregrounds iron of a region north of Stockholm, Sweden. This was still the usual raw material source in the 19th century, almost as long as the process was used.\nCrucible steel is steel that has been melted in a crucible rather than having been forged, with the result that it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.\nProcesses starting from pig iron.\nThe modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry Bessemer's process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or \"basic Bessemer process\") was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.\nAnother 19th-century steelmaking process was the Siemens-Martin process, which complemented the Bessemer process, which originally consisted of co-melting wrought-iron scrap with pig iron.\nThese methods of steel production were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), developed in 1952, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used, and because, with respect to the open hearth process, the same quantity of steel from a BOS process is manufactured in one-twelfth the time. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They can also be used for converting pig iron to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per\u00a0metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.\nIndustry.\nThe steel industry is often considered an indicator of economic progress, because of the critical role played by steel in infrastructural and overall economic development. In 1980, there were more than 500,000 U.S. steelworkers. By 2000, the number of steelworkers had fallen to 224,000.\nThe economic boom in China and India caused a massive increase in the demand for steel. Between 2000 and 2005, world steel demand increased by 6%. Since 2000, several Indian and Chinese steel firms have expanded to meet demand, such as Tata Steel (which bought Corus Group in 2007), Baosteel Group and Shagang Group. As of 2017[ [update]], though, ArcelorMittal is the world's largest steel producer.\nIn 2005, the British Geological Survey stated China was the top steel producer with about one-third of the world share; Japan, Russia, and the United States were second, third, and fourth, respectively, according to the survey. At the end of 2008, the steel industry faced a sharp downturn that led to many cut-backs. Steelmaking is a significant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions as of 2024. Potential ways to reduce emissions include replacing coke-based production methods with hydrogen, increasing recycling of steel, and applying carbon capture and storage technology.\nRecycling.\nSteel is one of the world's most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of over 60% globally; in the United States alone, over were recycled in the year 2008, for an overall recycling rate of 83%.\nAs more steel is produced than is scrapped, the amount of recycled raw materials is about 40% of the total of steel produced \u2013 in 2016, of crude steel was produced globally, with recycled.\nContemporary.\nCarbon.\nModern steels are made with varying combinations of alloy metals to fulfil many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually less than 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.\nRecent corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) regulations have given rise to a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.\nCarbon steels are often galvanized, through hot-dip or electroplating in zinc for protection against rust.\nAlloy.\nStainless steel contains a minimum of 11% chromium, often combined with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some stainless steels, such as the ferritic stainless steels are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic. Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES.\nAlloy steels are plain-carbon steels in which small amounts of alloying elements like chromium and vanadium have been added. Some more modern steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with large amounts of tungsten and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.\nEglin steel uses a combination of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel, named after Robert Hadfield, or manganese steel, contains 12\u201314% manganese which, when abraded, strain-hardens to form a very hard skin which resists wearing. Uses of this particular alloy include tank tracks, bulldozer blade edges, and cutting blades on the jaws of life.\nStandards.\nMost of the more commonly used steel alloys are categorized into various grades by standards organizations. For example, the Society of Automotive Engineers has a series of grades defining many types of steel. The American Society for Testing and Materials has a separate set of standards, which define alloys such as A36 steel, the most commonly used structural steel in the United States. The JIS also defines a series of steel grades that are used extensively in Japan and surrounding countries.\nUses.\nIron and steel are used widely in the construction of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. It sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite the growth in usage of aluminium, steel is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails and screws, and other household products and cooking utensils.\nOther common applications include shipbuilding, pipelines, mining, offshore construction, aerospace, white goods (e.g. washing machines), heavy equipment such as bulldozers, office furniture, steel wool, tool, and armour in the form of personal vests and helmets or vehicle armour (better known as rolled homogeneous armour in this role).\nHistorical.\nBefore the introduction of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.\nWith the advent of faster and cheaper production methods, steel has become easier to obtain and much cheaper. It has replaced wrought iron for a multitude of purposes. However, the availability of plastics in the latter part of the 20th century allowed these materials to replace steel in some applications due to their lower fabrication cost and weight. Carbon fibre is replacing steel in reinforcement-based applications owing to its high modulus value (up to 5 times higher than steel), but its high cost is a barrier to widespread use in transportation.\nStainless.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLow-background.\nSteel manufactured after World War II is contaminated with radionuclides, because steel production uses air, and the atmosphere is contaminated with radioactive dust produced by nuclear weapons testing. Low-background steel, steel manufactured prior to 1945, is used for certain radiation-sensitive applications such as Geiger counters and radiation shielding.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27059", "revid": "671411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27059", "title": "Stainless steel", "text": "Steel alloy resistant to corrosion\nStainless steel is an iron-based alloy that contains chromium, making it resistant to rust and corrosion. Alternatively, it is known as inox (an abbreviation of the French term \"inoxydable\", meaning non-oxidizable), corrosion-resistant steel (CRES), Nirosta (an abbreviation of the German term \"nichtrostender Stahl\") or rustless steel. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion comes from its chromium content of 10.5% or more, which forms a passive film that protects the material and can self-heal when exposed to oxygen. It can be further alloyed with elements like molybdenum, carbon, nickel and nitrogen to enhance specific properties for various applications.\nThe alloy's properties, such as luster and resistance to corrosion, are useful in many applications. Stainless steel can be rolled into sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing. These can be used in cookware, cutlery, surgical instruments, major appliances, vehicles, construction material in large buildings, industrial equipment (e.g., in paper mills, chemical plants, water treatment), and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products. Some grades are also suitable for forging and casting.\nThe biological cleanability of stainless steel is superior to both copper and aluminium, and comparable to glass. Its cleanability, strength, and corrosion resistance have prompted the use of stainless steel in pharmaceutical and food processing plants.\nDifferent types of stainless steel are labeled with an AISI three-digit number. The ISO 15510 standard lists the chemical compositions of stainless steels of the specifications in existing ISO, ASTM, EN, JIS, and GB standards in a useful interchange table.\nProperties.\nCorrosion resistance.\nAlthough stainless steel does rust, this only affects the outer few layers of atoms, its chromium content shielding deeper layers from oxidation.\nThe addition of nitrogen also improves resistance to pitting corrosion and increases mechanical strength. Thus, there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure. Corrosion resistance can be increased further by the following means:\nStrength.\nThe most common type of stainless steel, 304, has a tensile yield strength around in the annealed condition. It can be strengthened by cold working to a strength of in the full-hard condition.\nThe strongest commonly available stainless steels are precipitation hardening alloys such as 17-4 PH and Custom 465. These can be heat treated to have tensile yield strengths up to .\nMelting point.\nThe melting point of stainless steel ranges from , depending on the alloy, which is near that of ordinary steel, and much higher than aluminium or copper.\nConductivity.\nLike steel, stainless steels are relatively poor conductors of electricity, with significantly lower electrical conductivities than copper. In particular, the electrical contact resistance (ECR) of stainless steel arises as a result of the dense protective oxide layer and limits its functionality in applications as electrical connectors. Copper alloys and nickel-coated connectors tend to exhibit lower ECR values and are preferred materials for such applications. Nevertheless, stainless steel connectors are employed in situations where ECR poses a lower design criterion and corrosion resistance is required, for example in high temperatures and oxidizing environments.\nMagnetism.\nMartensitic, duplex and ferritic stainless steels are magnetic, while austenitic stainless steel is usually non-magnetic. Ferritic steel owes its magnetism to its body-centered cubic crystal structure, in which iron atoms are arranged in cubes (with one iron atom at each corner) and an additional iron atom in the center. This central iron atom is responsible for ferritic steel's magnetic properties. This arrangement also limits the amount of carbon the steel can absorb to around 0.025%. Grades with low coercive field have been developed for electro-valves used in household appliances and for injection systems in internal combustion engines. Some applications require non-magnetic materials, such as magnetic resonance imaging. Austenitic stainless steels, which are usually non-magnetic, can be made slightly magnetic through work hardening. Sometimes, if austenitic steel is bent or cut, magnetism occurs along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\nWear.\nGalling, sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, though other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium, are also susceptible. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken, and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners. Galling can be mitigated by the use of dissimilar materials (bronze against stainless steel) or using different stainless steels (martensitic against austenitic). Additionally, threaded joints may be lubricated to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Nitronic 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.\nDensity.\nThe density of stainless steel ranges from depending on the alloy.\nHistory.\nThe invention of stainless steel followed a series of scientific developments, starting in 1798 when chromium was first shown to the French Academy by Louis Vauquelin. In the early 1800s, British scientists James Stoddart, Michael Faraday, and Robert Mallet observed the resistance of chromium-iron alloys (\"chromium steels\") to oxidizing agents. Robert Bunsen discovered chromium's resistance to strong acids. The corrosion resistance of iron-chromium alloys may have been first recognized in 1821 by Pierre Berthier, who noted their resistance against attack by some acids and suggested their use in cutlery.\nIn the 1840s, both Britain's Sheffield steelmakers and then Krupp of Germany were producing chromium steel with the latter employing it for cannons in the 1850s. In 1861, Robert Forester Mushet took out a patent on chromium steel in Britain.\nThese events led to the first American production of chromium-containing steel by J. Baur of the Chrome Steel Works of Brooklyn for the construction of bridges. A US patent for the product was issued in 1869. This was followed with recognition of the corrosion resistance of chromium alloys by Englishmen John T. Woods and John Clark, who noted ranges of chromium from 5\u201330%, with added tungsten and \"medium carbon\". They pursued the commercial value of the innovation via a British patent for \"Weather-Resistant Alloys\".\nScientists researching steel corrosion in the second half of the 19th century didn't pay attention to the amount of carbon in the alloyed steels they were testing until in 1898 Adolphe Carnot and E. Goutal noted that chromium steels better resist to oxidation with acids the less carbon they contain.\nAlso in the late 1890s, German chemist Hans Goldschmidt developed an aluminothermic (thermite) process for producing carbon-free chromium. Between 1904 and 1911, several researchers, particularly Leon Guillet of France, prepared alloys that would later be considered stainless steel.\nIn 1908, the Essen firm Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft built the 366-ton sailing yacht \"Germania\" featuring a chrome-nickel steel hull, in Germany. In 1911, Philip Monnartz reported on the relationship between chromium content and corrosion resistance. On 17 October 1912, Krupp engineers Benno Strauss and Eduard Maurer patented as Nirosta the austenitic stainless steel that became known as 18/8 or AISI type 304.\nSimilar developments were taking place in the United States, where Christian Dantsizen of General Electric and Frederick Becket (1875\u20131942) at Union Carbide were industrializing ferritic stainless steel. In 1912, Elwood Haynes applied for a US patent on a martensitic stainless steel alloy, which was not granted until 1919.\nHarry Brearley.\nWhile seeking a corrosion-resistant alloy for gun barrels in 1913, Harry Brearley of the Brown-Firth research laboratory in Sheffield, England, discovered and subsequently industrialized a martensitic stainless steel alloy, later known as AISI type 420. The discovery was announced two years later in a January 1915 newspaper article in \"The New York Times\".\nThe metal was later marketed under the \"Staybrite\" brand by Firth Vickers in England and was used for the new entrance canopy for the Savoy Hotel in London in 1929. Brearley applied for a US patent during 1915 only to find that Haynes had already registered one. Brearley and Haynes pooled their funding and, with a group of investors, formed the American Stainless Steel Corporation, with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nRustless steel.\nBrearley initially called his new alloy \"rustless steel\". The alloy was sold in the US under different brand names like \"Allegheny metal\" and \"Nirosta steel\". Even within the metallurgy industry, the name remained unsettled; in 1921, one trade journal called it \"unstainable steel\".\nBrearley worked with a local cutlery manufacturer, who gave it the name \"stainless steel\". As late as 1932, Ford Motor Company continued calling the alloy \"rustless steel\" in automobile promotional materials. However, stainless tended to predominate worldwide, and even in modern Japan, Western cutlery is simply referred to as \"stainless (without \"steel\") spoon/fork\" etc. [\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30ec\u30b9: sutenresu].\nIn 1929, before the Great Depression, over 25,000 tons of stainless steel were manufactured and sold in the US annually.\nMajor technological advances in the 1950s and 1960s allowed the production of large tonnages at an affordable cost:\nFamilies.\nStainless steel is classified into five different \"families\" of alloys, each having a distinct set of attributes. Four of the families are defined by their predominant crystalline structure - the austenitic, ferritic, martensitic, and duplex alloys. The fifth family, precipitation hardening, is defined by the type of heat treatment used to develop its properties.\nAustenitic.\nAustenitic stainless steel is the largest family of stainless steels, making up about two-thirds of all stainless steel production. They have a face-centered cubic crystal structure. This microstructure is achieved by alloying steel with sufficient nickel, manganese, or nitrogen to maintain an austenitic microstructure at all temperatures, ranging from the cryogenic region to the melting point. Thus, austenitic stainless steels are not hardenable by heat treatment since they possess the same microstructure at all temperatures.\nAustenitic stainless steels consist of two subfamilies:\nFerritic.\nFerritic stainless steels have a body-centered cubic crystal structure, are magnetic, and are hardenable by cold working, but not by heat treating. They contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. Due to the near-absence of nickel, they are less expensive than austenitic stainless steels. Representative alloys include Type 409, Type 429, Type 430, and Type 446. Ferritic stainless steels are present in many products, which include:\nMartensitic.\nMartensitic stainless steels have a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure, are magnetic, and are hardenable by heat treating and by cold working. They offer a wide range of properties and are used as stainless engineering steels, stainless tool steels, and creep-resistant steels. They are not as corrosion-resistant as ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content. They fall into four categories (with some overlap):\nMartensitic stainless steels can be heat treated to provide better mechanical properties. The heat treatment typically involves three steps:\nDuplex.\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the ideal ratio being a 50:50 mix, though commercial alloys may have ratios of 40:60. They are characterized by higher chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the yield strength of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel types 304 and 316. Duplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance: lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex. The properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first to extensively use duplex stainless steel. The oil and gas industry became the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works) and in the water industry.\nPrecipitation hardening.\nPrecipitation hardening stainless steels are characterized by the ability to be precipitation hardened to higher strength. There are three types of precipitation hardening stainless steels which are classified according to their crystalline structure:\nClassification systems.\nSeveral different classification systems have been developed for designating stainless steels. The main system used in the United States has been the SAE steel grades numbering system. The SAE numbering system designates stainless steels by \"Type\" followed by a three-digit number and sometimes a letter suffix. A newer system that was jointly developed by ASTM and SAE in 1974 is The Unified Numbering System for Metals and Alloys (UNS). The Unified Numbering System classifies stainless steels using an alpha-numeric identifier consisting of \"S\" followed by five digits, although some austenitic stainless steels with high nickel content may fall into the nickel-base designation which uses \"N\" as the alpha identifier. The UNS designations incorporate previously used designations, whether from the SAE numbering system or proprietary alloy designations. Europe has adopted EN 10088 for classification of stainless steels.\nCorrosion resistance.\nUnlike carbon steel, stainless steels do not suffer uniform corrosion when exposed to wet environments. Unprotected carbon steel rusts readily when exposed to a combination of air and moisture. The resulting iron oxide surface layer is porous and fragile. In addition, as iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel, this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo passivation, spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal. This film is self-repairing, even when scratched or temporarily disturbed by conditions that exceed the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content. It is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic, and SCC (stress corrosion cracking). Any of these forms of corrosion can occur when the grade of stainless steel is not suited for the working environment.\nUniform.\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically where chemicals are produced or heavily used, such as in the pulp and paper industries. The entire surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1\u00a0mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of acid or base and the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as hydrochloric acid and dilute sulfuric acid, and oxidizing acids, such as nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids. Sulfuric acid is one of the most-produced industrial chemicals. At room temperature, type 304 stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while type 316 is resistant to 3% acid up to and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid. Type 904L and Alloy 20 are resistant to sulfuric acid at even higher concentrations above room temperature. Concentrated sulfuric acid possesses oxidizing characteristics like nitric acid, and thus silicon-bearing stainless steels are also useful. Hydrochloric acid damages any kind of stainless steel and should be avoided. All types of stainless steel resist attack from phosphoric acid and nitric acid at room temperature. At high concentrations and elevated temperatures, attack will occur, and higher-alloy stainless steels are required. In general, organic acids are less corrosive than mineral acids such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid.\nType 304 and type 316 stainless steels are unaffected by weak bases such as ammonium hydroxide, even in high concentrations and at high temperatures. The same grades exposed to stronger bases such as sodium hydroxide at high concentrations and high temperatures will likely experience some etching and cracking. Increasing chromium and nickel contents provide increased resistance.\nAll grades resist damage from aldehydes and amines, though in the latter case type 316 is preferable to type 304; cellulose acetate damages type 304 unless the temperature is kept low. Fats and fatty acids only affect type 304 at temperatures above and type 316 SS above , while type 317 SS is unaffected at all temperatures. Type 316L is required for the processing of urea.\nLocalized.\nLocalized corrosion can occur in several ways, e.g. pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion. These localized attacks are most common in the presence of chloride ions. Higher chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\nPitting corrosion is considered the most common form of localized corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN, obtained through the formula:\nformula_1,\nwhere the terms correspond to the proportion of the contents by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen in the steel. For example, if the steel consisted of 15% chromium %Cr would be equal to 15.\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance. Thus, increasing chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen contents provide better resistance to pitting corrosion.\nThough the PREN of certain steel may be theoretically sufficient to resist pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion can still occur when the poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) or when deposits form on the material. In these select areas, the PREN may not be high enough for the service conditions. Good design, fabrication techniques, alloy selection, proper operating conditions based on the concentration of active compounds present in the solution causing corrosion, pH, etc. can prevent such corrosion.\nStress.\nStress corrosion cracking (SCC) is caused by combination of tensile stress and a corrosive environment and can lead to unexpected and sudden failure of a stainless steel component. It may occur when three conditions are met:\nSCC can be prevented by eliminating one of these three conditions.\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\nGalvanic.\nGalvanic corrosion (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would alone, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to having a more positive electrode potential than for example carbon steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water. The relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important in determining the rate of corrosion. In the above example, the surface area of the rivets is small compared to that of the stainless steel sheet, resulting in rapid corrosion. However, if stainless steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be many orders of magnitude smaller. A frequent mistake is to assemble stainless steel plates with carbon steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable, the reverse is not. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.\nHigh-temperature.\nAt elevated temperatures, all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, of which oxygen is the most reactive component. To avoid corrosion in air, carbon steel is limited to approximately . Oxidation resistance in stainless steels increases with additions of chromium, silicon, and aluminium. Small additions of cerium and yttrium increase the adhesion of the oxide layer on the surface. The addition of chromium remains the most common method to increase high-temperature corrosion resistance in stainless steels; chromium reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately , while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately . Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately . Other gases, such as sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, chlorine, also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature, and the alloying content of the stainless steel. With the addition of up to 5% aluminium, ferritic grades Fe-Cr-Al are designed for electrical resistance and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Such alloys include Kanthal, produced in the form of wire or ribbons.\nStandard finishes.\nStandard mill finishes can be applied to flat rolled stainless steel directly by the rollers and by mechanical abrasives. Steel is first rolled to size and thickness and then annealed to change the properties of the final material. Any oxidation that forms on the surface (mill scale) is removed by pickling, and a passivation layer is created on the surface. A final finish can then be applied to achieve the desired aesthetic appearance.\nThe following designations are used in the U.S. to describe stainless steel finishes by ASTM A480/A480M-18 (DIN):\nJoining.\nA wide range of joining processes are available for stainless steels, though welding is by far the most common.\nThe ease of welding largely depends on the type of stainless steel used. Austenitic stainless steels are the easiest to weld by electric arc, with weld properties similar to those of the base metal (not cold-worked). Martensitic stainless steels can also be welded by electric-arc but, as the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and the fusion zone (FZ) form martensite upon cooling, precautions must be taken to avoid cracking of the weld. Improper welding practices can additionally cause sugaring (oxide scaling) and heat tint on the backside of the weld. This can be prevented with the use of back-purging gases, backing plates, and fluxes. Post-weld heat treatment is almost always required while preheating before welding is also necessary in some cases. Electric arc welding of type 430 ferritic stainless steel results in grain growth in the HAZ, which leads to brittleness. This has largely been overcome with stabilized ferritic grades, where niobium, titanium, and zirconium form precipitates that prevent grain growth. Duplex stainless steel welding by electric arc is a common practice but requires careful control of the process parameters. Otherwise, the precipitation of unwanted intermetallic phases occurs, which reduces the toughness of the welds.\nElectric arc welding processes include:\nMIG, MAG and TIG welding are the most common methods.\nOther welding processes include:\nStainless steel may be bonded with adhesives such as silicone, silyl modified polymers, and epoxies. Acrylic and polyurethane adhesives are also used in some situations.\nProduction.\nMost of the world's stainless steel production is produced by the following processes:\nWorld stainless steel production figures are published yearly by the International Stainless Steel Forum. Of the EU production figures, Italy, Belgium, and Spain were notable, while Canada and Mexico produced none. China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, the US, and Indonesia were large producers while Russia reported little production.\nBreakdown of production by stainless steels families in 2017:\nApplications.\nStainless steel is used in a multitude of fields including architecture, art, chemical engineering, food and beverage manufacture, vehicles, medicine, energy and firearms.\nLife cycle cost.\nLife cycle cost (LCC) calculations are used to select the design and the materials that will lead to the lowest cost over the whole life of a project, such as a building or a bridge.\nThe formula, in a simple form, is the following:\n formula_2\nwhere LCC is the overall life cycle cost, AC is the acquisition cost, IC the installation cost, OC the operating and maintenance costs, LP the cost of lost production due to downtime, and RC the replacement materials cost.\nIn addition, \"N\" is the planned life of the project, \"i\" the interest rate, and \"n\" the year in which a particular OC or LP or RC is taking place. The interest rate (\"i\") is used to convert expenses from different years to their present value (a method widely used by banks and insurance companies) so they can be added and compared fairly. The usage of the sum formula (formula_3) captures the fact that expenses over the lifetime of a project must be cumulated (added together) after they are corrected for interest rate.\nApplication of LCC in materials selection\nStainless steel used in projects often results in lower LCC values compared to other materials. The higher acquisition cost (AC) of stainless steel components are often offset by improvements in operating and maintenance costs, reduced loss of production (LP) costs, and the higher resale value of stainless steel components.\nLCC calculations are usually limited to the project itself. However, there may be other costs that a project stakeholder may wish to consider:\nSustainability \u2013 recycling and reuse.\nThe average carbon footprint of stainless steel (all grades, all countries) is estimated to be 2.90\u00a0kg of CO2 per kg of stainless steel produced, of which 1.92\u00a0kg are emissions from raw materials (Cr, Ni, Mo); 0.54\u00a0kg from electricity and steam, and 0.44\u00a0kg are direct emissions (i.e., by the stainless steel plant). Note that stainless steel produced in countries that use cleaner sources of electricity (such as France, which uses nuclear energy) will have a lower carbon footprint. Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO2 footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more. Carbon footprint must not be the only sustainability-related factor for deciding the choice of materials:\nStainless steel is 100% recyclable. An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products, while the remaining 60% comes from manufacturing processes. What prevents a higher recycling content is the availability of stainless steel scrap, in spite of a very high recycling rate. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is in more developed countries and in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag. The next step is the production of hot-rolled and cold-finished steel products in steel mills. Some scrap is produced, which is directly reused in the melting shop. The manufacturing of components is the third step. Some scrap is produced and enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss. The fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants, or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling loop, as shown in the table below:\nNanoscale stainless steel.\nStainless steel nanoparticles have been produced in the laboratory. These may have applications as additives for high-performance applications. For example, sulfurization, phosphorization, and nitridation treatments to produce nanoscale stainless steel based catalysts could enhance the electrocatalytic performance of stainless steel for water splitting.\nHealth effects.\nThere is extensive research indicating some probable increased risk of cancer (particularly lung cancer) from inhaling fumes while welding stainless steel. Stainless steel welding is suspected of producing carcinogenic fumes from cadmium oxides, nickel, and chromium. According to Cancer Council Australia, \"In 2017, all types of welding fumes were classified as a Group 1 carcinogen.\"\nStainless steel is generally considered to be biologically inert. However, during cooking, small amounts of nickel and chromium leach out of new stainless steel cookware into highly acidic food. Nickel can contribute to cancer risks\u2014particularly lung cancer and nasal cancer. However, no connection between stainless steel cookware and cancer has been established.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the co-founder of Polar Music and is best known for managing the Swedish pop band ABBA.\nEarly life.\nStikkan Erik Leopold Anderson was born on 25 January 1931 in Hova, Sweden, the son of a single mother named Ester. Anderson began his career as a chemistry and mathematics teacher at a primary school, by taking night classes after leaving school at the age of 15. Having written his first song at age 16, Anderson soon entered the Swedish popular music scene, becoming a music producer, manager and occasional performer.\nAnderson began writing songs as early as 1951, and in 1959 gained his breakthrough with the song \"\u00c4r du k\u00e4r i mig \u00e4nnu, Klas-G\u00f6ran?\" (\"Are You Still in Love With Me, Klas-G\u00f6ran?\"), written for Swedish singer Lill-Babs. During the 1960s, he was one of Sweden's most prolific songwriters. According to Anton Stimm in the Swedish SVT documentary 'Stikkan' Stig Anderson wrote 767 published titles. Anderson also founded Sweden Music in 1960, as well as several other companies. Three years later, Anderson co-founded Polar Music with Bengt Bernhag.\nManagement before ABBA.\nBy the late 1960s, Anderson was the manager and producer of Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, who would become the two main songwriters of ABBA. He joined the careers of these two, after previously managing the Hootenanny Singers, of which Ulvaeus was a member. Later, in 1972, he began managing Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and finally in 1976 Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog (until December 1975, F\u00e4ltskog was still bound to Cupol/CBS Records under a contract).\nBefore his time with ABBA, Anderson managed some of the biggest Swedish artists at that time, and had a huge number of hits on the Swedish charts. His success earned him the nickname \"The Business\" since he often had several artists in the Top 10 at any time with whom he had written, published, and recorded the songs. When requiring fresh ideas, Anderson would travel to New York City, buy songs that had been American hits, and then translate or transcribe the lyrics on the return journey ready for a recording session shortly after and then have the record on the shelves within a few days. Some songs were sent to IFPI/ASCAP for copyright infringement. \nFor writing the Swedish lyrics to \"Little Green Apples\" (\"Gr\u00f6na sm\u00e5 \u00e4pplen\"), \"Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)\" (\"Mamma \u00e4r lik sin mamma\") and \"Ljuva sextital\", Anderson was awarded Lyricist of the Year during the first Grammis Awards in 1969.\nABBA.\nIn the early years of ABBA's existence, Anderson co-wrote many of the songs' lyrics, among them some of the band's biggest hits, such as \"Ring Ring\" (1973), \"Waterloo\" (1974), \"Honey, Honey\" (1974), \"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\" (1975), \"Mamma Mia\" (1975), \"S.O.S\" (1975), \"Dancing Queen\" (1976), \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" (1977) and \"The Name of the Game\" (1977).\nSometimes referred to as the \"fifth member\" of ABBA, Anderson also owned the band's record label and publishing company. He shared the ownership with Benny Andersson, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Michael B. Tretow, the main sound engineer for the company.\nAnderson was one of the dominant figures behind ABBA, representing their commercial interests and global success through successful record deals. At the same time, he also managed the investment of funds and the enormous financial incomes of Polar Music, holding the majority of stocks. This was an agreement dating back to 1974, and a great deal of the money came from individual record deals he struck for the group, including a ground-breaking agreement for record sales in the Soviet Union in which ABBA recordings were released in exchange for barrels of oil. In the mid-1980s, a considerable part of ABBA's fortune was lost by mismanagement, bad investments, high demands for tax and the rise of credit rates.\nLegal disputes.\nThe contract with the performers, as well as the international distribution, ran from a standard publishing and recording deal involving identical contracts, rather than from one written specifically with the performers of the band. This led to problems later, when three of the four ABBA members terminated their relationship with Anderson when it was revealed that Anderson had used this contract to take a percentage of profits at a value of 4.5 million euros over the course of many years. A complaint against Anderson was submitted to the Stockholm District Court in June 1990 by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog's company \"Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog Produktion AB\", Benny Andersson's company \"Mono Music AB\", as well as a Dutch company holding Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus's rights. The dispute was eventually settled out of court in July 1991; the terms of the settlement remain undisclosed.\nIn 1982, Anni-Frid Lyngstad had sold all the shares in the Polar Music company given to her by Anderson, as she moved abroad. She remains the only member of the band never to seek legal recourse for past royalty fees and was not involved with the legal proceedings against Anderson.\nPolar Music Prize.\nIn 1989, Anderson made a substantial financial endowment to found the Polar Music Prize from money he made when he sold the multimillion-dollar record company Polar Records. In this deal nearly all utilisation and license rights, and the registered ABBA trademark, were sold for an unknown sum of money to PolyGram shortly before the ABBA members took him to court over royalty back payments. Previously, Anderson had licensed ABBA and the members' solo releases to labels internationally as a means to increase royalties. In 1998, PolyGram was in turn sold to Seagram and merged into what is now one of the Big Three record labels, the Universal Music Group, the company that holds the rights to the entire ABBA back catalogue.\nPersonal life and death.\nStig Anderson was married to Gudrun Anderson (n\u00e9e Rystedt, 1931\u20132010), and had two sons, Anders and Lasse and a daughter Marie. His daughter, Marie Ledin (born in 1957, wife of Swedish star and ABBA concert backing vocalist Tomas Ledin) was also involved in the music industry. In the mid-1980s she started a new, highly successful record label called \"Record Station\" (sold to German BMG in the early 1990s), followed by \"Anderson Records\". \"Anderson Records\" released Anni-Frid Lyngstad's Swedish comeback album \"Djupa andetag\" in 1996, as well as Michael B. Tretow's \"Greatest Hits\" in 1999.\nOn 12 September 1997 at the age of 66, Stig Anderson died of a heart attack. His funeral was broadcast live by Sveriges Television.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27061", "revid": "49214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27061", "title": "Soft drink", "text": "Sweetened non-alcoholic drink, often carbonated\nA soft drink (see \u00a7 Terminology for other names) is a class of drink containing no alcohol, usually (but not necessarily) carbonated, and typically including added sweetener. Flavors can be natural, artificial or a mixture of the two. The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet sodas), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives and other ingredients. Coffee, tea, milk, cocoa, and unaltered fruit and vegetable juices are not considered soft drinks.\nSoft drinks are called \"soft\" in contrast with \"hard\" alcoholic drinks and their counterparts: non-alcoholic drinks. Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink (ABV) in many countries and localities if the drink is to not be considered alcoholic. Examples of soft drinks include lemon-lime drinks, orange soda, cola, grape soda, cream soda, ginger ale and root beer.\nSoft drinks may be served cold, over ice cubes, or at room temperature. They are available in many container formats, including cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles. Containers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small bottles to large multi-liter containers. Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants, movie theaters, convenience stores, casual-dining restaurants, dedicated soda stores, vending machines and bars from soda fountain machines.\nWithin a decade of the invention of carbonated water by Joseph Priestley in 1767, inventors in Europe had used his concept to produce the drink in greater quantities. One such inventor, J. J. Schweppe, formed Schweppes in 1783 and began selling the world's first bottled soft drink. Soft drink brands founded in the 19th century include R. White's Lemonade in 1845, Moxie in 1876, Dr Pepper in 1885 and Coca-Cola in 1886. Subsequent brands include Pepsi, Irn-Bru, Sprite, Fanta, 7 Up and RC Cola.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"soft drink\" is a category in the beverage industry, and is broadly used in product labeling and on restaurant menus, generally a euphemistic term meaning non-alcoholic. However, in many countries such drinks are more commonly referred to by regional names, including \"pop\", \"cool drink\", \"fizzy drink\", \"cola\", \"soda\", or \"soda pop\". Other less-used terms include \"carbonated drink\", \"fizzy juice\", \"lolly water\", \"seltzer\", \"coke\", \"tonic\", and \"mineral\". Due to the high sugar content in typical soft drinks, they may also be called \"sugary drinks\".\nIn the United States, the 2003 Harvard Dialect Survey tracked the usage of the nine most common names. Over half of the survey respondents preferred the term \"soda\", which was dominant in the Northeastern United States, California, and the areas surrounding Milwaukee and St. Louis. The term \"pop\", which was preferred by 25% of the respondents, was most popular in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest, while the genericized trademark \"coke\", used by 12% of the respondents, was most popular in the Southern United States. The term \"tonic\" is distinctive to eastern Massachusetts, although its use is declining.\nIn the English-speaking parts of Canada, the term \"pop\" is prevalent, but \"soft drink\" is the most common English term used in Montreal.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the term \"fizzy drink\" is common. \"Pop\" and \"fizzy pop\" are used in Northern England, South Wales, and the Midlands while \"mineral\" is used in Ireland. In Scotland, \"fizzy juice\" or even simply \"juice\" is colloquially encountered, as is \"ginger\". In Australia and New Zealand, \"soft drink\" or \"fizzy drink\" is typically used. In South African English, \"cool drink\" is any soft drink. \nIn other languages, various names are used: descriptive names as \"non-alcoholic beverages\", equivalents of \"soda water\", or generalized names. For example, the Bohemian variant of the Czech language (but not Moravian dialects) uses \"limon\u00e1da\" for all such beverages, not only those made from lemons. Similarly, the Slovak language uses \"malinovka\" (\"raspberry water\") for all such beverages, not only for raspberry ones.\nHistory.\nThe origins of soft drinks lie in the development of fruit-flavored drinks. In the medieval Middle East, a variety of fruit-flavored soft drinks were widely drunk, such as sharbat, and were often sweetened with ingredients such as sugar, syrup and honey. Other common ingredients included lemon, apple, pomegranate, tamarind, jujube, sumac, musk, mint and ice. Middle Eastern drinks later became popular in medieval Europe, where the word \"syrup\" was derived from Arabic. In Tudor England, 'water imperial' was widely drunk; it was a sweetened drink with lemon flavor and containing cream of tartar. 'Manays Cryste' was a sweetened cordial flavored with rosewater, violets or cinnamon.\nAnother early type of soft drink was lemonade, made of water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, but without carbonated water. The \"Compagnie des Limonadiers\" of Paris was granted a monopoly for the sale of lemonade soft drinks in 1676. Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to Parisians.\nCarbonated drinks.\nCarbonated drinks or fizzy drinks are beverages that consist mainly of carbonated water. The dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a liquid, gives rise to \"effervescence\" or \"fizz\". Carbon dioxide is only weakly soluble in water; therefore, it separates into a gas when the pressure is released. The process usually involves injecting carbon dioxide under high pressure. When the pressure is removed, the carbon dioxide is released from the solution as small bubbles, which causes the solution to become effervescent, or fizzy.\nCarbonated beverages are prepared by mixing flavored syrup with carbonated water. Carbonation levels range up to 5\u00a0volumes of CO2 per liquid volume. Ginger ale, colas, and related drinks are carbonated with 3.5\u00a0volumes. Other drinks, often fruity ones, are carbonated less.\nIn the late 18th century, scientists made important progress in replicating naturally carbonated mineral waters. In 1767, Englishman Joseph Priestley first discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water when he suspended a bowl of distilled water above a beer vat at a local brewery in Leeds, England. His invention of carbonated water (later known as \"soda water\", for the use of soda powders in its commercial manufacture) is the major and defining component of most soft drinks.\nPriestley found that water treated in this manner had a pleasant taste, and he offered it to his friends as a refreshing drink. In 1772, Priestley published a paper entitled \"Impregnating Water with Fixed Air\" in which he describes dripping \"oil of vitriol\" (or sulfuric acid as it is now called) onto chalk to produce carbon dioxide gas and encouraging the gas to dissolve into an agitated bowl of water.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Within a decade, inventors in Britain and in Europe had taken Priestley's basic idea\u2014get some \"fixed air,\" mix it with water, shake\u2014and created contraptions that could make carbonated water more quickly, in greater quantities.\nOne of those inventors was named Johann Jacob Schweppe, who sold bottled soda water and whose business is still around today.\"\n\"The great soda-water shake up\" (October 2014) \"The Atlantic\".\nAnother Englishman, John Mervin Nooth, improved Priestley's design and sold his apparatus for commercial use in pharmacies. Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman invented a generating apparatus that made carbonated water from chalk by the use of sulfuric acid. Bergman's apparatus allowed imitation mineral water to be produced in large amounts. Thomas Henry, an apothecary from Manchester, was the first to sell artificial mineral water to the general public for medicinal purposes, beginning in the 1770s. His recipe for 'Bewley's Mephitic Julep' consisted of 3 drachms of fossil alkali to a quart of water, and the manufacture had to 'throw in streams of fixed air until all the alkaline taste is destroyed'.\nJohann Jacob Schweppe developed a process to manufacture bottled carbonated mineral water. He founded the Schweppes Company in Geneva in 1783 to sell carbonated water, and relocated his business to London in 1792. His drink soon gained in popularity; among his newfound patrons was Erasmus Darwin. In 1843, the Schweppes company commercialized Malvern Water at the Holywell Spring in the Malvern Hills, and received a royal warrant from King William IV.\nIt was not long before flavoring was combined with carbonated water. The earliest reference to carbonated ginger beer is in a \"Practical Treatise on Brewing\". published in 1809. The drinking of either natural or artificial mineral water was considered at the time to be a healthy practice, and was promoted by advocates of temperance. Pharmacists selling mineral waters began to add herbs and chemicals to unflavored mineral water. They used birch bark (see birch beer), dandelion, sarsaparilla root, fruit extracts, and other substances.\nPhosphate soda.\nA variant of soda in the United States called \"phosphate soda\" appeared in the late 1870s. It became one of the most popular soda fountain drinks from 1900 until the 1930s, with the lemon or orange phosphate being the most basic. The drink consists of fruit syrup, 1/2 teaspoon of phosphoric acid, and enough carbonated water and ice to fill a glass. This drink was commonly served in pharmacies.\nMass market and industrialization.\nSoft drinks soon outgrew their origins in the medical world and became a widely consumed product, available cheaply for the masses. By the 1840s, there were more than fifty soft drink manufacturers in London, an increase from just ten in the 1820s. Carbonated lemonade was widely available in British refreshment stalls in 1833, and in 1845, R. White's Lemonade went on sale in the UK. For the Great Exhibition of 1851 held at Hyde Park in London, Schweppes was designated the official drink supplier and sold over a million bottles of lemonade, ginger beer, Seltzer water and soda-water. There was a Schweppes soda water fountain, situated directly at the entrance to the exhibition.\nMixer drinks became popular in the second half of the century. Tonic water was originally quinine added to water as a prophylactic against malaria and was consumed by British officials stationed in the tropical areas of South Asia and Africa. As the quinine powder was so bitter people began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858. The mixed drink gin and tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin.\nA persistent problem in the soft drinks industry was the lack of an effective sealing of the bottles. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. The bottles could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured. R. White's, by now the biggest soft drinks company in London and south-east England, featured a wide range of drinks on their price list in 1887, all of which were sold in Codd's glass bottles, with choices including strawberry soda, raspberry soda, cherryade and cream soda.\nIn 1892, the \"Crown Cork Bottle Seal\" was patented by William Painter, a Baltimore, Maryland machine shop operator. It was the first bottle top to successfully keep the bubbles in the bottle. In 1899, the first patent was issued for a glass-blowing machine for the automatic production of glass bottles. Earlier glass bottles had all been hand-blown. Four years later, the new bottle-blowing machine was in operation. It was first operated by Michael Owens, an employee of Libby Glass Company. Within a few years, glass bottle production increased from 1,400 bottles a day to about 58,000 bottles a day.\nIn America, soda fountains were initially more popular, and many Americans would frequent the soda fountain daily. Beginning in 1806, Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman sold soda waters in New Haven, Connecticut. He used a Nooth apparatus to produce his waters. Businessmen in Philadelphia and New York City also began selling soda water in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, John Matthews of New York City and John Lippincott of Philadelphia began manufacturing soda fountains. Both men were successful and built large factories for fabricating fountains. Due to problems in the U.S. glass industry, bottled drinks remained a small portion of the market throughout much of the 19th century. (However, they were known in England. In \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\", published in 1848, the caddish Huntingdon, recovering from months of debauchery, wakes at noon and gulps a bottle of soda-water.)\nIn the early 20th century, sales of bottled soda increased greatly around the world, and in the second half of the 20th century, canned soft drinks became an important share of the market. During the 1920s, \"Home-Paks\" were invented. \"Home-Paks\" are the familiar six-pack cartons made from cardboard. Vending machines also began to appear in the 1920s. Since then, soft drink vending machines have become increasingly popular. Both hot and cold drinks are sold in these self-service machines throughout the world.\nConsumption.\nPer capita consumption of soda varies considerably around the world. As of 2014, the top consuming countries per capita were Argentina, the United States, Chile, and Mexico. Developed countries in Europe and elsewhere in the Americas had considerably lower consumption. Annual average consumption in the United States, at 153.5 liters, was about twice that in the United Kingdom (77.7) or Canada (85.3).\nIn recent years, soda consumption has generally declined in the West. According to one estimate, per capita consumption in the United States reached its peak in 1998 and has continually fallen since. A study in the journal \"Obesity\" found that from 2003 to 2014 the proportion of Americans who drank a sugary beverage on a given day fell from approximately 62% to 50% for adults, and from 80% to 61% for children. The decrease has been attributed to, among other factors, an increased awareness of the dangers of obesity, and government efforts to improve diets.\nAt the same time, soda consumption has increased in some low- or middle-income countries such as Cameroon, Georgia, India and Vietnam as soda manufacturers increasingly target these markets and consumers have increasing discretionary income.\nProduction.\nSoft drinks are made by mixing dry or fresh ingredients with water. Production of soft drinks can be done at factories or at home. Soft drinks can be made at home by mixing a syrup or dry ingredients with carbonated water, or by Lacto-fermentation. Syrups are commercially sold by companies such as Soda-Club; dry ingredients are often sold in pouches, in a style of the popular U.S. drink mix Kool-Aid. Carbonated water is made using a soda siphon or a home carbonation system or by dropping dry ice into water. Food-grade carbon dioxide, used for carbonating drinks, often comes from ammonia plants.\nDrinks like ginger ale and root beer are often brewed using yeast to cause carbonation.\nOf most importance is that the ingredient meets the agreed specification on all major parameters. This is not only the functional parameter (in other words, the level of the major constituent), but the level of impurities, the microbiological status, and physical parameters such as color, particle size, etc.\nSome soft drinks contain measurable amounts of alcohol. In some older preparations, this resulted from natural fermentation used to build the carbonation. In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other products such as non-alcoholic beer) are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. Modern drinks introduce carbon dioxide for carbonation, but there is some speculation that alcohol might result from fermentation of sugars in a non-sterile environment. A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.\nProducers.\nMarket control of the soft drink industry varies on a country-by-country basis. However, PepsiCo and the Coca-Cola Company remain the two largest producers of soft drinks in most regions of the world. In North America, Keurig Dr Pepper and Jones Soda also hold a significant amount of market share.\nHealth concerns.\nThe over-consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dental caries, and low nutrient levels. A few experimental studies reported the role sugar-sweetened soft drinks potentially contribute to these ailments, though other studies show conflicting information. According to a 2013 systematic review of systematic reviews, 83.3% of the systematic reviews without reported conflict of interest concluded that sugar-sweetened soft drinks consumption could be a potential risk factor for weight gain.\nObesity and weight-related diseases.\nFrom 1977 to 2002, Americans doubled their consumption of sweetened beverages\u2014a trend that was paralleled by doubling the prevalence of obesity. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with weight and obesity, and changes in consumption can help predict changes in weight.\nThe consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks can also be associated with many weight-related diseases, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risk factors.\nDental decay.\nMost soft drinks contain high concentrations of simple carbohydrates: glucose, fructose, sucrose and other simple sugars. If oral bacteria ferment carbohydrates and produce acids that may dissolve tooth enamel and induce dental decay, then sweetened drinks may increase the risk of dental caries. The risk would be greater if the frequency of consumption is high.\nA large number of soda pops are acidic as are many fruits, sauces, and other foods. Drinking acidic drinks over a long period and continuous sipping may erode the tooth enamel. A 2007 study determined that some flavored sparkling waters are as erosive or more so than orange juice.\nUsing a drinking straw is often advised by dentists as the drink does not come into as much contact with the teeth. It has also been suggested that brushing teeth right after drinking soft drinks should be avoided as this can result in additional erosion to the teeth due to mechanical action of the toothbrush on weakened enamel.\nBone density and bone loss.\nA 2006 study of several thousand men and women, found that women who regularly drank cola-based sodas (three or more a day) had significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) of about 4% in the hip compared to women who did not consume colas. The study found that the effect of regular consumption of cola sodas was not significant on men's BMD.\nBenzene.\nIn 2006, the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency published the results of its survey of benzene levels in soft drinks, which tested 150 products and found that four contained benzene levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water.\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration released its own test results of several soft drinks containing benzoates and ascorbic or erythorbic acid. Five tested drinks contained benzene levels above the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended standard of 5 ppb. As of 2006, the FDA stated its belief that \"the levels of benzene found in soft drinks and other beverages to date do not pose a safety concern for consumers\".\nKidney stones.\nA study published in the \"Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology\" in 2013 concluded that consumption of soft drinks was associated with a 23% higher risk of developing kidney stones.\nMortality, circulatory and digestive diseases.\nIn a 2019 study of 451,743 Europeans, those who had a consumption of soft drinks of two or more a day, had a greater chance of all-cause mortality than those who drank less than one per month. People who drank artificially sweetened drinks had a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, and people who drank sugar-sweetened drinks with digestive diseases.\nGovernment regulation.\nSchools.\nSince at least 2006, debate on whether high-calorie soft drink vending machines should be allowed in schools has been on the rise. Opponents of the soft drink vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents also argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. A 2011 bill to tax soft drinks in California failed, with some opposing lawmakers arguing that parents\u2014not the government\u2014should be responsible for children's drink choices.\nOn May 3, 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Cadbury Schweppes, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and the American Beverage Association announced new guidelines that will voluntarily remove high-calorie soft drinks from all U.S. schools.\nOn May 19, 2006, the British education secretary, Alan Johnson, announced new minimum nutrition standards for school food. Among a wide range of measures, from September 2006, school lunches will be free from carbonated drinks. Schools will also end the sale of junk food (including carbonated drinks) in vending machines and tuck shops.\nIn 2008, Samantha K Graff published an article in the \"Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science\" regarding the \"First Amendment Implications of Restricting Food and Beverages Marketing in Schools\". The article examines a school district's policy regarding limiting the sale and marketing of soda in public schools, and how certain policies can invoke a violation of the First Amendment. Due to district budget cuts and loss in state funding, many school districts allow commercial businesses to market and advertise their product (including junk food and soda) to public school students for additional revenue. Junk food and soda companies have acquired exclusive rights to vending machines throughout many public school campuses. Opponents of corporate marketing and advertising on school grounds urge school officials to restrict or limit a corporation's power to promote, market, and sell their product to school students. In the 1970s, the Supreme Court ruled that advertising was not a form of free expression, but a form of business practices which should be regulated by the government. In the 1976 case of \"Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council\", the Supreme Court ruled that advertising, or \"commercial speech\", to some degree is protected under the First Amendment. To avoid a First Amendment challenge by corporations, public schools could create contracts that restrict the sale of certain product and advertising. Public schools can also ban the selling of all food and drink products on campus, while not infringing on a corporation's right to free speech.\nOn December 13, 2010, President Obama signed the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 (effective in 2014) that mandates schools that receive federal funding must offer healthy snacks and drinks to students. The act bans the selling of soft drinks to students and requires schools to provide healthier options such as water, unflavored low-fat milk, 100% fruit and vegetable drinks or sugar-free carbonated drinks. The portion sizes available to students will be based on age: eight ounces for elementary schools, twelve ounces for middle and high schools. Proponents of the act predict the new mandate it will make it easier for students to make healthy drink choices while at school.\nIn 2015, Terry-McElarth and colleagues published a study in the \"American Journal of Preventive Medicine\" on regular soda policies and their effect on school drink availability and student consumption. The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a program beginning in the 2014\u20132015 school year that requires schools participating in federally reimbursable meal programs to remove all competitive venues (a la carte cafeteria sales, vending machines, and stores/snack bars/carts), on the availability of unhealthy drinks at schools and student consumption. The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.\nTaxation.\nIn the United States, legislators, health experts and consumer advocates are considering levying higher taxes on the sale of soft drinks and other sweetened products to help curb the epidemic of obesity among Americans, and its harmful impact on overall health. Some speculate that higher taxes could help reduce soda consumption. Others say that taxes should help fund education to increase consumer awareness of the unhealthy effects of excessive soft drink consumption, and also help cover costs of caring for conditions resulting from overconsumption. The food and drink industry holds considerable clout in Washington, DC, as it has contributed more than $50 million to legislators since 2000.\nIn January 2013, a British lobby group called for the price of sugary fizzy drinks to be increased, with the money raised (an estimated \u00a31 billion at 20p per litre) to be put towards a \"Children's Future Fund\", overseen by an independent body, which would encourage children to eat healthily in school.\nIn 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain imposed a 50% tax on soft drinks and a 100% tax on energy drinks to curb excess consumption of the commodity and for additional revenue.\nAttempted ban.\nIn March 2013, New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed to ban the sale of non-diet soft drinks larger than 16 ounces, except in convenience stores and supermarkets. A lawsuit against the ban was upheld by a state judge, who voiced concerns that the ban was \"fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences\". Bloomberg announced that he would be appealing the verdict. The state appellate courts upheld the trial court decision, and the ban remains unenforceable as of 2021.\nIn 2022, amidst soaring rates of obesity and diabetes, the Mexican state of Oaxaca enacted a ban on sugary drinks, including notably Coca-Cola, but it was poorly enforced.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Crocker received his bachelor's degree (1968) and PhD (1977) from the University of California, Los Angeles. \nCareer.\nAs a graduate student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in the 1960s, he was part of the team that developed the protocols for the ARPANET which were the foundation for today's Internet. He said \"While much of the development proceeded according to a grand plan, the design of the protocols and the creation of the RFCs was largely accidental.\" He was instrumental in forming a Network Working Group (NWG) in 1969 and was the instigator of the Request for Comment (RFC) series, authoring the first RFC and many more. Crocker led other graduate students, including Jon Postel and Vint Cerf, in designing a host-host protocol known as the Network Control Program (NCP). They planned to use separate protocols, Telnet and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), to run functions across the ARPANET. NCP codified the ARPANET network interface, making it easier to establish, and enabling more sites to join the network.\nHe formed the International Network Working Group (INWG) in 1972, then his research interests shifted to artificial intelligence. He was acknowledged by Cerf and Kahn in their seminal 1974 paper on internetworking\".\" \nWhile at UCLA Crocker taught an extension course on computer programming (for the IBM 7094 mainframe computer). The class was intended to teach digital processing and assembly language programming to high school teachers, so that they could offer such courses in their high schools. A number of high school students were also admitted to the course, to ensure that they would be able to understand this new discipline. Crocker was also active in the newly formed UCLA Computer Club.\nCrocker has been a program manager at Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a senior researcher at USC's Information Sciences Institute, founder and director of the Computer Science Laboratory at The Aerospace Corporation and a vice president at Trusted Information Systems. In 1994, Crocker was one of the founders and chief technology officer of CyberCash, Inc. In 1998, he founded and ran Executive DSL, a DSL-based ISP. In 1999 he cofounded and was CEO of Longitude Systems. He is currently CEO of Shinkuro, a research and development company.\nThe Networking Working Group RFC's provided the context in which the IETF was created in 1986.

{"id": "27065", "revid": "7770027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27065", "title": "Standardization", "text": "Implementation of technical standards based on the consensus of different parties\nStandardization (American English) or standardisation (British English) is the process of implementing and developing technical standards based on the consensus of different parties that include firms, users, interest groups, standards organizations and governments. Standardization can help maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, efficiency, and quality. It can also facilitate a normalization of formerly custom processes. \nIn social sciences, including economics, the idea of \"standardization\" is close to the solution for a coordination problem, a situation in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. Divergent national standards impose costs on consumers and can be a form of non-tariff trade barrier.\nObjectives.\nThe European Union's Regulation 1025/2012 on standardisation states that \"The primary objective of standardisation is the definition of voluntary technical or quality specifications with which current or future products, production processes or services may comply.\"\nHistory.\nEarly examples.\nStandard weights and measures were developed by the Indus Valley civilization. The centralized weight and measure system served the commercial interest of Indus merchants as smaller weight measures were used to measure luxury goods while larger weights were employed for buying bulkier items, such as food grains etc. Weights existed in multiples of a standard weight and in categories. Technical standardization enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement for construction. Uniform units of length were used in the planning of towns such as Lothal, Surkotada, Kalibangan, Dolavira, Harappa, and Mohenjo-daro. The weights and measures of the Indus civilization also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified. Shigeo Iwata describes the excavated weights unearthed from the Indus civilization:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A total of 558 weights were excavated from Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Chanhu-daro, not including defective weights. They did not find statistically significant differences between weights that were excavated from five different layers, each measuring about 1.5\u00a0m in depth. This was evidence that strong control existed for at least a 500-year period. The 13.7-g weight seems to be one of the units used in the Indus valley. The notation was based on the binary and decimal systems. 83% of the weights which were excavated from the above three cities were cubic, and 68% were made of chert.\n18th century attempts.\nThe implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly important with the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the need for high-precision machine tools and interchangeable parts.\nHenry Maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800. This allowed for the standardization of screw thread sizes for the first time and paved the way for the practical application of interchangeability (an idea that was already taking hold) to nuts and bolts.\nBefore this, screw threads were usually made by chipping and filing (that is, with skilled freehand use of chisels and files). Nuts were rare; metal screws, when made at all, were usually for use in wood. Metal bolts passing through wood framing to a metal fastening on the other side were usually fastened in non-threaded ways (such as clinching or upsetting against a washer). Maudslay standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of taps and dies that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.\nNational standard.\nMaudslay's work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards spread a bit within their industries.\nJoseph Whitworth's screw thread measurements were adopted as the first (unofficial) national standard by companies around the country in 1841. It came to be known as the British Standard Whitworth, and was widely adopted in other countries.\nThis new standard specified a 55\u00b0 thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327\"p\" and a radius of 0.137329\"p\", where \"p\" is the pitch. The thread pitch increased with diameter in steps specified on a chart. An example of the use of the Whitworth thread is the Royal Navy's Crimean War gunboats. These were the first instance of \"mass-production\" techniques being applied to marine engineering.\nWith the adoption of BSW by British railway lines, many of which had previously used their own standard both for threads and for bolt head and nut profiles, and improving manufacturing techniques, it came to dominate British manufacturing.\nAmerican Unified Coarse was originally based on almost the same imperial fractions. The Unified thread angle is 60\u00b0 and has flattened crests (Whitworth crests are rounded). Thread pitch is the same in both systems except that the thread pitch for the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u00a0in. (inch) bolt is 12 threads per inch (tpi) in BSW versus 13 tpi in the UNC.\nNational standards body.\nBy the end of the 19th century, differences in standards between companies were making trade increasingly difficult and strained. For instance, an iron and steel dealer recorded his displeasure in \"The Times\": \"Architects and engineers generally specify such unnecessarily diverse types of sectional material or given work that anything like economical and continuous manufacture becomes impossible. In this country no two professional men are agreed upon the size and weight of a girder to employ for given work.\"\nThe Engineering Standards Committee was established in London in 1901 as the world's first national standards body. It subsequently extended its standardization work and became the British Engineering Standards Association in 1918, adopting the name British Standards Institution in 1931 after receiving its Royal Charter in 1929. The national standards were adopted universally throughout the country, and enabled the markets to act more rationally and efficiently, with an increased level of cooperation.\nAfter the First World War, similar national bodies were established in other countries. The was set up in Germany in 1917, followed by its counterparts, the American National Standard Institute and the French Commission Permanente de Standardisation, both in 1918.\nRegional standards organization.\nAt a regional level (e.g. Europa, the Americas, Africa, etc) or at subregional level (e.g. Mercosur, Andean Community, South East Asia, South East Africa, etc), several Regional Standardization Organizations exist (see also Standards Organization).\nThere are three regional standards organizations in Europe known as European Standardization Organizations (ESOs), or European standards bodies. CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI are recognized via the EU's Regulation on Standardization (Regulation (EU) 1025/2012). CEN develops standards for numerous kinds of products, materials, services and processes. Some sectors covered by CEN include transport equipment and services, chemicals, construction, consumer products, defence and security, energy, food and feed, health and safety, healthcare, digital sector, machinery or services. The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) is the European Standardization organization developing standards in the electrotechnical area and corresponding to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in Europe.\nInternational standards.\nThe first modern International Organization (Intergovernmental Organization), the International Telegraph Union (now the International Telecommunication Union), was created in 1865 to set international standards in order to connect national telegraph networks, as a merger of two predecessor organizations (Bern and Paris treaties) that had similar objectives, but in more limited territories. With the advent of radiocommunication soon after its creation, the work of the ITU quickly expanded from the standardization of telegraph communications to the development of standards for telecommunications in general.\nInternational Standards Associations.\nBy the mid to late 19th century, efforts were being made to standardize electrical measurement. Lord Kelvin was an important figure in this process, introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. In 1857, he introduced a series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the \"Kelvin balance\" or \"Ampere balance\" (\"SiC\"), for the precise specification of the ampere, the standard unit of electric current.\nR. E. B. Crompton became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century. Many companies had entered the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for voltage, frequency, current and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams. Adjacent buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because they had been fitted out by different companies. Crompton could see the lack of efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international standard for electric engineering.\nIn 1904, Crompton represented Britain at the International Electrical Congress, held in connection with Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis as part of a delegation by the Institute of Electrical Engineers. He presented a paper on standardization, which was so well received that he was asked to look into the formation of a commission to oversee the process. By 1906 his work was complete and he drew up a permanent constitution for the International Electrotechnical Commission. The body held its first meeting that year in London, with representatives from 14 countries. In honour of his contribution to electrical standardization, Lord Kelvin was elected as the body's first President.\nThe International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA) was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation for all technical standards and specifications. The body was suspended in 1942 during World War\u00a0II.\nAfter the war, ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organization for Standardization (ISO); the new organization officially began operations in February\u00a01947.\nIn general, each country or economy has a single recognized National Standards Body (NSB). Examples include ABNT, AENOR (now called UNE, \"Spanish Association for Standardization\"), AFNOR, ANSI, BSI, DGN, DIN, IRAM, JISC, KATS, SABS, SAC, SCC, SIS. An NSB is likely the sole member from that economy in ISO.\nNSBs may be either public or private sector organizations, or combinations of the two. For example, the three NSBs of Canada, Mexico and the United States are respectively the Standards Council of Canada (SCC), the General Bureau of Standards (, DGN), and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). SCC is a Canadian Crown Corporation, DGN is a governmental agency within the Mexican Ministry of Economy, and ANSI and AENOR are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with members from both the private and public sectors. The determinants of whether an NSB for a particular economy is a public or private sector body may include the historical and traditional roles that the private sector fills in public affairs in that economy or the development stage of that economy.\nUsage.\nStandards can be:\nThe existence of a published standard does not necessarily imply that it is useful or correct. Just because an item is stamped with a standard number does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for any particular use. The people who use the item or service (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify it (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the available standards, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly: validation and verification.\nTo avoid the proliferation of industry standards, also referred to as private standards, regulators in the United States are instructed by their government offices to adopt \"voluntary consensus standards\" before relying upon \"industry standards\" or developing \"government standards\". Regulatory authorities can reference voluntary consensus standards to translate internationally accepted criteria into public policy.\nInformation exchange.\nIn the context of information exchange, standardization refers to the process of developing standards for specific business processes using specific formal languages. These standards are usually developed in voluntary consensus standards bodies such as the United Nations Center for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), and the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).\nThere are many specifications that govern the operation and interaction of devices and software on the Internet, which do not use the term \"standard\" in their names. The W3C, for example, publishes \"Recommendations\", and the IETF publishes \"Requests for Comments\" (RFCs). Nevertheless, these publications are often referred to as \"standards\", because they are the products of regular standardization processes.\nEnvironmental protection.\nStandardized product certifications such as of organic food, buildings or possibly sustainable seafood as well as standardized product safety evaluation and dis/approval procedures (e.g. regulation of chemicals, cosmetics and food safety) can protect the environment. This effect may depend on associated modified consumer choices, strategic product support/obstruction, requirements and bans as well as their accordance with a scientific basis, the robustness and applicability of a scientific basis, whether adoption of the certifications is voluntary, and the socioeconomic context (systems of governance and the economy), with possibly most certifications being so far mostly largely ineffective.\nMoreover, standardized scientific frameworks can enable evaluation of levels of environmental protection, such as of marine protected areas, and serve as, potentially evolving, guides for improving, planning and monitoring the protection-quality, -scopes and -extents. \nMoreover, technical standards could decrease electronic waste and reduce resource-needs such as by thereby requiring (or enabling) products to be interoperable, compatible (with other products, infrastructures, environments, etc), durable, energy-efficient, modular, upgradeable/repairable and recyclable and conform to versatile, optimal standards and protocols.\nSuch standardization is not limited to the domain of electronic devices like smartphones and phone chargers but could also be applied to e.g. the energy infrastructure. Policy-makers could develop policies \"fostering standard design and interfaces, and promoting the re-use of modules and components across plants to develop more sustainable energy infrastructure\". Computers and the Internet are some of the tools that could be used to increase practicability and reduce suboptimal results, detrimental standards and bureaucracy, which is often associated with traditional processes and results of standardization. Taxes and subsidies, and funding of research and development could be used complementarily. Standardized measurement is used in monitoring, reporting and verification frameworks of environmental impacts, usually of companies, for example to prevent underreporting of greenhouse gas emissions by firms.\nProduct testing and analysis.\nIn routine product testing and product analysis results can be reported using official or informal standards. It can be done to increase consumer protection, to ensure safety or healthiness or efficiency or performance or sustainability of products. It can be carried out by the manufacturer, an independent laboratory, a government agency, a magazine or others on a voluntary or commissioned/mandated basis.\nEstimating the environmental impacts of food products in a standardized way \u2013 as has been done with a dataset of &gt;57,000 food products in supermarkets \u2013 could e.g. be used to inform consumers or in policy. For example, such may be useful for approaches using personal carbon allowances (or similar quota) or for targeted alteration of (ultimate overall) costs.\nSafety.\nPublic information symbols.\nPublic information symbols (e.g. hazard symbols), especially when related to safety, are often standardized, sometimes on the international level.&lt;ref name=\"10.1007/978-3-319-60582-1\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nBiosafety.\nStandardization is also used to ensure safe design and operation of laboratories and similar potentially dangerous workplaces, e.g. to ensure biosafety levels. There is research into microbiology safety standards used in clinical and research laboratories.\nDefense.\nIn the context of defense, standardization has been defined by NATO as \"The development and implementation of concepts, doctrines, procedures and designs to achieve and maintain the required levels of compatibility, interchangeability or commonality in the operational, procedural, material, technical and administrative fields to attain interoperability.\"\nErgonomics, workplace and health.\nIn some cases, standards are being used in the design and operation of workplaces and products that can impact consumers' health. Some of such standards seek to ensure occupational safety and health and ergonomics. For example, chairs (see e.g. active sitting and steps of research) could be potentially be designed and chosen using standards that may or may not be based on adequate scientific data. Standards could reduce the variety of products and lead to convergence on fewer broad designs \u2013 which can often be efficiently mass-produced via common shared automated procedures and instruments \u2013 or formulations deemed to be the most healthy, most efficient or best compromise between healthiness and other factors. Standardization is sometimes or could also be used to ensure or increase or enable consumer health protection beyond the workplace and ergonomics such as standards in food, food production, hygiene products, tab water, cosmetics, drugs/medicine, drink and dietary supplements, especially in cases where there is robust scientific data that suggests detrimental impacts on health (e.g. of ingredients) despite being substitutable and not necessarily of consumer interest.\nClothing.\nClinical assessment.\nIn the context of assessment, standardization may define how a measuring instrument or procedure is similar to every subjects or patients. For example, educational psychologist may adopt structured interview to systematically interview the people in concern. By delivering the same procedures, all subjects is evaluated using same criteria and minimizing any confounding variable that reduce the validity. Some other example includes mental status examination and personality test.\nSocial science.\nIn the context of social criticism and social science, standardization often means the process of establishing standards of various kinds and improving efficiency to handle people, their interactions, cases, and so forth. Examples include formalization of judicial procedure in court, and establishing uniform criteria for diagnosing mental disease. Standardization in this sense is often discussed along with (or synonymously to) such large-scale social changes as modernization, bureaucratization, homogenization, and centralization of society.\nCustomer service.\nIn the context of customer service, standardization refers to the process of developing an international standard that enables organizations to focus on customer service, while at the same time providing recognition of success through a third party organization, such as the British Standards Institution. An international standard has been developed by The International Customer Service Institute.\nSupply and materials management.\nIn the context of supply chain management and materials management, standardization covers the process of specification and use of any item the company must buy in or make, allowable substitutions, and build or buy decisions.\nProcess.\nThe process of standardization can itself be standardized. There are at least four levels of standardization: compatibility, interchangeability, commonality and reference. These standardization processes create compatibility, similarity, measurement, and symbol standards.\nThere are typically four different techniques for standardization\nTypes of standardization process:\nEffects.\nStandardization has a variety of benefits and drawbacks for firms and consumers participating in the market, and on technology and innovation.\nEffect on firms.\nThe primary effect of standardization on firms is that the basis of competition is shifted from integrated systems to individual components within the system. Prior to standardization a company's product must span the entire system because individual components from different competitors are incompatible, but after standardization each company can focus on providing an individual component of the system. When the shift toward competition based on individual components takes place, firms selling tightly integrated systems must quickly shift to a modular approach, supplying other companies with subsystems or components.\nEffect on consumers.\nStandardization has a variety of benefits for consumers, but one of the greatest benefits is enhanced network effects. Standards increase compatibility and interoperability between products, allowing information to be shared within a larger network and attracting more consumers to use the new technology, further enhancing network effects. Other benefits of standardization to consumers are reduced uncertainty, because consumers can be more certain that they are not choosing the wrong product, and reduced lock-in, because the standard makes it more likely that there will be competing products in the space. Consumers may also get the benefit of being able to mix and match components of a system to align with their specific preferences. Once these initial benefits of standardization are realized, further benefits that accrue to consumers as a result of using the standard are driven mostly by the quality of the technologies underlying that standard.\nProbably the greatest downside of standardization for consumers is lack of variety. There is no guarantee that the chosen standard will meet all consumers' needs or even that the standard is the best available option. Another downside is that if a standard is agreed upon before products are available in the market, then consumers are deprived of the penetration pricing that often results when rivals are competing to rapidly increase market share in an attempt to increase the likelihood that their product will become the standard. It is also possible that a consumer will choose a product based upon a standard that fails to become dominant. In this case, the consumer will have spent resources on a product that is ultimately less useful to him or her as the result of the standardization process.\nEffect on technology.\nMuch like the effect on consumers, the effect of standardization on technology and innovation is mixed. Meanwhile, the various links between research and standardization have been identified, also as a platform of knowledge transfer and translated into policy measures (e.g. http://).\nIncreased adoption of a new technology as a result of standardization is important because rival and incompatible approaches competing in the marketplace can slow or even kill the growth of the technology (a state known as market fragmentation). The shift to a modularized architecture as a result of standardization brings increased flexibility, rapid introduction of new products, and the ability to more closely meet individual customer's needs.\nThe negative effects of standardization on technology have to do with its tendency to restrict new technology and innovation. Standards shift competition from features to price because the features are defined by the standard. The degree to which this is true depends on the specificity of the standard. Standardization in an area also rules out alternative technologies as options while encouraging others.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27067", "revid": "44840730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27067", "title": "Sub-Saharan Africa", "text": "Region south of the Sahara Desert\nSub-Saharan Africa is the area and regions of the continent of Africa that lie south of the Sahara. These include Central Africa, East Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Geopolitically, in addition to the African countries and territories that are situated fully in that specified region, the term may also include polities that only have part of their territory located in that region, per the definition of the United Nations (UN). This is considered a non-standardised geographical region with the number of countries included varying from 46 to 48 depending on the organisation describing the region (e.g. UN, WHO, World Bank, etc.). The African Union (AU) uses a different regional breakdown, recognising all 55 member states on the continent\u2014grouping them into five distinct and standard regions.\nThe term serves as a grouping counterpart to North Africa, which is instead grouped with the definition of MENA (i.e. Middle East and North Africa) as it is part of the Arab world, and most North African states are likewise members of the Arab League. However, while they are also member states of the Arab League, the Comoros, Djibouti, Mauritania, and Somalia (and sometimes Sudan) are all geographically considered to be part of sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, the UN Development Programme applies the \"sub-Saharan\" classification to 46 of Africa's 55 countries, excluding Djibouti, SADR, Somalia, and Sudan. The concept has been criticised by scholars on both sides of the Sahara as a racialist construction.\nSince around 3900 BCE, the Saharan and sub-Saharan regions of Africa have been separated by the extremely harsh climate of the sparsely populated Sahara, forming an effective barrier that is interrupted only by the Nile in Sudan, though navigation on the Nile was blocked by the Sudd and the river's cataracts. The Sahara pump theory explains how flora and fauna (including \"Homo sapiens\") left Africa to penetrate Eurasia and beyond. African pluvial periods are associated with a \"Wet Sahara\" phase, during which larger lakes and more rivers existed.\nNomenclature and conceptual criticism.\nGeographers historically divided the region into several distinct ethnographic sections based on each area's respective inhabitants. The concept of \"sub-Saharan Africa\" has been criticised as a racist construction intended to separate Africa. Critics from various countries have provided arguments supporting the interconnectedness of continental Africa, pointing to historical and cultural connections, as well as trade between North, West, and East Africa.\nCommentators in Arabic in the medieval period used the general term \"bil\u00e2d as-s\u00fbd\u00e2n\" (\"Land of the Blacks\") for the vast Sudan region (an expression denoting Central and West Africa), or sometimes extending from the coast of West Africa to Western Sudan. Its equivalent in Southeast Africa was \"Zanj\" (\"Country of the Blacks\"), which referred primarily to the Swahili coast.\nThe geographers drew an explicit ethnographic distinction between the Sudan region and its analogue Zanj, from the area to their extreme east on the Red Sea coast in the Horn of Africa. In modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea was \"Al-Habash\" or Abyssinia, which was inhabited by the \"Habash\" or Abyssinians, who were the forebears of the Habesha. In northern Somalia was \"Barbara\" or the \"Bilad al-Barbar\" (\"Land of the Berbers\"), which was inhabited by the Eastern \"Baribah\" or \"Barbaroi\", as the ancestors of the Somalis were referred to by medieval Arab and ancient Greek geographers, respectively.\nClimate zones and ecoregions.\nSub-Saharan Africa has a wide variety of climate zones or biomes. South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular are considered megadiverse countries. It has a dry winter season and a wet summer season.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nAccording to paleontology, early hominid skull anatomy was similar to that of their close cousins, the great African forest apes, gorilla and chimpanzee. However, they had adopted a bipedal locomotion and freed hands, giving them a crucial advantage enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open savanna at a time when Africa was drying up, with savanna encroaching on forested areas. This occurred 10\u00a0million to 5\u00a0million years ago.\nBy 3\u00a0million years ago several australopithecine hominid species had developed throughout Southern, East, and Central Africa. They were tool users rather than tool manufacturers. The next major evolutionary step occurred around 2.3\u00a0million\u00a0BCE, when primitive stone tools were used to scavenge the carcasses of animals killed by other predators, both for their meat and their marrow. In hunting, \"H. habilis\" was most likely not capable of competing with large predators and was more prey than hunter, although \"H. habilis\" likely did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small game and weakened larger prey such as cubs and older animals. The tools were classed as Oldowan.\nRoughly 1.8\u00a0million years ago, \"Homo ergaster\" first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From \"Homo ergaster\", \"Homo erectus\" (upright man) evolved 1.5\u00a0million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like \"H. habilis\". The brain later grew in size, and \"H. erectus\" eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the Acheulean. Potentially the first hominid to engage in hunting, \"H. erectus\" mastered the art of making fire. They were the first hominids to leave Africa, going on to colonise the entire Old World, and perhaps later on giving rise to \"Homo floresiensis\". Although some recent writers suggest that \"H. georgicus\", a \"H. habilis\" descendant, was the first and most primitive hominid to ever live outside Africa, many scientists consider \"H. georgicus\" to be an early and primitive member of the \"H. erectus\" species.\nThe fossil and genetic evidence shows \"Homo sapiens\" developed in East and Southern Africa by around 350,000 to 260,000 years ago and gradually migrated across the continent in waves. Between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, their expansion out of Africa launched the colonisation of the planet by modern humans. By 10,000\u00a0BCE, \"Homo sapiens\" had spread to all corners of the world. This dispersal of the human species is suggested by linguistic, cultural and genetic evidence.\nDuring the 11th millennium BP, pottery was independently invented in West Africa, with the earliest pottery there dating to about 9,400 BC from central Mali. It spread throughout the Sahel and southern Sahara.\nAfter the Sahara became a desert, it did not present a totally impenetrable barrier for travelers between north and south because of the application of animal husbandry towards carrying water, food, and supplies across the desert. Prior to the introduction of the camel, the use of oxen, mule, and horses for desert crossing was common, and trade routes followed chains of oases that were strung across the desert. The trans-saharan trade was in full motion by 500\u00a0BCE with Carthage being a major economic force for its establishment. It is thought that the camel was first brought to Egypt after the Persian Empire conquered Egypt in 525\u00a0BCE, although large herds did not become common enough in North Africa for camels to be the pack animal of choice for the trans-saharan trade.\nWest Africa.\nThe Bantu expansion is a major migration movement that originated in West Central Africa (possibly around Cameroon) around 2500\u00a0BCE, reaching East and Central Africa by 1000\u00a0BCE and Southern Africa by the early centuries\u00a0CE.\nThe Djenn\u00e9-Djenno city-state flourished from 250 BCE to 900 CE and was influential to the development of the Ghana Empire. The Nok culture of Nigeria (lasting from 1,500 BCE to 200 CE) is known from a type of terracotta figure. There were a number of medieval empires of the southern Sahara and the Sahel, based on trans-Saharan trade, including the Ghana Empire and the Mali Empire, Songhai Empire, the Kanem Empire and the subsequent Bornu Empire. They built stone structures like in Tichit, but mainly constructed in adobe. The Great Mosque of Djenne is most reflective of Sahelian architecture and is the largest adobe building in the world.\nIn the forest zone, several states and empires such as Bono State, Akwamu and others emerged. The Ashanti Empire arose in the 18th century in modern-day Ghana. The Kingdom of Nri, was established by the Igbo in the 11th century. Nri was famous for having a priest-king who wielded no military power. Nri was a rare African state which was a haven for freed slaves and outcasts who sought refuge in their territory. Other major states included the kingdoms of If\u1eb9 and Oyo in the western block of Nigeria which became prominent about 700\u2013900 and 1400 respectively, and center of Yoruba culture. The Yoruba built massive mud walls around their cities, the most famous being Sungbo's Eredo. Another prominent kingdom in southwestern Nigeria was the Kingdom of Benin, whose power lasted between the 15th and 19th century. Their dominance reached as far as the well-known city of Eko which was named Lagos by the Portuguese traders and other early European settlers. The Edo-speaking people of Benin are known for their famous bronze casting and rich coral, wealth, ancient science and technology and the Walls of Benin, one of the longest man-made structures on the world.\nIn the 18th century, the Oyo and the Aro Confederacy were responsible for most of the slaves exported from modern-day Nigeria, selling them to European slave traders. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the British expanded their influence into the Nigerian interior. In 1885, British claims to a West African sphere of influence received international recognition, and in the following year the Royal Niger Company was chartered under the leadership of Sir George Goldie. In 1900, the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate as part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. Nigeria was granted its independence in 1960 during the period of decolonization.\nCentral Africa.\nArcheological finds in Central Africa provide evidence of human settlement that may date back over 10,000 years. According to Zangato and Holl, there is evidence of iron-smelting in the Central African Republic and Cameroon that may date back to 3,000 to 2,500\u00a0BCE. Extensive walled sites and settlements have recently been found in Zilum, Chad. The area is located approximately southwest of Lake Chad, and has been radiocarbon dated to the first millennium\u00a0BCE.\nTrade and improved agricultural techniques supported more sophisticated societies, leading to the early civilisations of Sao, Kanem, Bornu, Shilluk, Baguirmi, and Wadai.\nFollowing the Bantu Migration into Central Africa, during the 14th century, the Luba Kingdom in southeast Congo came about under a king whose political authority derived from religious, spiritual legitimacy. The kingdom controlled agriculture and regional trade of salt and iron from the north and copper from the Zambian/Congo copper belt.\nRival kingship factions which split from the Luba Kingdom later moved among the Lunda people, marrying into its elite and laying the foundation of the Lunda Empire in the 16th century. The ruling dynasty centralised authority among the Lunda under the Mwata Yamyo or Mwaant Yaav. The Mwata Yamyo's legitimacy, like that of the Luba king, came from being viewed as a spiritual religious guardian. This imperial cult or system of divine kings was spread to most of central Africa by rivals in kingship migrating and forming new states. Many new states received legitimacy by claiming descent from the Lunda dynasties.\nThe Kingdom of Kongo existed from the Atlantic west to the Kwango river to the east. During the 15th century, the Bakongo farming community was united with its capital at M'banza-Kongo, under the king title, Manikongo. Other significant states and peoples included the Kuba Kingdom, producers of the famous raffia cloth, the Eastern Lunda, Bemba, Burundi, Rwanda, and the Kingdom of Ndongo.\nEast Africa.\nSudan.\nNubia, covered by present-day northern Sudan and southern Egypt, was referred to as \"Aethiopia\" (\"land of the burnt face\") by the Greeks. Nubia in her greatest phase is considered sub-Saharan Africa's oldest urban civilisation. Nubia was a major source of gold for the ancient world. Nubians built famous structures and numerous pyramids. Sudan, the site of ancient Nubia, has more pyramids than anywhere else in the world.\nHorn of Africa.\nThe Axumite Empire spanned the southern Sahara, south Arabia and the Sahel along the western shore of the Red Sea. Located in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, Aksum was deeply involved in the trade network between India and the Mediterranean. Growing from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period (c. 4th century\u00a0BCE), it rose to prominence by the 1st century\u00a0CE. The Aksumites constructed monolithic stelae to cover the graves of their kings, such as King Ezana's Stele. The later Zagwe dynasty, established in the 12th century, built churches out of solid rock. These rock-hewn structures include the Church of St. George at Lalibela.\nIn ancient Somalia, city-states flourished such as Opone, Mosyllon and Malao that competed with the Sabaeans, Parthians and Axumites for the wealthy Indo\u2013Greco\u2013Roman trade.\nIn the Middle Ages several powerful Somali empires dominated the region's trade, including the Ajuran Sultanate, which excelled in hydraulic engineering and fortress building, the Sultanate of Adal, whose General Ahmed Gurey was the first African commander in history to use cannon warfare on the continent during Adal's conquest of the Ethiopian Empire, and the Geledi Sultanate, whose military dominance forced governors of the Omani empire north of the city of Lamu to pay tribute to the Somali Sultan Ahmed Yusuf.\nSoutheast Africa.\nAccording to the theory of recent African origin of modern humans, the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either Southeast Africa or the Horn of Africa. During the first millennium\u00a0CE, Nilotic and Bantu-speaking peoples moved into the region, and the latter now account for three-quarters of Kenya's population.\nOn the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with Muslim Arab and Persian traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African Swahili City States. The Swahili culture that emerged from these exchanges evinces many Arab and Islamic influences not seen in traditional Bantu culture, as do the many Afro-Arab members of the Bantu Swahili people. With its original speech community centered on the coastal parts of Tanzania (particularly Zanzibar) and Kenya\u00a0\u2013 a seaboard referred to as the Swahili Coast\u00a0\u2013 the Bantu Swahili language contains many Arabic loan-words as a consequence of these interactions.\nThe earliest Bantu inhabitants of the Southeast coast of Kenya and Tanzania encountered by these later Arab and Persian settlers have been variously identified with the trading settlements of Rhapta, Azania and Menouthias referenced in early Greek and Chinese writings from 50\u00a0CE to 500\u00a0CE. These early writings perhaps document the first wave of Bantu settlers to reach Southeast Africa during their migration.\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large medieval Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the Buganda, Bunyoro and Karagwe kingdoms of Uganda and Tanzania.\nDuring the early 1960s, the Southeast African nations achieved independence from colonial rule.\nSouthern Africa.\nSettlements of Bantu-speaking peoples, who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the Limpopo River by the 4th or 5th century displacing and absorbing the original Khoisan speakers. They slowly moved south, and the earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan inhabitants. They reached the Fish River in today's Eastern Cape Province. Monomotapa was a medieval kingdom (c. 1250\u20131629), which existed between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers of Southern Africa in the territory of modern-day Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Its old capital was located at Great Zimbabwe.\nIn 1487, Bartolomeu Dias became the first European to reach the southernmost tip of Africa. In 1652, a victualling station was established at the Cape of Good Hope by Jan van Riebeeck on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. For most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the slowly expanding settlement was a Dutch possession. In 1795, the Dutch colony was captured by the British during the French Revolutionary Wars. The British intended to use Cape Town as a major port on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterward the Dutch East India Company declared bankruptcy, and the Dutch (now under French control) and the British found themselves at war again. The British captured the Dutch possession yet again at the Battle of Blaauwberg, commanded by Sir David Blair. The Zulu Kingdom was a Southern African tribal state in what is now KwaZulu-Natal in southeastern South Africa. The small kingdom gained world fame during and after their defeat in the Anglo-Zulu War. During the 1950s and early 1960s, most sub-Saharan African nations achieved independence from colonial rule.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\nAccording to , the population of sub-Saharan Africa was 1.1 billion in 2019. The current growth rate is 2.3%. The UN predicts for the region a population between 2 and 2.5\u00a0billion by 2050 with a population density of 80 per km2 compared to 170 for Western Europe, 140 for Asia and 30 for the Americas.\nSub-Saharan African countries top the list of countries and territories by fertility rate with 40 of the highest 50, all with TFR greater than 4 in 2008. All are above the world average except South Africa and Seychelles. More than 40% of the population in sub-Saharan countries is younger than 15 years old, as well as in Sudan, with the exception of South Africa.\nGDP per Capita (PPP) \"(2016, 2017 (PPP, US$))\", Life (Exp.) \"(Life Expectancy 2006)\", Literacy (Male/Female 2006), Trans \"(Transparency 2009)\", HDI \"(Human Development Index)\", EODBR \"(Ease of Doing Business Rank June 2008 through May 2009)\", SAB (\"Starting a Business June 2008 through May 2009)\", PFI \"(Press Freedom Index 2009)\"\nLanguages and ethnic groups.\nSub-Saharan Africa contains over 1,500 languages.\nAfroasiatic.\nWith the exception of the extinct Sumerian (a language isolate) of Mesopotamia, Afroasiatic has the oldest documented history of any language family in the world. Egyptian was recorded as early as 3200\u00a0BCE. The Semitic branch was recorded as early as 2900\u00a0BCE in the form of the Akkadian language of Mesopotamia (Assyria and Babylonia) and circa 2500\u00a0BCE in the form of the Eblaite language of northeastern Syria.\nThe distribution of the Afroasiatic languages within Africa is principally concentrated in North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Languages belonging to the family's Berber branch are mainly spoken in the north, with its speech area extending into the Sahel (northern Mauritania, northern Mali, northern Niger). The Cushitic branch of Afroasiatic is centered in the Horn, and is also spoken in the Nile Valley and parts of the African Great Lakes region. Additionally, the Semitic branch of the family, in the form of Arabic, is widely spoken in the parts of Africa that are within the Arab world. South Semitic languages are also spoken in parts of the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea). The Chadic branch is distributed in Central and West Africa. Hausa, its most widely spoken language, serves as a lingua franca in West Africa (Niger, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Cameroon, and Chad).\nKhoisan.\nThe several families lumped under the term Khoi-San include languages indigenous to Southern Africa and Tanzania, though some, such as the Khoi languages, appear to have moved to their current locations not long before the Bantu expansion. In Southern Africa, their speakers are the Khoikhoi and San (Bushmen), in Southeast Africa, the Sandawe and Hadza.\nNiger\u2013Congo.\nThe Niger\u2013Congo family is the largest in the world in terms of the number of languages (1,436) it contains. The vast majority of languages of this family are tonal, such as Yoruba and Igbo. However, others such as Fulani, Wolof and Kiswahili are not. A major branch of the Niger\u2013Congo languages is Bantu, which covers a greater geographic area than the rest of the family. Bantu speakers represent the majority of inhabitants in southern, central and southeastern Africa, though San, Pygmy, and Nilotic groups, respectively, can also be found in those regions. Bantu-speakers can also be found in parts of Central Africa such as Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and southern Cameroon. Swahili, a Bantu language with many Arabic, Persian, and other Middle Eastern and South Asian loan words, developed as a \"lingua franca\" for trade between the different peoples in southeastern Africa. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as Bushmen (also \"San\", closely related to, but distinct from \"Hottentots\") have long been present. The San evince unique physical traits, and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of Central Africa.\nNilo-Saharan.\nThe Nilo-Saharan languages are concentrated in the upper parts of the Chari and Nile rivers of Central Africa and Southeast Africa. They are principally spoken by Nilotic peoples and are also spoken in Sudan among the Fur, Masalit, Nubian, and Zaghawa peoples and in West and Central Africa among the Songhai, Zarma, and Kanuri. The Old Nubian language is also a member of this family.\nMajor languages of Africa by region, family and number of primary language speakers in millions:\nMajor cities.\nSub-Saharan Africa has several large cities. Lagos is a city in the Nigerian state of Lagos. The city, with its adjoining conurbation, is the most populous in Nigeria, and the second-most populous in Africa after Cairo, Egypt. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and also one of the most populous urban agglomerations. Lagos is a major financial centre in Africa; this megacity has the highest GDP, and also houses Apapa, one of the largest and busiest ports on the continent.\nDar es Salaam is the former capital of, as well as the most populous city in, Tanzania; it is a regionally important economic centre. It is located on the Swahili coast.\nJohannesburg is the largest city in South Africa. It is the provincial capital and largest city in Gauteng, which is the wealthiest province in South Africa. While Johannesburg is not one of South Africa's three capital cities, it is the seat of the Constitutional Court. The city is located in the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills, and is the centre of a large-scale gold and diamond trade.\nNairobi is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase \"Enkare Nyrobi\", which translates to \"cool water\", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.\nOther major cities in sub-Saharan Africa include Abidjan, Cape Town, Kinshasa, Luanda, Mogadishu and Addis Ababa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEconomy.\nIn the mid-2010s, private capital flew to sub-Saharan Africa\u00a0\u2013 primarily from members of BRICS, private-sector investment portfolios, and remittances\u00a0\u2013 began to exceed official development assistance.\nAs of 2011, Africa is one of the fastest developing regions in the world. Six of the world's ten fastest-growing economies over the previous decade were situated below the Sahara, with the remaining four in East and Central Asia. According to the World Bank, the economic growth rate in the region had risen to 4.7% in 2013. This continued rise was attributed to increasing investment in infrastructure and resources as well as steady expenditure per household.\nIn 2019, 424 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were reportedly living in severe poverty. In 2022, 460 million people\u2014an increase of 36 million in only three years\u2014were anticipated to be living in extreme poverty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sub-Saharan Africa's government debt rose from 28% of gross domestic product in 2012 to 50% of gross domestic product in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic caused it to rise to 57% of gross domestic product in 2021.\nSub-Saharan Africa was severely harmed when government revenue declined from 22% of GDP in 2011 to 17% in 2021. 15 African nations were (or are) at significant risk of debt, and 7 were (2021) in financial crisis according to the IMF. \nThe region went on to receive IMF Special Drawing Rights of $23 billion in 2021 to assist critical public spending.\nEnergy and power.\nAs of 2009[ [update]], 50% of Africa was rural with no access to electricity. In 2021, Africa generated 889 TWh of electricity, amounting to 3.13% of the global market share. Many countries were (as of 2009) affected by power shortages.\nThe percentage of residences with access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in the world. In some remote regions, fewer than one in every 20 households has electricity.\nBecause of rising prices in commodities such as coal and oil, thermal sources of energy are proving to be too expensive for power generation. Sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to generate 1,750 TWh of energy, of which only 7% has been explored. The failure to exploit its full energy potential is largely due to significant underinvestment, as at least four times as much (approximately $23\u00a0billion a year) and what is currently spent is invested in operating high cost power systems and not on expanding the infrastructure.\nAfrican governments are taking advantage of the readily available water resources to broaden their energy mix. Hydro Turbine Markets in sub-Saharan Africa generated revenues of $120.0\u00a0million in 2007 and was estimated to reach $425.0\u00a0million. \nAsian countries, notably China, India, and Japan, are playing an active role in power projects across the African continent. The majority of these power projects are hydro-based because of China's vast experience in the construction of hydro-power projects and part of the Energy &amp; Power Growth Partnership Services programme.\nWith electrification numbers, sub-Saharan Africa with access to the Sahara and being in the tropical zones has massive potential for solar photovoltaic electrical potential. Six hundred million people could be served with electricity based on its photovoltaic potential. \nIn 2003, China promised to train 10,000 technicians from Africa and other developing countries in the use of solar energy technologies over the next five years. Training African technicians to use solar power is part of the China-Africa science and technology cooperation agreement signed by Chinese science minister Xu Guanhua and African counterparts during premier Wen Jiabao's visit to Ethiopia in December 2003.\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is developing an integrated, continent-wide energy strategy. This has been funded by, amongst others, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund. These projects must be sustainable, involve a cross-border dimension and/or have a regional impact, involve public and private capital, contribute to poverty alleviation and economic development, and involve at least one country in sub-Saharan Africa.\nRenewable Energy Performance Platform was established by the European Investment Bank and the United Nations Environment Programme with a five-year goal of improving energy access for at least two million people in sub-Saharan Africa. It has so far invested around $45 million to renewable energy projects in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Solar power and hydropower are among the energy methods used in the projects.\nMedia.\nIn 2007, Radio was the major source of information in sub-Saharan Africa. Average coverage stands at more than a third of the population. Countries such as Gabon, Seychelles, and South Africa boast almost 100% penetration. Only five countries\u2014Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia\u2014still have a penetration of less than 10%. Broadband penetration outside of South Africa has been limited where it is exorbitantly expensive. Access to the internet via cell phones is on the rise.\nTelevision is the second major source of information. Because of power shortages, the spread of television viewing has been limited. Eight per cent have television, a total of 62\u00a0million. Those in the television industry view the region as an untapped green market. Digital television and pay for service are on the rise.\nOil and minerals.\nThe region is a major exporter to the world of gold, uranium, chromium, vanadium, antimony, coltan, bauxite, iron ore, copper, and manganese. South Africa, along with Gabon and Ghana, collectively supplies over 60% of global manganese, and is also a major exporter of chromium. A 2001 estimate is that 42% of the world's reserves of chromium may be found in South Africa. South Africa is the largest producer of platinum, with 80% of the total world's annual mine production and 88% of the world's platinum reserve. Sub-Saharan Africa produces 33% of the world's bauxite, with Guinea as the major supplier. Zambia is a major producer of copper. The Democratic Republic of Congo is a major source of coltan. Production from DR Congo is very small, but the country has 80% of the proven reserves in Africa, which are 80% of those worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa is a major producer of gold, producing up to 30% of global production. Major suppliers are South Africa, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Guinea, and Mali. South Africa had been first in the world in terms of gold production since 1905, but in 2007 it moved to second place, according to GFMS, the precious metals consultancy. Uranium is major commodity from the region. Significant suppliers are Niger, Namibia, and South Africa. Namibia was the number one supplier from sub-Saharan Africa in 2008. The region produces 49% of the world's diamonds.\nSub-Saharan Africa has been the focus of an intense race for oil by the West, China, India, and other emerging economies, even though it holds only 10% of proven oil reserves, less than the Middle East. This race has been referred to as the second Scramble for Africa. All reasons for this global scramble come from the reserves' economic benefits. Transportation cost is low and no pipelines have to be laid as in Central Asia. Almost all reserves are offshore, so political turmoil within the host country will not directly interfere with operations. Sub-Saharan oil is viscous, with a very low sulfur content. This quickens the refining process and effectively reduces costs. New sources of oil are being located in sub-Saharan Africa more frequently than anywhere else. Of all new sources of oil, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 are in sub-Saharan Africa.\nSub-Saharan Africa is a key player in the global minerals market, producing over 70%of the world's cobalt and hosting about 50%of its reserves in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The region also harbors significant lithium deposits in Zimbabwe, the DRC, and Mali.\nAgriculture.\nSub-Saharan Africa has more variety of grains than anywhere in the world. Between 13,000 and 11,000\u00a0BCE wild grains began to be collected as a source of food in the cataract region of the Nile, south of Egypt. The collecting of wild grains as source of food spread to Syria, parts of Turkey, and Iran by the eleventh millennium\u00a0BCE. By the tenth and ninth millennia southwest Asians domesticated their wild grains, wheat, and barley after the notion of collecting wild grains spread from the Nile.\nNumerous crops have been domesticated in the region and spread to other parts of the world. These crops included sorghum, castor beans, coffee, cotton, okra, black-eyed peas, watermelon, gourd, and pearl millet. Other domesticated crops included teff, enset, African rice, yams, kola nuts, oil palm, and raffia palm.\nDomesticated animals include the guinea fowl and the donkey.\nAgriculture represents 20% to 30% of GDP and 50% of exports. In some cases, 60% to 90% of the labor force are employed in agriculture. Most agricultural activity is subsistence farming. This has made agricultural activity vulnerable to climate change and global warming. As of right now Sub-Saharan Africa has degraded land covering one million square kilometres. Biotechnology has been advocated to create high yield, pest and environmentally resistant crops in the hands of small farmers. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a strong advocate and donor to this cause. Biotechnology and GM crops have met resistance both by natives and environmental groups.\nCash crops include cotton, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, and tobacco.\nThe OECD says Africa has the potential to become an agricultural superbloc if it can unlock the wealth of the savannahs by allowing farmers to use their land as collateral for credit. There is such international interest in sub-Saharan agriculture, that the World Bank increased its financing of African agricultural programs to $1.3\u00a0billion in the 2011 fiscal year. Recently, there has been a trend to purchase large tracts of land in sub-Sahara for agricultural use by developing countries.\nEarly in 2009, George Soros highlighted a new farmland buying frenzy caused by growing population, scarce water supplies and climate change. Chinese interests bought up large swathes of Senegal to supply it with sesame. Aggressive moves by China, South Korea, and Gulf states to buy vast tracts of agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa could soon be limited by a new global international protocol.\nLow productivity of subsistance farmers.\nCompared to South America and Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced persistently low crop yield productivity for more than 50 years. As mentioned above, one factor influencing low productivity might be low access to credit studies. Many studies have focused on factors such as access to credit, and time preferences as key explanations for low productivity of small farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, recent studies have explored an alternative mechanism: quality of agricultural inputs. Indeed, usage of high-quality inputs, such as seeds and fertiliser, would substantially increase productivity of subsistance farmers. However, there is a small take up rate of this product by farmers, despite acknowledging their benefits.\nStructure of the agricultural market.\nFirst, it is important to explain the structure of the agricultural input market in countries of the Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of seeds and fertilizers are traded informally, often of uncertain quality, either exchanged between farmers or reused from previous harvests, in the case of seeds. Only a small number of farmers purchase inputs from the formal market, which is generally considered to offer higher-quality products. We can illustrate this with the example of the Nigerian stem market. Indeed, only 1% of the stems sold in the Nigerian market are certified, while the remaining 99% are traded informally\u2014either as recycled stems from local varieties or as uncertified stems derived from previously improved varieties.\nUncertainty about quality of agricultural inputs.\nRecent studies explain that farmers mistrust the quality of fertilisers and seeds sold in the formal market. The study realized in Uganda infers quality across fertilizer and hybrid seeds varies significantly due to adulteration: sellers tend to mix the fertilizer with poor soil. However, one study realized in Tanzania finds no adulteration in agricultural inputs, but do find that visual appearance of input sold in the formal market is degraded. Whether one study or the other is correct, both papers highlight uncertainty about fertilizer's quality, thus generating mistrust among farmers and consequently generates a low take-up rate.\nAnother factor highlighting uncertainty about quality is the presence of relatively homogenous pricing among different quality of the same inputs. While in most markets price is a good indicator of quality. the higher the quality, the higher the price- , in this case, uniform pricing prevents farmers from using price as a signal of input quality. Consequently, the inability of farmers to infer the quality, either through physical appearance or price, creates asymmetric information in the market, leading an inefficient market.\nSome papers have tried to understand why sellers do not simply charge higher prices when they offer high-quality seeds and fertilizers, using a Bayesian learning model. It is challenging for a company to sell high-quality inputs at a premium price and build a reputation in the long term, meaning that farmers will trust the seller regarding the quality of its products. Indeed, as farmers are highly suspicious -due to fear of being scammed- their willingness to pay for high-quality products is very low. So even if the firm sells high-quality products, it will take too long for farmers to start trusting the firm, and for the seller to become profitable.\nPolicy recommendation.\nThe literature advises to actually improve farmers perception of true quality itself, and not to improve the quality of the products which already meet the standards. This can be done by providing more information about inputs quality, how they should look like, where they come from, making firms more reliable. That would allow more companies to enter the market and sell formally higher inputs, instead of farmers using their own seed or using seed of unknown quality bought in informal markets.\nInfrastructure.\nAccording to researchers at the Overseas Development Institute, the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such as areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa.\nInfrastructure investments contributed to Africa's growth, and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average 30\u201340% returns for telecommunications (ICT) investments, over 40% for electricity generation and 80% for roads.\nIn Africa, it is argued that in order to meet the MDGs, infrastructure investments would need to reach about 15% of GDP (around $93\u00a0billion a year). Currently, the source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by state spending, others by overseas development aid (ODA) and yet others by private investors. In sub-Saharan Africa, the state spends around $9.4\u00a0billion out of a total of $24.9\u00a0billion. In irrigation, SSA states represent almost all spending; in transport and energy a majority of investment is state spending; in ICT and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, aid, the private sector and non-OECD financiers between them exceed state spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased from $7\u00a0billion (2002) to $27\u00a0billion (2009). China, in particular, has emerged as an important investor.\nTransport.\nLess than 40% of rural Africans live within two kilometers of an all-season road, the lowest level of rural accessibility in the developing world. Spending on roads averages just below 2% of GDP with varying degree among countries. This compares with 1% of GDP that is typical in industrialised countries, and 2\u20133% of GDP found in fast-growing emerging economies. Although the level of expenditure is high relative to the size of Africa's economies, it remains small in absolute terms, with low-income countries spending an average of about US$7 per capita per year.\nEducation.\nForty per cent of African scientists live in OECD countries, predominantly in Europe, the United States and Canada. This has been described as an African brain drain. Despite this, sub-Saharan African universities tripled between 1991 and 2005, expanding at an annual rate of 8.7%, which is one of the highest regional growth rates in the world. In the last 10 to 15 years interest in pursuing university-level degrees abroad has increased.\nAccording to the CIA, low global literacy rates are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia and South Asia. However, literacy rates in sub-Saharan Africa vary significantly between countries. The highest registered literacy rate in the region is in Zimbabwe (90.7%; 2003 est.), while the lowest literacy rate is in South Sudan (27%).\nResearch on human capital formation was able to determine, that the numeracy levels of sub-Saharan Africa and Africa, in general, were higher than numeracy levels in South Asia. In the 1940s more than 75% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa was numerate. The numeracy of the West African countries, Benin and Ghana, was even higher with more than 80% of the population being numerate. In contrast, numeracy in South Asia was only around 50%.\nHigher diversity in Sub-Saharan African countries has been found to lead to a poorer economy. Researchers have argued that this is because of ethnic favouritism in their politics. Sub-Saharan leaders are more likely to provide better resources to their coethnic groups when in power. A study found that, on average, children of the favoured ethnic group are 2.25% more likely to attend primary school and 1.80% more likely to complete primary school. A 1% increase in GDP is associated with a 1.5% increase in the ethnic favouritism effect on primary school attendance.\nSub-Saharan African countries spent an average of 0.3% of their GDP on science and technology in 2007. This represents an increase from US$1.8\u00a0billion in 2002 to US$2.8\u00a0billion in 2007, a 50% increase in spending.\nMajor progress in access to education.\nAt the World Conference held in Jomtien, Thailand in 1990, delegates from 155 countries and representatives of some 150 organisations gathered with the goal to promote universal primary education and the radical reduction of illiteracy before the end of the decade. The World Education Forum, held ten years later in Dakar, Senegal, provided the opportunity to reiterate and reinforce these goals. This initiative contributed to having education made a priority of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000, with the aim of achieving universal schooling (MDG2) and eliminating gender disparities, especially in primary and secondary education (MDG3). Since the World Education Forum in Dakar, considerable efforts have been made to respond to these demographic challenges in terms of education. The amount of funds raised has been decisive. Between 1999 and 2010, public spending on education as a percentage of gross national product (GNP) increased by 5% per year in sub-Saharan Africa, with major variations between countries, with percentages varying from 1.8% in Cameroon to over 6% in Burundi. As of 2015, governments in sub-Saharan Africa spend on average 18% of their total budget on education, against 15% in the rest of the world.\nIn the years immediately after the Dakar Forum, the efforts made by the African States towards achieving EFA produced multiple results in sub-Saharan Africa. The greatest advance was in access to primary education, which governments had made their absolute priority. The number of children in a primary school in sub-Saharan Africa thus rose from 82\u00a0million in 1999 to 136.4\u00a0million in 2011. In Niger, for example, the number of children entering school increased by more than three-and-a-half times between 1999 and 2011. In Ethiopia, over the same period, over 8.5\u00a0million more children were admitted to primary school. The net rate of first-year access in sub-Saharan Africa has thus risen by 19 points in 12 years, from 58% in 1999 to 77% in 2011. Despite the considerable efforts, the latest available data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics estimates that, for 2012, there were still 57.8\u00a0million children who were not in school. Of these, 29.6\u00a0million were in sub-Saharan Africa alone, a figure which has not changed for several years. Many sub-Saharan countries have notably included the first year of secondary school in basic education. In Rwanda, the first year of secondary school was attached to primary education in 2009, which significantly increased the number of pupils enrolled at this level of education. In 2012, the primary completion rate (PCR) \u2013 which measures the proportion of children reaching the final year of primary school \u2013 was 70%, meaning that more than three out of ten children entering primary school do not reach the final primary year.\nLiteracy rates have gone up in sub-Saharan Africa, and internet access has improved considerably. At least 39 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have some large-scale school feeding programs, which can improve access to education. In aggregate, 16% of school-age children (and 25% of primary school-age children) in the region benefit from school meal programs, and about 82% of the funding for these programs is provided by governments. Nonetheless, a lot must yet happen for this region to catch up. The statistics show that the literacy rate for sub-Saharan Africa was 65% in 2017. In other words, one-third of the people aged 15 and above were unable to read and write. The comparative figure for 1984 was an illiteracy rate of 49%. In 2017, only about 22% of Africans were internet users at all, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).\nHealth.\nHealth challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa include HIV/AIDS in Africa, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, tuberculosis, onchocerciasis, maternal mortality and infant mortality.\nIn 1987, the Bamako Initiative conference organized by the World Health Organization was held in Bamako, the capital of Mali, and helped reshape the health policy of sub-Saharan Africa. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.\nIn 2011, sub-Saharan Africa was home to 69% of all people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. In response, a number of initiatives have been launched to educate the public on HIV/AIDS. Among these are combination prevention programmes, considered to be the most effective initiative, the abstinence, be faithful, use a condom campaign, and the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation's outreach programs. According to a 2013 special report issued by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the number of HIV positive people in Africa receiving anti-retro viral treatment in 2012 was over seven times the number receiving treatment in 2005, with an almost 1\u00a0million added in the last year alone. The number of AIDS-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 33 per cent less than the number in 2005. The number of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 25 per cent less than the number in 2001.\nLife expectancy at birth in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 40 years in 1960 to 61 years in 2017.\nMalaria is an endemic illness in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of malaria cases and deaths worldwide occur. Routine immunisation has been introduced in order to prevent measles. Onchocerciasis (\"river blindness\"), a common cause of blindness, is also endemic to parts of the region. More than 99% of people affected by the illness worldwide live in 31 countries therein. In response, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) was launched in 1995 with the aim of controlling the disease. Maternal mortality is another challenge, with more than half of maternal deaths in the world occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there has generally been progress here as well, as a number of countries in the region have halved their levels of maternal mortality since 1990. Additionally, the African Union in July 2003 ratified the Maputo Protocol, which pledges to prohibit female genital mutilation (FGM). Somalia, Guinea, Djibouti, Sierra Leone and Mali have the highest prevalence of FGM in the world. Infibulation, the most extreme form of FGM, is concentrated primarily in Northeast Africa.\nNational health systems vary between countries. In Ghana, most health care is provided by the government and largely administered by the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Services. The healthcare system has five levels of providers: health posts which are first-level primary care for rural areas, health centers and clinics, district hospitals, regional hospitals, and tertiary hospitals. These programs are funded by the government of Ghana, financial credits, Internally Generated Fund (IGF), and Donors-pooled Health Fund.\nEbola virus disease, which was first identified in 1976, occasionally occurs in outbreaks in tropical regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. The 2013\u20132016 Western African Ebola virus epidemic originated in Guinea, later spreading to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe principal religions of Sub-Saharan Africa are Christianity, Islam and traditional African religions, with Christianity being the largest religion, and religious syncretism being also common. African countries below the Sahara are largely Christian, while those above the Sahara, in North Africa, are predominantly Islamic. There are also Muslim majorities in parts of the Horn of Africa (Djibouti and Somalia) and in the Sahel and Sudan regions (the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Burkina Faso and Chad), as well as significant Muslim communities in Ethiopia and Eritrea, and on the Swahili Coast (Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya). West Africa is the only subregion of sub-Saharan Africa which has a Muslim majority population, and Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa.\nMauritius is the only country in Africa to have a Hindu majority. In 2012, sub-Saharan Africa constituted in absolute terms the world's third largest Christian population, after Europe and Latin America respectively. In 2012, sub-Saharan Africa also constituted in absolute terms the world's third largest Muslim population, after Asia and the Middle East and North Africa respectively.\nTraditional African religions are also commonly practiced across sub-Saharan Africa, with these religions being especially common in South Sudan, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, and Cameroon. Traditional African religions can be broken down into linguistic cultural groups, with common themes. Among Niger\u2013Congo-speakers is a belief in a creator god or higher deity, along with ancestor spirits, territorial spirits, evil caused by human ill will and neglecting ancestor spirits, and priests of territorial spirits. New world religions such as Santer\u00eda, Vodun, and Candombl\u00e9, would be derived from this world. Among Nilo-Saharan speakers is the belief in Divinity; evil is caused by divine judgement and retribution; prophets as middlemen between Divinity and man. Among Afro-Asiatic-speakers is henotheism, the belief in one's own gods but accepting the existence of other gods; evil here is caused by malevolent spirits. The Semitic Abrahamic religion of Judaism is comparable to the latter world view. San religion is non-theistic but a belief in a Spirit or Power of existence which can be tapped in a trance-dance; trance-healers.\nGenerally, traditional African religions are united by an ancient complex animism and ancestor worship.\nTraditional religions in sub-Saharan Africa often display complex ontology, cosmology and metaphysics. Mythologies, for example, demonstrated the difficulty fathers of creation had in bringing about order from chaos. Order is what is right and natural and any deviation is chaos. Cosmology and ontology is also neither simple or linear. It defines duality, the material and immaterial, male and female, heaven and earth. Common principles of being and becoming are widespread: Among the Dogon, the principle of \"Amma\" (being) and \"Nummo\" (becoming), and among the Bambara, \"Pemba\" (being) and \"Faro\" (becoming).\nSub-Saharan traditional divination systems display great sophistication. For example, the bamana sand divination uses well established symbolic codes that can be reproduced using four bits or marks. A binary system of one or two marks are combined. Random outcomes are generated using a fractal recursive process. It is analogous to a digital circuit but can be reproduced on any surface with one or two marks. This system is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa.\nCulture.\nSub-Saharan Africa is diverse, with many communities, villages, and cities, each with their own beliefs and traditions. Traditional African Societies are communal, they believe that the needs of the many far outweigh an individual's needs and achievements. Essentially, an individual's keep must be shared with other extended family members. Extended families are made up of various individuals and families who have shared responsibilities within the community. This extended family is one of the core aspects of every African community. \"An African will refer to an older person as auntie or uncle. Siblings of parents will be called father or mother rather than uncle and aunt. Cousins will be called brother or sister\". This system can be very difficult for outsiders to understand; however, it is no less important. \"Also reflecting their communal ethic, Africans are reluctant to stand out in a crowd or to appear different from their neighbours or colleagues, a result of social pressure to avoid offense to group standards and traditions.\" Women also have a very important role in African culture because they take care of the house and children. Traditionally, in many cultures \"men do the heavy work of clearing and ploughing the land, women sow the seeds, tend the fields, harvest the crops, haul the water, and bear the major burden for growing the family's food\". Despite their work in the fields, women are expected to be subservient to men in some African cultures. \"When young women migrate to cities, this imbalance between the sexes, as well as financial need, often causes young women of lower economic status, who lack education and job training, to have sexual relationships with older men who are established in their work or profession and can afford to support a girlfriend or two\".\nArt.\nThe oldest abstract art in the world is a shell necklace, dated to 82,000 years, in the Cave of Pigeons in Taforalt, eastern Morocco. The second-oldest abstract form of art, and the oldest rock art, is found in the Blombos Cave at the Cape in South Africa, dated 77,000 years. Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the oldest and most varied style of rock art in the world.\nAlthough sub-Saharan African art is very diverse, there are some common themes. One is the use of the human figure. Second, there is a preference for sculpture. Sub-Saharan African art is meant to be experienced in three dimensions, not two. A house is meant to be experienced from all angles. Third, art is meant to be performed. Sub-Saharan Africans have a specific name for masks. The name incorporates the sculpture, the dance, and the spirit that incorporates the mask. The name denotes all three elements. Fourth, art that serves a practical function. The artist and craftsman are not separate. A sculpture shaped like a hand can be used as a stool. Fifth, the use of fractals or non-linear scaling. The shape of the whole is the shape of the parts at different scales. Before the discovery of fractal geometry, Leopold Sedar Senghor, Senegal's first president, referred to this as \"dynamic symmetry\". William Fagg, a British art historian, has compared it to the logarithmic mapping of natural growth by biologist D'Arcy Thompson. Lastly, sub-Saharan African art is visually abstract, instead of naturalistic. Sub-Saharan African art represents spiritual notions, social norms, ideas, values, etc. An artist might exaggerate the head of a sculpture in relation to the body not because he does not know anatomy but because he wants to illustrate that the head is the seat of knowledge and wisdom.\nThe visual abstraction of African art was very influential in the works of modernist artists like Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Jacques Lipchitz.\nMusic.\nTraditional sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region's various populations. The common perception of sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered around the drums. This is partially true. A large part of sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of Niger\u2013Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages, is rhythmic and centered around the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspects of sub-Saharan music has been transferred to the new world by enslaved sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as samba, jazz, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, salsa, reggae and rap music.\nSome forms of sub-Saharan African music use strings, horns, and very little poly-rhythms. Music from the eastern Sahel and along the Nile, among the Nilo-Saharan, made extensive use of strings and horns in ancient times. Among the Afro-Asiatics of Northeast Africa, there is extensive use of string instruments and the pentatonic scale. Dancing involves swaying body movements and footwork. Among the San is extensive use of string instruments with emphasis on footwork.\nModern sub-Saharan African music has been influenced by music from the New World (Jazz, Salsa, Rhythm and Blues etc.) vice versa being influenced by enslaved sub-Saharan Africans. Popular styles are Mbalax in Senegal and Gambia, Highlife in Ghana, Zoblazo in Ivory Coast, Makossa in Cameroon, Soukous in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kizomba in Angola, and Mbaqanga in South Africa. New World styles like Salsa, R&amp;B/Rap, Reggae, and Zouk also have widespread popularity.\nCuisine.\nSub-Saharan African cuisine is very diverse. A lot of regional overlapping occurs, but there are dominant elements region by region.\nWest African cuisine can be described as starchy, flavorfully spicey. Dishes include fufu, kenkey, couscous, garri, foutou, and banku. Ingredients are of native starchy tubers, yams, cocoyams, and cassava. Grains include millet, sorghum, and rice, usually in the Sahel. Oils include palm oil and shea butter (Sahel). One finds recipes that mix fish and meat. Beverages are palm wine (sweet or sour) and millet beer. Roasting, baking, boiling, frying, mashing, and spicing are all cooking techniques.\nSoutheast African cuisine, especially those of the Swahili people, reflects its Islamic, geographical Indian Ocean cultural links. Dishes include ugali, sukuma wiki, and halva. Spices such as curry, saffron, cloves, cinnamon, pomegranate juice, cardamon, ghee, and sage are used, especially among Muslims. Meat includes cattle, sheep, and goats, but is rarely eaten since meat is viewed as a luxury.\nIn the Horn of Africa, pork and non-fish seafood are avoided by Christians and Muslims. Dairy products and all meats are avoided during lent by Ethiopians. Maize (corn) is a major staple. Cornmeal is used to make ugali, a popular dish with different names. Teff is used to make injera or canjeero (Somali) bread. Other important foods include enset, noog, lentils, rice, banana, leafy greens, chili peppers, coconut milk, and tomatoes. Beverages are coffee (domesticated in Ethiopia), chai tea, fermented beer from banana or millet. Cooking techniques include roasting and marinating.\nCentral African cuisine connects with all major regions of sub-Saharan Africa: Its cuisine reflects that. Ugali and fufu are eaten in the region. Central African cuisine is very starchy and spicy hot. Dominant crops include plantains, cassava, peanuts, chillis, and okra. Meats include beef, chicken, and sometimes exotic meats called bushmeat (antelope, warthog, crocodile). Widespread spicy hot fish cuisine is one of the differentiating aspects. Mushroom is sometimes used as a meat substitute.\nTraditional Southern African cuisine surrounds meat. Traditional society typically focused on raising sheep, goats, and especially cattle. Dishes include braai (barbecue meat), sadza, bogobe, pap (fermented cornmeal), milk products (buttermilk, yoghurt). Crops utilised are sorghum, maize (corn), pumpkin beans, leafy greens, and cabbage. Beverages include ting (fermented sorghum or maize), milk, chibuku (milky beer). Influences from the Indian and Malay communities can be seen in its use of curries, sambals, pickled fish, fish stews, chutney, and samosa. European influences can be seen in cuisines like biltong (dried beef strips), potjies (stews of maize, onions, tomatoes), French wines, and crueler or koeksister (sugar syrup cookie).\nClothing.\nLike most of the world, sub-Saharan Africans have adopted Western-style clothing. In some countries like Zambia, used Western clothing has flooded markets, causing great angst in the retail community. Sub-Saharan Africa boasts its own traditional http://. Cotton seems to be the dominant material.\nIn East Africa, one finds extensive use of cotton clothing. Shemma, shama, and kuta are types of Ethiopian clothing. Kanga are Swahili cloth that comes in rectangular shapes, made of pure cotton, and put together to make clothing. Kitenges are similar to kangas and kikoy, but are of a thicker cloth, and have an edging only on a long side. Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and South Sudan are some of the African countries where kitenge is worn. In Malawi, Namibia and Zambia, kitenge is known as Chitenge. One of the unique materials, which is not a fiber and is used to make clothing is barkcloth, an innovation of the Baganda people of Uganda. It came from the Mutuba tree (Ficus natalensis). In Madagascar a type of draped cloth called lamba is worn.\nIn West Africa, again cotton is the material of choice. In the Sahel and other parts of West Africa the boubou and kaftan style of clothing are featured. Kente cloth is created by the Akan people of Ghana and Ivory Coast, from silk of the various moth species in West Africa. Kente comes from the Akan twi word \"kenten\" which means basket. It is sometimes used to make dashiki and kufi. Adire is a type of Yoruba cloth that is starch resistant. Raffia cloth and barkcloth are also utilised in the region.\nIn Central Africa, the Kuba people developed raffia cloth from the raffia plant fibers. It was widely used in the region. Barkcloth was also extensively used.\nIn Southern Africa one finds numerous uses of animal hide and skins for clothing. The Ndau in central Mozambique and the Shona mix hide with barkcloth and cotton cloth. Cotton cloth is referred to as machira. Xhosa, Tswana, Sotho, and Swazi also made extensive use of hides. Hides come from cattle, sheep, goat, and elephant. Leopard skins were coveted and were a symbol of kingship in Zulu society. Skins were tanned to form leather, dyed, and embedded with beads.\nSports.\nFootball (soccer) is the most popular sport in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan men are its main patrons. Major competitions include the African Champions League, a competition for the best clubs on the continent and the Confederation Cup, a competition primarily for the national cup winner of each African country. The Africa Cup of Nations is a competition of 16 national teams from various African countries held every two years. South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a first for a sub-Saharan country. In 2010, Cameroon played in the World Cup for the sixth time, which is the current record for a sub-Saharan team. In 1996 Nigeria won the Olympic gold for football. In 2000 Cameroon maintained the continent's supremacy by winning the title too. Momentous achievements for sub-Saharan African football. Famous sub-Saharan football stars include Abedi Pele, Emmanuel Adebayor, George Weah, Michael Essien, Didier Drogba, Roger Milla, Nwankwo Kanu, Jay-Jay Okocha, Bruce Grobbelaar, Samuel Eto'o, Kolo Tour\u00e9, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The most talented sub-Saharan African football players find themselves courted and sought after by European leagues. There are currently more than 1000 Africans playing for European clubs. Sub-Saharan Africans have found themselves the target of racism by European fans. FIFA has been trying hard to crack down on racist outburst during games.\nRugby is popular in sub-Saharan Africa. The Confederation of African Rugby governs rugby games in the region. South Africa is a major force in the game and won the Rugby World Cup in 1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023. Africa is also allotted one guaranteed qualifying place in the Rugby World Cup.\nBoxing is a popular sport. Battling Siki is the first world champion to come out of sub-Saharan Africa. Countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa have produced numerous professional world champions such as Dick Tiger, Hogan Bassey, Gerrie Coetzee, Samuel Peter, Azumah Nelson and Jake Matlala.\nCricket has a following. The African Cricket Association is an international body which oversees cricket in African countries. South Africa and Zimbabwe have their own governing bodies. In 2003 the Cricket World Cup was held in South Africa, first time it was held in sub-Saharan Africa.\nOver the years, Ethiopia and Kenya have produced many notable long-distance athletes. Each country has federations that identify and cultivate top talent. Athletes from Ethiopia and Kenya hold, save for two exceptions, all the men's outdoor records for Olympic distance events from 800m to the marathon. Famous runners include Haile Gebrselassie, Kenenisa Bekele, Paul Tergat, and John Cheruiyot Korir.\nTourism.\nThe development of tourism in this region has been identified as having the ability to create jobs and improve the economy. South Africa, Namibia, Mauritius, Botswana, Ghana, Cape Verde, Tanzania and Kenya have been identified as having well developed tourism industries. Cape Town and the surrounding area is very popular with tourists.\nList of countries and regional organisation.\nSub-Saharan Africa is composed of 49 countries. Only six African countries are not geopolitically a part of sub-Saharan Africa: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco); they form the UN subregion of Northern Africa, which also makes up the largest bloc of the Arab World. Nevertheless, some international organisations include Sudan as part of North Africa. Although a long-standing member of the Arab League, Sudan has around 30% non-Arab populations in the west (Darfur, Masalit, Zaghawa), far north (Nubian) and south (Kordofan, Nuba), and a largely Arabised native Nubian population that represents the majority at 70% hence its inclusion in North Africa, but geographically and culturally Sudan is part of Sub Saharan Africa. Mauritania and Niger only include a band of the Sahel along their southern borders. All other African countries have at least significant portions of their territory within sub-Saharan Africa.\nSudan.\nDepending on classification Sudan is often not considered part of sub-Saharan Africa, as it is considered part of North Africa.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nSources.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a free content work.

It is one of several desert and xeric shrubland ecoregions that cover the northern portion of the African continent.\nSetting.\nThe Sahara Desert is the world's largest hot, non-polar desert and is located in North Africa. It extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Red Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Sahel savanna in the south. The vast desert encompasses several ecologically distinct regions. The Sahara Desert ecoregion covers an area of in the hot, hyper-arid centre of the Sahara, surrounded on the north, south, east, and west by desert ecoregions with higher rainfall and more vegetation.\nThe North Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion lies to the north and west, bordering the Mediterranean climate regions of Africa's Mediterranean and North Atlantic coasts. The North Saharan steppe and woodlands receives more regular winter rainfall than the Sahara Desert ecoregion. The South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion lies to the south, between the Sahara Desert ecoregion and the Sahel grasslands. The South Saharan steppe and woodlands receive most of their annual rainfall during the summer. The Red Sea coastal desert lies in the coastal strip between the Sahara Desert ecoregion and the Red Sea. The western portion of the region is known as El Djouf, on the border of Mauritania and Mali.\nSome mountain ranges rise up from the desert and receive more rainfall and cooler temperatures. These Saharan mountains are home to two distinct ecoregions; the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands in the Ahaggar, Tassili n'Ajjer, A\u00efr, and other ranges in the western and central Sahara Desert and the Tibesti\u2013Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands in the Tibesti and Jebel Uweinat of the eastern Sahara.\nThe surface of the desert ranges from large areas of sand dunes (erg), to stone plateaus (hamadas), gravel plains (reg), dry valleys (wadis), and salt flats. The only permanent river that crosses the ecoregion is the Nile River, which originates in east Africa and empties northward into the Mediterranean Sea. Some areas encompass vast underground aquifers, resulting in oases, while other regions severely lack water reserves.\nClimate.\nThe Sahara Desert features a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"BWh\"). The Sahara Desert is one of the driest and hottest regions of the world, with a mean temperature sometimes over and the average high temperatures in summer are over for months at a time, and can even soar to . In desert rocky mountains such as the Tibesti in Libya or the Hoggar in Algeria, average highs in summer are slightly moderated by the high elevation and are between at elevation. Daily variations may also be extreme: a swing from has been observed. Typical temperature swings are between .\nPrecipitation in the Sahara Desert is scarce, as the whole desert generally receives less than of rain per year except on the northernmost and southernmost edges as well as in the highest desert mountains. More than half of the desert area is hyper-arid and virtually rainless, with an average annual precipitation below and many consecutive years may pass without any rainfall. The south of the Sahara Desert, along the boundary with the hot semi-arid climate (\"BSh\") of the Sahel, receives most of its annual rainfall during the highest-sun months (summer) when the Intertropical Convergence Zone moves up from the south. Wind- and sandstorms occur in the early spring. Local inhabitants protect themselves from the heat, the sunshine, the dry air, the high diurnal temperature ranges, and the sometimes dusty or sandy winds by covering their heads, such as the cheche garment worn by Tuareg.\nHistory and conservation.\nThe Sahara was one of the first regions of Africa to be farmed. Some 5,000 years ago, the area was not so arid and the vegetation might have been closer to a savanna. Previous fauna may be recognised in stone carvings. However, desertification set in around 3000 BC, and the area became much like it is today.\nThe Sahara is largely undisturbed. The most degradation is found in areas where there is water, such as aquifer oases or along the desert margins where some rain usually falls most years. In these areas, animals such as addaxes, scimitar-horned oryxes, and bustards are over-hunted for their meat. Only one area of conservation is recorded in the Sahara: the Zellaf Nature Reserve in Libya.\nEcoregion delineation.\nIn 2001, WWF devised Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW) \"a biogeographic regionalization of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity\". The 2001 regionalization divided the deserts of the Sahara into several ecoregions. The Sahara desert ecoregion included the Sahara's hyper-arid center, and the more humid Saharan mountains and southern, northern, eastern, and western deserts were separate ecoregions.\nIn 2017, the authors of the 2001 system proposed a revised ecoregion system for the Sahara. Two new ecoregions, the West Sahara desert and East Sahara desert, were designated in the hyper-arid center. The transitional North Saharan steppe and woodlands and South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregions were extended towards the central Sahara, and the South Saharan steppe and woodlands was renamed South Sahara desert.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He wrote critical texts on organized religion, Christianity, morality, ethics, psychology, love, and the philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony, and parables. Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a \"single individual\", highlighting the importance of authenticity, personal choice and commitment, and the duty to love. Kierkegaard prioritized concrete human reality over abstract thinking.\nKierkegaard's theological work focuses on Socratic Christian ethics, the institution of the Church, the differences among purely objective proofs of Christianity, the infinite qualitative distinction between man and God, and the individual's subjective relationship to the God-Man Jesus Christ, which came through faith. Much of his work deals with Christian love. He was extremely critical of the doctrine and practice of Christianity as a state-controlled religion (Caesaropapism) like the Church of Denmark. His psychological work explored the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices. Unlike Jean-Paul Sartre and the atheistic existentialism paradigm, Kierkegaard focused on Christian existentialism.\nKierkegaard's early work was written using pseudonyms to present distinctive viewpoints interacting in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote \"Upbuilding Discourses\" under his own name and dedicated them to the \"single individual\" who might want to discover the meaning of his works. He wrote: \"Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject.\" While scientists learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation alone could reveal the inner workings of the world of the spirit.\nSome of Kierkegaard's key ideas include the concept of \"subjective and objective truths\", the knight of faith, the recollection and repetition dichotomy, angst, the infinite qualitative distinction, faith as a passion, and the three stages on life's way. Kierkegaard wrote in Danish and the reception of his work was initially limited to Scandinavia, but by the turn of the 20th century his writings were translated into French, German, and other major European languages. By the middle of the 20th century, his thought exerted a substantial influence on philosophy, theology, and Western culture in general.\nEarly years (1813\u20131836).\nKierkegaard was born to an affluent family in Copenhagen as the youngest of seven children. His mother, Ane S\u00f8rensdatter Lund Kierkegaard (1768\u20131834), had served as a maid in the household before marrying his father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard (1756\u20131838). She was an unassuming figure: quiet, and not formally educated. Her granddaughter, Henriette Lund, wrote that she \"wielded her scepter with delight, cosseted them [S\u00f8ren and his brother Peter], and protected them like a hen her chicks\". She also wielded influence on her children so that later Peter Christian Kierkegaard said that his brother preserved many of their mother's words in his writings. His father, on the other hand, was a well-to-do wool merchant from Jutland. He was a \"very stern man, to all appearances dry and prosaic, but under his 'rustic cloak' demeanor he concealed an active imagination which not even his great age could blunt\". He was also interested in philosophy and often hosted intellectuals at his home. He was devoted to the rationalist philosophy of Christian Wolff, and he eventually retired partly to pursue more of Wolff's writings. Kierkegaard, who followed his father's beliefs as a child, was heavily influenced by Michael's devotion to Wolffian rationalism. He also enjoyed the comedies of Ludvig Holberg, the writings of Johann Georg Hamann, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Edward Young, and Plato. The figure of Socrates, whom Kierkegaard encountered in Plato's dialogues, would prove to be a phenomenal influence on the philosopher's later interest in irony, as well as his frequent deployment of indirect communication.\nKierkegaard loved to walk along the crooked streets of 19th century Copenhagen, where carriages rarely went. In 1848, Kierkegaard wrote, \"I had real Christian satisfaction in the thought that, if there were no other, there was definitely one man in Copenhagen whom every poor person could freely accost and converse with on the street; that, if there were no other, there was one man who, whatever the society he most commonly frequented, did not shun contact with the poor, but greeted every maidservant he was acquainted with, every manservant, every common laborer.\" Our Lady's Church was at one end of the city, where Bishop Mynster preached the Gospel. At the other end was the Royal Theatre where Fru Heiberg performed.\nBased on a speculative interpretation of anecdotes in Kierkegaard's unpublished journals, especially a rough draft of a story called \"The Great Earthquake\", some early Kierkegaard scholars argued that Michael believed he had earned God's wrath and that none of his children would outlive him. He is said to have believed that his personal sins, perhaps indiscretions such as cursing the name of God in his youth or impregnating Ane out of wedlock, necessitated this punishment. Though five of his seven children died before he did, both S\u00f8ren and his brother Peter outlived him. Peter, who was seven years older, later became bishop in Aalborg. Julia Watkin thought Michael's early interest in the Moravian Church could have led him to a deep sense of the devastating effects of sin.\nFrom 1821 to 1830, Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue, \u00d8stre Borgerdyd Gymnasium when the school was situated in Klarebodeme, where Kierkegaard studied and learned Latin, Greek, and history, among other subjects. During his time there he was described as \"very conservative\"; someone who would \"honour the King, love the church and respect the police\". He frequently got into altercations with fellow students and was ambivalent towards his teachers. He went on to study theology at the University of Copenhagen. He had little interest in historical works, philosophy dissatisfied him, and he couldn't see \"dedicating himself to Speculation\". He said, \"What I really need to do is to get clear about \"what am I to do\", not what I must know.\" He wanted to \"lead a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge\". Kierkegaard didn't want to be a philosopher in the traditional or Hegelian sense and he didn't want to preach a Christianity that was an illusion. \"But he had learned from his father that one can do what one wills, and his father's life had not discredited this theory.\"\nOne of the first physical descriptions of Kierkegaard comes from an attendee, Hans Br\u00f8chner, at his brother Peter's wedding party in 1836: \"I found [his appearance] almost comical. He was then twenty-three years old; he had something quite irregular in his entire form and had a strange coiffure. His hair rose almost six inches above his forehead into a tousled crest that gave him a strange, bewildered look.\" Another comes from Kierkegaard's niece, Henriette Lund (1829\u20131909), who recounts that as a little boy S\u00f8ren was \"of a slight and delicate appearance. He went around in a coat the color of red cabbage, and his father usually called him 'the Fork,' because of his precocious tendency to make satirical remarks. Even though there was a serious, almost strict tone in the Kierkegaard home, I still have the impression that there was room for youthful liveliness, though perhaps of a more sober, homemade sort than is usual today. In the same way the house was also open, with an old-fashioned kind of hospitality.\" He was also described as \"quaintly attired, slight and small\".\nKierkegaard's mother \"was a nice little woman with an even and happy disposition,\" according to a grandchild's description. She was never mentioned in Kierkegaard's works. Ane died on 31 July 1834, age 66, possibly from typhus. His father died on 8 August 1838, age 82. On 11 August, Kierkegaard wrote: \"My father died on Wednesday (the 8th) at 2:00\u00a0a.m. I so deeply desired that he might have lived a few years more... Right now I feel there is only one person (E. Boesen) with whom I can really talk about him. He was a 'faithful friend.'\" Troels Frederik Lund, his nephew, was instrumental in providing biographers with much information regarding S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. Lund was a good friend of Georg Brandes and Julius Lange. Here is an anecdote about his father from Kierkegaard's journals.\nJournals.\nAccording to Samuel Hugo Bergmann, \"Kierkegaard's journals are one of the most important sources for an understanding of his philosophy\". Kierkegaard wrote over 7,000 pages in his journals on events, musings, thoughts about his works and everyday remarks. The entire collection of Danish journals (\"\") was edited and published in 13 volumes consisting of 25 separate bindings including indices. The first English edition of the journals was edited by Alexander Dru in 1938. The style is \"literary and poetic [in] manner\".\nKierkegaard wanted to have Regine, his fianc\u00e9e (see below), as his confidant but considered it an impossibility for that to happen so he left it to \"\"my reader\", that single individual\" to become his confidant. His question was whether or not one can have a spiritual confidant. He wrote the following in his \"Concluding Postscript\": \"With regard to the essential truth, a direct relation between spirit and spirit is unthinkable. If such a relation is assumed, it actually means that the party has ceased to be spirit.\"\nKierkegaard's journals were the source of many aphorisms credited to the philosopher. The following passage, from 1 August 1835, is perhaps his most oft-quoted aphorism and a key quote for existentialist studies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\nAlthough his journals clarify some aspects of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: \"Were I to die now the effect of my life would be exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance and have a great effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right.\"\nRegine Olsen and graduation (1837\u20131841).\nAn important aspect of Kierkegaard's life \u2013 generally considered to have had a major influence on his work \u2014 was his broken engagement to Regine Olsen (1822\u20131904).\nKierkegaard and Olsen met on 8 May 1837 and were instantly attracted to each other. In his journals, Kierkegaard wrote idealistically about his love for her. After passing his theological examinations in July 1840, Kierkegaard formally proposed to Olsen on 8 September. He soon felt disillusioned about his prospects. He broke off the engagement on 11 August 1841, though it is generally believed that the two were deeply in love. In his journals, Kierkegaard mentions his belief that his \"melancholy\" made him unsuitable for marriage, but his precise motive for ending the engagement remains unclear.\nIt was also during this period that Kierkegaard dedicated himself to authoring a dissertation. Upon submitting it in June 1841, a panel of faculty judged that his work demonstrated considerable intellect while criticizing its informal tone; however, Kierkegaard was granted permission to proceed with its defense. He defended \"On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates\" over seven and a half hours on 29 September 1841. As the title suggests, the thesis dealt with irony and Socrates; the influence of Kierkegaard's friend Poul Martin M\u00f8ller, who had died in 1838, is evident in the subject matter. Kierkegaard graduated from the University of Copenhagen on 20 October 1841 with a degree in philosophy. His inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler enabled him to fund his work and living expenses.\nAuthorship (1843\u20131846).\nKierkegaard published some of his works using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author. Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard's central writing on religion was \"Fear and Trembling\", and \"Either/Or\" is considered to be his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author's own. Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication. In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular. He has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer, though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to Christianity. He wrote his first book under the pseudonym \"Johannes Climacus\" (after John Climacus) between 1841 and 1842. \"De omnibus dubitandum est\" (Latin: \"Everything must be doubted\") was not published until after his death.\nKierkegaard's magnum opus \"Either/Or\" was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's \"Philosophy of Revelation\". \"Either/Or\" includes essays of literary and music criticism and a set of romantic-like aphorisms, as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith. Edited by \"Victor Eremita\", the book contained the papers of an unknown \"A\" and \"B\" which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary. Eremita had a hard time putting the papers of \"A\" in order because they were not straightforward. \"B\"'s papers were arranged in an orderly fashion. Both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals. Each approached the idea of first love from an aesthetic and an ethical point of view. The book is basically an argument about faith and marriage with a short discourse at the end telling them they should stop arguing. Eremita thinks \"B\", a judge, makes the most sense. Kierkegaard stressed the \"how\" of Christianity as well as the \"how\" of book reading in his works rather than the \"what\".\nThree months after the publication of \"Either/Or\", 16 May 1843, he published \"Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843\" and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard's own name and are available as \"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses\" today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the \"Edifying Discourses\"; however, in 1990, Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated the works again but called them the \"Upbuilding Discourses\". The word \"upbuilding\" was more in line with Kierkegaard's thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian deliberations about \"Works of Love\". An upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn't the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be \"upbuilding\", which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down to build up. Kierkegaard said: \"Although this little book (which is called 'discourses', not sermons, because its author does not have authority to \"preach\", 'upbuilding discourses', not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a \"teacher\") wishes to be only what it is, a superfluity, and desires only to remain in hiding\".\nOn 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses. \"Fear and Trembling\" was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. \"Repetition\" is about a Young Man (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries to see if the new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published \"Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843\" under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.\nKierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from God or not and concludes by saying, \"it does not depend, then, merely upon what one sees, but what one sees depends upon \"how\" one sees; all observation is not just a receiving, a discovering, but also a bringing forth, and insofar as it is that, how the observer himself is constituted is indeed decisive.\" God's love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is.\nDuring 1844, he published two, three, and four more upbuilding discourses just as he did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the \"single individual\" who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for \"that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call \"my\" reader\"; the single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.\nHe also wrote several more pseudonymous books in 1844: \"Philosophical Fragments\", \"Prefaces\" and \"The Concept of Anxiety\" and finished the year up with \"Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844\". He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.\nKierkegaard believed \"each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations\". In an earlier book he had said, \"to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning\", and in another, \"no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning\", \"no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.\" And, finally, in 1850 he wrote, \"those true Christians who in every generation live a life contemporaneous with that of Christ have nothing whatsoever to do with Christians of the preceding generation, but all the more with their contemporary, Christ. His life here on earth attends every generation, and every generation severally, as Sacred History...\" But in 1848, \"The whole generation and every individual in the generation is a participant in one's having faith.\"\nHe was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a \"third term\" that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard wrote in 1844, 'If a person can be assured of the grace of God without needing temporal evidence as a middleman or as the dispensation advantageous to him as interpreter, then it is indeed obvious to him that the grace of God is the most glorious of all.\" He was against mediation and settled instead on the choice to be content with the grace of God or not. It's the choice between the possibility of the \"temporal and the eternal\", \"mistrust and belief, and deception and truth\", \"subjective and objective\". These are the \"magnitudes\" of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison.\nThe Inwardness of Christianity.\nKierkegaard believed God comes to each individual mysteriously. He published \"Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions\" (first called \"Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life\", in David F. Swenson's 1941 translation) under his own name on 29 April, and \"Stages on Life's Way\" edited by Hilarius Bookbinder, 30 April 1845. The \"Stages\" is a sequel to \"Either/Or\" which Kierkegaard did not think had been adequately read by the public and in \"Stages\" he predicted \"that two-thirds of the book's readers will quit before they are halfway through, out of boredom they will throw the book away.\" He knew he was writing books but had no idea who was reading them. His sales were meager and he had no publicist or editor. He was writing in the dark, so to speak. Many of his readers have been and continue to be in the dark about his intentions. He explained himself in his \"Journal\": \"What I have understood as the task of the authorship has been done. It is one idea, this continuity from \"Either/Or\" to Anti-Climacus, the idea of religiousness in reflection. The task has occupied me totally, for it has occupied me religiously; I have understood the completion of this authorship as my duty, as a responsibility resting upon me.\" He advised his reader to read his books slowly and also to read them aloud since that might aid in understanding.\nHe used indirect communication in his writings by, for instance, referring to the religious person as the \"knight of hidden inwardness\" in which he's different from everyone else, even though he looks like everyone else, because everything is hidden within him.\nKierkegaard was aware of the hidden depths inside of each single individual. The hidden inwardness is inventive in deceiving or evading others. Much of it is afraid of being seen and entirely disclosed.\nKierkegaard imagined hidden inwardness several ways in 1848. He was writing about the subjective inward nature of God's encounter with the individual in many of his books, and his goal was to get the single individual away from all the speculation that was going on about God and Christ. Speculation creates quantities of ways to find God and his Goods but finding faith in Christ and putting the understanding to use stops all speculation, because then one begins to actually exist as a Christian, or in an ethical/religious way. He was against an individual waiting until certain of God's love and salvation before beginning to try to become a Christian. He defined this as a \"special type of religious conflict the Germans call \"Anfechtung\"\" (contesting or disputing).\nIn Kierkegaard's view, the Church should not try to prove Christianity or even defend it. It should help the single individual to make a leap of faith, the faith that God is love and has a task for that very same single individual. Kierkegaard identified the leap of faith as the good resolution. Kierkegaard discussed the knight of faith in \"Works of Love\", 1847 by using the story of Jesus healing the bleeding woman who showed the \" originality of faith\" by believing that if she touched Jesus' robe she would be healed. She kept that secret within herself.\nKierkegaard wrote his \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments\" in 1846 and here he tried to explain the intent of the first part of his authorship. He said, \"Christianity will not be content to be an evolution within the total category of human nature; an engagement such as that is too little to offer to a god. Neither does it even want to be the paradox for the believer, and then surreptitiously, little by little, provide him with understanding, because the martyrdom of faith (to crucify one's understanding) is not a martyrdom of the moment, but the martyrdom of continuance.\" The second part of his authorship was summed up in \"Practice in Christianity\":\nEarly Kierkegaardian scholars, such as Theodor W. Adorno and Thomas Henry Croxall, argue that the entire authorship should be treated as Kierkegaard's own personal and religious views. This view leads to confusions and contradictions which make Kierkegaard appear philosophically incoherent. Later scholars, such as the post-structuralists, interpreted Kierkegaard's work by attributing the pseudonymous texts to their respective authors. Postmodern Christians present a different interpretation of Kierkegaard's works. Kierkegaard used the category of \"The Individual\" to stop the endless \"Either/Or\".\nPseudonyms.\nKierkegaard's most important pseudonyms, in chronological order, were:\nAll of these writings analyze the concept of faith, on the supposition that if people are confused about faith, as Kierkegaard thought the inhabitants of Christendom were, they will not be in a position to develop the virtue. Faith is a matter of reflection in the sense that one cannot have the virtue unless one has the concept of virtue\u2014or at any rate the concepts that govern faith's understanding of self, world, and God.\nThe \"Corsair\" affair.\nOn 22 December 1845, Peder Ludvig M\u00f8ller, who studied at the University of Copenhagen at the same time as Kierkegaard, published an article indirectly criticizing \"Stages on Life's Way\". The article complimented Kierkegaard for his wit and intellect, but questioned whether he would ever be able to master his talent and write coherent, complete works. M\u00f8ller was also a contributor to and editor of \"The Corsair\", a Danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing. Kierkegaard published a sarcastic response, charging that M\u00f8ller's article was merely an attempt to impress Copenhagen's literary elite.\nKierkegaard wrote two small pieces in response to M\u00f8ller, \"The Activity of a Traveling Esthetician\" and \"Dialectical Result of a Literary Police Action\". The former focused on insulting M\u00f8ller's integrity while the latter was a directed assault on \"The Corsair\", in which Kierkegaard, after criticizing the journalistic quality and reputation of the paper, openly asked \"The Corsair\" to satirize him.\nKierkegaard's response earned him the ire of the paper and its second editor, also an intellectual of Kierkegaard's own age, Me\u00efr Aron Goldschmidt. Over the next few months, \"The Corsair\" took Kierkegaard up on his offer to \"be abused\", and unleashed a series of attacks making fun of Kierkegaard's appearance, voice and habits. For months, Kierkegaard perceived himself to be the victim of harassment on the streets of Denmark. In a journal entry dated 9 March 1846, Kierkegaard made a long, detailed explanation of his attack on M\u00f8ller and \"The Corsair\", and also explained that this attack made him rethink his strategy of indirect communication.\nThere had been much discussion in Denmark about the pseudonymous authors until the publication of \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments\", 27 February 1846, where he openly admitted to be the author of the books because people began wondering if he was, in fact, a Christian or not. Several Journal entries from that year shed some light on what Kierkegaard hoped to achieve. This book was published under an earlier pseudonym, Johannes Climacus. On 30 March 1846 he published \"\", under his own name. A critique of the novel \"Two Ages\" (in some translations \"Two Generations\") written by Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensv\u00e4rd, Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of modernity and its passionless attitude towards life. Kierkegaard writes that \"the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion ... The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual\". In this, Kierkegaard attacked the conformity and assimilation of individuals into \"the crowd\" which became the standard for truth, since it was the numerical. How can one love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame?\nAs part of his analysis of the \"crowd\", Kierkegaard accused newspapers of decay and decadence. Kierkegaard stated Christendom had \"lost its way\" by recognizing \"the crowd\", as the many who are moved by newspaper stories, as the court of last resort in relation to \"the truth\". Truth comes to a single individual, not all people at one and the same time. Just as truth comes to one individual at a time so does love. One doesn't love the crowd but does love their neighbor, who is a single individual. He says, \"never have I read in the Holy Scriptures this command: You shall love the crowd; even less: You shall, ethico-religiously, recognize in the crowd the court of last resort in relation to 'the truth.'\"\nAuthorship (1847\u20131855).\nKierkegaard began to publish under his own name again in 1847: the three-part \"Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits\". It included \"Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing\", \"What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air\", and \"The Gospel of Sufferings\". He asked, What does it mean to be a single individual who wants to do the good? What does it mean to be a human being? What does it mean to follow Christ? He now moves from \"upbuilding (Edifying) discourses\" to \"Christian discourses\", however, he still maintains that these are not \"sermons\". A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote devotional discourses and Godly discourses.\n\"Works of Love\" followed these discourses on 29 September 1847. Both books were authored under his own name. It was written under the themes \"Love covers a multitude of sins\" and \"Love builds up\". (1 Peter 4:8 and 1 Corinthians 8:1) Kierkegaard believed that \"all human speech, even divine speech of Holy Scripture, about the spiritual is essentially metaphorical speech\". \"To build up\" is a metaphorical expression. One can never be all human or all spirit, one must be both. Later, in the same book, Kierkegaard deals with the question of sin and forgiveness. He uses the same text he used earlier in \"Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843\", \"Love hides a multitude of sins\". (1 Peter 4:8). He asks if \"one who tells his neighbors faults hides or increases the multitude of sins\".\nIn 1848, he published \"Christian Discourses\" under his own name and \"The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress\" under the pseudonym Inter et Inter. \"Christian Discourses\" deals the same theme as \"The Concept of Anxiety\", angst. The text is the Gospel of Matthew 6 verses 24\u201334. This was the same passage he had used in his \"What We Learn From the Lilies in the Field and From the Birds of the Air\" of 1847.\nKierkegaard tried to explain his prolific use of pseudonyms again in \"The Point of View of My Work as an Author\", his autobiographical explanation for his writing style. The book was finished in 1848, but not published until after his death by his brother Peter Christian Kierkegaard. Walter Lowrie mentioned Kierkegaard's \"profound religious experience of Holy Week 1848\" as a turning point from \"indirect communication\" to \"direct communication\" regarding Christianity. However, Kierkegaard stated that he was a religious author throughout all of his writings and that his aim was to discuss \"the problem 'of becoming a Christian', with a direct polemic against the monstrous illusion we call Christendom\". He expressed the illusion this way in his 1848 \"Christian Address\", \"Thoughts Which Wound From Behind \u2013 for Edification\".\nHe wrote three discourses under his own name and one pseudonymous book in 1849. He wrote \"The Lily in the Field and the Bird of the Air. Three Devotional Discourses\", \"Three Discourses at the Communion on Fridays\" and \"Two Ethical\u2013Religious Essays\". The first thing any child finds in life is the external world of nature. This is where God placed his natural teachers. He's been writing about confession and now openly writes about Holy Communion which is generally preceded by confession. This he began with the confessions of the esthete and the ethicist in \"Either/Or\" and the highest good peace in the discourse of that same book. His goal has always been to help people become religious but specifically Christian religious. He summed his position up earlier in his book, \"The Point of View of My Work as an Author\", but this book was not published until 1859.\nThe second edition of \"Either/Or\" was published early in 1849. Later that year he published \"The Sickness unto Death\", under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus. He's against Johannes Climacus, who kept writing books about trying to understand Christianity. Here he says, \"Let others admire and praise the person who pretends to comprehend Christianity. I regard it as a plain ethical task\u2014perhaps requiring not a little self-denial in these speculative times, when all 'the others' are busy with comprehending\u2014to admit that one is neither able nor supposed to comprehend it.\" Sickness unto death was a familiar phrase in Kierkegaard's earlier writings. This sickness is despair and for Kierkegaard despair is a sin. Despair is the impossibility of possibility.\nIn \"Practice in Christianity\", 25 September 1850, his last pseudonymous work, he stated, \"In this book, originating in the year 1848, the requirement for being a Christian is forced up by the pseudonymous author to a supreme ideality.\" This work was called \"Training in Christianity\" when Walter Lowrie translated it in 1941.\nHe now pointedly referred to the acting single individual in his next three publications; \"For Self-Examination\", \"Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays\", and in 1852 \"Judge for Yourselves!\". \"Judge for Yourselves\"! was published posthumously in 1876.\nIn 1851 Kierkegaard wrote his \"Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays\" where he once more discussed sin, forgiveness, and authority using that same verse from 1 Peter 4:8 that he used twice in 1843 with his \"Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843\".\nKierkegaard began his 1843 book \"Either/Or\" with a question: \"Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Reason alone baptized?\" He didn't want to devote himself to Thought or Speculation like Hegel did. Faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self-control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and selfishness. These are the inner passions that Thought knows little about. Hegel begins the process of education with Thought but Kierkegaard thinks we could begin with passion, or a balance between the two, a balance between Goethe and Hegel. He was against endless reflection with no passion involved. But at the same time he did not want to draw more attention to the external display of passion but the internal (hidden) passion of the single individual. Kierkegaard clarified this intention in his \"Journals\".\nSchelling put Nature first and Hegel put Reason first but Kierkegaard put the human being first and the choice first in his writings. He makes an argument against Nature here and points out that most single individuals begin life as spectators of the visible world and work toward knowledge of the invisible world.\nNikolai Berdyaev makes a related argument against reason in his 1945 book \"The Divine and the Human\".\nAttack upon the Lutheran State Church.\nKierkegaard's final years were taken up with a sustained, outright attack on the Church of Denmark by means of newspaper articles published in \"The Fatherland\" (\"F\u00e6drelandet\") and a series of self-published pamphlets called \"The Moment\" (\"\u00d8jeblikket\"), also translated as \"The Instant\". These pamphlets are now included in Kierkegaard's \"Attack Upon Christendom\". \"The Moment\" was translated into German and other European languages in 1861 and again in 1896.\nKierkegaard first moved to action after Professor (soon Bishop) Hans Lassen Martensen gave a speech in church in which he called the recently deceased Bishop Jacob Peter Mynster a \"truth-witness, one of the authentic truth-witnesses\". Kierkegaard explained, in his first article, that Mynster's death permitted him\u2014at last\u2014to be frank about his opinions. He later wrote that all his former output had been \"preparations\" for this attack, postponed for years waiting for two preconditions: 1) both his father and bishop Mynster should be dead before the attack, and 2) he should himself have acquired a name as a famous theologic writer. Kierkegaard's father had been Mynster's close friend, but S\u00f8ren had long come to see that Mynster's conception of Christianity was mistaken, demanding too little of its adherents. Kierkegaard strongly objected to the portrayal of Mynster as a 'truth-witness'.\nKierkegaard described the hope the witness to the truth has in 1847 and in his Journals.\nKierkegaard's pamphlets and polemical books, including \"The Moment\", criticized several aspects of church formalities and politics. According to Kierkegaard, the idea of congregations keeps individuals as children since Christians are disinclined from taking the initiative to take responsibility for their own relation to God. He stressed that \"Christianity is the individual, here, the single individual\". Furthermore, since the Church was controlled by the State, Kierkegaard believed the State's bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee the welfare of its members. More members would mean more power for the clergymen: a corrupt ideal. This mission would seem at odds with Christianity's true doctrine, which, to Kierkegaard, is to stress the importance of the individual, not the whole. Thus, the state-church political structure is offensive and detrimental to individuals, since anyone can become \"Christian\" without knowing what it means to be Christian. It is also detrimental to the religion itself since it reduces Christianity to a mere fashionable tradition adhered to by unbelieving \"believers\", a \"herd mentality\" of the population, so to speak. Kierkegaard always stressed the importance of the conscience and the use of it.\nHowever, he showed marked elements of convergence with the medieval Catholicism. Nonetheless, Kierkegaard has been described as \"profoundly Lutheran\".\nDeath.\nBefore the tenth issue of his periodical \"The Moment\" could be published, Kierkegaard collapsed on the street. He stayed in the hospital for over a month and refused communion. At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. He told Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood, who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that his life had been one of immense suffering, which may have seemed like vanity to others, but he did not think it so.\nKierkegaard died in Frederiks Hospital after over a month, possibly from complications from a fall from a tree in his youth. It has been suggested by professor Kaare Weismann and philosopher Jens Staubrand that Kierkegaard died from Pott disease, a form of tuberculosis. He was interred in the Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd in the N\u00f8rrebro section of Copenhagen. At Kierkegaard's funeral, his nephew Henrik Lund caused a disturbance by protesting Kierkegaard's burial by the official church. Lund maintained that Kierkegaard would never have approved, had he been alive, as he had broken from and denounced the institution. Lund was later fined for his disruption of the funeral.\nReception.\n19th-century reception.\nFredrika Bremer wrote of Kierkegaard in 1850: \"While Martensen with his wealth of genius casts from his central position light upon every sphere of existence, upon all the phenomena of life, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard stands like another Simon Stylites, upon his solitary column, with his eye unchangeably fixed upon one point.\" In 1855, the Danish National Church published his obituary. Kierkegaard did have an impact there judging from the following quote from their article: \"The fatal fruits which Dr. Kierkegaard show to arise from the union of Church and State, have strengthened the scruples of many of the believing laity, who now feel that they can remain no longer in the Church, because thereby they are in communion with unbelievers, for there is no ecclesiastical discipline.\"\nChanges did occur in the administration of the Church and these changes were linked to Kierkegaard's writings. The Church noted that dissent was \"something foreign to the national mind\". On 5 April 1855, the Church enacted new policies: \"every member of a congregation is free to attend the ministry of any clergyman, and is not, as formerly, bound to the one whose parishioner he is\". In March 1857, compulsory infant baptism was abolished. Debates sprang up over the King's position as the head of the Church and over whether to adopt a constitution. Grundtvig objected to having any written rules. Immediately following this announcement the \"agitation occasioned by Kierkegaard\" was mentioned. Kierkegaard was accused of Weigelianism and Darbyism, but the article continued to say, \"One great truth has been made prominent, viz (namely): That there exists a worldly-minded clergy; that many things in the Church are rotten; that all need daily repentance; that one must never be contented with the existing state of either the Church or her pastors.\"\nHans Lassen Martensen addressed Kierkegaard's ideas extensively in \"Christian Ethics\", published in 1871. Martensen accused Kierkegaard and Alexandre Vinet of not giving society its due, saying both of them put the individual above society, and in so doing, above the Church. Another early critic was Magn\u00fas Eir\u00edksson, who criticized Martensen and wanted Kierkegaard as his ally in his fight against speculative theology.\nAugust Strindberg was deeply affected by reading Kierkegaard while a student at Uppsala University. Edwin Bj\u00f6rkman credited Kierkegaard, as well as Henry Thomas Buckle and Eduard von Hartmann, with shaping Strindberg's artistic form \"until he was strong enough to stand wholly on his own feet.\" The dramatist Henrik Ibsen is said to have been interested in Kierkegaard, as well as the Norwegian national writer and poet Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson.\nOtto Pfleiderer, in \"The Philosophy of Religion On the Basis of Its History\" (1887), claimed that Kierkegaard presented an anti-rational view of Christianity. An entry on Kierkegaard from an 1889 dictionary of religion presents an idea of how he was regarded at that time, stating: \"He was the most original thinker and theological philosopher the North ever produced. His fame has been steadily growing since his death, and he bids fair to become the leading religio-philosophical light of Germany. Not only his theological but also his aesthetic works have of late become the subject of universal study in Europe.\"\nAlthough not cited by him explicitly, Kierkegaard's view of faith would influence Norwegian theologian Gisle Christian Johnson (1822\u20131894). Johnson's system of dogmatic theology contained in his \"Grundrids af den Systematisk Theologi\" (published posthumously in 1897) differed starkly from those of his contemporaries in its integration of a threefold paradigm for viewing the essence of faith (\"Troens V\u00e6sen\") as Egotistic, Legalist, and Christian, found in the first part of the work (\"Pistiks\"), which itself was cast in the Law/Gospel mold of confessional Lutheranism. The final stage is marked in terms of discontinuity and radical change, and thus requires a leap to faith similar to that of Kierkegaard, what Johnson styles an irrefutable claim (\"uafviselig Fordring\") of higher existence correlate to True Being (\"sande V\u00e6sen\"). Likewise, the development of the infinite qualitative distinction from subjective faith by Gisle Johnson has distinct Kierkegaardian overtones. Johnson would have read Kierkegaard in the 1840s during his studies in continental Europe, developing his \"Pistiks\" in 1853 after his appointment to faculty at the University of Kristiana; as such, Svein Aage Christoffersen has designated Johnson to be the first Kierkegaardian in theology, fusing confessional, theological, and experiential categories of faith into a single dogmatic system. Johnson's pietistic emphases merged with Kierkegaard's own emphases on genuineness of faith to produce a revivalist movement that swept across Norway, known as the Johnsonian Revivals.\nEarly 20th-century reception.\nThe first academic to draw attention to Kierkegaard was fellow Dane Georg Brandes, who published in German as well as Danish. Brandes gave the first formal lectures on Kierkegaard in Copenhagen and helped bring him to the attention of the European intellectual community. Brandes published the first book on Kierkegaard's philosophy and life, (1879) which Adolf Hult said was a \"misconstruction\" of Kierkegaard's work and \"falls far short of the truth\". Brandes compared him to Hegel and Tycho Brahe in \"Reminiscences of my Childhood and Youth\" (1906). Brandes also discussed the \"Corsair Affair\" in the same book. Brandes opposed Kierkegaard's ideas in the 1911 edition of the \"Britannica\". Brandes compared Kierkegaard to Friedrich Nietzsche as well. He also mentioned Kierkegaard extensively in volume 2 of his 6 volume work, \"Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature\" (1872 in German and Danish, 1906 English).\nSwedish author Waldemar Rudin published \"S\u00f6ren Kierkegaards person och f\u00f6rfattarskap \u2013 ett f\u00f6rs\u00f6k\" in 1880. During the 1890s, Japanese philosophers began disseminating the works of Kierkegaard. Tetsuro Watsuji was one of the first philosophers outside of Scandinavia to write an introduction on his philosophy, in 1915.\n Harald H\u00f8ffding's work was greatly influenced by Kierkegaard, having himself stated that Kierkegaard's thought \"has pursued me from my youth, [and] determined the direction of my life.\" H\u00f8ffding was a friend of the American philosopher William James, and although James had not read Kierkegaard's works, as they were not yet translated into English, he attended the lectures about Kierkegaard by H\u00f8ffding and agreed with much of those lectures. James' favorite quote from Kierkegaard came from H\u00f8ffding: \"We live forwards but we understand backwards\".\nFriedrich von H\u00fcgel wrote about Kierkegaard in 1913, saying: \"Kierkegaard, the deep, melancholy, strenuous, utterly uncompromising Danish religionist, is a spiritual brother of the great Frenchman, Blaise Pascal, and of the striking English Tractarian, Hurrell Froude, who died young and still full of crudity, yet left an abiding mark upon all who knew him well.\"\nJohn George Robertson wrote an article called S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard in 1914: \"Notwithstanding the fact that during the last quarter of a century, we have devoted considerable attention to the literatures of the North, the thinker and man of letters whose name stands at the head of the present article is but little known to the English-speaking world ... Kierkegaard, the writer who holds the indispensable key to the intellectual life of Scandinavia, to whom Denmark in particular looks up as her most original man of genius in the nineteenth century, we have wholly overlooked.\" Robertson wrote previously in (1898) about Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. Theodor Haecker, based in Munich, published an essay in 1913 titled \"Kierkegaard and the Philosophy of Inwardness\", and David F. Swenson's treatment of Kierkegaard's life and works was published as an issue of \"Scandinavian Studies and Notes\" in 1920. Swenson stated: \"It would be interesting to speculate upon the reputation that Kierkegaard might have attained, and the extent of the influence he might have exerted, if he had written in one of the major European languages, instead of in the tongue of one of the smallest countries in the world.\"\nAustrian psychologist Wilhelm Stekel (1868\u20131940) referred to Kierkegaard as the \"fanatical follower of Don Juan, himself the philosopher of Don Juanism\" in his book \"Disguises of Love\". German psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers (1883\u20131969) stated he had been reading Kierkegaard since 1914 and compared Kierkegaard's writings with Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Mind\" and the writings of Nietzsche. Jaspers saw Kierkegaard as a champion of Christianity and Nietzsche as a champion for atheism. Later, in 1935, Jaspers emphasized Kierkegaard's (and Nietzsche's) continuing importance for modern philosophy.\nGerman and English translators of Kierkegaard's works.\nThe first translation into German of Kierkegaard's work appeared in 1861, but it was Albert B\u00e4rthold who undertook the first substantial program of translating Kierkegaard into German, beginning in 1873. Hermann Gottsche published Kierkegaard's Journals in 1905. It had taken academics 50 years to arrange his journals. Kierkegaard's main works were translated into German by Christoph Schrempf from 1909 onwards. Emmanuel Hirsch released a German edition of Kierkegaard's collected works from 1950 onwards. Both Harald Hoffding's and Schrempf's books about Kierkegaard were reviewed in 1892.\nLee M. Hollander, a scholar of Germanic philology at the University of Texas at Austin, published the first translation of Kierkegaard into English in 1923, though the publication received little attention. In the 1930s, further English translations by Douglas V. Steere, David F. Swenson, Walter Lowrie, and Alexander Dru appeared, the last two translators working under the efforts of Oxford University Press editor Charles Williams, one of the members of the Inklings. Thomas Henry Croxall, another early translator, Lowrie, and Dru all hoped that people would not just read about Kierkegaard but would actually read his works. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong translated his works more than once. The first volume of their first version of the \"Journals and Papers\" (Indiana, 1967\u20131978) won the 1968 National Book Award for Translation. They both dedicated their lives to the study of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and his works, which are maintained at the Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library. Alastair Hannay translated some of Kierkegaard's works for Penguin Classics, starting in 1985 with \"Fear and Trembling\".\nKierkegaard's influence on Karl Barth's early theology.\nKierkegaard's influence on Karl Barth's early theology is evident in \"The Epistle to the Romans\" 1918, 1921, 1933. Barth read at least three volumes of Kierkegaard's works: \"Practice in Christianity\", \"The Moment\", and an \"Anthology\" from his journals and diaries. Almost all key terms from Kierkegaard which had an important role in \"The Epistle to the Romans\" can be found in \"Practice in Christianity\". The concept of the indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment of \"Practice in Christianity\", in particular, confirmed and sharpened Barth's ideas on contemporary Christianity and the Christian life.\nWilhelm Pauck wrote in 1931 (\"Karl Barth Prophet of a New Christianity\") that Kierkegaard's use of the Latin phrase \"Finitum Non Capax Infiniti\" (the finite does not (or cannot) comprehend the infinite) summed up Barth's system. David G. Kingman and Adolph Keller each discussed Barth's relationship to Kierkegaard in their books, \"The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth's Teachings\" (1934) and \"Karl Barth and Christian Unity\" (1933). Keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others.\nStudents of Kierkegaard became a \"group of dissatisfied, excited radicals\" when under Barthianism. Eduard Geismar (1871\u20131939), who gave \"Lectures on Kierkegaard\" in March 1936, was not radical enough for them. Barthianism was opposed to the objective treatment of religious questions and to the sovereignty of man in the existential meeting with the transcendent God. But just as students of Hegel broke off into Right and Left, so did the German followers of Barth.\nBarth endorses the main theme from Kierkegaard but also reorganizes the scheme and transforms the details. He expands the theory of indirect communication to the field of Christian ethics; he applies the concept of unrecognizability to the Christian life. He coins the concept of the \"paradox of faith\" since the form of faith entails a contradictory encounter of God and human beings. He also portrayed the contemporaneity of the moment when in crisis a human being desperately perceives the contemporaneity of Christ. In regard to the concept of indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment, the Kierkegaard of the early Barth is a productive catalyst.\nLater-20th-century reception.\nWilliam Hubben compared Kierkegaard to Dostoevsky in his 1952 book \"Four Prophets of Our Destiny\", later titled \"Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Kafka\".\nJohn Daniel Wild noted as early as 1959 that Kierkegaard's works had been \"translated into almost every important living language including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and it is now fair to say that his ideas are almost as widely known and as influential in the world as those of his great opponent Hegel, still the most potent of world philosophers.\"\nIn 1964 Life Magazine traced the history of existentialism from Heraclitus (500BC) and Parmenides over the argument over The Unchanging One as the real and the state of flux as the real. From there to the Old Testament Psalms and then to Jesus and later from Jacob Boehme (1575\u20131624) to Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) and Blaise Pascal (1623\u20131662) and then on to Nietzsche and Paul Tillich. Dostoevsky and Camus are attempts to rewrite Descartes according to their own lights and Descartes is the forefather of Sartre through the fact that they both used a \"literary style\".\nKierkegaard's comparatively early and manifold philosophical and theological reception in Germany was one of the decisive factors of expanding his works' influence and readership throughout the world. Important for the first phase of his reception in Germany was the establishment of the journal \"Zwischen den Zeiten\" (\"Between the Ages\") in 1922 by a heterogeneous circle of Protestant theologians: Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, Rudolf Bultmann and Friedrich Gogarten. Their thought would soon be referred to as dialectical theology.\nAt roughly the same time, Kierkegaard was discovered by several proponents of the Jewish-Christian philosophy of dialogue in Germany, namely by Martin Buber, Ferdinand Ebner, and Franz Rosenzweig. In addition to the philosophy of dialogue, existential philosophy has its point of origin in Kierkegaard and his concept of individuality. Martin Heidegger sparsely refers to Kierkegaard in \"Being and Time\" (1927), obscuring how much he owes to him. Walter Kaufmann discussed Sartre, Jaspers, and Heidegger in relation to Kierkegaard, and Kierkegaard in relation to the crisis of religion in the 1960s. Later, Kierkegaard's \"Fear and Trembling\" (Series Two) and \"The Sickness Unto Death\" (Series Three) were included in the Penguin Great Ideas Series (Two and Three).\nPhilosophy and theology.\nKierkegaard has been called a philosopher, a theologian, the \"father of existentialism\", both atheistic and theistic variations, a literary critic, a social theorist, a humorist, a psychologist, and a poet. Two of his influential ideas are \"subjectivity\", and the notion popularly referred to as \"leap of faith\". However, the Danish equivalent to the English phrase \"leap of faith\" does not appear in the original Danish nor is the English phrase found in current English translations of Kierkegaard's works. Kierkegaard does mention the concepts of \"faith\" and \"leap\" together many times in his works.\nThe leap of faith is his conception of how an individual would believe in God or how a person would act in love. Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith is at the same time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. Someone who does not realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God. Kierkegaard writes, \"doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world\".\nKierkegaard also stresses the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments\" that \"subjectivity is truth\" and \"truth is subjectivity.\" This has to do with a distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in \"some sense\" believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: \"What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the \"de te narratur fabula\" [the tale is told about you] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life.\" In other words, Kierkegaard says: \"Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life\u2014or the learner who should put it to use?\" This is how it was summed up in 1940:\nKierkegaard primarily discusses subjectivity with regard to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that doubt is an element of faith and that it is impossible to gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed \"likely\" to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.\nPhilosophical criticism.\nKierkegaard's famous philosophical 20th-century critics include Theodor Adorno and Emmanuel Levinas. Non-religious philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger supported many aspects of Kierkegaard's philosophical views, but rejected some of his religious views. One critic wrote that Adorno's book \"Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic\" is \"the most irresponsible book ever written on Kierkegaard\" because Adorno takes Kierkegaard's pseudonyms literally and constructs a philosophy that makes him seem incoherent and unintelligible. Another reviewer says that \"Adorno is [far away] from the more credible translations and interpretations of the Collected Works of Kierkegaard we have today.\"\nLevinas' main attack on Kierkegaard focused on his ethical and religious stages, especially in \"Fear and Trembling\". Levinas criticises the leap of faith by saying this suspension of the ethical and leap into the religious is a type of violence. He states: \"Kierkegaardian violence begins when existence is forced to abandon the ethical stage in order to embark on the religious stage, the domain of belief. But belief no longer sought external justification. Even internally, it combined communication and isolation, and hence violence and passion. That is the origin of the relegation of ethical phenomena to secondary status and the contempt of the ethical foundation of being which has led, through Nietzsche, to the amoralism of recent philosophies.\"\nLevinas pointed to the Judeo-Christian belief that it was God who first commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, he would not have listened to the angel's command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, \"transcending ethics\" seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable. One interesting consequence of Levinas' critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent. However, one of Kierkegaard's central points in \"Fear and Trembling\" was that the religious sphere \"entails\" the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always in one way or another ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn't tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in \"Stages on Life's Way\".\nSartre objected to the existence of God: If existence precedes essence, it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. In \"Being and Nothingness\", Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a \"pour-soi\" (a being-for-itself; a consciousness) who is also an \"en-soi\" (a being-in-itself; a thing) which is a contradiction in terms. Critics of Sartre rebutted this objection by stating that it rests on a false dichotomy and a misunderstanding of the traditional Christian view of God. Kierkegaard has Judge Vilhelm express the Christian hope this way in \"Either/Or\":\nSartre agreed with Kierkegaard's analysis of Abraham undergoing anxiety (Sartre calls it anguish), but claimed that God told Abraham to do it. In his lecture, \"Existentialism is a Humanism\", Sartre wondered whether Abraham ought to have doubted whether God actually spoke to him. In Kierkegaard's view, Abraham's certainty had its origin in that \"inner voice\" which cannot be demonstrated or shown to another (\"The problem comes as soon as Abraham wants to be understood\"). To Kierkegaard, every external \"proof\" or justification is merely on the outside and external to the subject. Kierkegaard's proof for the immortality of the soul, for example, is rooted in the extent to which one wishes to live forever.\nFaith was something that Kierkegaard often wrestled with throughout his writing career; under both his real name and behind pseudonyms, he explored many different aspects of faith. These various aspects include faith as a spiritual goal, the historical orientation of faith (particularly toward Jesus Christ), faith being a gift from God, faith as dependency on a historical object, faith as a passion, and faith as a resolution to personal despair. Even so, it has been argued that Kierkegaard never offers a full, explicit and systematic account of what faith is. \"Either/Or\" was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's \"Philosophy of Revelation\". According to the \"Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Religion\", Either/Or (vol. 1) consists of essays of literary and music criticism, a set of romantic-like-aphorisms, a whimsical essay on how to avoid boredom, a panegyric on the unhappiest possible human being, a diary recounting a supposed seduction, and (vol. II) two enormous didactic and hortatory ethical letters and a sermon. This opinion is a reminder of the type of controversy Kierkegaard tried to encourage in many of his writings both for readers in his own generation and for subsequent generations as well.\nPolitical views.\nThroughout retrospective analyses Kierkegaard has been viewed as an apolitical philosopher. Despite this, Kierkegaard did publish works of a political nature; this includes his first published essay, criticizing the movement for \"women's liberation\". Although Kierkegaard's earlier works might include some misogynist statements, a negative view of women is not found in his later works. In these later works, he expressed that men and women are equal before God, showed great respect for certain women, and believed that women are also capable of being faithful.\nHe attacked Hegelianism via elaborate parody throughout his works from \"Either/Or\" to \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\". Despite his objections to Hegelianism, he expressed an admiration for Hegel personally and would even regard his system favourably if it was proposed as a thought experiment.\nKierkegaard leaned towards conservatism, being a personal friend of Danish king Christian VIII, whom he viewed as the moral superior of every Danish man, woman, and child. He argued against democracy, calling it \"the most tyrannical form of government,\" arguing in favour of monarchy saying \"Is it tyranny when one person wants to rule leaving the rest of us others out? No, but it is tyranny when all want to rule.\" Kierkegaard held strong contempt for the media, describing it as \"the most wretched, the most contemptible of all tyrannies\". He was critical of the Danish public at the time, labeling them as \"the most dangerous of all powers and the most meaningless,\" writing further in \"Two Ages: A Literary Review\" that:\nSome interpret Kierkegaard's thought as implying that in regards to serving God, sexuality is irrelevant \"before God not only for men and women, but also for homosexuals and heterosexuals\".\nKierkegaard's political philosophy has been likened to anti-establishment thought and has been described as \"a starting point for contemporary political theories\".\nLegacy.\nMany 20th-century philosophers, both theistic and atheistic, and theologians drew concepts from Kierkegaard, including the notions of angst, despair, and the importance of the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor, although later writers celebrated him as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right. University of Copenhagen historian of philosophy Jon Stewart has written extensively about S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's thought, and edited a \"monumental series\" of volumes on Kierkegaard's global reception and impact. Since Kierkegaard was raised as a Lutheran, he was commemorated as a teacher in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 11 November.\nPhilosophers and theologians influenced by Kierkegaard are numerous and include major twentieth century theologians and philosophers. Paul Feyerabend's epistemological anarchism in the philosophy of science was inspired by Kierkegaard's idea of subjectivity as truth. Ludwig Wittgenstein was immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard, claiming that \"Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls\". Karl Popper referred to Kierkegaard as \"the great reformer of Christian ethics, who exposed the official Christian morality of his day as anti-Christian and anti-humanitarian hypocrisy\". Hilary Putnam admired Kierkegaard, \"for his insistence on the priority of the question, 'How should I live?'\". By the early 1930s, Jacques Ellul's three primary sources of inspiration were Karl Marx, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and Karl Barth. According to Ellul, Marx and Kierkegaard were his two greatest influences, and the only two authors of which he read all of their work. Herbert Read wrote in 1945 \"Kierkegaard's life was in every sense that of a saint. He is perhaps the most real saint of modern times.\"\nKierkegaard has also had a considerable influence on 20th-century literature. Figures deeply influenced by his work include W. H. Auden, Jorge Luis Borges, Don DeLillo, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka, David Lodge, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Rainer Maria Rilke, J.D. Salinger and John Updike. What George Henry Price wrote in his 1963 book \"The Narrow Pass\" regarding the \"who\" and the \"what\" of Kierkegaard still seems to hold true today: \"Kierkegaard was the sanest man of his generation...Kierkegaard was a schizophrenic...Kierkegaard was the greatest Dane...the difficult Dane...the gloomy Dane...Kierkegaard was the greatest Christian of the century...Kierkegaard's aim was the destruction of the historic Christian faith...He did not attack philosophy as such...He negated reason...He was a voluntarist...Kierkegaard was the Knight of Faith...Kierkegaard never found faith...Kierkegaard possessed the truth...Kierkegaard was one of the damned.\"\nKierkegaard had a profound influence on psychology. He is widely regarded as the founder of Christian psychology and of existential psychology and therapy. Existentialist (often called \"humanistic\") psychologists and therapists include Ludwig Binswanger, Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Carl Rogers, and Rollo May. May based his \"The Meaning of Anxiety\" on Kierkegaard's \"The Concept of Anxiety\". Kierkegaard's sociological work \"Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age\" critiques modernity. Ernest Becker based his 1974 Pulitzer Prize book \"The Denial of Death\" on the writings of Kierkegaard, Freud and Otto Rank. Kierkegaard is also seen as an important precursor of postmodernism. Danish priest Johannes M\u00f8llehave has lectured about Kierkegaard. In popular culture, he was the subject of serious television and radio programmes; in 1984, a six-part documentary, \"Sea of Faith\", presented by Don Cupitt, featured an episode on Kierkegaard, while on Maundy Thursday in 2008, Kierkegaard was the subject of a discussion on the BBC Radio 4 programme presented by Melvyn Bragg, \"In Our Time\", during which it was suggested that Kierkegaard straddles the analytic/continental divide. Google honoured him with a Google Doodle on his 200th anniversary.\nThe novel \"Therapy\" by David Lodge details a man experiencing a mid-life crisis and becoming obsessed with the works of Kierkegaard.\nKierkegaard is considered by some modern theologians to be the \"father of existentialism\". Because of his influence (and in spite of it), others only consider either Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre to be the actual \"father of existentialism\". Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nWorks by Kierkegaard.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks by others.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27078", "revid": "6027259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27078", "title": "Worf", "text": "Fictional character from Star Trek\nWorf, son of Mogh is a fictional character in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, portrayed by actor Michael Dorn. He appears in the television series ' (\"TNG\"), seasons four through seven of ' (\"DS9\"), and the third and final season of ', as well as the feature films \"Star Trek Generations\" (1994), ' (1996), ' (1998), and ' (2002).\nWorf is the first Klingon main character to appear in \"Star Trek\". In 11 seasons as a regular character on \"TNG\" and \"DS9\", plus appearances as a recurring character in \"Picard\", Worf has appeared in more \"Star Trek\" franchise episodes than any other character.\nCasting.\nInitially, Worf was not intended to be a regular character, as Gene Roddenberry wanted to avoid \"retreads of characters or races featured prominently in the original \"Star Trek\" series\". Accordingly, a cast portrait released in June 1987 to promote the upcoming series did not include Worf. Several \"tall, slim, black actors\" auditioned for Worf before Michael Dorn came along. Not only did the Worf character become a regular on \"The Next Generation\", he was continued on the \"Deep Space Nine\" series for four more seasons (1995\u201399) and talk of a spin-off Worf show continued even into the 2010s.\nHe made his debut in 1987 in \"Encounter at Farpoint\", and last appeared in character in 2023 in \"Picard\" season 3. Dorn as Worf made 283 on-screen appearances, the most of any actor in the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nFamily history.\nWorf was orphaned as a child as a result of the Khitomer Massacre, and raised by Helena and Sergey Rozhenko. In one episode, the character says he was raised on the farm world Gault and in others he says he was raised in Russia near the Ural Mountains. He experiences conflicts between his upbringing and his desire to honor his biological heritage. He has two brothers, each with their own respective backstories, as well as two adoptive human parents, and one son. Important \"Star Trek\" episodes for Worf's family include \"The Bonding\", \", \", \" and \" in \"The Next Generation\", and \"Sons of Mogh\" and \"You Are Cordially Invited\" in \"Deep Space Nine\".\nThe House of Mogh was a family of high social and political rank, and was for a time represented on the Klingon High Council. In \"\" (set around 70 years before the \"Next Generation\" era began), Colonel Worf (also portrayed by Dorn) appears as the legal advocate of Captain James T. Kirk and Dr. Leonard McCoy after they are accused of killing Chancellor Gorkon of the Klingon High Council. He was also a member of the Klingon delegation at Camp Khitomer. Although not explicitly stated, he was intended to be Worf's grandfather and namesake.\nWorf has a son named Alexander with a half-human half-Klingon woman named K'Ehleyr, a character introduced in \"; however, she is later killed in \", a \"sequel\" to that episode and part of the Worf story arc, leaving Worf as a single parent. Alexander has to live aboard \"Enterprise\"-D when K'Ehleyr is killed. After \"TNG\" ends, Worf gets moved to the Deep Space Nine space station where he eventually marries the Trill symbiont Jadzia Dax. (See \"You Are Cordially Invited\".) On \"DS9\", Worf misses the \"Enterprise\"-D \"family\" that he had, often bemoaning the cut-rate work ethic and unfriendliness on the wayward outpost.\nThe episode \"Sins of the Father\" introduces Worf's long-lost brother Kurn, who is also an orphan of the House of Mogh. Worf's adoptive parents have a biological son, Nikolai Rozhenko, with whom Worf grew up. Nikolai and Worf talk in \"Homeward\", where it is revealed that Worf will likely have a nephew or niece.\nIn \"The Bonding\" (\"TNG\" S3E5, aired 1989), Worf adopts an orphan boy into the House of Mogh. In the first \"Star Trek\" episode written by screenwriter Ron Moore, the orphan Jeremy (played by Gabriel Damon) has a special Klingon ceremony to be adopted into Worf's family.Join me in the R'uustai, the Bonding. You will become part of my family now and for all time. We will be brothers.\n\u2013 Worf to Jeremy, \"The Bonding\"\nStorylines.\nBackstory.\nWorf was born in 2340 on Qo'noS (the Klingon homeworld) as the son of Mogh. Five years later, his parents moved to the Khitomer colony. Worf's parents were killed during a surprise attack by the Romulans on the Khitomer outpost. The colony's distress call was answered by the Federation starship USS \"Intrepid\". Chief Petty Officer Sergey Rozhenko found Worf in the rubble and took him in after failing to find any living relatives. Rozhenko and his wife Helena raised him on a small farm colony on the planet Gault, a world of about 20,000 inhabitants, almost all of them human. Worf also has a human brother, Nikolai, with whom he often quarreled. He also spent time on Earth in his parents' native city of Minsk, later recommending it to Miles O'Brien as one of his favorite places on Earth.\nWorf did not take the Rozhenkos' last name, preferring to be addressed by the Klingon designation, \"Worf, son of Mogh\". However, his son, Alexander Rozhenko, who was raised by the Rozhenkos after his mother, K'Ehleyr, died, did use their surname. Although Worf was raised by humans, he considered himself a Klingon at heart and studied in-depth the ways of his people. As an adult, his mannerisms and personality, as well as his innate sense of honor, became more Klingon than human.\nWorf's brother Kurn, barely a year old at the time of the Khitomer attack, had been left behind on the Klingon homeworld Qo'noS by his parents. Lorgh, a friend to House of Mogh (appearing only in dialog of the episode \"\"), was charged with the care of the younger son, originally expecting Mogh's stay at the Khitomer outpost to be short-term. Lorgh adopted Kurn after the attack, but informed Klingon authorities that he had died with the rest of the family. Kurn was not revealed as being alive until both brothers were adults.\nIn 2357, Worf entered Starfleet Academy. He graduated in 2361 and was commissioned with the rank of Ensign, becoming the first Klingon officer in Starfleet. Although Worf took immense pride and a sense of honor from serving in Starfleet, most other Klingons shunned and belittled his choice of vocation.\nIn 2359, he became briefly involved with K'Ehleyr who was the daughter of a Klingon father and a human mother.\n\"The Next Generation\".\nIn 2364, Worf was assigned to the USS \"Enterprise\"-D as relief flight control and tactical officer with the rank of lieutenant junior grade (\"TNG\": \"\") under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The next year, he was made Acting Chief of Security following the death of Tasha Yar, even though he believed that a promotion due to the death of a comrade was not honorable (\"TNG\": \"\"). The next year, he transferred to operations division and was formally made Chief of Security (\"TNG\": \"\").\nIn 2365, he renewed his relationship with K'Ehleyr when she came aboard the \"Enterprise\" as a Federation emissary on an urgent mission. He proposed marriage but was rejected (\"TNG\": \"\").\nIn 2366, he was promoted to Lieutenant (\"TNG\": \"\"). After an accident caused the death of Lt. Marla Astor, Worf brought the orphaned Jeremy Astor into the House of Mogh through the rite of R'uustai (\"TNG\": \"\").\nWorf learned of Kurn's existence when Kurn was assigned to the \"Enterprise\" as an exchange officer. Kurn specifically asked for the \"Enterprise\" so he could observe his brother. He then revealed his true identity, informing Worf that the House of Mogh's rival Duras accused their father of betraying the Klingon Empire by helping the Romulans attack Khitomer. When they and the \"Enterprise\" crew discovered that it was in fact Duras's father who betrayed the Empire, Worf, realizing that the powerful House of Duras could not be publicly shamed without throwing the Empire into civil war, accepted a ritual discommendation from the Klingon High Council. While Worf decided to accept this dishonor, it was decided to keep Kurn's true identity secret in order to protect his honor (and the House of Mogh as a whole be left alone) (\"TNG\": \"\").\nIn 2367, K'Ehleyr returned with Klingon Chancellor K'mpec who had come to meet with Captain Picard. When she came aboard, Worf learned he had a son named Alexander. She wanted to marry him but Worf refused because he did not want to share his dishonor with her and their son (\"TNG\": \"\").\nAfter K'mpec's death, she assisted Captain Picard with the rite of succession. K'Ehleyr was eventually murdered by Duras when she found evidence of his involvement in the effort to discredit Worf (and why he was discommended). Exercising his right of vengeance, Worf fought and killed Duras with a bat'leth in a duel, allowing Duras's political opponent Gowron to become chancellor (\"TNG\": \"Reunion\").\nA civil war erupted when the Duras's son Toral challenged Gowron. Worf believed Gowron was the legitimate ruler and convinced his brother to bring forces loyal to him into battle on Gowron's behalf. Worf resigned from Starfleet to fight for Gowron and served on his brother's ship. Gowron won the war after Starfleet exposed Romulan support for the House of Duras. In appreciation of his support, Chancellor Gowron restored Worf's honor, allowing Kurn a seat on the High Council as the recognized brother and representative of the House of Mogh (\"TNG\": \"\"). Once the war was over, Worf regained his Starfleet commission, recognizing that he did not fully belong to Klingon society (\"TNG\": \"Redemption, Part II\").\nIn 2369, while the \"Enterprise\" was at Deep Space Nine, Worf investigated a claim that his father might still be alive in a Romulan prison camp. His father was not there (having indeed been killed during the battle at Khitomer), but a number of Klingons were living there with the Romulans. Unable to return home with honor, as Klingons are supposed to commit suicide rather than be taken prisoner, they stayed and strayed from their way of life. Worf's visit had a profound effect on the children of the prisoners and many chose to leave with him (\"TNG\": ).\nWorf's visit to the camp caused him to reconsider his own beliefs. He visited the monastery at Boreth to meditate. One day, a man appeared before him claiming to be Kahless the Unforgettable who had returned to lead the Empire once more. Worf was willing to consider the idea that Kahless was genuine because he believed the Klingons had lost their ways. Gowron was skeptical. He questioned Kahless about details of his memories, which Kahless could not recall, and then challenged Kahless to combat, defeating him easily. The loss forced the clerics to reveal that they had created a clone of Kahless and implanted ancient scriptures of Kahless's battles as his memories. Despite this, Worf became convinced that the Klingons would make a leap of faith and accept him as the legitimate heir of Kahless. He convinced the Klingons to appoint the new Kahless as Emperor. While real power remained with Gowron as head of government, the Emperor would be the formal head of state and teach the stories of Kahless. Gowron was induced to go along with this arrangement when Worf threatened in private otherwise to oppose him publicly, which Gowron, still not fully in control of the Empire, could not afford. (\"TNG\": \"Rightful Heir\").\nWorf avoided romantic attachments with non-Klingons during his first few years onboard the \"Enterprise\"-D. As Worf explained to both Commander Riker and Guinan, he felt that non-Klingon females would be too fragile, and that he would have to restrain himself too much. He eventually developed strong feelings for Counselor Deanna Troi, and explored a relationship with her for a time, which at times strained his relationship with her former romantic interest, Commander Riker. Worf and Troi seemed to end their relationship following the destruction of the \"Enterprise\"-D at Veridian III and Worf's reassignment to Deep Space Nine.\n\"Deep Space Nine\".\nIn 2371, he was promoted to lieutenant commander (\"Star Trek Generations\"). After the destruction of the \"Enterprise\"-D, Worf took an extended leave to evaluate his future. He was at a monastery on the Klingon colony of Boreth when he was ordered to go to Deep Space Nine to advise Captain Sisko when a Klingon fleet massed at the station. When he arrived, he was met by former \"Enterprise\"-D crew member and Deep Space Nine Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien. (\"DS9\": \"\").\nWorf learned that the Klingons were planning to invade Cardassia because of a coup which they had been led to believe was engineered by the Dominion. Worf reluctantly informed Sisko, knowing this would jeopardize his status in the empire. After the invasion had begun, Gowron traveled to DS9 to ask Worf to join him in battle. Gowron believed the Federation was unworthy of Worf's loyalty because they would not fight the Dominion. Worf felt the war was wrong and he could not support it. Gowron punished him by reinstating Worf's discommendation, but this time executing it to the full degree, by stripping him and his family of his honor, lands, and titles, effectively bringing down the House of Mogh.\nWorf submitted his resignation but Sisko rejected it because he still needed him. He had decided to rescue the members of the Cardassian council from certain death at the hands of the Klingons. In doing so, he was able to prove that there was no Dominion involvement by verifying their identities. The Klingons attacked the station in order to capture the council members but withdrew as Starfleet ships approached, fearing a war on two fronts.\nAt the end of the immediate crisis, Sisko convinced Worf to join the crew as Strategic Operations officer. In this role, he would coordinate all Starfleet activity in the Bajoran sector and act as executive officer of the USS \"Defiant\", meaning he had to adjust to the requirements and obligations that came with the red \"command personnel\" uniform. For the first months, Worf had difficulties adjusting to life on the station, unintentionally overstepping his boundaries by acting as he did on the \"Enterprise\", putting him for a while at odds with Chief of Security Odo. For Worf, the station's life seemed just too much 'grey', subsequently requesting to relocate his quarters aboard \"Defiant\".\nAfter the Klingon civil war, Kurn had gained a seat on the High Council. Worf's opposition to the war against Cardassia cost Kurn his seat on the council. Four months later, he arrived at DS9 seeking help from his brother to perform a ritual to die with honor. He felt that the ritual, which involved Worf killing him, was the only way to restore his honor. Initially disregarding orders from Sisko not to carry out the honor killing, Worf failed in his first attempt to perform the ritual and later found he could not bring himself to do so again, as he had taken on a human feature of morality and would consider it murdering his brother. Worf arranged for his brother to have cosmetic surgery and his memory wiped so he could start a new life with no ties to the House of Mogh. Kurn now has the identity of Rodek, who believes he lost his memory after being hit by a plasma discharge (\"DS9\" episode \"Sons of Mogh\"). When Rodek sees Worf, he asks him whether he is family. Worf bitterly replies that he has no family.\nAfter a year of war between the Federation and the Klingons, Worf joined a team sent to investigate claims that Gowron was a changeling in disguise. Worf nearly killed Gowron in combat but at the last moment the impostor was revealed to be disguised as Gowron's military adviser General Martok. The discovery helped restore peace between the Federation and the Klingons and to Worf again being shunned by Gowron for not having killed him when he had the chance, reaffirming his dishonor. (\"DS9\": \"\", \"Apocalypse Rising\").\nIn early 2373, Worf became involved with DS9 science officer Jadzia Dax, a Trill woman. She was familiar with Klingon customs due to the experience of the Dax symbiont's previous host, Curzon. She was the first non-Klingon that Worf could \"physically\" be with in the traditional Klingon way, although it still left bruises, cuts and broken bones.\nWhile on a mission to the Gamma Quadrant, Worf was captured by the Dominion and sent to a Jem'Hadar prison camp where he met the real General Martok and was reunited with the real Dr. Bashir, who had both been captured and replaced by changelings. While the prisoners worked to escape, Worf entered a daily round of combat with each of the guards in turn. He earned the respect and admiration of Martok and even of the guards because he would not yield. Once the prisoners escaped, they managed to warn the station about the Bashir-changeling.\nUpon their return, Martok was assigned command of the Klingon detachment on Deep Space Nine and command of the IKS \"Rotarran\". Martok asked Worf to be his first officer. The ship had suffered many losses to the Dominion, and morale was low. Martok's refusal to engage the enemy, due to his Dominion incarceration, made things worse. Worf challenged him for command, but allowed Martok to win and retain command. This led to Martok regaining his warrior's courage and, with renewed vigor, he led the crew to their first victory against the Dominion. Understanding what Worf had done, Martok thanked him for reminding him of his duty as a soldier and offered him a place in his house as his brother. By joining the House of Martok, Worf's status in the empire was restored (albeit the House of Mogh remains stricken). Worf's son, Alexander, was also assigned to the \"Rotarran\" after joining the Klingon Defense Force. Though Worf was initially estranged by his now adult son, and skeptical of his son's desire to serve the Empire, he eventually reconciled with him, and his son joined the House of Martok as well. Worf continued to serve on the \"Rotarran\" after Sisko withdrew from DS9 at the beginning of the Dominion War.\nWhen Sisko eventually returned with a fleet of Federation ships to retake the station, Worf and Martok lobbied Gowron to send Klingon ships to join the battle. The entry of the Klingon ships turned the tide and allowed the Defiant to break through and retake the station (\"DS9\": \"Favor the Bold\", \"Sacrifice of Angels\").\nHaving helped liberate the station, Worf and Jadzia decided to get married. The wedding was a traditional Klingon ceremony which included a series of trials on Jadzia's part in order to gain the approval of Martok's wife to join the House of Martok. This almost ended in disaster, as the free-spirited Jadzia felt forced into a position rather than taking the matter seriously enough. Eventually, realizing its importance to Worf and counseled by Sisko that she needed to mature, Jadzia yielded and she was allowed to marry Worf. (\"DS9\": \"You Are Cordially Invited\").\nIn the \"DS9\" episode \"\", Worf prematurely ended a mission to contact a Cardassian informant inside the Dominion in order to save his injured wife. The informant was subsequently executed by the Dominion, causing Captain Sisko to officially caution that Starfleet might not grant Worf his own command after this incident (being another official reprimand in Worf's records of consequence). However, Sisko added that, had he been forced to choose between his duty and his wife, he would have done the same thing.\nBy late 2374, Worf and Jadzia were married less than a year when they decided to try to have a child, despite the extreme difficulties posed by the disparate biologies of Trill and Klingons. While Worf was away during a mission, Jadzia visited the Bajoran temple on the station where she was attacked and killed by an alien possessing the body of Gul Dukat, who had come aboard the station to destroy an Orb of the Prophet. (\"DS9\": \"Time's Orphan\", \"Tears of the Prophets\")\nJulian Bashir was able to save the Dax symbiont, which was sent back to the Trill homeworld to be rejoined with a new host aboard the USS \"Destiny\". When the symbiont's health worsened, the Dax symbiont was implanted into a new host named Ezri Dax, who was the assistant ship's counselor. She had not been trained to be a host, but she was the only available unjoined Trill aboard. Ezri had difficulty making the transition and sought out Ben Sisko on Earth.\nIn 2375, Worf led a mission to destroy a Dominion shipyard. He dedicated this mission to his late wife, in order to ensure her entry into Sto-Vo-kor, the Valhalla-like realm of the honored dead, being joined by Quark, Bashir and O'Brien (\"DS9\": \"Shadows and Symbols\").\nEzri helped Sisko on his mission, and then returned to DS9 with him (\"DS9\": \"Shadows and Symbols\"). She accepted his request to stay on as station counselor. Worf avoided Ezri at first, confused about what to do about this new situation. Her quick posting to DS9 led to a number of awkward moments between her and Worf, since the new host carried all the memories of their former hosts but had its own distinct personality, despite their shared past. Also, it was considered taboo on Trill for new hosts to fraternize with former lovers. After a brief rekindling of their feelings for one another, they decided that things were just too different and, eventually, the two settled into a comfortable friendship, with Ezri eventually becoming romantically involved with Julian Bashir (who previously had feelings for Jadzia). This allowed Worf to accept 'his' Jadzia to have her place into Sto-Vo-Kor.\nIn 2375, Worf became concerned with the leadership of Gowron. The entry of the Breen into the war on the side of the Dominion temporarily sidelined the Federation and Romulan fleets, which proved vulnerable to Breen weaponry. This left the Klingons alone to carry on the fight as their ships were not affected in the same manner. Gowron assumed direct command because he feared Martok's growing popularity and devised a plan to discredit Martok. He began ordering Martok on near-suicidal missions against Dominion forces, hoping that a string of defeats would weaken Martok's popularity and discredit him as a military leader. Recognizing that Gowron was jeopardizing the entire war effort for the sake of his personal pride, Worf tried to convince Martok that he should challenge Gowron for the leadership. After Martok refused, Worf challenged Gowron himself, citing his faulty battle planning, his dishonorable conduct in trying to discredit Martok, and poor strategies at the later stages of the Dominion War. After a brief battle, Worf killed Gowron; by right, he was proclaimed the new chancellor of the Klingon High Council. However, Worf declined in favor of Martok (\"DS9\": \"Tacking Into the Wind\"). Ironically, it was again by Worf's hand the next chancellor of the Empire was decided (having slain Duras to allow Gowron's ascension after K'mpec's death), and the second time he and Gowron dueled, this time finishing Gowron off. As a token of respect, Worf performed the Klingon Death Howl after Gowron's death, essentially forgiving his misdeeds and recognizing a worthy warrior was on his way to Sto-Vo-Kor.\nAfter the conclusion of the Dominion War, Worf was offered the position of the Federation ambassador to Qo'noS (the Klingon homeworld), as depicted in the \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" series finale \"What You Leave Behind\".\n\"Star Trek\" films.\nWorf continued to appear in \"TNG\" films, which is explained in various ways, such as being rescued from the damaged \"Defiant\" during a battle with the Borg (\"Star Trek: First Contact\") and taking leave that led to him traveling on the \"Enterprise\" (\"Star Trek: Insurrection\"). \"\" was released after the conclusion of \"DS9\" and Worf's status at this time is unclear, although the novelization stated that Worf returned to Starfleet as he found life as an ambassador unsatisfying. Worf attended the wedding of William Riker and Deanna Troi on Earth and traveled to Betazed with the \"Enterprise\" crew for the second wedding ceremony when the ship was diverted to investigate positronic signals from a system near the Romulan border.\n\"Star Trek: Picard\".\nBy the time of \"\", Worf has become a subcontractor for Starfleet Intelligence, having attained the rank of Captain and briefly commanded the \"Enterprise\"-E beforehand. Worf has mellowed with age, no longer giving in to impulse; even adopting a fondness for meditation and tea in his free time, having seemingly given up Klingon opera. It's also revealed that something happened to the \"Enterprise\"-E under Worf's command that renders it unusable by the time of \"Star Trek: Picard\", something that Worf insists was not his fault.\nA contact (heavily implied to be Odo) has made Worf aware that a group of Changelings objected to the Dominion's surrender and began a campaign against the Federation, prompting Worf to mount an investigation into their activities, assisted by Raffi Musiker and supervised by Ro Laren. Worf and Raffi interrogate multiple criminal co-conspirators, including the Ferengi Sneed and the Vulcan Krinn, finding that the Changeling group has infiltrated the highest levels of Starfleet and burgled its most advanced lab the Daystrom Institute to restart the Dominion War. He is reunited with Picard and the rest of the \"Enterprise\" crew, including a resurrected Data, throughout the third season, whereupon he helps Picard defeat the Changelings' collaborators, the Borg, once and for all using the rebuilt \"Enterprise\"-D. Worf also helps Musiker reunite with her estranged family by secretly leaking her heroic deeds to them. He is last seen playing poker with his \"Enterprise\" crewmates at the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles, content with his life.\nAlternate versions.\nIn 2370 after returning from a tournament, Worf encountered a quantum fissure and began shifting into different realities. In one reality, he became involved with Deanna Troi while recovering from a spinal injury. He asked permission from Commander Riker to court Troi. By the time the events in this episode takes place, he has been married to her for two years. In another reality, Worf is first officer of the \"Enterprise\", serving under Capt. Riker, who assumed command after Capt. Picard was killed by the Borg. He is married to Deanna Troi and has a daughter Shannara Rozhenko and a son Eric Christopher Rozhenko. However, she doesn't know anything about Alexander (\"TNG\": \"Parallels\").\nIn an alternate future, Alexander becomes a diplomat instead of a warrior. He wanted to end the feuding among the great houses and declared that the House of Mogh would no longer engage in blood feuds. Worf warned him that this was a show of weakness but Alexander persisted. Shortly after Alexander's decision, he witnesses Worf being killed on the floor of the High Council. Had he become a warrior, he thinks perhaps he could have saved his father's life. Eventually, he finds a way to travel back in time to try to prevent these events from occurring by convincing his younger self to train to become a warrior while under the assumed name of K'Mtar, but Worf convinces him to return to the future with assurances that he has already changed his own history (\"TNG\": \"Firstborn\").\nIn an alternate future, Worf had been reluctant to become involved with Troi and her subsequent death led to a rift between Riker and himself as a result. He later served as a member of the Klingon High Council and was governor of the Klingon colony of H'atoria with his fellow Klingons possibly at the brink of war with the Federation after conquering the Romulan Star Empire. Nevertheless, he helps his old crewmates with the threat of an anti-time eruption, and Riker makes a conciliatory gesture to his old friend, asking for his help on the \"Enterprise\" bridge during the situation, which Worf accepts (\"TNG\": \"All Good Things\").\nWhile on a mission in the Gamma Quadrant, the \"Defiant\" detects an energy barrier surrounding a planet in a nearby solar system. When they enter the barrier, the ship is damaged and they detect a settlement with 8,000 people who are mostly human. When they investigate, they learn they have been expected. The settlers explain they are the descendants of the \"Defiant\" crew. In a couple of days, when the \"Defiant\" tries to leave orbit, they will be thrown back in time two centuries and crash land on the planet. Worf learns he married and raised a family. He meets his descendant Brota who leads the Sons of Mogh. The members are descendants of Worf and Jadzia and others who choose to join them. They follow Klingon customs as first taught to them by Worf (\"DS9\": \"Children of Time\").\nIn the mirror universe, Worf leads the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance as Regent. After Terran rebels take over Terok Nor, Worf tries to recapture the station but is defeated by the rebels who have a new ship based on the design of the \"Defiant\" from the prime universe. Enraged, Worf claimed he lost only because he had been betrayed, with the Mirror Garak blaming Intendant Kira Nerys as the likely source (\"DS9\": \"Shattered Mirror\"). Eventually, Worf captured her and Grand Nagus Zek who crossed over to this universe to open new markets. Worf agreed to let Zek go in exchange for a cloaking device, but the device was sabotaged and his ship was disabled, allowing the Terran rebels to capture him (\"DS9\": \"The Emperor's New Cloak\").\nOnscreen appearances 2017 - present.\nDue to Worf's popularity there was some talk of a Captain Worf series prior to the streaming television spinoffs that began in 2017. Dorn said he had tried to pitch a Captain Worf show in the 2010s, but he was not successful\".\" The actor was reportedly offered a role as a Worf-ancestor on \" but this did not come to fruition.\nIn 2012 Dorn conceived idea for Worf show, and has pitched it at various times. He talked about his experiences pitching his idea for the character at the 2019 Keystone Comic Con.\nIn 2021, actor Michael Dorn, in addressing rumors that he might appear on the Paramount+ series \", in whose third season he would appear as a supporting character, said he was still interested in a movie or series with Worf.\nReferences in other media.\nWorf has appeared in various TV, film, book, and video games, as well as being referenced in non-franchise media such as through satire.\nVideo games.\nIn \"\", Commander Worf is one of the three main playable characters in the computer game \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Fallen\". In the game the player can play as Worf, and the game had generally favorable reviews, with on reviewer saying it has a \"compelling storyline\". It was published in 2000 for Windows and 2001 for Macintosh.\nIn \"\", Commander Worf is part of the 2000 Sony PlayStation video game \"Star Trek: Invasion\". In the game, the player gets instructions from Worf, and the game received generally favorable reviews.\nTelevision.\nThe series finale of \"Webster\" has the titular character go into the future to the \"Enterprise\"-D bridge, where he encounters several unnamed \"Enterprise\" crew members and Worf. Worf initially tells Webster he cannot return him to his time due to the \"Enterprise\"'s inability to escape the gravitational pull of a planet, but eventually, they are able to reverse-engineer the process that transported Webster to the future, and return him home. Webster wakes up from what seems to have been a dream.\nDuring the film \"Ted 2\", Michael Dorn appears as a character by the name of Rick. This character in the film attended the New York Comic Con amateurishly dressed as Worf.\nWorf, voiced by Michael Dorn, makes an appearance in the animated series \"Family Guy\".\nBooks and comics.\nWorf's character is further developed in non-canon media. In \"Star Trek\", the non-live action material is not considered a part of the character's story, although it may use elements from the television and film narrative. In other words, live action appearances don't take into account the stories written in novels for example.\nAccording to the Pocket Books novels set after \"Nemesis\", Worf takes over William T. Riker's position of first officer aboard the \"Enterprise\"-E. According to \"Death in Winter\", Worf was to transfer with Riker to the \"Titan\", but after Data's death, Picard asks Worf to stay aboard the \"Enterprise\", and Worf obliges. In early 2380 in \"Resistance\", Starfleet Command approves Picard's request to make Worf the permanent first officer, but Worf refuses as he doubts his command skills (due to his choice of love over duty in \"Change of Heart\"). Soon afterwards, however, Worf successfully leads the rescue of Picard from another Borg crisis, and is sufficiently convinced to accept the permanent promotion. As of 2385 in the novel miniseries \"Star Trek: The Fall\", Worf continues to remain first officer of the \"Enterprise\"-E. According to the Titan series, he also adopted Data's cat Spot.\nWorf had a relationship with \"Enterprise\"-E Chief of Security Jasminder Choudhury in the books until her death in the 2012 novel \"The Persistence of Memory\" by David Mack.\nThe Pocket Books series continued in the 2016 trilogy \"Prey\", written by John Jackson Miller. In it, Worf and the cloned Klingon Emperor Kahless are drawn into battle with a group of discommendated Klingons, all disciples of the late Kruge, the villain from the movie \"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\", being manipulated by Kruge's secret heir Korgh. By 2386, Worf's son Alexander is an Ambassador, working alongside Admiral William Riker. The events of \"Prey\" conclude with the last survivors of the discommendated Klingons taking on roles as guardians for a planet whose previous guards were killed as part of the conspiracy, with Kahless joining them to help them learn how to be truly Klingon. As acknowledgement of Worf's role in helping them redeem themselves, the group name the first child born during this crisis after Worf.\nIDW Publishing took the character in a different direction in its licensed works. In the official comic book prequel to the 2009 movie \"Star Trek\", Worf is a General in the Klingon Empire who is dispatched to deal with Romulan Captain Nero and his significantly altered mining vessel, the \"Narada\", which leads to a confrontation in which Nero impales Worf through the back with a large mechanical tentacle. When the \"Enterprise\"-E intervenes, Nero beams Worf to Captain Data, but uses the opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the \"Enterprise\" before leaving to attack the planet Vulcan. Worf's status after this is never explicitly mentioned in the comic.\nIn Una McCormack's \"Star Trek: Picard: The Last Best Hope\", a direct prequel to \"\", Worf is promoted to Captain of the \"Enterprise\"-E in 2381 once Picard is promoted to Admiral.\nCritical and fan reception.\nWorf is a decidedly popular character among fans. The episode \"Heart of Glory\" (S1E20 of \"TNG\"), which focuses on Worf and his relationship to other Klingons, is credited with planting \"many seeds for successive Klingon storylines ... and new insights into Klingon culture\".\nWith \"TNG\" over in 1995, the writers of \"DS9\" came up with the idea of adding Worf to the cast in response to pressure to boost ratings.\"Screen Rant\" has rated the character Worf a number of times, and by several authors, at its site. Author Edward Cambro ranks Worf as the 13th best \"Star Trek\" character overall, and remarks how Worf had to \"walk the line between two cultures, neither of which he entirely understood (nowhere is this more apparent than in episodes like \",\" \",\" and \"\").\" Said cultures being Klingons and human. Then author Sara Schmidt ranks Worf the 7th most attractive person in the \"Star Trek\" universe, in between T'Pol (\"Enterprise\") and Michael Burnham (\"Star Trek: Discovery\"), and in another article, she goes on to suggest ideas for a Worf spin-off, saying a young Worf would be \"interesting to explore\", as well as a \"series about Worf's experiences as a Federation ambassador to Qo'noS.\" Dusty Stowe then ranks the top 8 most powerful characters of \"Star Trek\" and places Worf as the most powerful between Spock and Q.\n\"TheWrap\" rates Worf as the 9th best character of \"Star Trek\", saying that he \"started the trend of turning enemies from past series into complex characters who became vital Starfleet crew members despite cultural differences.\"\nSyFy rated Worf as the 2nd greatest Klingon of the \"Star Trek\" franchise. The author explains that Worf is only in second place because he was raised by humans and relies mostly on honor. He goes on to admit, \"Michael Dorn created a \"Trek\" legend here, there can be no doubt.\"\n\"Den of Geek\" places four squarely Worf-centric episodes (one of which is a two-parter) in its list of 25 \"must-watch\" \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episodes which include \"The Emissary\", \"Sins of the Father\", \"Reunion\", \"Redemption\" (Parts I &amp; II).\nWorf is ranked the 13th most important character of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" science fiction universe by \"Wired\" magazine, beating out such favorites as Uhura. To be included in this list, characters must be Starfleet personnel or crew, plus in original media only.\n\"IndieWire\" ranked Worf as the 6th best character on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" in 2017 and \"CBR\" ranked Worf as the 8th best Starfleet character of \"Star Trek\" in 2018.\nFilk artists Ookla the Mok include a song about Worf entitled \"Mr. W\" on their 2003 album \"Oh Okay LA\". The lyrics are a parody on why Worf would not make a good captain, since he is not afraid to die and how not everyone feels the same about that. It even includes a rap from what sounds like Worf himself, toward the end.\nMusician Voltaire wrote a song called \"Worf's Revenge\" whose lyrics detail imaginings of Worf's likes and dislikes. In the band's view, Worf hates tribbles and calls Barclay a \"lowly white P'tak.\"\nProminent episodes.\nSome shows have a major subplot for the Worf character. The first of these debuted in 1988, \"Heart of Glory\" (which was S1E20 of \"The Next Generation\") This kicked off a long-running story arc that continued until the end of \"DS9\" in 1999 on television and 2002 on film.\nIn the 2012 book \"Star Trek 101: A Practical Guide to Who, What, Where, and Why\" by \"Terry J. Erdmann,\" they felt \"The Way of the Warrior\" was one of three key episodes for the character Worf, along with \"The Sword of Khaless\" and \"Sons of Mogh\".\n\"TNG\":\n\"DS9\":\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Malcolm McDowell joins cast members from the 1960s television show ' and the 1987 sequel series ', including William Shatner and Patrick Stewart. In the film, Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS \"Enterprise\"-D joins forces with Captain James T. Kirk to stop the villain Tolian Soran from destroying a planetary system in his attempt to return to an extra-dimensional realm known as the Nexus.\n\"Generations\" was conceived as a transition from the original cast of the \"Star Trek\" films to the cast of \"The Next Generation\". After developing several film ideas concurrently, the producers chose a script written by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga. Production began while the final season of the television series was being made. The director was David Carson, who previously directed episodes of the television series; photography was by franchise newcomer John A. Alonzo. Filming took place on the Paramount Studios lots, and on location in Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada, and Lone Pine, California. The film's climax was revised and reshot following poor reception from test audiences. The film uses a mix of traditional optical effects alongside computer-generated imagery and was scored by regular \"Star Trek\" composer Dennis McCarthy.\n\"Star Trek Generations\" was released in the United States on November 18, 1994. Paramount promoted the film with merchandising tie-ins, including toys, books, games, and a website\u2014a first for a major motion picture. The film opened at the top of the United States box office its first week of release and grossed a total of $118\u00a0million worldwide. Critical reception was mixed, with critics divided on the film's characters and comprehensibility to a casual viewer. It was followed by \"\" in 1996.\nPlot.\nIn 2293, retired Starfleet officers James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott, and Pavel Chekov attend the maiden voyage of the USS \"Enterprise\"-B. During the shakedown cruise, the starship is pressed into a rescue mission to save two El-Aurian refugee ships that a massive energy ribbon has snared. \"Enterprise\" saves some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but becomes trapped by the ribbon, and Kirk goes to a control room to help the ship escape. While \"Enterprise\" is freed, Kirk is presumed lost in space and dead after the trailing end of the ribbon tears open the ship's hull.\nIn 2371, the crew of the USS \"Enterprise\"-D is in a holodeck computer simulation, celebrating the promotion of shipmate Worf to lieutenant commander. Captain Jean-Luc Picard learns his brother and nephew have been killed in a fire, and is distraught that the Picard family line will end with him. \"Enterprise\" receives a distress call from a stellar observatory, where an El-Aurian, Dr. Tolian Soran, launches a probe at the nearby star. The probe causes the star to implode, creating a shockwave that destroys its planetary system. Soran kidnaps \"Enterprise\" engineer Geordi La Forge and is transported off the station by a Klingon Bird of Prey belonging to the Duras sisters.\n\"Enterprise\" crewmember Guinan tells Picard that she and Soran were among the El-Aurians rescued in 2293. Soran\u2014who lost his family when their homeworld was destroyed\u2014is obsessed with returning to the energy ribbon to reach the \"Nexus\", an extra-dimensional realm of wish fulfillment outside normal space-time. Picard and Data determine that Soran, unable to safely fly a ship directly into the ribbon, is altering its path by removing the gravitational effects of nearby stars. Soran plans to destroy another star to bring the ribbon to the planet Veridian III, consequently killing millions on a nearby inhabited planet.\nUpon entering the Veridian system, Picard offers himself to the Duras sisters in exchange for La Forge but insists on being transported to Soran directly. La Forge is returned to \"Enterprise\", but unwittingly exposes the ship's defense details through the transmitter installed in his VISOR device. The Duras sisters attack, and \"Enterprise\" sustains critical damage before destroying the Bird of Prey by triggering its cloaking device, and firing photon torpedoes when its shields drop. When La Forge reports that the starship is about to suffer a warp-core breach as a result of the attack, Commander William Riker evacuates everyone to the forward saucer section of the starship, which separates from the engineering section just before the breach occurs. The resulting shockwave sends the saucer-section crashing onto the surface of Veridian III.\nPicard fails to stop Soran from launching another probe. The Veridian star's resulting destruction alters the ribbon's course, and Picard and Soran enter the Nexus before the shockwave destroys Veridian III. Picard is surrounded by an idealized family, but realizes it is an illusion. He is met by an \"echo\" of Guinan left behind in the Nexus. Guinan sends him to meet James T. Kirk, who is safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is initially entranced by the opportunity the Nexus offers to atone for past regrets, he realizes it lacks danger and excitement. Having learned that they can travel whenever and wherever desired through the Nexus, Picard convinces Kirk to return with him to Veridian III, shortly before Soran launches the probe.\nWorking together, Kirk and Picard distract Soran long enough for Picard to lock the probe in place; it explodes on the launchpad and kills Soran. Kirk is fatally injured in the effort, and Picard buries him at the site. Three Federation starships arrive to retrieve the \"Enterprise\" survivors from Veridian III. Picard muses that, given the ship's legacy, the \"Enterprise\"-D will not be the last vessel to carry the name.\nCast.\nThe main cast of \"\" reprise their roles in \"Generations\": Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker, LeVar Burton as Chief Engineer Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Brent Spiner as Lieutenant Commander Data, Gates McFadden as Chief Medical Officer Commander Beverly Crusher, Michael Dorn as Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Marina Sirtis as ship's counselor Commander Deanna Troi. Recurring characters from the series return, including Barbara March and Gwynyth Walsh as the villainous Klingon sisters Lursa and B'Etor Duras, Patti Yasutake as \"Enterprise\" nurse Lieutenant Alyssa Ogawa, and Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan.\nMalcolm McDowell plays Tolian Soran, the film's antagonist. McDowell had worked with Stewart on stage decades earlier, and relished the chance to kill Shatner's character. He liked his character's spiked hair and black ensemble, and requested that his character not have alien features to avoid lengthy makeup sessions.\nIn the film's initial script, the entire principal cast of \"The Original Series\" was featured, but only three members appear in the film: William Shatner as Kirk, James Doohan as Scott, and Walter Koenig as Chekov. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley declined to appear as their characters Spock and Leonard McCoy. Nimoy felt there were story problems with the script and that Spock's role was extraneous. Producer Rick Berman told the press, \"Both Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley felt they made a proper goodbye in the last movie.\" Nimoy and Kelley's lines were subsequently modified for Doohan and Koenig. The news that not all of the \"Original Series\" cast was in the film was not passed to all of \"The Next Generation\" actors. When Goldberg arrived on set on her first day, she immediately asked to see Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Nyota Uhura in \"The Original Series\". When told that Nichols was not in the film, she said to Koenig, \"The fans have been waiting for years to see Nichelle and me and Uhura and Guinan on screen together.\" Patrick Stewart said that he had made an effort to ensure the original cast's involvement in the film: \"I didn't want us to sail into the future just as \"The Next Generation\" cast.\"\nAlan Ruck plays \"Enterprise\"-B captain John Harriman. When approached for the role, Ruck assumed he would play an alien, saying, \"Look, when I shave every day, I don't look in the mirror and say, 'Hey! There's a starship commander.'\" Berman informed him that the character was from a wealthy and connected family, and was placed in command as a stepping stone to a political career. Jacqueline Kim plays \"Enterprise\"-B helmsman Demora Sulu. Kim consulted with art supervisor Michael Okuda to make sure her hand movements and manipulations of the ships' controls were consistent and accurate. Glenn Morshower played an \"Enterprise\"-B navigator; he apologized to the director for a poor first rehearsal, because as a \"Star Trek\" fan he was unused to performing along with actors he had idolized for years.\nMany of the minor characters throughout the film appeared in different roles in the television series. Tim Russ, who appears as an \"Enterprise\"-B bridge officer, played a terrorist in \"Starship Mine\" and a Klingon in \", and later joined the cast of \" as the Vulcan Tuvok. Various background roles were played by the main cast's stunt doubles.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1992, months before the official announcement of a followup to ', Paramount Pictures executives approached ' producer Rick Berman about creating another feature film. Berman informed writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga that Paramount had approved a two-picture deal approximately midway through \"The Next Generation\"'s sixth season. Moore and Braga, convinced Berman had called them into his office to tell them \"The Next Generation\" was cancelled and they were out of a job, were instead given the task of writing the film. Berman also worked with former \"Next Generation\" producer Maurice Hurley to develop possible story ideas, intending to develop two film scripts simultaneously and prioritize whichever was most promising. Executive producer Michael Piller turned down the opportunity to develop ideas, objecting to what he saw as a competition for the job. Moore and Braga's script was ultimately chosen. The writers spent weeks developing the story with Berman, before taking a working vacation in May 1993 to write the first-draft screenplay, completed June 1.\nMoore described \"Generations\" as a project with several required elements. Berman felt that having the original cast of the previous \"Star Trek\" films felt like a \"good way to pass the baton\" to the next series. The studio wanted the original cast to only appear in the first minutes and Kirk only recurring at the end of the film. Other requests included a Khan Noonien Singh-like antagonist, Klingons, and a humorous Data plot. At one point, the writers toyed with the idea of pitting the two crews against each other. \"We were obsessed with the poster image of the two \"Enterprises\" locked in combat: \"Kirk vs. Picard, One Must Die!\"\" said Moore. Ultimately, the writers could not come up with a plausible explanation for such a conflict, and abandoned the idea.\nIn the initial draft of the screenplay, the original series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot would have been the entire cast crammed into an elevator, happy to be back together. The \"Enterprise\"-D's destruction also appeared\u2014the saucer crash had first been proposed by Moore as the conclusion to part one of a sixth-season cliffhanger story that was scrapped. Kirk's death was developed in Braga, Moore, and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that \"we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list.\" After the idea of killing off a \"Next Generation\" cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. \"We all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it,' \" Moore said. The studio and William Shatner had few concerns about the plot point.\nRefining the script meant facing the realities of budget constraints. The initial proposal included location shooting in Hawaii, Idaho, and the Midwestern United States, and the total budget was over $30\u00a0million. The budget dropped to $25\u00a0million after negotiations. A revised version of the script from March 1994 incorporated feedback from the producers, studio, actors, and director. The writers changed one sequence where Harriman trained his predecessors in the \"Enterprise\"-B's operation after Shatner felt the scene's joke went too far. Picard's personal tragedy was written as his brother Robert's heart attack, but Stewart suggested the loss of his entire family to add emotional impact. The opening sequence took place on the solar observatory with two Rosencrantz and Guildenstern-influenced characters talking shortly before an enemy attack; \"Next Generation\" writer Jeri Taylor suggested that the opening should be something \"fun\", leading to the switch to the holodeck scene.\nLeonard Nimoy turned down the chance to direct the feature. The producers chose David Carson. The British director had no feature film experience, but had directed several episodes of \"Star Trek\", including the \"Next Generation\" episode \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" and the \" pilot \".\nDesign.\n\"Star Trek\" veteran Herman Zimmerman served as production designer, collaborating with illustrator John Eaves for many designs. Zimmerman's approach to realizing a vision of the future was to take existing designs and use them in a different manner to express living in the future. Taking cues from director Nicholas Meyer's approach to \"\", Zimmerman noted that future humanity will still have the same furniture needs, so a logical approach was to start with what would remain the same and work from there.\nTransitioning from television to film meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with a higher level of polish to stand up on the big screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge. Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; he had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked, but never had the time or money to rework it.\nThe script called for an entirely new location on the \"Enterprise\"-D: stellar cartography. The script described the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a three-story circular set to give the impression the actors were inside a star map dominated by screens. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design. The backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create in the years before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer graphics software. The starmaps were replaced with a bluescreen for scenes where the static images would be replaced by computer-animated star maps by Santa Barbara Studios. Stellar cartography was one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.\nThe film marked the first appearance of the starship \"Enterprise\"-B. The ship was a modification of the \"Excelsior\", a model designed and built by Bill George and effects house Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) for ' a decade earlier. Co-producer Peter Lauritson, illustrator John Eaves, and Zimmerman designed the \"Enterprise\"-B with additions to its hull, some of which were added so that they could depict damage to the ship without harming the underlying model's surface, and to improve the look of the ship when it was filmed from angles called for in the script. The ship's bridge was based on previous designs for the \"Enterprise\"-A and \"Excelsior\" sets Zimmerman had created for \"The Undiscovered Country\", using pieces from each. The surrounding spacedock for \"Enterprise\"'s maiden voyage was a modification of the model created for ' (1979), refurbished and modified to better fit the film's anamorphic screen frame.\nLike Zimmerman, George took the opportunity of the \"Enterprise\"-D's screen debut to touch up the model. Because \"Generations\" featured the \"Enterprise\"-D separating into its saucer and engineering sections, the original model built by ILM for the television series was removed from storage. The model was stripped, rewired, and its surface detailed to stand up to scrutiny. George changed the paint job, as he recalled they had been in a rush to prepare the model for television and its green-and-blue color scheme did not properly read on film. The paint scheme was shifted towards a \"battleship grey\", with glossy tiled areas reminiscent of the original feature film \"Enterprise\".\nWhile \"Generations\" made use of new sets and props, set decorator John M. Dwyer reused existing props or made new ones out of premade materials where possible, rather than spend money on new items: a torture device was created from a birthing chair, nose hair clippers, and flashlights; packing materials formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran's missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements. The stellar observatory set was filled with props from \"The Next Generation\", with some added in deliberate nods to past episodes. Other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for \"\" and ribbed plastic walls in the Jefferies tubes, repurposed from the sets of \"The Hunt for Red October\". Original set pieces and props included paintings for the settings in the Nexus.\nRobert Blackman, \"The Next Generation\"'s long-serving costume designer re-designed the Starfleet uniforms which the \"Enterprise\"-D crew would wear in the film. Blackman crafted militaristic-looking uniforms with rank sleeves inspired by \"The Original Series\", high collars, and jackets reminiscent of the uniforms developed for \"The Wrath of Khan\". The redesign was abandoned, and the cast wore combinations of the uniforms from \" The Next Generation\" and \"Deep Space Nine\"; the only new addition was an Eaves-designed angular communications badge that replaced the previous oval shape. Time was so short that Jonathan Frakes and Levar Burton borrowed the costumes from \"Deep Space Nine\" actors Avery Brooks and Colm Meaney. Also created by Blackman was a skydiving outfit worn by Shatner; though the scene was cut from the film, the costume was used in the \"Voyager\" episode \"\".\nFilming.\nBerman backed Carson's choice to hire John A. Alonzo, the director of photography for \"Chinatown\" and \"Scarface\". Alonzo was shown more than a dozen \"Star Trek\" episodes to familiarize himself with the franchise. He favored lighting scenes as much as possible from within the sets rather than staging lights and flags for each shot. Carson credited this approach with saving time and allowing more freedom when shooting. He later wrote that the production moved at a \"TV-like\" pace; principal photography concluded after 51 days.\nFilming commenced on March 28, 1994. \"Generations\" and \"The Next Generation\" were filmed simultaneously on different soundstages on the Paramount Studios lot. Scenes that did not feature the television series regulars were filmed first, starting with those in the \"Enterprise\"-B deflector room. The scenes of Harriman, Chekov, and Scott reacting to Kirk's apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the deflector room to be suitably distressed to visualize the damage.\nStage 7 was where the \"Enterprise\"-B's bridge, deflector room, and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elicit more genuine reactions. The stellar observatory set was an elaborate redress of the \"Enterprise\"-B's bridge, with added levels and swapped walls changing the layout. Control panels styled after those in the original \"Star Trek\" series helped suggest the age of the station.\nThe cast of \"The Next Generation\" started filming their scenes for \"Generations\" four days after wrapping on the show. After the filming of the series was complete, there were only six months remaining before the film's release date. The \"Enterprise\"-D crash scenes were filmed mid-May 1994, and were among the last remaining shots before the existing \"Next Generation\" sets were demolished to make way for \"Star Trek: Voyager\". As a result, the crew distressed the sets for the crash damage more than would have been normal during the series' run.\nDespite the budget cuts, \"Generations\" shot many scenes on location. The rushed pace of filming meant that not all locations had been selected before the start of principal photography, and the production was still scouting locations until two weeks before the final scenes. The production exhausted possible options within Los Angeles' studio zone and looked up to away for suitable locations. The \"Enterprise\"-D promotion ceremony on the holodeck was filmed on , a full-scale replica of the first American sailing ship to visit Japan. Carson fought hard to keep the shoot during budget trims, deciding to sacrifice other days in the schedule to keep the scene. \"Lady Washington\" was anchored at Marina del Rey and sailed out a few miles from shore over five days of shooting. Some of \"Lady Washington\"'s crew appeared amongst \"Enterprise\" crew members.\nPicard's house in the Nexus was a private home in Pasadena, California; almost all the furnishings were custom props or outside items. Portions of the scene were shot in May 1994, followed by new shoots five months later. The revisions included adding Picard's nephew Ren\u00e9 to his imagined Christmas celebration with his family. The house of Kirk's Nexus recollections was located in Lone Pine, California, with the cabin filled with props to represent Kirk's career, from a Klingon bat'leth to a painting of his \"Enterprise\".\nCarson wanted a suitably remote and alien mountain location for the film's climax at Soran's compound. The scenes were filmed over eight days on an elevated plateau in the \"Valley of Fire\", north-east of Las Vegas, Nevada. The rise's height and sloped sides required cast and crew to climb using safety ropes and carry all provisions and equipment with them. The heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, who wore a wool costume. Safety harnesses and wires used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice were removed digitally in postproduction.\nAs originally filmed, Kirk was shot in the back and killed by Soran. Test audiences reacted negatively to the death, so the scene was rewritten and reshot over two weeks so that Kirk sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran's control pad and de-cloak the probe. Paramount allowed the film to go over budget to $35\u00a0million for the re-shoots. As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their shoot from the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage to be included in the final cut.\nEffects.\n\"Generations\"' special effects tasks were split between the television series' effects vendors and ILM. ILM CG Supervisor John Schlag recalled that it was easy to recruit staff who wanted to work on \"Star Trek\"; working on the film \"gave me a chance to be a part of the whole \"Trek\" thing ... ILM is practically an entire company filled with \"Trek\" geeks\". The screenwriters filled the initial drafts with exciting\u2014and expensive\u2014effects. Effects supervisor John Knoll's team then storyboarded the effects sequences, figuring out how to best service the script as cheaply as possible. When even those estimates proved too costly, ILM continued cutting shots. \"[We had] nothing left to cut, and we still had to cut stuff out,\" Knoll recalled.\nPrevious \"Star Trek\" films had used conventional motion control techniques to record multiple passes of the starship models and miniatures. For \"Generations\", the effects artists began using computer-generated imagery (CGI) and models for certain shots. No physical shooting models were built for the refugee ships, although George recalled that he created a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to develop his ideas from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it. Other CG elements included the solar collapses and the Veridian III planet. Knoll used a digital version of the \"Enterprise\"-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and slitscan effect for the original meant that the effect \"barely holds up\", Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout. While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built; these included the observatory, built by model shop foreman John Goodson.\nThe climactic battle between the \"Enterprise\" and the Klingons over Veridian III was accomplished using traditional motion control, but without the budget for practical explosions and special breakaway models, impacts and battle damage were simulated with practical compositing tricks and computer-generated effects. The destruction of the Bird of Prey was a reuse of footage from \"The Undiscovered Country\". Weapons fire and energy bolts were hand-animated, but Knoll had a different idea for the photon torpedoes. A fan of the impressive, arcing look of the torpedoes from \"The Motion Picture\", Knoll scanned in footage from the film and turned to computer-generated effects. A simulator program created a similar look that could be animated from any point the effects artists wanted, without the expense and tedium required\u2014shining lasers through a crystal in a smoky environment\u2014to recreate the look optically.\nCarson described the Nexus energy ribbon as the true villain of the film; ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural frame of reference. \"When creating something from scratch, it's always important to rough out the whole thing... because there are so many paths you can explore, it's easy to get bogged down,\" recalled effects co-supervisor Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the from \"The Undiscovered Country\". Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory simulation. The airfoil-shaped core of the undulating ribbon was enhanced with electrical tendrils. To sell the ribbon's vastness in space shots where no sense of scale would be available, Seiden and George created a debris field of embers that trailed the ribbon. The inside of the ribbon was conceptualized as similar to a dense electrical storm, with electricity fogging the screen. Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and \"Enterprise\"-B should be CG models. To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the physical model, with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens. The tendril strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\nThe \"Enterprise\"-D crash sequence was filmed in a forest floor set extended by matte paintings, built outside so ILM could use natural light. A model \"Enterprise\" saucer was constructed specifically for the shots; the model's size gave it the right sense of scale for flying dirt and debris, an illusion enhanced by shooting with a high-speed camera to give the saucer the expected slow movement of a massive object. ILM shot its crew members walking about their parking lot and matted the footage onto the top of the saucer to represent Starfleet personnel evacuating the saucer section.\nMusic.\nDennis McCarthy, the principal composer for \"The Next Generation\", was given the task of writing \"Generations\"' score. McCarthy became the first \"Star Trek\" composer to work on both television and film projects. Critic Jeff Bond wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. The film's opening music is a choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the \"Enterprise\"-B, McCarthy used low brass chords. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a sound not used on \"The Next Generation\"), while the scene ends with dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the \"Enterprise\"-D. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. A broad fanfare\u2014the film's only distinct theme\u2014first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. This theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from \"The Next Generation\"'s first season, notes from the theme for \"Deep Space Nine\", and Alexander Courage's \"Star Trek\" theme. For the final battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music to accentuate the fistfight. For Kirk's death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another statement of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk's grave is scored with more pomp. The Courage theme plays again at the film's close.\nThe original soundtrack was released in 1994 on cassette tape and CD. In 2013, GNP Crescendo Records rereleased the soundtrack as a two-disc, expanded collector's edition including previously unheard tracks.\nRelease.\nMarketing.\nThe marketing of \"Generations\" included a website, the first to officially publicize a motion picture. The site was a success, being viewed millions of times worldwide in the weeks leading to the film's release, at a time when fewer than a million Americans had internet access. Paramount also promoted the film on the Prodigy online service.\nTie-in merchandise released to promote the film included collectible cups and calendars from Jack in the Box, promotional kiosks at Kmart stores, and action figures. Due to production timelines, these figures wore the Blackman-designed Starfleet uniforms that were ultimately unused in the film itself. Other collectibles included a 600,000-run special issue of \"Entertainment Weekly\" dedicated to the film, and stamps and souvenir sheets produced by Guyana. A novelization of the film written by J. M. Dillard spent three weeks on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. Paramount's licensing group estimated promotional partners could add up to $15\u00a0million in the film's support.\nSeveral tie-in video games were released to tie in with the film's release. Absolute Entertainment published \"\" for the Game Boy and the Game Gear handheld devices. Three years after the film, MicroProse produced \"Star Trek VII: Generations\", which featured the film's cast as voice actors. The game roughly followed the plot of the film with most of the game played in a first-person perspective.\nVersions of the film's script leaked out in advance of the film. A bootleg script revealed the energy ribbon and Kirk's death; James Doohan confirmed the script's authenticity at a fan convention in March 1994, but his agent denied he had seen the finished script. In September, another copy of the film's script leaked onto the internet. As a result, news of Kirk's death was widespread.\nBox office.\n\"Star Trek Generations\" was previewed in the United States and Canada on November 17, 1994, and grossed $3\u00a0million from 1,525 theaters. The film opened to a wide release in 2,659 theaters the following day and grossed $23.1\u00a0million during the opening weekend, averaging $8,694 per theatre. It was the highest-grossing film during the first week of its release in the United States, staying in the top ten for a further four weeks. The film went on to gross $75,671,125 in the United States and Canada and $42,400,000 internationally, making $118\u00a0million worldwide against a $35\u00a0million budget. In the United Kingdom, \"Generations\" opened on February 10, 1995, at number one with \u00a32,040,000. In Japan, the film grossed $1.2\u00a0million its opening weekend, a large amount considering the franchise's usual poor performance in that market. Given its moderate budget, \"Generations\"'s gross was considered a success.\nReception.\n\"Star Trek Generations\" earned mixed reviews from critics and fans. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"\"Generations\" stands as a mediocre changing of the guard for crews of the Enterprise, with a dull plot that sometimes seems like an expanded episode of the television series.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 55 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating . Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore assigned the film an average grade of \"B+\" on its A+ to F scale. Writing about the film decades later, \"Den of Geek\" described the film as divisive, and \"Tor.com\" noted the film had been picked apart for years by fans and the film's own writers. In 2001, the BBC gave it 2 of 5 stars, summarizing, \"Devotees may find it necessary (if depressing) viewing.\"\nCritics complained the film felt like an overly-long episode of the television series. The \"Orlando Sentinel\"'s Jay Boyar agreed, but said the film minimized the television series' tendency to \"bog down\" by moving to the next scene before boredom could set in. Kenneth Turan called the film safe, and said that it relied heavily on viewers' appreciation for the \"Star Trek\" television series. Jay Carr of \"The Boston Globe\" described the film as \"reassuringly predictable\", saying that it featured elements that would be recognizable by the fans of both series but that the lack of surprises was a benefit.\n\"Cinefantastique\"'s Steve Biodrowski praised some of the big-budget touches the film brought to the franchise, but wrote that most of the attempts such as John Alonzo's cinematography seemed to backfire. In contrast, Carrie Rickey of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" and \"Den of Geek\"'s Chris Cummins praised Alonzo's work as one of the few bright spots of the film; \"[Alonzo] makes the \"Enterprise\" look like an actual lived-in starship,\" Cummins wrote, and \"for the first time ever, the crew of the Enterprise-D looked like they were truly in outer space\". Elizabeth Renzetti from \"The Globe and Mail\" praised the film for its special effects, but felt they were not strong enough to cover the weak plotting.\nOpinions were divided on whether or not the film was accessible to non-\"Star Trek\" fans. Critics such as \"The New York Times\"' Janet Maslin suggested that despite being \"predictably flabby and impenetrable in places\" and suffering from technobabble, there was enough action and spectacle to engage others. Boyar felt that specific plot beats would fly over the heads of casual viewers, but the film's innate sense of fun would keep them engaged. Others considered the film inaccessible to neophytes, and too preoccupied with fan-focused elements that detracted from the overall story, with Roger Ebert critiquing the movie as being \"...so concerned with in-jokes and updates for Trekkers that it [could] barely tear itself away long enough to tell a story\".\nThe meeting of Kirk and Picard prompted comparisons between the two respective actors; Stewart's performance was often considered superior. James Berardinelli and Ebert wrote that Kirk's lack of presence through much of the film was still keenly felt. Biodrowski, in contrast, wrote that Shatner's hammy acting was a better fit for the film than Stewart's subtle delivery. Boyar thought Shatner did a good job playing a straight man in the final sequences and injecting more fun into the film. \"The Baltimore Sun\"'s Stephen Hunter considered Shatner and Stewart emblematic of two different eras of stardom, and that Stewart's commanding presence \"wipes poor, saintly old Shatner off the screen\". \"Cinefantastique\" and others criticized the scenes between Kirk and Picard as lacking.\nMcDowell's turn as Soran received differing opinions. Berardinelli and Rickey called Soran a weak and ill-defined villain, and Hunter dismissed Soran as a nemesis unworthy of the titanic meeting of Kirk and Picard. \"People\"'s Ralph Novak called Soran a \"standard-issue \"Trek\" villain\", while Maslin, \"Newsweek\"'s Michel Marriott, and \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Lisa Schwarzbaum enjoyed the performance. Novak wrote that Data's subplot of learning about emotions was a highlight and probably the most enjoyable part of the film for non-fans, while Ebert said that the premise \"could have led to some funny scenes, but doesn't\". Coates summed up the subplot as \"dreary\".\nHome media.\n\"Generations\" was released on LaserDisc in the United States on July 18, 1995, followed by a September release in Japan. It was also released on the United Kingdom in 1995 in the PAL format. The film was released in the UK on VHS on 28 December 1998. It was given a DVD release in 1998, with a non-anamorphic transfer and no special features. It later received a British DVD release on October 2, 2000. A new anamorphic transfer formed the basis of a 2004 special edition, with audio and text commentaries and special featurettes. The film was released on Blu-ray in 2009 as part of a box set of \"The Next Generation\" films, along with additional material. The four \"Next Generation\" feature films were released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on April 4, 2023, in standalone and collected formats.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27080", "revid": "39078488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27080", "title": "Odo (Star Trek)", "text": "Character in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\nOdo , played by Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, is a fictional character in the science fiction television series \"\". He is a member of a shape-shifting species called Changelings and serves as the head of security for the space station Deep Space Nine on which the show is set. Intelligent, observant, and taciturn, Odo uses his unique abilities throughout the show to maintain security on the DS9 station and later aids the Bajoran people and the Federation throughout the Dominion War against his own people, the Founders.\nOverview.\n\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\nThe original \"Writer's Bible\" from 1992 for \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" described Odo as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Odo, an alien male, middle-aged curmudgeon, and a shape-shifter. In his natural state he is a gelatinous liquid. He was a Bajoran law enforcement officer on the space station under the Cardassians. Starfleet decides to have him continue in that role, since he's extremely savvy about the Promenade and all who frequent it. His backstory is: 50 years ago, with no memory of his past, he was found alone in a mysterious spacecraft that appeared in the Denorios asteroid belt. He was found by the Bajoran and lived amongst them. At first he was sort of an Elephant Man, a source of curiosity and humor as he turned himself into a chair or pencil. Finally he realized he would have to take the form of a humanoid to assimilate and function in their environment. He does it, but resents it. As a result, Odo performs a uniquely important role in the ensemble: he is a character who explores and comments on Human values. Because he is forced to pass as one of us, his point of view usually comes with a cynical and critical edge. But he can't quite get it right, this humanoid shape, though he continues to try. So he looks a little unfinished in a way. He's been working on it a long time. Someone might ask him: Why don't you take the form of a younger man. His answer: I would if I could. He has the adopted child syndrome, searching for his own personal identity. Although he doesn't know anything about his species, he is certain that justice is an integral part of their being, because the necessity for it runs through every fiber of his body \u2013 a racial memory. That's why he became a law man. He has a couple of Bajoran deputies; he doesn't allow weapons on the Promenade, and once every day he must return to his gelatinous form.\nActor Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois describes Odo as \"a very unformed being\" who was \"trying to get some kind of shape to his life\". Co-creator of \"\", Michael Piller, speaks of Odo's role within the show as being prompted by needing \"a character who represented the traditions of Spock and Data, the outsider who looks in at humanity.\"\nLate in the , in the episode \"\", an Odo who has lived an additional 200 years tells the \"current\" Kira Nerys that he has loved her from the time their friendship first began. With this revelation, Kira and the \"current\" Odo eventually become a couple.\nAccording to the backstory of the series, Odo was found adrift in his natural gelatinous state in the Denorios Belt in the Bajoran system. Doctor Mora Pol studied him for seven years, not initially recognising him as a sentient being. Mora and his fellow Bajoran scientists, not sure of what Odo actually was, initially had placed him in a sample container which they labelled \"unknown sample\". This was translated by their Cardassian supervisors as odo'ital, which literally means \"nothing\". Doctor Mora was later compelled to recognise Odo's sentience when he copied a beaker on a laboratory table. Even after it became clear that Odo was indeed sentient, the Bajoran scientists kept calling him \"odo'ital\", styling it like a Bajoran name (\"Odo Ital\").\nLater on the story was slowly developed: Over 200 years before, the Changelings' Great Link (a planet in the Gamma Quadrant where Changelings exist in their natural gelatinous form) had sent out 100 Changeling infants in containers throughout the universe in order to see how other alien races react to the presence of Changelings. Other than Odo, of those sent out, three have been accounted for:\nIn a battle with a Changeling spy, Odo ended up killing him and thus breaking the most important rule of the Changelings (no Changeling must ever hurt another). He was punished by being changed by the Great Link into becoming a \"solid\". He regained his powers in the process of trying to save a dying Changeling. Although his deepest desire is to rejoin the Great Link, he is reluctant to do so due to the mad crusade of the \"Female Changeling / Founder\" for total war against every solid in the Alpha Quadrant. In the last episode, Odo rejoins the Great Link, saving them from being totally destroyed (\"What You Leave Behind\").\nOdo is tacitly mentioned in the third season of \"\", set two decades after \"Deep Space Nine\", as still being among the Great Link and having informed Worf of a rogue group of Changelings plotting a terrorist attack against the Federation.\nIn \"\", a holographic version of Odo appears in \"Kobayashi\" as a part of the \"Enterprise\"-D bridge crew during Dal R'El's attempts to beat the Kobayashi Maru test. The other crewmembers that Dal selects are former crewmembers of the \"Enterprise\" and \"Enterprise\"-D.\nMirror Universe.\nIn the Mirror Universe, Odo is the supervisor of the mining complex at Terok Nor. He is a brutal taskmaster over Terran slaves there and tolerates no deviation from his strict rules. Relatively little is known of him, as no one in the Mirror Universe is aware that the wormhole exists or who Odo's people are. During a mining accident, Odo begins an evacuation of the Terran workers from the complex. Julian Bashir, seizing the opportunity to escape, destroys him with a disruptor.\nIn this reality, Odo has his own set of rules called the \"Rules of Obedience\" and quotes one of the rules in the same way that mainstream universe Quark would quote the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition.\nAfter filming of the episode \"\", which was mirror Odo's sole onscreen appearance, actor Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois liked the mirror universe uniform so much he began wearing it while playing the regular universe version of Odo as well.\nNon-canon.\nNovels.\nIn the initial \"Deep Space Nine\" relaunch novels, Odo is succeeded as security chief by Ro Laren, who is working for the Bajoran Militia. He also sent a Jem'Hadar ambassador to the Alpha Quadrant to foster understanding in the Dominion of other cultures, and soon returned to DS9.\nIn the \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine \u2013 Millennium\" series of novels, it is revealed that Odo rarely shifted into smaller forms such as insects due to a psychological block from his original training under Doctor Mora. The novel series also speculates that the Founders placed a mental block on Odo's abilities to make it difficult for him to alter his face, thus explaining why he can never get faces quite right, even after linking with other Changelings on several occasions.\nIn the \"Star Trek: Terok Nor\" novel \"Night of the Wolves\", Odo was found in a spherical module in the Denorios Belt by the Cardassian vessel \"Kevalu\", which was under the command of Dalin Malyn Ocett, in 2345.\nIn the \"Star Trek: Typhon Pact\" novel \"Raise the Dawn\", Odo returned to the Alpha Quadrant to help Sisko investigate reports that the Typhon Pact, an alliance of the Federation's enemies, have stolen Jem'Hadar technology to perfect their own quantum slipstream drive, only to be trapped in the Alpha Quadrant when the wormhole was seemingly destroyed thanks to Kira's attempt to stop a Typhon Pact ship from using it again.

They were devised in 1991 for the series ' before being used in the subsequent series ' and \"\".\nThe writers of \"The Next Generation\" introduced the Cardassians for the fourth season episode \"\" as new antagonists for the crew of the USS \"Enterprise\"-D to interact with on a personal level, as the Borg lacked personality or individuality, hindering interpersonal drama.\nIn the series, set in the 24th century, the Cardassians are presented as living under a military government controlling the Cardassian Union, an interstellar empire occupying other planets, most notably Bajor. When \"\" was launched in 1993, its writers set its events in the vicinity of Bajor in the aftermath of the Cardassian occupation.\nThe Cardassians grew into major antagonists throughout the series, with several recurring characters developed, including Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) and Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo).\nDesign.\nThe design of the Cardassians was undertaken by \"The Next Generation\"'s costume designer Bob Blackman and makeup designer Michael Westmore. They sought to give the species a \"snakelike\" appearance. Cardassians have grayish-white skin, ridges on either side of the neck, and a spoon-shaped structure on the forehead. Westmore was inspired by an abstract painting he had seen in a Ventura Boulevard store of a wide-shouldered woman with what looked like a spoon on her forehead.\nRick Sternbach designed the Cardassian spaceship in \"The Wounded\". He initially proposed a pod-shaped vessel, before replacing it with a design resembling a scorpion, then one based on the ankh symbol. Sternbach later noted that \"The \"Galor\" class started with an Egyptian ankh, given how [the Cardassians] were like the Pharaohs to the Bajoran slaves, but you don't really see the basic shape unless you look straight down on the vessel. The little disruptor pyramids were a bit more obvious, as were the 'temple' type structures on the ship's backbone, and the sandy yellow shades.\"\nEd Miarecki and Tom Hudson built the model used in \"The Wounded\" from Sternbach's design. In the episode, Cardassian weapons fired a pink discharge, changed to amber in later episodes.\nProduction designer Herman Zimmerman worked on the Cardassian architecture depicted on the shows. His concept had some Art Deco influence, and was based on geometric patterns. Some motifs were ellipses, angles rather than straight lines, and groups of three.\nDepiction in the shows.\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\"The Wounded\": 1991.\nThe Cardassians were invented by the writers of \" for the show's fourth season episode \", written by Stuart Charno, Sara Charno, and Cy Chermak, with teleplay by Jeri Taylor. It was first screened in January 1991. The script related that the Cardassian Union and the United Federation of Planets\u2014of which Earth was a part\u2014were involved in skirmishes for many years but had signed a peace treaty.\nIt begins with the revelation that the USS \"Phoenix\", a renegade Federation starship under the command of Captain Benjamin Maxwell (Bob Gunton), has begun attacking Cardassian targets, as Maxwell is convinced the Cardassians are rearming for war against the Federation. The USS \"Enterprise\"-D, captained by Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), is sent to stop the \"Phoenix\", with the Cardassian Gul Macet (Marc Alaimo) coming aboard the \"Enterprise\" to assist.\nAlaimo's appearance as Gul Macet in \"The Wounded\" made him the second actor, after Mark Lenard, to play three separate alien species in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. In earlier episodes he portrayed an Antican (\"Lonely Among Us\") and a Romulan (\"\"). He later portrayed a human in \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\" before gaining a recurring role as the Cardassian Gul Dukat in \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\nFor this episode, several Cardassians were depicted wearing helmets, something never again done in the franchise; Blackman and Westmore's designs also gave Macet facial hair, the only time a Cardassian was shown this way.\nLater episodes: 1991\u20131994.\nIn the fifth season episode \"\", written by Rick Berman and Michael Piller and first screened in October 1991, the Bajoran species was introduced. It explained that the Cardassians had annexed the Bajoran homeworld, Bajor, 40 years earlier, with many Bajorans fleeing their planet as refugees and often fighting back with militant tactics. \"Ensign Ro\" was the first episode where Cardassian warships were introduced as \"Galor class\" vessels. Although it was not intended at the time, the situation between the Cardassians and Bajorans laid the groundwork for the plot of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\nThe Cardassians were central to the two-part sixth season episode \"\", written by Frank Abatemarco and screened in December 1992. In them, the Federation has gained intelligence that the Cardassians are developing a genetically engineered virus on an uninhabited planet. Picard is sent to infiltrate and destroy the weapon but is apprehended and tortured by the Cardassian Gul Madred (David Warner).\n\"Chain of Command Part I\" included the first mentions that the Cardassians' homeworld was called \"Cardassia\", and the \"Cardassian Union\" as the name of their interstellar state (previously mentioned only as the \"Cardassian Empire\"). \"Chain of Command PartI\" also introduced the news that the Cardassians had withdrawn from Bajor, setting the stage for the events of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\", which began airing a month later. The show's designers introduced the Cardassians' hand weapon in this episode, with Sternbach describing it as like a \"copper-colored banana\". Part Two of \"Chain of Command\" provided a brief history of the Cardassians and their military government.\nThe Cardassians also appeared in the sixth season episode \", written by Joe Menosky and Ronald D. Moore and screened in April 1993, where it is revealed that humans and Cardassians\u2014as well as the Klingons and Romulans\u2014are all descended from an ancient species who seeded many planets with life. In the seventh season episode \", written by Ronald D. Moore, it is explained that the treaty between the Federation and the Cardassians left various Federation planets in Cardassian territory, and that many of these Federation colonists refused to leave. Their presence and struggle for independence from Cardassian rule was a recurring theme in both \"Deep Space Nine\" and \"Voyager\". \"Journey's End\" was the first time Cardassian communicators were shown, affixed to the actors' wrists. The conflict between the Cardassians and the rebel colonists, known as the Maquis, was again used as the basis for the series' penultimate episode, \"\", written by Naren Shankar and Ren\u00e9 Echevarria and directed by Stewart.\n\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\nLaunching the new series, \", was the pilot episode \", written by Rick Berman and Michael Piller. Focussing on the aftermath of the Cardassian departure from Bajor, the premise of the series revolves around the Federation taking control of Deep Space Nine, a Cardassian-built space station orbiting Bajor, at the request of the Bajoran provisional government.\nIn \"Emissary\", the station's new Starfleet commander, Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is visited by the Cardassian who formerly served as prefect of Bajor, Gul Dukat, played by Marc Alaimo. Alaimo had played a different Cardassian character in \"The Next Generation\", but was brought in to replace the actor formerly cast as Dukat, whose performance had dissatisfied the creative team. Ira Behr recalled that \"It was either Mike Piller or Rick Berman who finally said, 'Let's get Marc Alaimo,' who had done a bunch of \"TNG\" episodes for them in the past. Marc came in and, of course, he \"was\" Gul Dukat.\" \"Deep Space Nine\" would go on to introduce several more Cardassians as recurring characters, including the exiled spy-turned-tailor Elim Garak, whose mysterious past and moral ambiguity made him one of the franchise's most popular recurring characters.\nLate in the first season, the show's creative team included another Cardassian-themed episode, \"\". Written by Lisa Rich and Jeanne Carrigan-Fauci as a bottle episode, it featured the arrest of a Cardassian believed to be guilty of war crimes against Bajor, Aamin Marritza (Harris Yulin), and the relationship he developed with the station's Bajoran second-in-command, Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor). The lengthy speech given to Marritza was an early example of what the writers came to call \"Cardassian monologues\". Behr said, \"Cardassians love to speak. Garak loves to speak, Enabran Tain loves to speak. Dukat loves to speak\u2014very slowly\u2014and certainly Marritza loves to speak.\"\nOver the course of \"Deep Space Nine\", the Cardassians' internal politics and their relationships with the Federation and Bajor go through many upheavals. In early seasons, the Cardassians maintain a shaky alliance with the Federation, which comes to their defense against attacks from the Maquis and the Klingons. An ill-advised attack by the Obsidian Order, the Cardassian intelligence agency, against the alien empire known as the Dominion cripples the power of the Cardassian military dictatorship and allows a civilian government to take control. Later in the series, Dukat negotiates Cardassia's membership in the Dominion in exchange for his own appointment as ruler of Cardassia, leading to a war against the Federation. When Dominion rule becomes too oppressive for the Cardassians, Dukat's successor Damar leads a resistance movement against the Dominion with the support of the Federation and Bajorans, restoring Cardassia's independence. However, during the final battle of the war, the Dominion leader ordered a genocidal retaliation for the Cardassian resistance. Although this was ended, at least eight hundred million people were killed and Elim Garak lamented that their freedom had come at the cost of much of Cardassia's rich culture, best people and greatest minds, leaving the Cardassians facing a dire reconstruction effort.\nCardassian history.\nWithin the \"Star Trek\" fictional universe, the Cardassians were once a \"peaceful people with a rich spiritual life\". However, during this period they also suffered from disease and famine. Nationalistic fervour grew and a military dictatorship was established, under which the citizens became prosperous. The Obsidian Order, an intelligence agency and internal security police force, kept the population under surveillance. The Cardassians became imperialistic, waging war with other races and occupying their territory to exploit resources. The Cardassian empire is known as the Cardassian Union.\nOccupation of Bajor.\nIn 2328, the Cardassians invaded Bajor, occupying it for forty years, during which time they forced many Bajorans into slave labor, using them in their various mining operations. This forced many Bajorans to flee and live in refugee camps away from Cardassian domination, while other Bajorans became involved in the resistance movement, engaged in guerrilla warfare organising terrorist attacks against Cardassian targets.\nThe Federation would not intervene in the situation, due to Prime Directive considerations.\nIn 2369, the Bajoran resistance forced the Cardassians off Bajor, after which the Bajoran Provisional Government invited the United Federation of Planets to set up base on the former Cardassian mining station of Terok Nor, renaming it Deep Space Nine.\nDominion War.\nDuring the Dominion War, the Cardassian Union joined the Dominion in opposition to the Federation alliance, taking a main role below the Dominion's rulers, the Founders. They were supplanted by the Breen Confederacy and, after some of their territory was promised to the Breen, the Cardassians rebelled against the Dominion, and were instrumental in defeating the Dominion and ending the war. It was a Bajoran, Colonel Kira Nerys of the Bajoran Militia, who trained the Cardassians in guerrilla warfare to defeat their own occupiers.\nReception.\nIn 2017, \"Den of Geek\" ranked Cardassians the 4th best aliens of the \"Star Trek\" franchise, behind the Borg but ahead of the Bajorans.\nSome of the top-rated television episodes featuring Cardassians in \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" include \"Improbable Cause\", which features an intriguing story centered on Garak, and also \"Duet\".\nIn cosmology.\nIn cosmology, the concept \"Cardassian expansion\" is a term used for a modification to the Friedmann equations. It is named after the fictional \"Star Trek\" race by the original authors, Katherine Freese and Matthew Lewis. In their 2002 paper (which has been cited more than 330 times), a footnote on the \"Cardassian term\" states: \"2 The name Cardassian refers to a humanoid race in \"Star Trek\" whose goal is to take over the universe, i.e., accelerated expansion. This race looks foreign to us and yet is made entirely of matter.\"\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hertzler\nMartok, son of Urthog is a recurring character in \", played by actor J. G. Hertzler. Martok is a high-ranking Klingon leader at the Federation-Bajoran space station in the late 2300s. Martok figures prominently in many of the show's long running story arcs, and also is an important relationship for Worf.\nConcept and production.\nJ. G. Hertzler made his first appearance in the franchise in the ' pilot episode, \", as a Vulcan Captain who is killed when his vessel is destroyed. Following this, he made his first appearance as a Klingon in the video game ', directed by Jonathan Frakes and also starring Robert O'Reilly as Chancellor Gowron. When the producers of \"Deep Space Nine\" were casting Martok, Hertzler auditioned after initially not considering the role but found himself getting angry during the interview due to a comment from the director which he felt was insulting. However, this response led to him gaining the role, and it was included as a character trait for Martok.\nIt took around three hours each day for the make-up to be applied to Hertzler by David Quashnick, who was the \"specialist\" who did both Hertzler and O'Reilly's Klingon make-up. Hertzler did not mind the process, but stated that having the prostheses block the sight in his left side could sometimes make filming difficult as he could not see when turning that way. He felt it was important to the character to remind him of the time spent on the Dominion prison world, and turned down the opportunity to have Martok's sight restored when it was suggested by executive producer Ira Steven Behr. In particular, Hertzler felt it gave the same air to Martok as Christopher Plummer's character in \"\".\nIn 2020, Hertzler talked about developing the character: \"As a stage actor you usually get some weeks to rehearse, if you get lucky, and then you go on. And with Martok, I was able to work on him for four years. Now I am still doing it 25 years later!\"\nIn an interview with \"Heavy\" in 2021, Hertzler discussed how it was working with the cast of \"Deep Space Nine\". He found it was intimidating at first, because the regular cast had worked with each other for years, and the Martok character had to \"boss people around.\" However, he found the other actors welcomed him and helped him feel like he belonged.\nAppearances.\nBackground.\nLittle backstory is given regarding the early life of Martok, except for a brief history sketched by himself in the \"Deep Space Nine\" episode \"\". It is known that he was born into a Klingon house (The House of Martok) that was not part of the aristocracy and was raised in the Ket'ha lowlands on the Klingon homeworld of Qo'noS. This area is considered a wasteland by the Klingons.\nMartok's family had been loyal soldiers of the Klingon Empire for 15 generations, but never officers. It was Urthog's long-held wish that Martok become an officer, so he enlisted the aid of officers whose respect he had earned, and convinced one to sponsor his son's application to the Klingon academy. They submitted the application to the Oversight Committee, believing that approval would be a mere formality, but was rejected by one member, the legendary Klingon warrior Kor, who held elitist views regarding the honor and prestige of the \"great houses\". With such a rejection on his record, Martok could no longer even serve as a common soldier. He chose to serve, regardless, and spent five years on General ShiVang's flagship as a civilian laborer. When the ship was surprised by a Romulan attack, Martok took up arms and helped repel the boarding party. His skill and bravery earned him a battlefield commission, but the honour was soured by the fact that Urthog had died some years earlier and couldn't share in his son's glory. Martok later earned the rank of Lieutenant after the Battle of Tcha'voth, becoming tactical officer aboard the cruiser \"Gothspar\" under Captain Kultan (ST:DS9 Books: \"The Left Hand of Destiny\"), and by his introduction to the series, he had attained the rank of General and still held a grudge against Kor.\nGeneral Martok.\nAround 2371, Martok was abducted by agents of the Dominion and replaced with a shapeshifter. The exact date of this is unclear. The changeling was successful at beginning the war with the Cardassians (S4, E1) but inadvertently revealed himself to Odo (who had been misled into believing that Chancellor Gowron was the changeling) at a Klingon award ceremony, and was quickly killed by the Klingons attending the ceremony (S5, E1).\nThe real Martok spent two years in a Dominion internment camp, forced to fight Jem'Hadar soldiers daily in hand-to-hand combat for training purposes. Presumably it was during one of these fights that his left eye was gouged out. During his confinement, Martok came to respect the indomitable character and fighting qualities of Worf. In the episode \"By Inferno's Light\", Martok escapes and returns to the Alpha Quadrant with Elim Garak, Worf and Julian Bashir, and is made commander of the Klingon forces on \"Deep Space Nine\".\nWeeks after this new assignment, Martok took command of a Klingon Bird-of-Prey, the \"Rotarran\", and made it his personal flagship. Initially, the \"Rotarran's\" crew were beaten and fatalistic, a fact that was made worse by Martok's apparent reluctance to engage Jem'Hadar forces on their first mission. Eventually, a confrontation between Martok and Worf helped rally both the crew's warrior spirit as well as Martok's. The mission would conclude with the \"Rotarran\" engaging and destroying a Jem'Hadar vessel and rescuing thirty-five crewmen from a disabled Klingon ship. A grateful Martok would later invite Worf (who had earlier been stripped of his family name by Gowron) to join Martok's house.\nMartok is portrayed as an excellent judge of character, caring deeply about those under his command. This, in turn, earned him great respect among fellow Klingons, since while they have a love for battle and conquest, they also have a very low opinion of those who wantonly throw soldiers into battle with little regard for their safety or well-being. These traits, along with his courage and leadership skills, would serve him well in the Dominion War, during which he fought in several battles, including the battle to retake Deep Space Nine, and the First and Second Battle of Chin'toka. Despite his humble background, or perhaps because of it, Martok would become extremely popular among other Klingon warriors and the civilian population, because he climbed his way up the ranks honorably, though Martok himself repeatedly stated he had no interest in politics. Eventually, he was made Supreme Commander of the Ninth Fleet, a position he initially resented because of the amount of paperwork involved. Like most Klingons, Martok had a disdain for Ferengi, which manifested itself in several refusals to even acknowledge Nog, who at the time was a Starfleet Cadet. It isn't until Nog stands up to Martok and directly challenges him that Martok begins to display a grudging respect for the young Ferengi (episodes \"Soldiers of the Empire\", \"\").\nShortly before the end of the war (\"When It Rains\u2026\"), Gowron comes to Deep Space Nine to honor Martok by inducting him into the Order of Kahless, and then announces that he would be taking control of the Klingon forces from Martok because it was time for him to \"take a more active role in the war\". However, it becomes clear that Gowron is simply worried about Martok getting too powerful politically, and intends to usurp Martok's standing by sending him into battles that he cannot win. Worf tries to convince Martok to challenge Gowron, but he refuses, saying he is a loyal soldier of the Empire and has no desire whatsoever to enter politics, let alone become Chancellor. Worf then kills Gowron himself, and rather than accept the title of Chancellor, gives it to Martok (\"Tacking into the Wind\").\nChancellor Martok.\nWhen the Dominion forces suddenly withdrew into Cardassian territory, the Allies realized that they were withdrawing in order to gain time to recover from their battle wounds, so that they could come back stronger a few years later.\nMartok believed that the Empire should attack right away, and convinced the Federation and Romulans to attack as well. Martok, leading the Klingon fleet; Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko, leading the Federation fleet; and the Romulans attacked and defeated the Dominion on the Cardassian homeworld.\nDespite the refusal of Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko (who were horrified by the sight of being surrounded by so many dead Cardassians) to drink bloodwine with Martok in the halls of Cardassian Central Command, something most Klingons would consider a grave insult, Martok simply shook his head and said that humans didn't understand, with the Federation and Klingons remaining staunch allies. Martok is happy to receive Lt. Commander Worf as the Federation Ambassador to Qo'noS. He comments that he now has an Ambassador that he can go targ hunting with and that, for this reason, \"perhaps being Chancellor won't be \"so bad\" after all\". Shortly after the end of the war, Martok and Worf leave DS9 for Qo'noS (\"What You Leave Behind\").\nPersonal life.\nMartok is the son of Urthog, and is an only child. He grew up in the Ketha province on Qo'noS. Urthog did not live to see his son become an officer; Martok holds a grudge against Kor for robbing his father of that honour.\nMartok is married to Sirella, a noble woman. They have one son, Drex (\"You Are Cordially Invited\", \"\") Martok views marriage as another form of combat, albeit one disguised and more subtle than most (\"The Changing Face of Evil\").\nAfter Worf joined Martok's house, Worf's son Alexander would be inducted into the house as well, as would Jadzia Dax upon her marriage to Worf (the marriage was initially opposed by Sirella). After Jadzia's death, Martok would come to regard Dax's new host Ezri as a worthy successor to Jadzia and would consider her part of his house as well.\nMartok's first appearances on \" (in \" and \"Apocalypse Rising\") were actually the Changeling infiltrator posing as Martok. The real Martok did not appear onscreen until \"In Purgatory's Shadow\".\nThe Mirror Universe version of Martok has only appeared in the novels. Unlike the regular Martok, who is an honorable and caring commander, the MU version is foul-mouthed, slovenly and cruel. He is eventually killed by the mirror counterpart of Klag, who assumes Martok's role as Regent of the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReception and analysis.\nIn 2015, SyFy rated Martok among the top 21 most interesting supporting characters of Star Trek, and in 2019, SyFy rated Martok as the #1 greatest and \"most Klingon-y\" Klingon of the \"Star Trek\" franchise. Tara Bennett called him \"legendary.\" In 2016, ScreenRant ranked the character Martok as the 12th best \"Star Trek\" character overall, in between Worf (#13) and Sarek (#11). They describe Martok as a \"Klingon's Klingon\", but instead of being obsessed with battle he appears as \"battle-worn, flinty, and grateful to be alive\", while Victor Grech highlights the instances where Martok embraces warfare.\nIn 2018, CBR ranked this character 10th best recurring character of all \"Star Trek\".\nProducer Ira Steven Behr's impression from \"The Way of the Warrior\" was \"Gee, this guy Martok is great\", and he decided to make him a recurring character. He described Martok as \"a great Klingon. Very charismatic and fun.\"\nUwe Meyer characterizes Martok as an upright person of integrity, who in this regard stands in direct contrast and conflict to his predecessor, the erratic and self-serving Gowron. Martok is committed to family loyalty and follows a code of honour that is especially visible in times of war. Douglas Mann calls it \"the Homeric code of the Klingon warrior\" and compares it to that of ancient Sparta and the warriors of Mycenean culture as depicted in the \"Illiad\".\nMeyer sees elements of the Cold War reflected in the Star Trek franchise, with the Federation representing the West and the Klingon Empire the USSR and Russia. In this context, Martok represents a Klingon character who is not explicitly Westernized like Worf, but still pays homage to the liberal values of the West to a significant degree. This characterization - bar the political connotations - is supported by a discussion documented by Karl Spracklen: Martok has been exposed to human culture enough to laugh off the refusal of his Federation allies to celebrate a victory the Klingon way with him, where another Klingon might have been offended. Martok's chancellorship is compared by Meyer to the position of Mikhail Gorbachev in the USSR, as a representative of the ruling elite who recognizes the shortcomings and divisions of his society and strives for reform. In this role Martok is also similar to the character of Azetbur from \"\". She was denied significant success as a lone reformer. Whether Martok can fulfill the hopes invested in him is an open question at the end of his arc.\nUwe Meyer also states that Martok conforms to the stereotype of the simple, honest soldier, who is not well-versed in the intrigues associated with a negatively connoted political class, and is more like a politician should be because of it. That he was often victorious in battle is presented as adding to his aptitude, comparable to a number of former military officers who have achieved the U.S. presidency."}

She is seen again commanding the USS \"Dauntless\" in \"\", searching for the missing USS \"Protostar\" which was being commanded by Captain Chakotay, her former first officer on \"Voyager\", at the time of its disappearance.\nAlthough other female captains had appeared in previous \"Star Trek\" episodes and other media, Janeway was the first to serve as the central character of a live-action \"Star Trek\" television series. She has also appeared in other media including books and video games. In all of her screen appearances, she has been played by Kate Mulgrew.\nCasting.\n\"Star Trek: Voyager\".\nDuring the development of \"Star Trek: Voyager\", one of the actors considered to play the captain, before it was decided the character would be a woman, was Gary Graham. Kate Mulgrew, Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold, Erin Gray, Patty Duke and Susan Gibney were all considered or auditioned during development, with Bujold being initially cast.\nThe character was originally named Elizabeth Janeway, after the noted writer of the same name. However, after Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold was cast, she requested the character be renamed \"Nicole Janeway\". Bujold was initially very positive, saying in an interview, \"This role is a challenge but it feels right.\" Bujold, whose acting experience was mainly in feature films, was unprepared for the schedule demanded by television and was unwilling to do news interviews. After the second day of filming for the first episode \"\", Bujold dropped out of the series.\nAfter Bujold's departure, Joanna Cassidy, Susan Gibney, Elizabeth Dennehy, Tracy Scoggins, and Lindsay Crouse were considered as replacements. Erin Gray and Chelsea Field (wife of future \"Star Trek\" captain Scott Bakula) auditioned for the role. Not only was shooting already behind schedule, but the episode had to be ready by January 1995. It was not only the launch of series, but would also be the first program airing on the newly-launching United Paramount Network (UPN), and over $20 million was being spent on the pilot. Kate Mulgrew, who had previously auditioned for the role, was cast on September 17, 1994. She suggested that the name be changed to \"Kathryn\", to which the producers agreed. \n\"Star Trek: Prodigy\".\nIn October 2020, Mulgrew confirmed she would voice Janeway in the animated series \"\". Executive Producer Alex Kurtzman said of the choice, \"We can think of no better captain to inspire the next generation of dreamers on Nickelodeon, than she.\" In April 2021, it was revealed that Mulgrew would voice an emergency training hologram based on Janeway. Though initially announced as a series for Nickelodeon, the show premiered on Paramount+ in October 2021, with later airings on Nickelodeon.\nThe real Janeway first appears in the episode \"A Moral Star, Part 2\". Janeway is searching for her former first officer, Captain Chakotay, of the USS \"Protostar\". She commands the USS \"Dauntless,\" which features a quantum slip-stream drive. The ship is based on schematics the crew of the USS \"Voyager\" obtained under Janeway's command in the Delta Quadrant of another USS \"Dauntless\", a ship used to bait the crew into getting assimilated by the Borg (\"Hope and Fear\"). She tries to keep up with the \"Protostar\" and its protowarp capability. The kids, desperate for a means of explaining the situation to their pursuers without setting off the \"living construct\" booby trap, since using regular communications with the Starfleet ships would do that, attempt a telepathic communication with Admiral Janeway. In the attempt, the effort goes awry with the consciousnesses of the kids' leader, Dal and Admiral Janeway being inadvertently exchanged in their bodies. While this development allows Janeway to learn the full situation from the kids, Dal's struggles in Janeway's body leads to the crew to believe she had lost her sanity. The two manage to return to their bodies, but Janeway found herself in the brig with seemingly no one willing to believe her explanation of recent events, nor her warning of the Protostar's booby trap before it was too late and the Starfleet ships in the immediate area starting to attack each other out of the crews' control and that promised to be only the beginning of the destruction.\nThe events of \"Supernova, Part 2\" caused Mulgrew's primary role in the series to shift to Admiral Janeway. Within this episode, the holographic Janeway stays on the \"Protostar\" in order to enact the self-destruct to destroy a \"living construct\" installed on the \"Protostar\" threatening to obliterate Starfleet. Though she promises to copy herself so she can join her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, she is unable to do so due to the vastly increased complexity of her program, meaning her program is lost when the \"Protostar\" is destroyed, something she makes sure the kids only discover when it is too late so they would not delay their escape arguing with her. When the kids reach Starfleet Headquarters, Admiral Janeway vouches for them and takes them under her wing as warrant officers.\nIn the second season, Janeway works with the kids to rescue Chakotay from the future, accidentally creating a universe destroying temporal paradox in the process. As a result of the alterations to time, a younger version of the holographic Janeway returns in the second season, having spent ten years marooned with Chakotay. At the behest of Wesley Crusher, Janeway reluctantly allows the kids to go after Chakotay alone and they find and rescue him and the \"Protostar\". At the end of the season, at Chakotay's behest, The Doctor copies the holographic Janeway onto an EMH backup module before her memories are erased and the ship is sent back in time to be found by the kids. In the present, the holographic Janeway becomes the Emergency Command Hologram of the new USS \"Prodigy\".\nCharacter biography.\nIn the \"Star Trek\" universe, Kathryn Janeway was born on May 20, 2336 in Bloomington, Indiana on Earth. She was the daughter of Vice Admiral Janeway and has a sister named Phoebe, who is the artist in the family. Phoebe never chose to join Starfleet and stayed close to home with her mother, Gretchen Janeway. Kathryn Janeway was very close to her father, who taught her to look at the universe with a scientist's eye; she was devastated by his death. Her first mission after graduating the academy was as a science officer on the USS \"Al-Batani\", where she served as Chief Science Officer during the Arias mission.\nCaptain Janeway takes command of the \"Intrepid\"-class USS \"Voyager\" in 2371. Their first mission is to locate and capture a Maquis vessel last seen in the area of space known as the Badlands. While there, the Maquis ship and \"Voyager\" are transported against their will into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light-years away, by a massive displacement wave. The Maquis ship is destroyed while fighting the Kazon-Ogla, and although \"Voyager\" survives, there are numerous casualties. In order to protect the Ocampa, who live on a planet \"Voyager\" visits, Janeway destroys the Caretaker Array, the space station that transported the two ships to the Delta Quadrant, which provides energy to the Ocampa's planet, despite the fact that the Array may be the two ships' only chance to return home. In doing this, Janeway strands her ship and crew seven decades' travel from home.\nHer first major task is integrating the surviving Maquis and \"Voyager\" crews. Chakotay, captain of the Maquis ship, succeeds the deceased Lieutenant Commander Cavit as her first officer. Janeway also grants convicted criminal, former Starfleet officer, and accomplished pilot Tom Paris a field commission, and makes him \"Voyager\"'s helmsman.\nJaneway's other interactions with her crew include helping the de-assimilated Borg Seven of Nine reclaim her individuality and humanity and advocating for the 's status as a sentient being.\nDuring the course of the TV series, \"Voyager\" has contact with the Q Continuum on three occasions, and repeated contact with the Borg. With the intervention of a future/alternate version of herself, Janeway leads her crew in using one of the Borg's transwarp conduits to return her ship to Federation space after having traveled through the Delta Quadrant for seven years.\nIn a cameo in the film \"\", now-Admiral Janeway instructs Captain Jean-Luc Picard to travel to Romulus at the invitation of the film's antagonist.\nA few years after \"Voyager\"'s return to Federation space and Janeway's subsequent promotion to Admiral, Janeway commands the USS \"Dauntless\" in an effort to locate her former first officer Chakotay who disappeared while commanding the USS \"Protostar\".\nNon-canon.\nAdmiral Janeway also appeared in the Borg Invasion 4-D ride at the venue in Las Vegas, which closed in 2008. In the ride, Janeway leads \"Voyager\" to the rescue of ride participants who are ostensibly trapped first on a space station and later on a shuttlecraft that come under attack by a Borg Cube commanded by the Borg Queen. At the ride's end, Janeway tells the participants, \"Congratulations. You've defeated the Borg with one thing the Queen can never assimilate: the human spirit. As long as we have that, resistance will never be futile.\"\nJaneway continued as a major character in the \"Star Trek\" novels that depict the events in the lives of the \"Voyager\" characters after the end of that series. In Peter David's 2007 ' novel, \"Before Dishonor\", which is set after the events of ', Janeway is assimilated by a rogue faction of the Borg, and becomes their new Borg Queen. Seven of Nine, with the aid of Ambassador Spock and the \"Enterprise\"-E crew, manages to communicate with Janeway's consciousness, buried deep within the Queen's mind. During a brief moment of contact, Janeway helps them destroy the Borg cube, with all hands on board. Although Seven manages to escape, Janeway is killed. Her memorial service sees a vast turnout, and a tall gleaming pillar with a light burning atop it is constructed in tribute to her. The Q female appears to Janeway's spirit, and tells her that Q and the Q Continuum had taken an interest in her. Telling her that she has a destiny, Lady Q takes Janeway by the hand, and disappears with her into realms unknown. Writer Peter David explained the book was conceived by Pocket Books editorial as one in which Janeway would die, and that he was brought in to write it in order to give her a reportedly heroic send-off.\nIn the 2012 \"Star Trek: Voyager\" novel \"The Eternal Tide\" by Kirsten Beyer, Janeway returns to human life with the help of young Q, who needs her assistance, and by the book's end resumes her admiralship in Starfleet. In the 2014 \"Star Trek: Voyager\" novel \"Protectors\" by Kirsten Beyer, Janeway goes back to Earth per orders of Starfleet Command; by the end of the book she returns to the Delta Quadrant, taking charge of the starships stationed there. She continues this mission in Beyer's second 2014 \"Star Trek: Voyager\" novel, \"Acts of Contrition\".\nIn Cryptic Studios' online role-playing game, \"Star Trek Online\", Janeway was physically added to game in January 2022 along with voiceover work by Kate Mulgrew as part of the game's twelfth anniversary. Prior to her addition, Janeway was only occasionally mentioned in the game. She was also retroactively added to the game's 2014 \"Delta Rising\" expansion.\nReception.\nIn 2019, Vulture.com ranked Captain Kathryn Janeway as the number one \"Star Trek\" captain by their selection criterion, a combination of competency and managerial style. In particular, they note her ability to overcome great challenges despite being on the other side of the Galaxy and commanding a crew in large part consisting of non-Starfleet personnel. One of her interesting relationships is noted as with the former Maquis B'Elanna Torres (played by Roxann Dawson), and the former Borg Seven of Nine (played by Jeri Ryan). Space.com rated Janeway as the number three best captain of \"Star Trek\". In 2017, \"The Washington Post\" ranked Janeway as the third best Captain of \"Star Trek\".\n\"Screen Rant\" rated her the fifth best captain of the franchise, noting her ability to command in adverse situations; two praises were that she does not give up easily and tries to maintain crew morale. In a review of female characters from science fiction television and film, Janeway was in the top ten. Captain Janeway was ranked as the 18th best character of all \"Star Trek\" by IGN in 2009. In 2016, Captain Janeway was ranked as the 8th most important character of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" science fiction universe by Wired magazine.\nThe romance between Janeway and Kashyk in \"\" was praised by \"Screen Rant\", which they rated as one of the ten best episodes of \"Star Trek: Voyager\". In 2018, CBR ranked Janeway as the 4th best Starfleet character of \"Star Trek\". In 2017, \"Screen Rant\" ranked Kathryn Janeway as the 18th most attractive person in the \"Star Trek\" universe.\nIn 2018, The Gamer ranked Janeway as one of the top fifteen starship captains of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nCaptain Janeway was rated as one of the top seven time travelers, in the whole \"Star Trek\" franchise by \"Nerdist\" in 2019, for her exploits in \"\".\nIn July 2019, Screen Rant ranked Janeway the 4th smartest character of \"Star Trek\".\nIn May 2024, CBR ranked Janeway as the best Star Trek captain to lead a series.\nLegacy.\nThere's coffee in that nebula.\nIn 2015, astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti \u2013 then serving aboard the International Space Station\u2013 dressed as Janeway for photographs in which she gestured toward an incoming Dragon cargo spacecraft. She posted a photo to Twitter with the comment, \"\u2018There\u2019s coffee in that nebula\u2019\u2026 ehm, I mean\u2026 in that #Dragon,\" quoting a memorable line by the character from the \"Star Trek: Voyager\" episode \"\". The craft was carrying an ISSpresso machine and coffee for the crew.\nBirthplace monument.\nIn 2019, a group of Bloomington, Indiana residents formed what is now The Janeway Collective with the goal of building a \"Captain Kathryn Janeway\" birthplace monument such as the one existing for James T. Kirk in Riverside, Iowa. Through attending local events and raising awareness, and with the permission of CBS, they were able to successfully raise funds through a crowdsourcing campaign on the platform Patronicity and received a matching grant from the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority's CreatINg Place program.\nAn official groundbreaking event took place on June 27, 2020, and the monument was unveiled on October 24, 2020, after being delayed from the planned date of May 20, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kate Mulgrew attended the unveiling virtually due to the pandemic. The monument is constructed of a cast bronze bust with a limestone base with stainless steel plate, and was sculpted by Aaron Eby. It is located on the B-Line Trail immediately next to the WonderLab science museum.\nOn October 23, 2022, almost two years after the unveiling, Kate Mulgrew visited the monument in person, fulfilling the promise she made when the statue was unveiled.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is portrayed as a half-human half-Klingon born in 2346 on the Federation colony Kessik IV. \nIn the series, Torres was admitted to Starfleet academy but dropped out before graduating. She joined the Maquis in 2370 and was serving on the \"Val jean\" when taken to the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker alien using his station. In the first few episodes, her Maquis ship was destroyed and the surviving Maquis joined the USS \"Voyager\" on the long journey across the galaxy to Earth. She was posted to engineering and quickly promoted to chief engineer, where she played a major role in the rest of the series. She had an ongoing relationship with Tom Paris, whom she married in the final season.\nDawson was praised for her portrayal of Torres by CBR, who wrote that she made the character believable. As a part-human, part-Klingon character struggling to reconcile the two halves of her heritage, Torres was praised by multi-ethnic audiences.\nCharacter development.\nThe \"Star Trek: Voyager Companion\" describes B'Elanna as a young half-human half-Klingon in her twenties who is a member of the Maquis Rebellion.\nThe producers wanted to hire an actress who could portray B'Elanna's inner struggle between her human and Klingon halves. After Roxann Dawson read for the role, she became the first of the \"Voyager\" actors to be cast. Originally, Dawson's makeup differed from the final design; she explained that she had a much more pronounced Klingon forehead and nose and had to wear a set of Klingon teeth, which made her feel uncomfortable. She asked the producers and makeup artist Michael Westmore if they could perhaps make her more attractive and tone down the Klingon makeup. Eventually they came up with a design with which Roxann was happy, something she described as her \"beauty monster makeup\". \nDuring season one, Dawson initially doubted her readiness to portray her character's dual roles in the early-series episode '.' However, she used the episode to learn more about her character, and it became one of her favorite episodes. When the episode aired, she called her parents to ask their opinions, and they replied, \"You were good, but the girl that played that Klingon was really great!\", which Dawson took as a compliment. Joy Kilpatrick was a stand-in of one of two versions albeit uncredited. \nDuring season four, Dawson became pregnant with her first child. The writers decided they did not want B'Elanna to be pregnant as well, so for the duration of Dawson's pregnancy, she was given an engineering lab coat, which was used to help cover her growing pregnancy. \nDuring the episode \"\", the Hirogen had taken over \"Voyager\" and forced the crew to participate in holodeck recreations of various combat situations, to which B'Elanna's holodeck character is portrayed as pregnant in World War II with a Nazi officer's child.\nDuring season five, Dawson had a meeting with the producers and writers to discuss her character. Roxann explained to them that she felt B'Elanna had an extreme dark side that hadn't been explored, and from that discussion the episode \"\" was created. Dawson stated that after the episode aired, she received fan mail praising the issues of depression and inner conflict raised in the episode, with which many people identified.\nDuring season six, Dawson got the chance to explore B'Elanna's Klingon heritage thanks to an episode originally conceived by Ronald D. Moore for \". In the episode \", B'Elanna has a near-death experience and travels to Gre'thor, the Klingon Hell, where she meets her mother, Miral. She discovers that because of the dishonor B'Elanna has caused her family, her mother would spend eternity in Gre'thor. The episode explores some aspects of B'Elanna's character, and also gives further insight into Klingon mythology. Dawson believed the episode had many layers to it, and she believed it was essentially a coming-of-age story for B'Elanna and her final acceptance of her Klingon heritage.\nDuring season seven, a pregnancy storyline was written in for B'Elanna's character. Jessica Gaona played the character's young iteration in the episode \"\". At the end of the series, Dawson described B'Elanna's character arc as that of an \"unruly young woman who matures over the course of seven years.\"\nCharacter overview.\nB'Elanna was born in 2346 on the Federation colony Kessik IV. Torres had a troubled childhood; her human father, John Torres, and Klingon mother, Miral, often fought. At the age of 5, she overheard her father expressing his unhappiness in the home of two Klingons and she would attempt to run away. In a later confrontation with him, she bitterly told him to leave. John Torres left when B\u2019Elanna was twelve years old. He returned to Earth days later, leaving her to be raised by her mother. In season 7, he contacted her through Starfleet Command and asked to resume a relationship to which she agreed.\nBeing both Human and Klingon, Torres is shown as prone to aggressive outbursts. She once attacked her schoolmate Daniel Byrd after he repeatedly taunted her, calling her \"Miss Turtlehead\" due to her cranial ridges. Torres retained this aggressive behavior throughout her life, but she eventually learned to control it.\nStarfleet Academy and Maquis.\nWhile attending Starfleet Academy, B'Elanna was constantly having trouble with the Starfleet's rules. This resulted in her getting four disciplinary hearings and one suspension. Torres dropped out of Starfleet Academy in 2365 at age 19. Before doing so, Torres was a valued member of the academy athletics team, competing as a decathlete. Her decision to leave the academy upset the track and field coach, as well as other professors.\nA few years later she became a member of the Maquis renegade group and began developing a profound hatred of the Cardassians. Torres became associated with a Maquis captain named Chakotay and was serving as chief engineer on his ship, the \"Val Jean\", when they were brought to the Delta Quadrant by \"The Caretaker\".\nDuring her time with the Maquis, Torres reprogrammed a Cardassian missile known as \"\". The missile, built with artificial intelligence, was originally targeted at Maquis installations. Torres reprogrammed it on a course for a Cardassian installation, but \"Dreadnought\" was swept into the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker.\nUSS \"Voyager\".\nWhen the crews of the USS \"Voyager\" and the \"Val Jean\" were taken to the Delta Quadrant, Harry Kim and Torres were transported to the Ocampa home world while their respective crews set out to look for them. Being the only two people from their region of the Alpha Quadrant, the two quickly formed a relationship and she nicknamed him \"Starfleet\" for his faith in the Federation and Starfleet. This relationship would carry on throughout the series as the two would more than occasionally work on tasks together, allowing Kim to prove his intelligence to the whole crew.\nIn 2371, B'Elanna Torres joined the \"Voyager\" crew with the rest of the Maquis from the \"Val Jean\", as Captain Kathryn Janeway offers them the opportunity. She was placed in the engineering department. As the original chief engineer was killed during the trip to the Delta Quadrant, Captain Janeway promoted Torres to the position based on Chakotay's recommendation. Initially, Torres was very outspoken in her disapproval of Captain Janeway's decision to destroy the Caretaker's array, which had the ability to send the \"Voyager\" back home from the Delta Quadrant, and carried a small grudge against the captain. Over the first few months, Torres began respecting the captain and her decisions based on Janeway's strong leadership and their shared interest in science.\nShortly after becoming chief engineer, Torres disobeys the captain's orders when \"Voyager\" encounters a race known as the Sikarians. The Sikarians have advanced transporter technology that could drastically shorten their 70-year journey, but Sikarian law prohibits the \"Voyager\" crew from obtaining it legitimately. Torres becomes involved with a small group of officers who obtain the technology on the Sikarian black market and perpetrate a failed attempt to integrate it into \"Voyager\"'s systems.\nTorres, along with Tom Paris, was later kidnapped by the Vidiians. A Vidiian scientist extracts the Klingon DNA from Torres, splicing her into two separate people: one human, one Klingon. He believed the Klingon DNA had a specific biochemical property that could lead to a cure for the , a disease affecting his people. The human Torres is portrayed fraught with fear but having strong technical expertise, while the Klingon Torres is shown as aggressive and impatient. After her escape from the Vidiians the Klingon Torres suffered a fatal wound from the Vidiian energy weapon and died, but the used her DNA to restore the human Torres to her original half-human/half-Klingon state, as her cellular structure needs the Klingon DNA to survive.\nIn the episode \",\" it is revealed that Torres at the time had a romantic interest in Chakotay.\nIn 2373, Torres was the target of telepathically inspired dreams from a member of a race called the Enarans. The dreams were actually memories of a great massacre that took place on the Enaran homeworld and were the elder Enaran's method of making sure that the memory of this massacre lives on, even if in the mind of an alien.\nLater that year, Vulcan engineer Vorik triggered Torres's mating instincts when he forcibly initiated a telepathic bond with her while he is experiencing the \"pon farr\". Torres and Tom Paris later became trapped on a planet together during an , and Torres attempted to get Paris to mate with her, but he resisted. Eventually, Vorik and Torres engaged in ritual battle to purge the blood fever.\nTorres later began a relationship with Paris after a complicated and stormy courtship. During an incident in 2374, Torres confessed her love to him when they were left floating in space in environmental suits, with almost no hope of rescue (\"\"). Although \"Voyager\" was soon able to rescue them, Torres realized that her courage in admitting her love had brought her one step closer to discovering what she considered true honor. Their relationship first flourished on screen during \"\". They married in 2377 and their honeymoon was aboard the \"Delta Flyer.\"\nWhen Torres and Paris conceived their daughter, Miral, in 2377, she learned from that the child would have distinct Klingon cranial ridges as well as other Klingon traits. Torres, remembering painful events from her own childhood, urged the Doctor to perform gene therapy to reduce this phenotype, and even went so far as to reprogram him to do so. Paris and Captain Janeway both disagreed and prevented the Doctor from performing the genetic modifications. When Paris got her to open up, she admitted that she was afraid her husband would find living with two Klingons too difficult and leave her the way her father did. Once he allayed her fears, he admitted wanting even more children just like their mother, and Torres was finally able to enjoy the pregnancy (\"\").\nWhen a group of Klingon radicals spent time aboard \"Voyager\" (\"), Torres began opening herself to more Klingon beliefs and, for the first time since childhood, was able to pray for her grandmother, L'Naal, and her great-grandmother, Krelik. When communications with Earth became available (\"), she reached out to her estranged father, John Torres.\nMiral Paris, named after B'Elanna's mother, was born at the beginning of 2378, during \"Voyager\"'s trip through a Borg transwarp conduit back to the Alpha Quadrant. In an alternate timeline where \"Voyager\" made it home by different means, Miral was shown as an adult serving in Starfleet, with the rank of ensign.\nBirthdate.\nOn September 2, 2014, the official Star Trek website published an archive article with information on the press release for the launch of the series. In the document, which includes character biographies, it confirms that when the series began (2371) \u2013 \"B'Elanna is a beautiful 25-year-old woman who is half-human, half-Klingon...\" This information would then place B'Elanna's birthdate at 2346.\nThe \"Official Star Trek Voyager Companion\" gives further evidence to Torres's age. This is a passage taken from the book: \"B'ELANNA TORRES is a half-Klingon, half-human in her twenties who is frantically working at the consoles of the barely spaceworthy craft...\"\nReception.\nIn March 2019, Syfy rated B'Elanna as the 6th-greatest Klingon of the \"Star Trek\" franchise. In particular, they noted that she was an interesting character in the series, displaying both loyalty to the crew of the starship and brilliance as an engineer.\nIn 2017, \"Screen Rant\" ranked B'Elanna Torres as the 14th-most attractive person in the \"Star Trek\" universe.\nIn 2018, The Wrap ranked B'Elanna Torres as the 35th-best character of \"Star Trek\" overall. CBR ranked B'Elanna as the 14th-best Starfleet character of \"Star Trek\", in 2018. They note that the former Maquis member works as chief engineer on the USS \"Voyager\" spacecraft, and must struggle with her ambivalent emotions about her Klingon heritage while keeping the warp engines working in the Delta quadrant (cutoff from Federation starbases). In addition, CBR opined that the character enhanced other characters aboard the starship, and praised the actress who portrayed her for making B\u2019Elanna Torres's relationships more believable.\nIn 2019, B'Elanna Torres was ranked the 11th-sexiest \"Star Trek\" character by Syfy.\nB\u2019Elanna's struggle to reconcile both sides of her Klingon/Human hybrid heritage has been praised by audiences of multi-ethnic backgrounds.\nIn 2020 \"ScreenRant\" ranked B'Elanna and Tom Paris as the 3rd best romantic couple of all \"Star Trek\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Portrayed by Robert Beltran, he was First Officer aboard the Starfleet starship USS \"Voyager\", and later promoted to captain in command of the \"USS Protostar\" in '. The character was suggested at an early stage of the development of the series. He is the first Native American main character in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. This was a deliberate move by the producers of the series, who sought to inspire minorities - specifically Native Americans - as was intended with Uhura in \"\" for African Americans. To develop the character, the producers sought the assistance of Jamake Highwater, who falsely claimed to be Native American. Despite first being named by producers as Sioux, and later Hopi, Chakotay was given no tribal affiliation at the start of the series, and eventually was assigned ancestry with a fictional tribe in the episode \"\u201d. It wasn't until his appearance in \"Star Trek: Prodigy\" that he was formally identified as a descendant of the Nicarao people of Central America.\nThe character first appeared in the pilot episode of the series, \". Chakotay continued to appear throughout the series in a main cast role, with his final appearance in the finale, \". He was featured in an ongoing storyline throughout the and seasons, which featured the betrayal of his former lover Seska (Martha Hackett) until her death in \". Following his experience with disconnected Borg in \", Chakotay was against an alliance with the Borg in \"\", nearly leading to the death of Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Despite this, by the end of the series, the two characters were in a romantic relationship. In the set after the vessel's return to the Alpha Quadrant, Chakotay is promoted to captain of the ship, but the relationship with Seven has ended.\nReviewers of Chakotay were critical of the stereotypical nature of Chakotay's Native American heritage. This led to comparisons with Tonto from \"The Lone Ranger\", and that the inclusion of \"Hollywood\" versions of vision quests and meditation techniques were contrary to the character's in-universe tribal background. However, he was praised as a role model for Native American science fiction and called \"ground-breaking\", as well as the most prominent example of a Native American character within this genre.\nConcept and development.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs a leader, he is steady, fearless, and capable of inspiring absolute devotion. Though he comes onto \"Voyager\" more by necessity than choice, he quickly wins the respect of even the most die-hard Starfleet veterans. He strikes an immediate and powerful bond with Janeway, and an unusual one with Kim, who through Chakotay's example begins to question his own homogenization and the loss of his traditional values.\n Rick Berman, Michael Piller, Jeri Taylor, Chakotay's description, \"Star Trek: Voyager Bible\", 1995\nThe inclusion of a Native American character in \"Star Trek: Voyager\" was suggested at an early stage in the development of the series. The producers were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise. It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of Uhura in \"\" later inspired Whoopi Goldberg and other African Americans. Executive producer Jeri Taylor said: \"It seemed to us that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost\u00a0... the future looks good, you have purpose, you have worth, you have value, you will be leaders, you will be powerful. That was one character choice we had early on.\" Taylor's notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as \"First Officer \u2013 a human native American male, a 'Queequeg' person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet. A mystical, mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection, not explained.\" A month later, this description was expanded with the line, \"This man has made another choice \u2013 to re-enter the world of Starfleet.\" Chakotay was not the first Native American character to appear in the franchise, with \"The Paradise Syndrome\" in the of \"Star Trek: The Original Series\" showing a group of displaced humans following a Native American\u2013like culture.\nThe producers aimed to develop some conflict between the members of the crew to produce a scenario similar to the Bajoran / Starfleet relationship seen in ', but wanted the characters to share the same ideals. To do this, the Maquis were created \u2013 a group of Federation colonists from the Cardassian border in a disputed territory who were joined by some Starfleet officers who joined them to fight for their rights. The producers had the Maquis introduced in other \"Star Trek\" series before \"Voyager\" in four episodes; two in ' and two in \"Deep Space Nine\". It was a deliberate reference to the political situation in the West Bank.\nIn developing Chakotay, the producers sought the assistance of Jamake Highwater, a writer of more than 25 books of both fiction and non-fiction related to Native American myths and traditions. Highwater was a controversial choice of advisor, having been exposed by Hank Adams and Vine Deloria, Jr. as taking a fake Native American ancestry to sell books. Around September 21, 1993, Highwater gave seven pages of notes to producers regarding Chakotay's backstory, but his tribal ancestry was unresolved. By the end of that month, Michael Piller drafted the first version of the writer's bible for the series in which the character was named \"Chakotoy\". By the time Piller wrote the first draft of the story that eventually became the \"Voyager\" pilot \"\", the character was known as \"Chakotay\" and been made a Sioux. By the third draft of the story, submitted at the start of November, he had become a Hopi, but by the following February, he once again had no tribal affiliation.\nWinrich Kolbe, the director of \"Caretaker\", was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans who were in the Screen Actors Guild. The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on Robert Beltran, who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera \"Models Inc.\" and was of Mexican heritage. Beltran was not familiar with \"Star Trek\" before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the \"Caretaker\" script which showed the character becoming the second in command of \"Voyager\" after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant. Beltran explained the audition experience: \"I felt neutral about the audition, didn't much care one way or the other. I went in the first time and wasn't really trying to get the part. They asked to see me again, and they wanted to see more of an edge to the character.\"\nChakotay was originally written as a \"calm, stoic\" character, but Beltran expanded on the character during the audition process, something that Kolbe credited him for. The writer's bible described Chakotay as a very traditional Native American with an altar and traditional art in his quarters. It also mentioned his spirit guide, something which was picked up in the media report in \"TV Guide\". Beltran wore a facial tattoo while playing Chakotay, which was applied with make-up. The design was created by Michael Westmore, who deliberately created it so it did not represent any particular tribal culture. The in-universe story of the tattoo and Chakotay's tribal origins were explained in the episode \"\".\nBeltran gained the reputation on-set as a comedian. Following the and during a group interview with \"The Washington Times\", Beltran joked that he was asked to perform in \"Hamlet\" during the summer in Albuquerque, but had been asked to wear Chakotay's facial tattoo. During that time, he worked on the Oliver Stone film \"Nixon\" (1995). During the period when \"Voyager\" was run by Taylor and Piller as the executive producers, Beltran gave feedback on the character which was taken into account. He later explained that this ended following the introduction of Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine onto the cast and Brannon Braga taking over from Taylor and Piller. Beltran felt that Chakotay was one of the characters alongside Harry Kim, Tuvok, and Neelix who were left behind by the new writers, who tended to concentrate on Janeway, Seven, and .\nBeltran said that he was not aware of the effects this was having on the rest of the cast, saying: \"For me it was like, 'OK, you can fire me if you want to. Go ahead, and I'll leave.'\" He compared his experience on \"Voyager\" to working in a car factory, and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity. Beltran explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors, and in the end, he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make \"very much difference, except to a very, very small percentage of fans who maybe didn't like what I said.\"\nIn an interview to publicize the final episode of \"Voyager\", \"Endgame\", Beltran said: \"We all had a great relationship with each other and we've all said how much we enjoy our crew. We have a terrific crew. But at the same time, I'm looking forward to what's next. It's exciting to know that something unknown is next.\" The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and Chakotay. Ryan found this relationship confusing for the characters, as although it had been suggested in the episode \"\", in the intervening episodes, the producers had told her and Beltran to ignore it.\nAppearances.\nBackground.\nChakotay's backstory was explained during the course of \"Star Trek: Voyager\". He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone. While young, he was looked after by his grandfather. At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribe's ancestral home in Central America and the descendants of the Rubber Tree People. He was resistant to this, and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century. He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father's wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu.[A] He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on Ktaria VII, and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.\nHe was assigned as an instructor in Starfleet's Advanced Tactical Training and achieved the rank of lieutenant commander. Following the death of his father in 2368 while defending his colony from the Cardassians, Chakotay resigned his Starfleet commission and joined the Maquis. At the time of his resignation, one of his students was Ro Laren. After he joined the Maquis, he became captain of a vessel named the \"Val Jean\", with a crew which among others included his lover Seska (Martha Hackett), B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and Tuvok (Tim Russ), who was actually Captain Janeway's Chief of Security, on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Maquis.\n\"Star Trek: Voyager\".\nThe Kazon and Seska.\nIn the pilot episode of \"Voyager\", while the crew on the \"Val Jean\" seek to evade a Cardassian vessel captained by Gul Evek (Richard Poe) in the Badlands, the vessel is transported some 70,000 light years across the galaxy into the Delta Quadrant by the creature known as the Caretaker. After the Federation starship USS \"Voyager\" is also trapped in the Delta Quadrant and Tuvok was revealed to be a Starfleet agent, Chakotay agrees with Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to work together to find two of their missing crew. Following an attack by the Kazon, Chakotay destroyed the \"Val Jean\" to save \"Voyager\" and the Maquis crew joined the Federation ship. Chakotay was given a provisional rank of commander and named executive officer, the second-in-command of the vessel and the crew seeks to return home to the Alpha Quadrant.\nThe Kazon continue to be a hindrance during \"Voyager\"'s initial period in the Delta Quadrant, with Chakotay dismayed in \"State of Flux\" when Seska is revealed as a Cardassian spy who has been providing technology to the Kazon to seek an alliance. She escapes \"Voyager\" and sides with the Kazon-Nistrim, one of the factions within that species. Chakotay is rendered brain dead, but is made into a disembodied spirit able to possess other crewmembers in \"\". The incident occurs while Tuvok and he were investigating a dark matter nebula, and he sought to prevent the ship from returning there, as an alien species wants to feed on the crew's neural energy. After \"Voyager\" enters the nebula, Chakotay possesses Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and guides the ship out using a medicine wheel as a map. Shortly afterwards, The Doctor (Robert Picardo) is able to restore Chakotay's mind into his body. At the end of the first season, Chakotay supported Tuvok's aim of helping the former Maquis crew adapt better to life on \"Voyager\" in \"\", by showing them the enforcement techniques of the Maquis.\nIn the episode \"Tattoo\", Chakotay meets with an alien race who influenced the ancestors of his tribe. They perceived \"Voyager\" as a threat because they had thought his people had been wiped out. He was able to resolve the problem using the teachings of his father. The Kazon returned and attacked \"Voyager\" in \"\", where they stole a transporter control module. Chakotay took it upon himself to retrieve the device, recognising that Seska was behind it. He managed to destroy it, but was captured and tortured by the Kazon in the process. He was rescued by \"Voyager\", and shortly afterwards, he was contacted by Seska, who informed him that she had impregnated herself with his DNA. In \"\", Chakotay and Janeway are infected with a virus which requires them to quarantine themselves on a nearby planet. The two began to show signs of affection for each other, but their stay is short-lived after \"Voyager\" under the captaincy of Tuvok agrees a deal with the Vidiians for a cure. The pair agree to return to the status quo on \"Voyager\", but remain good friends.\nChakotay was contacted by Seska in \"\" to say that his son had been born, and the Kazon were threatening to condemn her to the life of a slave. \"Voyager\" attempted to extract Seska and the child, but it was a trap and resulted in the Kazon boarding the vessel and stranding the Federation/Maquis crew on a nearby planet. While Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeil), The Doctor, and Lon Suder (Brad Dourif), along with allied Talaxian forces, sought to retake \"Voyager\", Chakotay was instrumental in the crew's survival on the planet. He saved Kes (Jennifer Lien) from a local tribe, and built an alliance with them. The crew retook \"Voyager\", and in the process Seska was killed. The child was discovered not to be Chakotay's, but instead a Cardassian/Kazon hybrid and the son of the Kazon-Nistrim leader First Maje Culluh (Anthony De Longis).\nEntering Borg space.\nThe first indication that \"Voyager\" was approaching Borg space was shown in the episode \"\". While investigating a Federation distress call in a shuttlecraft, Chakotay was injured by the natives of a planet. Another group saves him, and Chakotay discovers that the colonists are former Borg whose access to the main hive-mind was disrupted. He is linked to a local hive-mind to help him to heal, and after being returned to \"Voyager\", he is forced against his will to reactivate the colonists' former Borg Cube. Chakotay is released from the new \"cooperative\" after the Cube self-destructs, leaving the planet with a hive-mind separate from the main collective. Chakotay is captured by the Voth scientist Gegen (Henry Woronicz) in \"Distant Origin\", who is seeking to prove his hypothesis that the Voth came from Earth. When Gegen is placed on trial by his people, Chakotay seeks to argue in his defense. Ultimately, Gegen is forced to back down to save \"Voyager\" after the Voth threaten to destroy the vessel. Before they depart, Chakotay gives a model globe of the Earth to Gegen as a present.\nHis experience with the disconnected Borg resulted in Chakotay being against a plan to ally with the Borg against Species 8472 in \"\", causing conflict between Captain Janeway and him. The alliance results in Seven of Nine and a number of other Borg drones being placed on \"Voyager\" and Janeway injured. Although he was ordered to continue with the alliance, Chakotay seeks to renegotiate the alliance, but Seven refuses any changes. When she opens a rift to Fluidic Space, Chakotay decompresses the cargo bay, sending all the Borg drones out into space with the exception of Seven. Later, when the Borg attempt to double-cross \"Voyager\", Chakotay activates his localised neural link, confusing Seven and allowing Torres to disable her link to the Collective permanently.\nChakotay played an important role when \"Voyager\" was attacked in their dreams by a species that existed in a shared dream state, using meditative techniques of his people to induce a state of lucid dreaming that allowed him to wake himself up and plant a mental \"command\" that he would see Earth's moon in any dream. With the rest of the crew asleep with the exception of the Doctor, Chakotay was able to track down the aliens' home planet, ordering the Doctor to destroy the canyon where the dream species slept if they would not release the rest of the crew. During the \"Year of Hell\", Chakotay is captured by the Krenim scientist Annorax (Kurtwood Smith) on a Time Ship. The two first attempt to work together as Annorax agrees to restore the now damaged \"Voyager\" if Chakotay complies with his demands. After Annorax wipes out a species, though, he helps to disable the ship, allowing Captain Janeway to destroy it by ramming \"Voyager\" into it. This results in the timeline being reset, and the events of the episode were undone. In \"\", he falls in love with Kellin (Virginia Madsen), a member of a xenophobic race who have developed a technology to prevent others from forming long-term memories of them. As such, he is informed that they were previously in love when she was on \"Voyager\" a month earlier, and rekindle their relationship despite Chakotay not remembering the earlier encounter. Another member of her race removes Kellin's memories of Chakotay and installs a virus to remove all records of their race. Chakotay takes to writing out his memories of Kellin on paper so that he will not forget them.\nHe was placed in command of \"Voyager\" after Seven was captured by the Borg in \"Dark Frontier\" and destroyed a transwarp conduit. Chakotay is later one of the members of the crew who were captured by Borg children in \"\" and was saved after Seven's intervention. Initially, Chakotay and Seven did not get along, but he would come to realise that he was mistaken in that opinion. Towards the end of the in \"Human Error\", Seven simulates a relationship with Chakotay on the holodeck. A Borg implant was preventing her from feeling strong emotions without any physical ill effects, which prevented her from seeking a romantic relationship with the real Chakotay. By the time of the series finale, \"Endgame\", The Doctor had managed to remove the implant, allowing Seven to pursue a relationship with Chakotay. The alternative future seen at the start of the episode showed that Seven and Chakotay were eventually married, but she died while \"Voyager\" was still travelling home. Chakotay died in 2394, following \"Voyager\"'s return, and Admiral Janeway visits his grave marker in that episode. This future was undone by the future Janeway travelling back in time to \"Voyager\" to return it to Earth sooner.\n\"Star Trek: Prodigy\".\nSometime prior to 2383, Chakotay was named Captain of the USS \"Protostar\" and was in command when the ship was taken by the Vau N'Akat. Chakotay's mission was to continue exploration of the Delta Quadrant after \"Voyager's\" return, but his ship fell through a time rift into the future where it was captured by the Vau N'Akat who blamed the Federation for the destruction of their home planet in a civil war. The Vau N'Akat attempted to use the \"Protostar\" to send a weapon called a living construct back in time to destroy the Federation, but Chakotay and his first officer Adreek-Hu managed to launch themselves with the weapon on board, forcing the Vau N'Akat to chase after it. At the end of the first season, following the destruction of the \"Protostar\", a new temporal rift is opened through which Starfleet receives a distress call from Chakotay 52 years into the future.\nIn the second season, Janeway leads a rescue mission for Chakotay with her cadets, who were the ones to find and crew the \"Protostar\" after it was sent back in time, traveling into the future with the plan to help Chakotay and Adreek to launch the ship and then to rescue them. However, they accidentally change history, allowing Chakotay and Adreek to escape with their ship through the rift, sending it elsewhere and creating a temporal paradox that starts destroying the universe. With the help of Wesley Crusher, the cadets eventually find Chakotay in the present where he has been marooned for ten years on another planet, becoming a broken man following the loss of his crew and hope. The cadets manage to reignite Chakotay's spirit and help him to repair the \"Protostar\" and escape, reuniting with the \"Voyager\"-A and Janeway. With the universe still in danger from the paradox and Ascencia, the last of the hostile Vau N'Akat from the future, Janeway, Chakotay, and the cadets embark upon a mission to launch the \"Protostar\" into the past where it will be found by the younger selves of the cadets, repairing the timeline. Returning to Starfleet, Chakotay becomes the new captain of the \"Voyager\"-A before Mars is destroyed by rogue synths, changing everything for the Federation. Alongside Janeway and the Doctor, Chakotay gives the cadets field commissions as ensigns and the new \"Protostar\"-class ship, the USS \"Prodigy\", which has been turned into a training ship. During their time together, Chakotay becomes a mentor to Dal R'El who expresses doubts about his future after seeing that he won't be the captain. Chakotay explains to Dal that he struggled all of his life to find a place where he belonged before becoming \"Voyager's\" first officer. While Chakotay wasn't the captain, being the loyal support of Janeway instead was where he finally found his purpose. Dal later takes this to heart, giving the captain's chair to Gwyn and serving as the first officer of the \"Prodigy\" instead.\nReception.\nSome criticism was directed at Chakotay's character development during the series. James Lileks for the \"Star Tribune\" said that \"Chakotay, the rock-solid First Officer, remained rock-solid\", but also suggested that \"[a]ll of the characters ended the series as they began.\"\nCritics commented on the relationship between Janeway and Chakotay, with psychologist Richard Borofsky's views published in \"The Boston Herald\". He suggested that by several seasons into \"Voyager\", Chakotay had come to terms with his feelings for his Captain, but she was hesitant about entering into a relationship with a member of her crew. For the relationship to work in the future, it was said that Chakotay should not try to lead the relationship and Janeway needed to be more vulnerable. Following the end of \"\", the romance between Chakotay and Janeway was described in the \"Chicago Tribune\" as the one most wanted to be seen on screen in any of the \"Star Trek\" series, but that \"it never panned out. Dang!\" Chakotay's relationship with Seven was also commented on, and both UGO and io9 complained that the relationship appeared at random.\nIn 2016 Chakotay was ranked as the eleventh most important character out of 100 of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" science fiction universe by \"Wired\" magazine. In 2018, CBR ranked Chakotay the 20th best Starfleet character of \"Star Trek\". In July 2019, \"Screen Rant\" ranked \"\" as one of the top five worst of the series, singling out Chakotay as a major problem in the show noting how he did not really fit in, and had poor development.\nFor his portrayal as Chakotay, Beltran won the Nosotros Golden Eagle Award for Outstanding Actor in a Television Series in 1997. He was nominated in 1996 for the NCLR Bravo Award for Outstanding Television Series Actor in a Crossover Role, and the ALMA Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Television Series in a Crossover Role in 1998 and 1999.\nThemes.\nChakotay's inclusion in the main cast of \"Voyager\" was seen by critics as one of several who were used to highlight the diversity within the series. This was highlighted during the episode \"\", in which one scene showed Janeway, Tuvok, Harry Kim, and Chakotay in a single camera pan. Beltran's individual position was that he was \"continually positioned as an exotic native other in relation to the white female Captain Janeway\", and was used to \"help the white protagonist and progress the internal narrative.\"\nThe placement of a character of indigenous peoples descent in science fiction was highlighted in the media. Drew Hayden Taylor said that Chakotay was \"perhaps the most well-known\". Of Chakotay's origin, he said: \"They never actually say what nation he is, but I do believe it's some Central American tribe.\" Hayden Taylor wrote in a later article in 2012 describing the rise of Native American characters in the \"Twilight\" film series that Chakotay was still the sole popular example of a Native American character in science fiction. Chakotay was also described as \"the only First Nations role model around in a futuristic setting\" in the 2005 book, \"\"Indian\" Stereotypes in TV Science Fiction: First Nations' Voices Speak Out\", but was also referred to as the \"quintessential Tonto in outer space\". A similar criticism was highlighted of the character in \"Medicine Bags and Dog Tags: American Indian Veterans from Colonial Times to the Second Iraq War\" (2008), which called Chakotay \"a creature of white fantasies\" and suggested that he was \"far more stereotypical than Tonto\" as \"at least Tonto was heroic and saved the Lone Ranger once in a while\".\nAlthough religion was referenced during the \"Star Trek\" franchise, such as in the \"Star Trek: The Original Series\" episode \"Who Mourns for Adonais?\", it did not take a more prominent role until later in the series, with \"\" exploring the Bajorans' beliefs and \"Voyager\" concentrating on those of Chakotay. These included vision quests, and other interpretations of Native American culture which were described by critics as showing a \"very Hollywood version of Plains-culture religion\".\nThe appearance of a medicine wheel in the episode \"Cathexis\" was described by Sierra S. Adare as showing Chakotay as a \"'good Indian' in the classic Pocahontas sense\". Chakotay is seen attempting to introduce rituals and meditation techniques to other crew members, something they failed to understand. These were said to be contrary to the tribal history described in \"Tattoo\", which was said to say that Chakotay's tribe descended from a pre-Mayan culture in Central America. Adare attributed this to Euro-American/European writers writing inaccurate information into scripts. However, the appearance of the character was described as \"groundbreaking\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27086", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27086", "title": "Maquis (Star Trek)", "text": "Fictional terrorist organisation\nIn the \"Star Trek\" science-fiction franchise, the Maquis are a 24th-century paramilitary organization-terrorist group (like the World War II Maquis in the French Resistance and the Spanish Maquis that emerged in the Spanish Civil War). The group is introduced in the two-part episode \" of the television series ', building on a plot foundation introduced in the episode \" of '; they appear in later episodes of those two series as well as \"\". The Maquis story debuted when three \"Star Trek\" television shows running from 1987 to 2001 took place in the same fictional science-fiction universe at the same time in the future (the 2360s\u20132370s). As a result, the Maquis story was told across several episodes in all three shows. The Maquis are especially prominent in \"Star Trek: Voyager\", whose premise is that a Starfleet crew and a Maquis crew are stranded together on the opposite side of the Galaxy.\nThe Maquis are also featured in the comic book saga \"\" by Malibu Comics, who held the rights to \"Deep Space Nine\" comics in the 1990s, and in the book series \"The Badlands\" by Susan Wright.\nConcept.\nThe concept of the Maquis was introduced by the creators of \"The Next Generation\" so that it could play a role in the upcoming \"Voyager\", which was scheduled to begin airing in 1995. As Jeri Taylor commented, \"We knew that we wanted to include a renegade element in \"Voyager\", and that the show would involve a ship housing both Starfleet people and those idealistic freedom fighters that the Federation felt were outlaws [i.e., the Maquis].\" Therefore, the creators of \"Star Trek\" decided to create a backstory for the Maquis in several episodes of \"Deep Space Nine\" and \"The Next Generation\", and named them after the French guerrilla fighters of the Second World War. The recurring characters of Michael Eddington (Kenneth Marshall) in \"Deep Space Nine\" and Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) in \"The Next Generation\" became members of the Maquis, and \"Voyager\" contained regular former Maquis characters such as Chakotay (Robert Beltran) and B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), as well as recurring characters such as Seska (Martha Hackett). While the book by Erdmann links the Maquis to the French Maquis, their history seems to more closely resemble the Spanish Maquis.\nIn \"Caretaker\", the pilot episode of \"Star Trek: Voyager\", the titular starship pursues a Maquis ship into the Badlands before being teleported to the Delta Quadrant.\nStoryline.\nAccording to the fictional storyline of the \"Star Trek\" universe, the Maquis were formed in the 24th century after a peace treaty was enacted between the United Federation of Planets and the Cardassian Union, redesignating the demilitarized zone between the two powers, which resulted in the Federation ceding several of their colony worlds to the Cardassians. Although the colonists were offered free relocation to elsewhere in Federation territory, some insisted on remaining on the ceded worlds; effectively becoming subject to the Cardassian Union, which behaves aggressively towards them. Some of these colonists subsequently formed the Maquis to protect themselves from Cardassian aggression, due to a lack of official support from the Federation; who feared breaking the peace treaty with the Cardassians, which would lead to war.\nNonetheless, various Federation members supported the Maquis' cause, and illegally supplied them with weapons and other technology that they could use in their struggle. In several cases, the Federation actually intervened in the war between the Maquis and the Cardassians, aiding the latter in recognition of the peace treaty. In one case, the Federation ship tracked a Maquis vessel to the Badlands with the intention of apprehending it, but an alien force transported both to the Delta Quadrant on the opposite side of the Milky Way Galaxy. The two crews were forced to unite to survive against alien threats such as the Kazon and the Borg. In later years, when the Cardassians joined the Dominion to fight in the Dominion War against the Federation, the Dominion aided the Cardassian military in wiping out the Maquis; a prelude to their war against the Federation and its allies.\nThe Maquis provide moral challenges to existing characters such as Quark and Sisko on Deep Space Nine. Quark is lured into selling weapons to the Maquis by an attractive Vulcan woman, showing how his desire for money unwittingly turned him into an illegal-arms dealer. Sisko must navigate the internal politics of the Cardassians and Federation as he tries to uphold the peace treaty, in addition to being tested by his old friend trying to recruit him into the rebellion.\nEpisodes.\nCardassians were introduced on \"Star Trek The Next Generation\" in January 1991 with the episode \", which lays some of the foundation for the Federation settlements on the Cardassian border. \" aired in October 1991 introducing the experiences of living in Cardassian-occupied space. \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" premiered in January 1993 and is primarily set within former Cardassian-occupied space. \"The Next Generation\"'s \"\" aired in March 1994 and introduced the results of the Federation-Cardassian peace treaty and establishment of a new demilitarized zone with Federation colonists in Cardassian territory. The Maquis were then formally introduced one month later on \"Deep Space Nine\"'s two-part episode \"\" and would then be the focus of many episodes of the franchise.\nThe episode \"Learning Curve\" used the different operating styles of Maquis and Federation as a plot point when some Maquis were taken aboard as crew on a Federation starship.\nCharacters.\nVarious members of the Maquis are characters in \"TNG\", \"DS9\", and \"Voyager\", although membership is sometimes transitory and as revealed by the Maquis saga, for example some are revealed as Federation agents. The reveal of a character's identity is common plot device throughout the story line. Many episodes play on these questions.\nFictional spacecraft.\nIn the \"Star Trek\" science fiction franchise, the Maquis are known to use a diverse mix of older spacecraft from the United Federation of Planets. Three aspects are that the spacecraft are older, as much as several decades, there are a variety of types in service, and finally, they tend to be of Federation design. Although the spacecraft are old, the Maquis are known to upgrade them with advanced weaponry to take on larger Cardassian vessels such as the \"Galor\" class.\nThe Maquis Fighter seen in the DS9 episodes (\"The Maquis\" I &amp; II) was designed by Jim Martin and the model for the special effect shots was built by Tony Meinenger. The fighter/transport used by Ro was also designed by Jim Martin, but that model was built by Greg Jein.\nIn 2006, the miniature model of the Maquis raider from \"The Maquis, Part II\" went for 10,800 USD at auction.\nReception.\nAn example of a review of Maquis episode was in 2016; \"USA Today\" the episode \"The Maquis\" as a must-watch for the entire \"Star Trek\" franchise for its introduction of the Maquis story, which would also be an element in \"Star Trek: Voyager\". They note the interesting science fiction story elements of the Federation, Cardassians, Maquis, and Bajorans playing off one another to create complex themes centered around the fictional space station Deep Space Nine.\nBroadcast and releases.\nEpisodes featuring the Maquis were distributed in many ways because the story was spread out across multiple series. For instance, \"Star Trek : Deep Space Nine\" was broadcast in syndication, while \"Star Trek: Voyager\" was on the UPN network. Home Video Releases of the television episodes include an array of LaserDisc, VHS, and DVD titles. Relevant \"Star Trek: Trek The Next Generation\" titles were also released on Blu-Ray disc in HD.\nFor example, the two part episode \"The Maquis\" was released in two separate LaserDisc releases in the United States. A double episode 12 inch optical disc with \"Blood Oath\" and \"The Maquis, Part I\" was released on October 6, 1998, in the United States. Another item with \"The Maquis, Part II\" and \"The Wire\" was released on October 20, 1998.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kes joins the crew in the pilot episode \"\", opening an aeroponics garden and working as the medical assistant to the artificial intelligence known as . She is a member of a telepathic alien species known as the Ocampa, who have latent psychic abilities and a lifespan of only nine years. Her storylines focus on encouraging the Doctor to develop his humanity and dealing with her Talaxian boyfriend Neelix's jealousy. She also seeks to expand upon her mental capabilities, leaving in the after her powers threaten to destroy the ship. She reappears in a episode and features in .\n\"Voyager\"'s creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor designed Kes to be a rapidly aging character who would provide audiences with a different perspective on time. Although Kes is portrayed as fragile and innocent, she is also shown as having hidden strength and maturity. \"Voyager\"'s producers reluctantly fired Lien after her personal issues affected her reliability on set. At the time, this was not openly discussed, and her departure was attributed to other reasons; these ranged from Lien voluntarily leaving to pursue other roles to her being removed to make room for Jeri Ryan's introduction as Seven of Nine.\nKes was a fan-favorite character while \"Voyager\" was airing, although critics reacted more negatively, finding the character boring and without a clear purpose. Lien was praised for her performance, which was highlighted in reviews of individual episodes. Kes's age was the subject of critical discussion, questioning if she was too young to be dating Neelix. Lien's removal from \"Voyager\" received mixed reviews from critics; some preferred the addition of Seven of Nine, while others were disappointed by this casting change. Reviewers and fans disliked her return in the season-six episode \"\", which some media outlets called one of the worst moments in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. Academics have analyzed Kes's representation of femininity, her relationship with Captain Kathryn Janeway, and her mental abilities.\nAppearances.\nBackground and introduction.\nIntroduced in \"\"'s pilot episode \"\", Kes is an Ocampa\u2014a telepathic alien species with latent psychic abilities and a lifespan of nine years. She was born and raised on the Ocampa home world in an underground city, which was constructed by an alien known as the Caretaker after he inadvertently destroyed the planet's atmosphere. The Ocampa have grown dependent on his care. The Caretaker realizes he is dying and abducts beings from across the galaxy, including the Starfleet crew of the starship USS \"Voyager\". He does this to find a compatible mate to produce an offspring who would continue caring for the Ocampa.\nKes dreams of exploring the galaxy and finds a way out of the city, but is captured and tortured by the Kazon. She is rescued by her Talaxian boyfriend Neelix who is assisted by \"Voyager\" captain Kathryn Janeway and her crew. When the Kazon attack and attempt to steal the Caretaker's technology, Janeway orders the destruction of his vessel. Stranded in the Delta Quadrant, she agrees to have Kes and Neelix remain on \"Voyager\".\nOn \"Star Trek: Voyager\".\nAboard \"Voyager\", Kes starts an aeroponics garden to provide produce to the crew. While working as a medical assistant for , an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram, she encourages him to develop his social skills and the crew to recognize him as more than a machine. The Vidiians harvest Neelix's lungs in \", and Kes donates one of her own to him. In \", emanations from space-dwelling lifeforms cause Kes to prematurely enter a fertile period. An Ocampa goes through this process only once and it is her only time to have a child. After discussions, Neelix agrees to be a father, but Kes decides against having a child. When \"Voyager\" moves away from the aliens, the Doctor determines Kes had a false alarm and would be able to conceive in the future. Neelix grows more paranoid regarding \"Voyager\"'s helmsman Tom Paris and his interest in Kes, such as in \"; the two resolve this tension in \" during an away mission.\nWhen \"Voyager\" discovers an Ocampa colony in \", its leader Tanis teaches Kes psychokinesis. Prior to this, Security Chief Tuvok had been training Kes. She uses her abilities in earlier episodes, including having visions of a planet's destruction in \" and showing an eidetic memory in \"\". Unable to control her psychokinesis abilities, she destroys the aeroponics garden and nearly kills Tuvok by boiling his blood. The crew discovers that Tanis is working with the Caretaker's mate, Suspiria, to destroy \"Voyager\", but Kes subdues him with her powers. In \"\", Tiernan, a former dictator of the planet Illari, possesses Kes and uses her abilities to stage a coup on the new leader. Under his influence, Kes breaks up with Neelix. Although \"Voyager\" frees Kes from Tieran's control and kills him, the experience traumatizes her.\nIn \"\", Kes is attracted to Zahir, a member of an alien species of explorers, and considers temporarily joining his journey. The Doctor injures Zahir and kidnaps Kes after developing an evil alter ego while grafting new personalities into his program. After the Doctor is returned to normal, Kes decides to remain on \"Voyager\". Throughout \", Kes lives short periods of her life in reverse order, from her death to her conception, as part of an alternative timeline. During \", Kes becomes telepathically connected with Species 8472, who are at war with the Borg.\nKes's powers advance at an exponential rate in \"\" to the point that she can no longer stay aboard \"Voyager\", as they threaten to destroy the ship. Leaving on a shuttlecraft, she hurls \"Voyager\" and its crew safely beyond Borg space, roughly 10,000 light-years closer to Earth, before turning into living energy. In \"\", Kes is unable to control her evolving mental abilities, and she fears that she would not be accepted by other Ocampa. She blames these changes on Janeway for allowing her to join \"Voyager\". Breaking into \"Voyager\", she travels back in time to negotiate with the Vidiians to take her younger self back to the Ocampa home world. The younger Kes makes a hologram to remind her future self about her love for the crew. This message encourages the older Kes to return to Ocampa.\nOther appearances.\nIn 1995, Pocket Books began publishing set during the show's run and after its . Kes appears in the 1995 novelization of \"Caretaker\" by L. A. Graf and the 1996 book for \"\" by Diane Carey. Nathan Archer began writing the 1995 book \"Ragnorak\", before the pilot episode aired and said that his interpretation of Kes, based on the series bible, was radically different from her depiction in the show. In Greg Cox's 1997 novel, \"The Black Shore\", Kes has horrific visions after the crew takes shore leave on a seemingly idyllic planet. Cox included scenes between Kes and Chief Engineer B'Elanna Torres after reading an interview in which actor Roxann Dawson, who portrays Torres, talked about how the characters rarely interacted. \"Marooned\", published in the same year, focuses on Kes being kidnapped by a space pirate; the author Christie Golden said that she wanted to explore how Kes would appear to an alien with a lifespan of thousands of years.\nKes appears in stories published after \"Voyager\" ended. She goes back in time to help create an Ocampa and Nacene hybrid in the \"String Theory\" trilogy (2005\u20132006) by Jeffrey Lang, Kirsten Beyer, and Heather Jarman. The book describes the Kes from \"Fury\" as the \"manifestation of her dark side\" made as a byproduct of this time travel. Jarman used \"Evolution\" to explore questions she had with \"Voyager\", such as how Neelix felt about Kes after her departure and what the Ocampa home world looked like in the past. In Beyer's 2012 book, \"The Eternal Tide\", Kes helps to resurrect a dead Janeway.\nKes is also depicted in short stories, like Penny A. Proctor's \"Restoration\" from the 2002 anthology in which she revives Ocampa's ecosystem. She is included in three stories from the 2005 collection \"Distant Shores\". In Kim Sheard's \"Winds of Change\", Kes struggles with aggression after \"Warlord\" and asks Torres for advice. Sheard developed the concept after being told the anthology would focus on unusual character combinations. \"Closure\" is about Neelix seeing Kes after being caught in a cave-in with former Borg drone Seven of Nine. The author James Swallow was inspired by how Ethan Phillips, who plays Neelix, wanted closure for his character's relationship with Kes. In \"Brief Candle\", Neelix talks about one of his memories with Kes; the writer Christopher L. Bennett said she was one of his favorite \"Voyager\" characters.\nDevelopment.\nCreation and casting.\nKes was one of the first nine characters that ' creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor developed for the crew of the USS \"Voyager\" starship. Inspired by the ' episode \", Berman, Piller, and Taylor wanted to feature a rapidly-aging character to encourage viewers to reflect on time. Early in production, they nicknamed Kes the Mayfly to reference her short lifespan. She was set to age a year at the midpoint of each season to emphasize this rapid age progression.\nIn initial descriptions, Kes was characterized as a potential scout and expert on gangs, but was later changed to be a medical intern, while Neelix assumed a similar role as a guide. When Berman, Piller, and Taylor wrote Kes with psychic powers, production assistant Zayra Cabot hired a paranormal-focused consulting firm, Joan Pearce Research Associates. Joan Pearce created a list of psi abilities, which was used to decide that Kes would be shown with limited telepathy in the pilot episode (\") with further exploration of her power planned for later episodes.\nEarly in \"Voyager\"'s development, it was undetermined if Kes would be female, male, or androgynous. \"Caretaker\" director Winrich Kolbe wanted an actress who \"could be fragile but with a steely will underneath\". Jennifer Lien was an \"early selection\" for the role; Taylor said that she had \"this wonderful elfin quality\" and projected vulnerability and strength in her audition. Lien was unfamiliar with the \"Star Trek\" franchise, and at the age of 19, she was the youngest actor on the show. Jennifer Gatti had also been considered for the role, and would later guest star in the episode \"\".\nFor the pilot, Robert Blackman designed Kes's wardrobe and Michael Westmore created her prosthetic ears. Blackman had difficulty dressing Lien as \"Voyager\"'s producers were unclear on her character's direction. His initial design was for a pastel-colored costume inspired by a sprite; producers rejected it, instead suggesting a costume similar to Peter Pan's. The final look was partially modeled on Joan of Arc. Kes's wardrobe primarily consisted of tunics, and Lien wore a short blonde wig. Lien tested combinations of wigs and prosthetics, which cinematographer Marvin V. Rush filmed for Berman's final approval. Westmore kept the prosthetic simple to facilitate working on 30 Ocampa characters for the pilot episode. Lien said the ear prosthetics impaired her hearing, and she developed an allergic response to them as the series progressed. Starting with the episode \"\", Lien no longer wore the prosthetics and used her longer hair to cover her ears and hide this change; around this point, her costumes also transitioned to tighter jumpsuits.\nCharacterization and relationships.\nIn \"Voyager\"'s series bible, Kes is characterized as \"an innocent who sees humanity through a fresh perspective\" and as \"delicate, beautiful, [and] young\". The \"Caretaker\" script describes her as a \"dazzling, ethereal beauty, waifish and fragile\" who has a \"dignity to her bearing, an alertness in her look, that suggests a being of powerful intelligence\". While promoting \"Voyager\", Lien said that Kes lacked any \"cynicism or precociousness or pretentiousness or sarcasm\", and believed this separated her from the typical roles for young women. Taylor defined the character through her curiosity as demonstrated by how she challenges the Ocampa's beliefs and explores her mental abilities. Author Paul Ruditis wrote that Kes has a \"fragile power\" and balances a \"child-like wonder\" with a \"maturity of someone well into adulthood\".\nKes and Neelix were created as an alien couple who would learn about humanity together. They are portrayed as an unlikely pair in age and appearance, with Kes as the dominant partner keeping Neelix out of trouble. Kes and Neelix are shown sleeping in separate bedrooms, and their sex lives are left vague. Taylor said this was done to avoid potentially offending viewers, particularly families with young children and those against cohabitation. Taylor and Berman also worried that Kes was too young to show in a sexual relationship. In retrospect, writers and producers felt Kes and Neelix never worked as a couple; a break-up scene was filmed for the episode \"\", but was cut due to time constraints.\nIn \"Voyager\"'s first two seasons, Kes is involved in a love triangle with Neelix and Tom Paris. Neelix becomes increasingly jealous over Paris's interest in Kes, although she never returns his advances. None of the actors involved liked this storyline, which was ended to avoid further damaging Neelix and Paris as characters. Aside from Neelix, Kes spent most of her scenes with the Doctor; she was instrumental to helping him develop his humanity and persuading the crew to view him as more than just a machine. The Doctor teaches Kes about medicine and Tuvok helps her to further develop her mental abilities. She is respectful toward the Doctor and Kathryn Janeway, whom she sees as parental figures.\nDeparture and return.\nIn the , \"Voyager\"'s producers reluctantly fired Lien when her personal issues affected her reliability on set. She had become increasingly unfocused, requiring multiple takes to complete a scene. Lien refused to discuss or accept help for her problems; Taylor said that no one on the set knew the cause for her behavior, which she described as \"something emotionally upset\". Actors on \"Voyager\" found Lien to be private and shy; Robert Picardo, who plays the Doctor, said that she became \"really monosyllabic\". Robert Beltran, who portrays Chakotay, got the impression that either Lien no longer wanted to work on the show or that the shooting schedule was affecting her.\nThe cast and crew did not publicly disclose the reason for Lien's firing. At the time, Lien was believed to have been removed to make space for Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine, but these casting choices were unrelated. Paramount reported that Lien wanted to act in other projects, and Taylor said Kes \"did not work out as well as we wanted\". In 2004, writer Kenneth Biller talked about his disappointment about Kes's removal:\nI was a little bit regretful when Kes left the show, because I thought she was an interesting character to write for\u2014from a science-fiction standpoint\u2014because she had certain... she had telepathic abilities, she had this very compressed lifespan, she had things about her character that often lent themselves to interesting storytelling [...] We lost something in losing the Kes character.\nUPN executives wanted Kes cut from \"Voyager\" off-screen without explanation, but Taylor insisted that the character get a proper farewell. Lien last appears as a full-time cast member in \". It was intended to be the fifth episode of the fourth season, but was moved to the second after a decision was made to remove Lien earlier than planned. She had a final appearance in the episode, \". Berman asked her to come back before a story was completed. Lien discussed the script with Fuller and Michael Taylor to ensure that Kes was \"handled with great care\". Her primary request was for the character to be dramatically different than how she left. In a 2010 interview, Lien said she preferred \"The Gift\" as her final episode; she disliked her performance in \"Fury\", explaining that she had not acted for an extended period and struggled with playing such a different version of Kes.\nReception.\nWhile \"Voyager\" was airing, Kes was a fan-favorite character, ranking as the most popular from the show on a Usenet newsgroup listing. \"The Virginian-Pilot\"'s Larry Bonko felt that she \"gave the series heart\". Other critics had negative reviews for Kes, finding her to be boring and without a clear direction. Rob Owen, writing for the \"Albany Times Union\", felt she was \"reduced to a subservient Nurse Chapel role\" early in the series. Henry Mietkiewicz of the \"Toronto Star\" thought she did not contribute much outside of her medical training. In retrospective reviews, Kes was called the show's \"most superfluous character\" by \"The A.V. Club\"'s William Hughes, and \"generally a pretty crap and useless character\" by Tom Pritchard of \"Gizmodo\".\nCritics praised Jennifer Lien's performance as Kes. For the pilot episode, \"Varietys Kinsey Lowe described her as bringing a \"beguiling blend of naive wonder and fierce dedication\" to her character. While critical of \"\", writer David A. McIntee said she convincingly portrayed Kes's fear about her physical changes. Andy Patrizio for \"IGN\" wrote that starting in \"Voyager\"'s second season, \"we really started to see the talents of Jennifer Lien as Kes\". He identified her portrayal of a possessed Kes in \"\" as a highlight. \"Reactors Keith DeCandido praised Lien's acting in his reviews for \"\", \"Warlord\", \", and \".\nKes's age was a topic of critical commentary. \"Bustle\"'s Marie Southard Ospina praised \"Elogium\" for its portrayal of a woman voluntarily not having a baby, but felt that Kes's age made the moment uncomfortable. Other commentators felt Kes was too young to be dating Neelix. According to \"Den of Geek\"'s Juliette Harrisson, the age gap was frequently criticized online. Science-fiction author Sylvia Spruck Wrigley interpreted Kes as undergoing puberty in \"Elogium\", noting that it raises questions about Neelix starting a relationship with a prepubescent girl. Harrisson and \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\"'s Jonathan Storm wrote that the age difference could be rationalized since Kes and Neelix are aliens with different biology than humans.\nSome critics praised the decision to remove Kes during \"Voyager\"'s fourth season, preferring the addition of Seven of Nine. The \"Akron Beacon Journal\"'s R.D. Heldenfels described it as a \"reasonable trade\", viewing Kes as \"wan and increasingly dull\". Pritchard thought Seven of Nine was more complex compared to Kes. Other reviewers disliked this change, as they enjoyed the character. Patrizio was critical of the writers developing new ideas for Seven of Nine after struggling with Kes for three seasons. He preferred Lien's acting and Kes as a character over Ryan as Seven of Nine. Writers Duncan Barrett and Michele Barrett cited Lien's removal as an example of \"Star Trek\" having \"a serious historical problem with the treatment of its female performers\", explaining that a male lead was never taken off a \"Star Trek\" series.\nKes's return in \"Fury\" was criticized as one of the worst moments in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. DeCandido considered the story to be insulting to the character describing the script and Lien's acting as lacking any \"emotional content\". Michael Weyer of \"Comic Book Resources\" believed that Kes deserved a better ending and disliked how she came back as \"twisted monster whose actions can come off as a spoiled brat\". Fans were also critical of how the episode portrayed Kes. \"Den of Geek\"'s John Andrews had a more positive response to \"Fury\", calling it a \"sad yet compelling character study\".\nThemes and analysis.\nFemininity.\nAcademics analyzed Kes as a representation of womanhood and femininity on \"Star Trek\". Communication studies professor Mia Consalvo described her as a \"woman with stereotypically feminine traits\" such as \"empathy and caring\". She identified Kes as one of several female characters with similar characteristics on \"Star Trek\" who are placed in healthcare rather than leadership roles, and argued that this is because the setting of the series \"valorized\" masculine traits over feminine ones.\nAmerican culture historian Peter W. Y. Lee said that \"Voyager\" characterizes Kes as a \"little girl\" who struggles to maintain her innocence as the series progresses, specifically with scenes involving sex or motherhood. Lee wrote that unlike other children in \"Star Trek\", namely Wesley Crusher, Jake Sisko, Nog, Molly O'Brien, and Alexander Rozhenko, Kes is more of a \"blank slate\". He argued that Kes becomes too mature for this \"little girl\" role after adopting a \"more aggressive womanhood and sexuality\" in \"\" that foreshadows her having \"outgrown her home\" and leaving \"Voyager\".\n\"Voyager\" aired in the 1990s, a decade that editor Leimar Garcia-Siino characterized by postfeminism and its \"reactionary anti-feminist and traditionally gendered views\". Garcia-Siino wrote that although these events shaped the writing for Kes, the character was still portrayed with authority through her hydroponics garden and her medical and psychic training and is shown as reaching self-actualization.\nRelationship with Janeway.\nScholars had varying interpretations of Kes's relationship with Janeway. Cultural studies lecturer Debra Bonita Shaw argued that although Janeway accepts characters like Kes into her crew, she treats them as subordinates who must aid in \"Voyager\"'s return home. Lee considered Janeway more of a parental figure to Kes. He noted that Janeway's actor Kate Mulgrew shared this view, particularly for \"\"; Mulgrew said the episode's focus on Janeway helping Kes with puberty and potential pregnancy and motherhood \"showed my involvement with her on a very female level, a very maternal level\".\nRoger Kaufman, a scholar in LGBT psychology, interpreted Kes as one of Janeway's \"significant intimate partnerships\". According to Kaufman, it was shown in their protection of each other, like Janeway saving her in \" and \", and Kes sending \"Voyager\"'s crew past Borg space in \"\". Kaufman wrote that Kes's decision to leave \"Voyager\" used similar language to a lesbian coming out; he paralleled her desire to explore her powers without endangering \"Voyager\" with a lesbian not wanting to cause trouble for her family of origin.\nMental abilities.\nScholars focused on how Kes's powers contributed to her character development. Lee wrote that \"Voyager\" focuses Kes's character arc on her mental abilities rather than her physical development; he explained that \"Kes's girl power rested in her brains, not her bared skin\". Aviva Dove Viebahn, a professor of media studies, argued that the non-human Kes is nearly tokenized as a \"native informant\" whose role is merely to advise the human crew about the Delta Quadrant. For Viebahn, the character's mental abilities, which at times are more useful than \"Voyager\"'s medical and scientific technologies, provide her a degree of agency which elevates her from this \"subjugated\" role.\n\"Voyager\" often depicts Kes's powers as dangerous or unpredictable. Media studies scholar Marion Gymnich wrote that in \"Cold Fire\", Kes changes from \"generally very friendly and gentle\" to \"extremely destructive\" after being tutored by another Ocampa. She cited her as an example of \"Star Trek\" negatively portraying telepathy. Comparing \"Voyager\" to Homer's epic poem \"Odyssey\", literary scholar Kwasu David Tembo likened Kes to two of the poem's characters\u2014Calypso and Circe\u2014as her powers both endanger the ship and aid in its homeward journey. Tembo wrote that Kes and Circe both have the \"attractive and equally dangerous aspects of Aeaea and Ocampan power are under the absolute control of a female authority\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Paris is the chief helmsman, as well as a temporary auxiliary medic, of the USS \"Voyager\", a Starfleet ship that was stranded in the Delta Quadrant by an alien entity known as the Caretaker. \nInitially recruited by Captain Kathryn Janeway as a Starfleet \"observer\" on \"Voyager\"'s first mission into the Badlands, Paris was reinstated as a Starfleet officer by Janeway and took on the role of being \"Voyager\"'s helmsman after the original helmsman was killed during the ship's turbulent displacement from the Alpha Quadrant.\nThe character's middle name, \"Eugene\", is a tribute to \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry.\nBackground.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe of all the crew is not dismayed by the cruel fate which has befallen them: what does it matter that they're at the ends of the galaxy? He's flying a ship and having adventures \u2013 that's just what he wants to be doing and it doesn't matter particularly to him where it happens.\n Rick Berman, Michael Piller, Jeri Taylor, Tom Paris' description, \"Star Trek: Voyager Bible\", 1995\nThe writers planned to use the character of Nicholas Locarno as a template for Tom Paris, a previous similar character played by McNeill in the ' episode \"The First Duty\". \"Voyager\"'s writers created an entirely new character sharing many of Locarno's attributes. One reason for this is that the writers wanted to have the character be a story of redemption, and they did not like the backstory established for Locarno.\nParis' character has two backstories. The original backstory, and the only one acknowledged onscreen, cast Paris as a disgraced officer dishonorably discharged from Starfleet for covering up pilot error following a shuttle accident on Caldik Prime. In her published novel, \"Pathways\", \"Voyager\" producer Jeri Taylor provided an alternative story much more similar to Locarno's, moving the accident to Paris' Academy years and making his fellow cadets the victims of his recklessness.\nAppearances.\nPrior to \"Voyager\".\nIn the \"Star Trek\" fictional universe, \"Star Trek: Voyager\" takes place in the years 2371 to 2378. Most of Paris' backstory takes place prior to the 2370s.\nTom Paris is the son of Starfleet Admiral Owen Paris, with most of his other family also hailing from Starfleet. Following his family's tradition, Paris attended Starfleet Academy sometime in the 2350s and majored in astrophysics. A gifted pilot, he earned an assignment to the Academy's honor squadron.\nHis relationship with his father was not a good one; while Tom wanted to join the Federation Naval Patrol due to his love for the sea, Owen wanted him to enlist at Starfleet Academy. Admiral Paris often disapproved of his son's tendency to get into fights and his resulting punishments.\nAfter his graduation from Starfleet Academy, Paris was assigned to the \"USS Exeter\". During his initial tenure at Starfleet, Paris crashed a shuttle he was piloting near Caldik Prime, killing three other Starfleet officers. Afraid he would lose his commission, Paris falsified records to conceal the cause of the accident. His efforts to cover up his pilot error succeeded, but overwhelmed by guilt and regret, he confessed. He was court martialed for his actions and dishonorably discharged from Starfleet. This caused a major rift between Paris and his father.\nFollowing his discharge, Paris left San Francisco for Marseille, where he started spending his time drinking and playing pool in Sandrine's, a waterfront bar that he frequented during his academy days. There, Chakotay, a former Starfleet officer now serving with the Maquis, recruited him to serve as a mercenary pilot for the Maquis Rebellion against the Federation. This adventure went no better than his earlier stint in Starfleet as Paris was captured by Starfleet while piloting his first mission for the Maquis.\nTried and convicted of treason for aiding the Maquis Rebellion, Paris was sentenced to serve time in a Federation penal settlement near Auckland, New Zealand.\nEvents of \"Voyager\".\nWhile serving time, Paris is visited by Kathryn Janeway, captain of the starship USS \"Voyager\". \"Voyager\"'s first mission was to travel to the Badlands and locate a missing Maquis ship commanded by Chakotay, which also has Janeway's chief of security Tuvok aboard as a spy. Janeway recruits Paris due to his previous experience working with the Maquis, obtaining his temporary release. In return, Paris would serve as an informant during the mission.\nJaneway and the crew of \"Voyager\", while searching for the Maquis ship, are thrown into the Delta Quadrant by a massive energy wave created by an alien known as the Caretaker. Once there, they successfully locate the Maquis ship docked at the Caretaker's array. The survivors of the incident become stranded about 70,000 light-years from Earth. The Maquis ship is destroyed and its crew joins the Federation crew on \"Voyager\". \nThe marooning of \"Voyager\" in the Delta Quadrant provides Paris with a new beginning. Janeway gives Paris a field commission as a Starfleet lieutenant and makes him the chief helmsman of \"Voyager\". He had a rough start, however, as Starfleet and Maquis alike viewed Paris with suspicion due to his previous affiliations with both organizations. Paris worked hard to earn his crewmates' respect. During this time, he became best friends with Ensign Harry Kim, a young officer on his first mission who defied his crewmates to befriend Paris. Eventually Paris is accepted by the crew and becomes one of Janeway's most valued officers.\nAs \"Voyager\" begins its journey home, Paris is involuntarily selected to be an auxiliary medic on \"Voyager\" as he had previously studied two semesters of biochemistry at Starfleet Academy. He is initially joined and eventually replaced by Kes after she expresses a desire to learn from the Doctor. Later, on an away mission, Paris visits the planet Banea with Harry Kim to find a replacement collimator. Once \"Voyager\" arrives to pick them up however, they learn that Paris is accused of murdering a well-known elderly engineering physicist after allegedly being caught flirting with the latter's wife. As punishment, the Baneans imprint the scientist's final moments leading up to his death in Paris' brain, which Paris has to relive repeatedly, slowly causing permanent brain damage. Tuvok conducts his own investigation to determine the true culprit, and discovers that Paris had been framed by the Baneans' enemies and is being used as a messenger, with the messages being imprinted in the recollection which Paris initially thought to be random letters and numbers. Upon discovery of Paris' innocence, the imprints are removed.\nDuring \"Voyager\"'s second year in the Delta Quadrant, Paris reconfigures a shuttlecraft with the help of Kim and chief engineer B'Elanna Torres and breaks the transwarp barrier, achieving warp 10 and becoming the first known person to do so. However, this later causes Paris to experience an accelerated state of evolution that would normally take humans millions of years. During this, Paris kidnaps Janeway in a shuttlecraft and brings her on a warp 10 flight. \"Voyager\" later finds the duo on an uninhabited planet and discovers that they had evolved into amphibian-like beings and had reproduced. The Doctor manages to reverse the evolution process using antiproton treatments. Later that year, Paris also participates in a plot organized by Janeway and Tuvok in order to flush out a possible traitor aboard \"Voyager\" that had been feeding information to Seska and the Kazon, one of \"Voyager\"'s enemies. However, this negatively impacts Paris' relations with first officer Chakotay as no one else had known of the plan, all being deceived by Paris' apparent tardiness and attitude. The plot is successful at deceiving the rest of the crew to the point where Neelix, believing that Paris was going to leave \"Voyager\" for good, gives a tribute speech on his own onboard show. Paris later manages to sneak on board a Kazon ship and discover the spy. In the season 3 premiere, \"\", Paris takes back \"Voyager\" with the assistance of the Doctor, crewman Lon Suder as well as several Talaxian ships after \"Voyager\" was taken over by the Kazon.\nDuring \"Voyager\"'s third and fourth years into its journey, Paris is accused of bombing an alien world along with Kim and is sentenced to jail. Paris becomes gravely injured after being stabbed during a prison fight. Despite \"Voyager\" later discovering and bringing forward the true perpetrator, Paris and Kim are denied release due to the society's laws. Both men are later saved by Janeway and the others after they break into the prison. Relationships-wise, Paris grows closer to B'Elanna Torres. In one instance, Torres experiences symptoms similar to the Vulcan \"pon farr\" and aggressively pursues Paris as a result. Knowing that Torres was in a delirious state, Paris does not engage with her, angering the latter as she knew of Paris' advances. The year after, Paris and Torres are on an away mission which had gone wrong. As the pair float aimlessly in space in their environmental suits, the duo confesses to each other their true feelings. Fortunately, they are saved by \"Voyager\" in time. As the rest of the crew are unaware of the duo's relationship, they try their best to keep quiet about it. During that year, Paris also returns to being a field medic after Kes departs \"Voyager\" in \"\", serving regular shifts in the sickbay.\nThe following year, Paris builds his own unique shuttlecraft which he named the \"Delta Flyer\". The construction of the craft was authorized by Janeway as \"Voyager\" had to retrieve a multi-spatial probe that was lost in the atmosphere of a gas giant. Paris and the \"Delta Flyer\" manage to safely retrieve the probe. Later that year, Paris is demoted to ensign by Janeway and placed in \"Voyager\"'s brig for 30 days after disobeying direct orders to not interfere with another society, called the Moneans, who lived on a planet where the entirety of its surface area was covered in water. Paris, who had an affection for the sea, had become concerned with the planet's gradual loss of water. Upon discovery by Paris that the Moneans' own oxygen-mining operations are to blame for the loss of water, he goes in the \"Delta Flyer\" with a Monean in order to target the oxygen refineries so that they could be temporarily taken out of operation and redesigned in a way that reduced the loss of water. The attack is foiled by \"Voyager\" at the last second, preventing a massive catastrophe. As Paris spends 30 days in the brig, he dictates his whole situation in his personal access display device in the form of a letter to his father to pass the time, later instructing the computer to transmit the letter to his father once \"Voyager\" is within range of Earth. \nDuring \"Voyager\"'s last few years in the Delta Quadrant, Paris is repromoted to lieutenant junior grade in the season 6 finale \"Unimatrix Zero\" after a year of exemplary service. As Paris and Torres' relationship grew deeper, they marry during an interstellar race. Later that year, when it is revealed that Torres had become pregnant, Paris manages to convince Torres to let their baby inherit Torres' Klingon characteristics when she did not want them. As \"Voyager\" makes their return to the Alpha Quadrant and Earth in 2378, Torres gives birth to her and Paris' daughter, Miral Paris.\nLater career.\nParis briefly appears in \"\" in the season 2 episode \"We'll Always Have Tom Paris\", set approximately three years after the end of \"Star Trek:\" \"Voyager\". In \"Lower Decks\", Paris, who by then had been fully promoted to lieutenant, had been moving through various Starfleet ships and posts, conducting handshake tours and speaking of his experiences in the Delta Quadrant. In one instance, Paris visits the USS \"Cerritos\", the show's focus ship, much to the excitement of one of the show's main characters.\nNon-canonical appearances.\nIn the non-canonical \"Voyager\" relaunch novels, written by Christie Golden, Paris was promoted two steps in rank, like many of the \"Voyager\" crew, and is now a lieutenant commander. He is serving as the first officer of \"Voyager\", under the command of now-Captain Chakotay.\nIn \"\", published by Activision in 2000, Paris appears in the game as the ship's helmsman.\nIn \"Star Trek Online\", a massive multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Cryptic Studios, Paris is active as a Starfleet captain in the early 25th century. Paris makes his first appearance in the game in 2015, with McNeill reprising Paris and voicing him.\nPersonality.\nPersonal interests.\nParis had a deep interest in 20th-century Earth pop culture, often utilizing such in his holo-programs. This knowledge helped the crew during time travel incidents. \nParis had also shown an interest in cars; he was well-versed with 20th-century automobiles and even created his own holoprogram where he would tinker with cars from that era. This interest was also shown when \"Voyager\" encountered a Ford truck that originated from 1936 floating in space, as Paris was able to identify the car model and even the year it came from. He also programmed a holoprogram featuring a 1957 Chevy for the Doctor to use when the latter had an attraction to a Vidiian patient.\nDuring Paris' childhood, he had an interest in the sea as well as naval ships; in one instance, Paris was scolded by his father for playing with ancient sailing ship models instead of doing his homework. This interest later pushed Paris to do everything in his power to save the Moneans' planet, which was entirely water-based, as it was losing water due to the society's oxygen-mining operations.\nWhile serving on \"Voyager\", Paris also nurtured a long-hidden talent for holo-programming, devising several programs for the entertainment of his fellow crewmembers. His most popular programs included a re-creation of Sandrine's bar, an Irish town called Fair Haven, and a 1930s-era sci-fi movie serial titled \"Captain Proton\".\nRelationships.\nParis was at times portrayed as feeling resentful toward his father, Owen Paris, due to the latter's words and actions which made Paris feel misunderstood and isolated during his childhood years. Their relationship improved substantially over the course of the series, due to Captain Janeway's willingness to offer him redemption, and later due to his relationship with B'Elanna Torres.\nHe became good friends with Harry Kim from the start and at times displayed protectiveness in the face of Harry's customary naivet\u00e9. In \"\", he rescues the ensign from Quark, a manipulative Ferengi. Kim later befriends Paris. The bond between both men strengthened after Kim protected Paris while they were imprisoned in a jail complex despite the latter destroying one of Kim's tools while in a delirious state.\nParis also viewed Captain Janeway in high regard. As she recruited Paris to join \"Voyager\" on its initial first mission, he was fatefully brought along to the Delta Quadrant. This made Paris felt like he had been given a second chance in life and was grateful to her for it. In one instance where all members of the crew were forced to abandon ship as \"Voyager\" prepared to self-destruct in order to destroy a missile from hitting an inhabited planet, Paris thanked Janeway for everything she has done before he left the ship in an escape pod while Janeway stayed behind to oversee the auto-destruction sequence.\nOne member of the crew with whom Paris initially had a somewhat difficult relationship was Chakotay because of their history in the Maquis. Paris also expressed dislike of Chakotay's leadership as he felt that Chakotay was not flexible regarding Starfleet protocols, insisting that he overruled most of the other officers' suggestions and opinions. These tensions even escalated to the point where Paris had to be placed in the brig after pushing Chakotay to the floor. However, it was later revealed that these tensions were all a ruse in a plot to expose a traitor on \"Voyager\", though unbeknownst to Chakotay. Fortunately, throughout \"Voyager\"'s seven-year journey home, Paris and Chakotay reconciled (in part due to Paris having earned Chakotay's trust) and became good friends.\nInitially, Paris and Neelix also often got into personal conflicts due to the former's often fraternizations with Kes, who was Neelix's girlfriend. Neelix felt jealous of Paris as the latter had given Kes a special locket for her birthday. They later resolved their differences after taking care of an alien baby together while on an away mission. When Paris appeared to be departing the ship in the episode \"\", Neelix was shown to be greatly concerned for Paris. When he later found out that Paris was part of a plot to expose a spy aboard \"Voyager\", he volunteered to take part in the plot to bring back Paris safely. When Torres' baby was announced during \"Voyager\"'s last year in the quadrant, Paris had initially thought of Neelix to be the child's godfather, though Neelix had to give the role to the Doctor as the former already had goddaughter Naomi Wildman.\nReception.\n\"Wired\" ranked Paris as the 26th most important character of Starfleet in 2016, while \"Comic Book Resources\" ranked Paris as the 19th best Starfleet character in 2018.\nIn 2020, \"ScreenRant\" ranked B'Elanna Torres and Paris as the 3rd best romantic couple of all \"Star Trek\". In 2021, they also felt that Paris' story arc was an interesting one, as he starts off on probation from Starfleet prison, but then returns to good standing over the course of his adventures on the show.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most familiar Q is portrayed by John de Lancie. He is an extra-dimensional being of unknown origin who possesses immeasurable power over time, space, the laws of physics, and reality itself, being capable of altering it to his whim. Despite his vast knowledge and experience spanning untold eons, he is not above practical jokes for his personal amusement, a Machiavellian or manipulative purpose, or to prove a point. He is said to be almost completely omnipotent and continually evasive regarding his true motivations.\nThe name \"Q\" applies to the names of the individuals portrayed (all male and female characters refer to each other as \"Q\"); it also applies to the name of their race and to the \"Q Continuum\" itself \u2013 an alternate dimension accessible to only the Q and their \"invited\" guests. The true nature of the realm is said to be beyond the comprehension of \"lesser beings\" such as humans, therefore it is shown to humans only in ways they can understand; e.g., a run-down gas station in the \"middle of nowhere\".\nBeginning with the pilot episode \"Encounter at Farpoint\" of \"\", Q became a recurring character, with pronounced comedic and dramatic chemistry with Jean-Luc Picard. He serves as a major antagonist throughout \"The Next Generation\", playing a pivotal role in both the first and final episodes. Q is initially presented as a cosmic force judging humanity to see if it is becoming a threat to the universe, but as the series progresses, his role morphs more into one of a teacher to Picard and the human race generally \u2013 albeit often in seemingly destructive or disruptive ways, subject to his own amusement. Other times, notably during \"Deja Q\" and \"Voyager\", Q appears to the crew seeking assistance.\nGene Roddenberry chose the letter \"Q\" in honor of his friend Janet Quarton.\nAppearances in \"Star Trek\" media.\nList of appearances.\nMany \"Star Trek\" television episodes and novels have featured Q and often have titles that play on the letter \"Q\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTelevision.\nQ debuted in \"Encounter at Farpoint\", where he puts Captain Picard and the \"Enterprise\" crew on trial, arguing that humanity is a dangerous race and should be destroyed. When they later save the life of a kidnapped alien, Q agrees to defer judgment, though he hints that it will not be the last time the crew sees him.\nIn \"Hide and Q\", he forces the \"Enterprise\" crew to participate in a war game against monsters he summoned, then makes a wager with Picard. He grants Commander William Riker the powers of a Q, then promises that if Riker rejects the powers, then Q will leave them alone. Riker uses the powers to save his friends and starts to lose himself to them, but ultimately manages to reject them. Q attempts to go back on his word, but the Q Continuum forcibly recalls him.\nIn \"Q Who\", he offers to divest himself of his powers and guide humanity through uncharted regions and prepare it for unknown threats. Picard argues that Q's services are unneeded (and unwanted), and Q rebuts him by teleporting the USS \"Enterprise\" to a distant system for their first encounter with the Borg. Unable to resist the Borg, Picard must ask Q to save the ship. Q returns the \"Enterprise\" home and tells Picard that other men would rather have died than ask for help. This episode also reveals Q has a past history and hostile relationship with Guinan.\nIn \"Deja Q\", Q is punished by the Q Continuum by being made mortal; his committing of an uncharacteristically selfless act (sacrificing his life so that a race attacking him will not destroy the \"Enterprise\") garners the return of his powers. In the same episode, Q says that Picard is \"the closest thing in this universe that I have to a friend.\"\nThe Q are mentioned in \"\". A woman named Ardra claims to be the Devil to subjugate a planet, displaying abilities similar to the Q. The crew speculate that she may be a member of the Q Continuum or even Q himself in a disguise before Picard points out Q would not be interested in a planet's economics. Ardra is exposed as a con artist using technology to simulate her powers.\nIn \"Qpid\", Q attempts to repay Picard for saving him in \"Deja Q\" by helping him with his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Vash. He transports everyone to Sherwood Forest and casts himself as the Sheriff of Nottingham, Picard as Robin Hood, the crew as the Merry Men, and Vash as Maid Marian, then challenges them to rescue her. Q and Vash find themselves kindred spirits, and she ultimately decides to go with him and explore the universe together.\nIn \"True Q\", Q reveals that a new crew member named Amanda Rogers is actually the daughter of two rogue members of the Q Continuum, then orders her to choose between remaining human and never using her powers, or coming with him to join the Continuum. After using her powers to save a planet, Amanda decides to join the Continuum.\nToward the end of \"The Next Generation\", Q is less antagonistic toward Picard. In \", Q apparently saves Picard and helps him better understand himself, giving Picard a chance to avoid the accident that gave him an artificial heart only for Picard to choose dying as himself over living the tedious life he would have lived without the inspiration of his near-death experience (although whether Q actually appeared in this episode or was merely a hallucination Picard experienced during surgery is deliberately left ambiguous).\nIn \", Q reveals that the trial of humanity is not over and displaces Picard through different time periods where a temporal anomaly threatens the existence of humanity. After Picard resolves the situation, Q admits to having helped him find the solution and to having saved him from death. Q departs, stating that the trial of humanity is never over.\nIn the \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" episode \"Q-Less\", Vash decided to end her partnership with Q. Q follows her to the Deep Space Nine station and attempts to win her back. Q is blamed for a series of power failures, but denies it. Q taunts Commander Benjamin Sisko, only to get punched in the face, shocking him since 'Picard never did that'. The power failures were actually caused by an alien life form disguised as a crystal that Vash was carrying. Q gives Vash his blessing to leave him.\nIn the \"Star Trek: Voyager\" episode \"\", Q pursues a rogue member of the Continuum, later named Quinn, who has been inadvertently released from his asteroid prison by the crew of that ship, and who seeks asylum on \"Voyager\". He demands that Q make him human, as he does not wish to be a member of the Continuum any more, but Q refuses, because Quinn intends to commit suicide if he becomes human. The two parties agree to allow Captain Janeway to mediate their dispute, and after Janeway eventually finds in favor of Quinn, he is made human and then commits suicide. It is subsequently revealed that Q chose to assist Quinn's suicide.\nLater, in the \"Voyager\" episode \"The Q and the Grey\", Q reappears on the \"Voyager\", asking Janeway to bear his child. He eventually reveals that the uncertainty and instability caused by Quinn's suicide divided the Continuum, causing a civil war between Quinn's followers (of which Q is a part) and the rest of the Continuum. Q believes that the birth of a new member of the Continuum could revitalize the Q by giving them something new to focus on after millennia of stagnation and boredom. Janeway refuses, and after she and her crew bring about a ceasefire in the Continuum, Q eventually mates with a female Q (Suzie Plakson) with whom he had been involved (referred to in \"Star Trek\" novels as 'Lady Q'), producing a son. Their progeny is born conscious and with all the power of any other Q, although lacking adult maturity. Q makes Janeway his godmother.\nIn the episode \"\", he appears on \"Voyager\" with his immature, rebellious son, who appears as a human teenager (played by John de Lancie's real-life son Keegan de Lancie, and referred to in the novels as \"Little Q\" or \"q\"). Q asks Janeway to mentor his son, and the two adults agree that the boy will remain on \"Voyager\", without his powers, and either learn how to be a responsible, accountable, and productive inhabitant of the cosmos, or spend eternity as an amoeba. Eventually, the young Q comes around, but the Continuum is not entirely convinced, so in negotiation with Q, they come to an agreement. Q must eternally guard, observe, and accompany the boy to ensure his proper behavior. Q thanks Janeway for her help by showing her a shortcut to Earth that will shave three years off \"Voyager\"'s journey. When she asks why he does not just send them directly to Earth, he says it would set a bad example for his son to do all the work for them.\nIn the \"\" episode \"Veritas\", Q appears in a flashback, challenging the senior crew of the USS \"Cerritos\" to an inexplicable 'game' to prove humanity's worth, dressing them up as chess pieces facing a football field filled with anthropomorphic cards and soccer balls. Later in the episode, he appears again to challenge the ensigns to a duel, but he is unceremoniously blown off by Ensign Mariner, who tells him to \"go bother Picard.\" Q follows them anyway, complaining that Picard is always quoting Shakespeare and .\nQ returns in of \"\". In the episode \"The Star Gazer\", the \"Stargazer\" encounters a Borg vessel containing the Borg Queen. When it appears that she is assimilating the Stargazer and controlling the fleet, Picard activates the ship's self-destruct mechanism to stop her. Just as the ship explodes, Picard abruptly wakes up in a different version of his home. Q appears, initially looking like his younger self before turning himself into an old man to match Picard's age. Q says the trial of humanity is not over, so he's altered history to show Picard \"the end of the road not taken.\"\nIn the next episode, \"Penance\", Q acts unusually agitated while claiming this dark, totalitarian future is all Picard's fault, even striking Picard when he complains. This prompts Picard to wonder if Q is unwell. Q admits to saving Picard and his crew from the explosion of the \"Stargazer\" and making sure they all remembered the original timeline to give them a chance to change it back. After Q departs, Picard meets his crew and they work with a captured Borg Queen, who can detect temporal anomalies and says this future was caused by a change in Los Angeles in the year 2024.\nIn the next episode, \"Assimilation\", Q briefly appears to taunt Picard about how everything was lost because of his fears before disappearing.\nIn the next episode, \"Watcher\", Q appears in Los Angeles in 2024 (before First Contact), observing a woman working on a planned spaceflight to Europa. He is then surprised to find his powers do not work.\nIn the next episode, \"Fly Me to the Moon\", the woman is revealed to be Jean-Luc Picard's ancestor, Renee Picard. Undaunted by the loss of his powers, Q poses as Renee's psychiatrist and tries to convince her to cancel her spaceflight to Europa. When Picard and his crew find out about this, they speculate that this is the change that causes the dark future. Q also meets Dr. Adam Soong and provides him a temporary cure for his daughter Kore's life-threatening illness. Desperate for a permanent cure, Soong agrees to assist Q.\nIn the next episode, \"Two of One\", Q instructs Soong to stop Renee from going on her spaceflight, which he attempts by trying to hit her with his car. However, Picard pushes her out of the way and is hit instead and hospitalized by his injuries.\nQ is mentioned in the next episode, \"Monsters\". After recovering, Picard asks Guinan to summon Q to their location so he can question him, remembering Q's unusual behavior in their previous encounter. Guinan reveals that the Q Continuum and her race, the El-Aurians, went to war in the past before making a peace treaty. However, her ritual to summon Q fails.\nIn the next episode, \"Mercy\", after Picard and Guinan have been arrested by an FBI agent, Q visits Guinan disguised as an agent, revealing that he is dying and that this whole scenario was just an attempt to give his life meaning. He leaves after saying humans are always stuck in the past, giving Picard inspiration to pry into the agent's past to persuade him to let them go. Q later visits Kore and gives her the permanent cure even though Soong did not fulfill his end of the bargain, allowing her to leave her home and escape her controlling father. The Borg Queen reveals the change that caused the dark future: In the original timeline, Renee found an alien life form on Europa, paving the way for the formation of the Federation. If Renee's flight is prevented, Dr. Adam Soong will eventually rise in power and become ruler of the world.\nIn \"Farewell,\" after the original timeline is restored, Picard leaves the skeleton key behind a loose brick in the wall for his younger self to find, then encounters Q in his home. Q notes that Picard had the chance to potentially save his mother and change his own future, but instead he chose to accept himself as he is and absolve himself of his guilt. Because Picard has chosen himself, perhaps now he will finally believe himself worthy of being chosen by someone else, and may even give himself the chance to be loved. Q repeats his earlier statement that this was about forgiveness: Picard's own forgiveness of himself. Q reminds Picard that all of the deaths caused by Q's alteration of the timeline have been fixed, apart from Tallinn and Elnor. However, Tallinn was always destined to die in every timeline, but thanks to Picard's intervention, Tallinn had been able to meet Ren\u00e9e in this one. Picard asks why Q had taken such an interest in him for over thirty years, and Q explains that he is dying alone and doesn't want that for Picard. As such, he had set it up so Picard could travel back in time and become unshackled from his past (\"As I leave, I leave you free.\") For once, Q had not been acting for some grander design, but simply because he cared about Picard and genuinely wanted to help his friend.\nGathering outside, Q prepares to use the last of his power to send Picard and his friends back to their own timeline, an action that will kill Q in his weakened state. When Rios chooses to stay in 2024, Q tells Picard that he now has an unexpected surplus of energy, which he will use to give Picard a final surprise gift. Stating that Q doesn't have to die alone, Picard hugs him, and an emotional Q promises to \"See you out there.\" He then snaps his fingers one last time, sending Picard, Raffi and Seven back to 2401 moments before the \"Stargazer's\" destruction, allowing Picard the chance to change his future. Shortly thereafter, the group discovers Q's final gift: Q has resurrected Elnor and returned him to the \"Excelsior\".\nDespite his supposed death, Q appears to Picard's son Jack Crusher in a mid-credits scene of the \"Star Trek: Picard\" series finale \"The Last Generation\". When asked about his supposed death, Q simply states that he'd hoped that the next generation wouldn't think so linearly and that while humanity's trial has ended for Picard, it has only just begun for Jack.\nThe Q were also mentioned in of \" as the possible creators of the Dark Matter Anomaly threatening the Alpha Quadrant, but were dismissed as being such by the Federation due to neither Q or his fellow Q being heard from since the late 26th century.\nIn the \" episode \"\", Q appears in spectral form to reprimand his son, Trelane, for interfering with the crew of the \"Enterprise\" using false memories.\nNovels.\nThe similarity between Q and Trelane, the alien encountered in the \"Star Trek\" episode \"The Squire of Gothos\", inspired writer Peter David to establish in his 1994 novel \"Q-Squared\" that Trelane is a member of the Continuum, and that Q is his godfather; it is heavily implied that Q is actually Trelane's biological father, although the truth of this was kept a secret. This parental connection would later be made official in \"Strange New Worlds\".\nQ's past is expanded on in the trilogy ', which has Q and Picard travel through Q's past, witnessing Q's first encounter with the being that inspired his interest in testing other races. This being, known as 0, is similar to Q in power and abilities (although an injury of some sort prevents 0 travelling faster than light under his own power, even if he can still teleport short distances), but whereas Q has been shown to be more of a \"merry prankster\" throughout \"Star Trek\" canon, 0 is malevolent in his desires. Where Q always offers his opponents a sporting chance to win his challenges, 0 is ultimately shown to use his 'tests' as just an excuse to torture other races, to the extent that he basically changes the rules of his games so that the subjects will inevitably lose. The young Q ends up bringing him into the Milky Way galaxy through the Guardian of Forever while looking for something new to do with himself, and 0 assembles other seemingly omnipotent beings from the original \"Star Trek\", including Gorgan (the entity who turned children against their parents in \"And the Children Shall Lead\"), The One (the being who impersonated God in ') and (*) (the entity from \"Day of the Dove\", which thrived on violent conflict). However, although intrigued at 0's words about testing lesser races, Q loses his taste for 0's methods when 0's group provoke the Tkon Empire- an advanced civilisation millennia in the past- into decades of civil war and then blows up their sun just as they were about to exchange their dying old sun for a younger, fresher one, the Tkon having completed their Great Endeavour despite the war. 0's group was later defeated in a battle with the Q Continuum, though the dinosaurs were left extinct as a result when Q diverted an asteroid from one of the combatants so that it would strike Earth instead. With Q having abstained from most of the conflict, he was thus put in charge of watching over Earth and its inhabitants as a possible rehabilitation project, while (*) and Gorgan escaped and The One was trapped at the heart of the galaxy having been reduced to just his head. 0 in particular was banished to just outside our galaxy and the galactic barrier erected to keep him out; as Picard observes, with 0's crippled state preventing him travelling faster than light, 0 was essentially reduced to a shipwrecked survivor cut off from the nearest inhabitable land and millennia away from anywhere else. In the course of the trilogy, 0 is temporarily released from his banishment beyond the galaxy and sought revenge on Q, having manipulated a dying scientist to complete an artificial wormhole experiment intended to let starships breach the barrier that would allow 0 to regain access. However, 0 was defeated when Picard was able to convince one of 0's old enemies to join forces with Q so that their combined powers could stop his former mentor.\nThe novel \"The Buried Age\" \u2014 which explores Picard's life between the destruction of the \"Stargazer\" and his appointment to the position of captain of the \"Enterprise\"-D \u2014 ends with a cameo appearance by Q as he meets an alien woman who recently met Picard before she chose to ascend to a higher plane of existence, her tales of Picard inspiring Q's own interest in humanity. This novel also establishes why Q chose his name, as he wanted something that would be simple for humans to remember, reasoning that, if he was ever asked why he was called 'Q', he could reply \"Because U will always be behind me\".\nIn the \"Voyager\" novel \"The Eternal Tide\", Q's son sacrifices himself to save the universe, inspired by the example of the resurrected Kathryn Janeway, prompting Q to declare himself her enemy. However, he swiftly gets over this hostility 'off-screen', and by the later novel \"A Pocket Full of Lies\", it is revealed that he acted to save the life of an alternate Janeway created during the events of \"\".\nIn the \"Star Trek\" comic series based on the alternate timeline established in the 2009 film \"Star Trek\", Q visits that reality to take the crew of the \"Enterprise\" into their future. This allows them to interact with characters from the original timeline in the new history created by Spock's trip to the past. It also helps Q deal with a threat to the Continuum in the form of the Pah-Wraiths, which have all but destroyed the Bajoran Prophets in this timeline, the \"Enterprise\" crew retrieving a tablet containing the last Prophet and allowing it to merge with Q to defeat the Pah-Wraiths.\nComputer games.\nThe 1996 computer game \"\" was primarily made up of live action segments directed by James L. Conway and featured John de Lancie as Q.\nAnother Q also appears during holiday events in the massively multiplayer online game \"Star Trek Online\" including the creation of a Christmas village that player characters can be teleported to. This entity is believed to be The Junior Q as he had mentioned the name \"Aunt Kathy\".\nQ's phone number.\nIn \", S02E05 \", Q sends Dr. Adam Soong his business card via his 3D printer. The number on it was (323) 634-5667. This is a functional phone number intended for the viewers to call. Typically, American movies or TV episodes use \"dud\" phone numbers that go nowhere, but this is a small treat for diligent viewers; a small, out-of-universe Easter egg with a short message from John de Lancie's portrayal of Q. Since initial launch this phone number is still active.\nReception.\nIn 2009, Q was ranked as the 9th best character of all \"Star Trek\" by IGN.\nIn 2016, \"Time\" rated Q as the #10 best villain of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nIn 2017, Space.com rated Q as one of the \"15 of the Most Bizarre Alien Species\" of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nIn 2018, \"The Wrap\" said that Q would be at the top of the list if he was included with ranking 39 main cast characters of the \"Star Trek\" franchise prior to \"\".\nIn 2018, CBR ranked Q the #1 best \"Star Trek\" recurring character.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Debuting in the television series ', McFadden appeared in every season, except for the second, as well as its spin-off feature films: \"Star Trek Generations\", ', ', and '. McFadden returned to the role in the third season of '. She also had cameo appearances in ', both as a holographic recreation and the real Crusher.\nCrusher was the chief medical officer of the \"Enterprise\"-D and \"Enterprise\"-E, two starships in the \"Star Trek\" universe.\nCasting.\nGates McFadden was reluctant to accept the role of Dr. Crusher because of her commitment to appear in the play \"The Matchmaker\" at the La Jolla Playhouse. Before McFadden was cast, Anne Twomey and Jenny Agutter were considered for the role. During the second season, the character was written out of the series, with the explanation that she \"was off heading up Starfleet Medical for the year.\" Producer Rick Berman has said that McFadden left due to her disputes with the head \"TNG\" writer at the time, Maurice Hurley. She was replaced by the louder, more opinionated Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur). Patrick Stewart was upset by McFadden's departure and played a large part in bringing about her return after Hurley left at the end of the second season.\nEarly life.\nBeverly Crusher was born Beverly Howard on October 13, 2324, in Copernicus City, Luna. Her ancestors were Scottish-Americans. Following the death of her parents when she was very young, she lived with her grandmother, Felisa Howard, on Arvada III, a colony planet, until a moon collision caused the planet to flood, forcing its evacuation. Resourceful Felisa, with her granddaughter's aid, used herbs, grasses, tree chemicals, and roots as medicines when synthetic medicines ran out for the injured.\nDuring her youth, Beverly was known as quiet, shy, and socially awkward. She was also very self-conscious about her bright red hair, and at the age of 13, attempted to dye it dark with disastrous results. She admits to Data later, in the episode \"Offspring\", that she was often ridiculed, unpopular in school, and it had been very painful for her. She also admits that it brought back painful memories of those years when she saw her son Wesley going through similar ridicule as a child.\nIt was her grandmother's career as a healer and Beverly's own caring, high intelligence, and sensitivity that largely sparked Beverly's lifelong interest in medicine and healing the sick and wounded. The Arvada III disaster solidified Beverly's decision to be a doctor.\nAfter Arvada III was evacuated, Beverly and Felisa then settled on Caldos IV where Beverly lived until she entered Starfleet Academy.\nStarfleet Academy.\nCrusher attended Starfleet Academy from 2342 to 2350 during which she attended medical school. While attending the academy, she became romantically involved with fellow cadet Jack Crusher. They were introduced by their friend, Walker Keel. She graduated top of her class and married Jack in 2348. She had also been called \"the Dancing Doctor\" when she was at the academy because she had won multiple awards at a dance competition in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2350, she started an internship with Dr. Dalen Quaice.\nFamily.\nAfter marrying Jack, Beverly returned to the academy while he left for the USS \"Stargazer\". A year later, she gave birth to a son named Wesley Crusher. Jack died on an away mission when Wesley was five years old. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who was commanding the \"Stargazer\" at the time, took home the body of Jack. She never fully recovered from his death. Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard were also acquaintances while the character's husband was alive, as Picard and Jack Crusher were very good friends. At the beginning of the series, Picard and Dr. Crusher have not seen or heard from each other since Jack's death. \"Encounter at Farpoint\" is the first time Picard and Dr. Crusher's son Wesley truly meet face to face. Later in her life she realizes Picard has fallen in love with her.\nAs time goes by, both Crusher and Picard try to conceal their feelings from each other. Their relationship advances in \"Attached\", when the two are linked telepathically and their romantic feelings are revealed. At the end of this episode, Beverly tells Jean-Luc, \"Perhaps we should be afraid\", implying that she's not ready to take that step forward in their relationship.\nHowever, only a handful of episodes later in \"\", it is revealed that neither Beverly nor Jean-Luc has been able to let go of those feelings and they are back to where they started, trying to pretend the feelings don't exist and that they have no problem being \"just friends\" with one another.\nIn the series finale \"\", it is revealed that in an alternate future, Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard had been married and then divorced\u2014still evidently having feelings for each other after so many years. Little information is given about the circumstances of their marriage or separation. In the present the two share a kiss; however, that particular timeline is erased when Picard changes the past.\nIn the four \"Next Generation\" movies, the flirtation between Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard remains, though it is not as obvious as previous episodes and most certainly not part of the substantial movie plots. The most noteworthy moment between the two happens in one of the deleted scenes of the last \"Next Generation\" movie, \"\".\nFollowing the television series and films, the relationship between Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard continued throughout the non-canonical \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" Pocket Books series. Beverly and Jean-Luc have married, but still serve together on the \"Enterprise\"-E. They have a son named Ren\u00e9 Jacques Robert Francois Picard, named after Picard's older brother (Robert) and nephew (Ren\u00e9).\nHowever, in the canonical sequel series \"\", Beverly and Jean-Luc have not married. They have conceived a son, Jack II, but mounting assassination attempts on Picard have led Beverly to hide Jack away from him and raise Jack by herself. By 2401, Beverly is piloting her own charity hospital ship, the SS \"Eleos\", and is assisting her son in his criminal exploits. She sends a message to Jean-Luc requesting help and gets severely injured when encountering an aggressive band of raiders. Picard commandeers a Starfleet ship, the USS \"Titan\", and rescues her and Jack, right before the raiders' leader Vadic destroys the \"Eleos\". After she is treated, Beverly helps the \"Titan\"'s medical staff throughout the third season, and her analysis of autopsies and interrogation of Vadic with Picard, prove crucial in helping uncover a conspiracy of rogue Changelings infiltrating Starfleet out of revenge for Starfleet's medical experimentation and actions during the Dominion War. She is reunited with the rest of the \"Enterprise\" crew as they race to prevent the conspirators and their collaborators the Borg from further attacking Starfleet. When they are too late, Picard decides to infiltrate the Borg's last cube and rescue a newly assimilated Jack. Beverly fires the torpedoes that destroy the cube while the rest of the crew beams Picard and Jack out. By 2402, after developing new transporter modifications and gene therapies to prevent the conspirators and their partners the Borg from returning, her commission is reinstated. Beverly is promoted to the rank of Admiral, and Beverly and Picard see their son off as he joins Starfleet aboard the USS \"Enterprise\"-G. Beverly and Jean-Luc are last seen playing poker with the rest of the \"Enterprise\"-D crew in the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles, finally content with their lives.\nIn \"\" , Kathryn Janeway contacts Beverly in 2384 after meeting Wesley. Beverly isn't able to offer much insight into her son's current activities as Wesley hasn't visited her in years. Beverly laments that \"for a time traveler, I wish he had more time to spend with his mother.\" Wesley later finally visits his mother, and she introduces Wesley to his little brother for the first time, Jack having only been a small child at the time.\nReception.\nThe character has generally been positively received. Zack Handlen of \"The A.V. Club\" praised Gates McFadden's performance, as well as the inclusion of a strong, likable female character in the series, but lamented that the character's potential was never fully realized, saying she \"should've been one of 's best characters\" but that \"too often, her character has been relegated to back-up roles, interjecting occasional medical jargon to give color to scenes, or else worrying to one side about whether or not Wesley was getting enough fun in his life.\"\nMcFadden left the series at the end of the first season and was replaced by Diana Muldaur as Doctor Katherine Pulaski at the beginning of the second. An official announcement stated McFadden had left the series to pursue other career options. McFadden herself got a call from her agent who told her the producers had decided to go in another direction with the character. Like the other cast members, McFadden was surprised. Thanks to a letter-writing campaign, support from Patrick Stewart, and a personal invitation from executive producer Rick Berman, McFadden was brought back to the TNG cast for the third and subsequent seasons, with her only three appearances for season two being stock footage.\nIn an interview in May 2006, Berman revealed the actress was fired at end of the first season of \"The Next Generation\" because head writer Maurice Hurley \"had a real bone to pick\" and did not like her acting. After Hurley departed the show's writing staff, Berman brought the actress and character back.\nIn 2016, SyFy ranked Beverly Crusher as the fourth best of the six main-cast space doctors of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nIn 2016, Beverly Crusher was ranked as the 20th most important character of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" science fiction universe by \"Wired\" magazine.\nIn 2017, IndieWire ranked Beverly fifth in a list of important characters on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", noting she was \"pretty much flawless\" and offered \"valuable perspectives\".\nIn 2017, IndieWire ranked Crusher as the sixth best character on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\nIn 2018, CBR ranked Beverly Crusher the 21st best member of Starfleet.\nIn 2018, \"The Wrap\" placed Crusher as 14th out of 39 in a ranking of the franchise's best main characters prior to \".\nIn 2019, ScreenRant suggested the character was ripe for a spin-off series, highlighting her relations with Picard and also the high potential of the character.\nIn 2019, SyFy Wire recommended \" include Beverly Crusher, pointing out her long-time friendship with the titular character.

McCoy, known as \"Bones\", is a character in the American science-fiction franchise \"Star Trek\". McCoy was played by actor DeForest Kelley in the from 1966 to 1969, and he also appears in the , in six \"Star Trek\" films, in the pilot episode of \"\", and in numerous books, comics, and video games. A decade after Kelley's death, Karl Urban assumed the role of McCoy in the \"Star Trek\" reboot film in 2009.\nDepiction.\nMcCoy was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2227. The son of David McCoy, he attended the University of Mississippi and is a divorc\u00e9. McCoy later married Natira, the priestess of Yonada, as recounted in the episode \"For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky\". In 2266, McCoy was posted as chief medical officer of the USS \"Enterprise\" under Captain James T. Kirk, who often calls him \"Bones\". McCoy and Kirk are good friends, even \"brotherly\". The passionate, sometimes cantankerous McCoy frequently argues with Kirk's other confidant, science officer Spock, and occasionally is annoyed by Spock's Vulcan heritage. McCoy often plays the role of Kirk's conscience, offering a counterpoint to Spock's logic. McCoy is suspicious of technology, especially the transporter. As a physician, he prefers less intrusive treatment and believes in the body's innate recuperative powers. The nickname \"Bones\" \u2013 chosen before the character was named \u2013 is a play on \"sawbones\", a 19th century epithet for a surgeon. In the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film reboot, when McCoy first meets Kirk, he complains that his ex-wife took all their shared assets following their divorce: \"All I got left is my bones\", implying this was the origin of the nickname.\nWhen Kirk orders McCoy's commission reactivated in ' (1979); a resentful McCoy complains of being \"drafted\". Spock transfers his \"katra\"\u2014his knowledge and experience\u2014into McCoy before dying in ' (1982). This causes mental anguish for McCoy, who in ' (1984) helps restore Spock's \"katra\" to his reanimated body. McCoy continues to serve on Kirk's crew aboard the captured Klingon ship in ' (1986). In \"\" (1989), McCoy (through the intervention of Spock's half-brother Sybok) reveals that he helped his father commit suicide to relieve him of his pain. Shortly after the suicide, a cure was found for his father's disease, and McCoy had carried the guilt about it with him until Sybok's intervention.\nIn ' (1991), McCoy and Kirk escape from a Klingon prison world, and the \"Enterprise\" crew stops a plot to prevent peace between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Kelley reprised the role for the \"Encounter at Farpoint\" pilot episode of ' (1987), insisting upon no more than the minimum Screen Actors Guild payment for his appearance. McCoy had attained the rank of admiral in the \"Trek\" timeline when this episode was aired, and he is stated to be 137 years of age. He went on to become chief of Starfleet Medical, with a special rank known as branch admiral. The fictional book \"Comparative Alien Physiology\" was written by McCoy, and was required reading at the Starfleet Medical Academy through the 2370s.\nIn the 1973 \" episode \", McCoy mentions he has a daughter, Joanna. Although Chekov's friend Irina in the original series episode \"The Way to Eden\" was originally written as McCoy's daughter, it was changed before the episode was shot.\nReboot film series.\nIn the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film, which takes place in an alternate, parallel reality, McCoy and Kirk become friends at Starfleet Academy, which McCoy joins after a divorce that he says, \"left [him] nothing but [his] bones.\" This line, improvised by Urban, explains how McCoy earned the nickname \"Bones\". McCoy later helps get Kirk posted aboard the USS \"Enterprise\". He later becomes the chief medical officer after Doctor Puri is killed during an attack by Nero. McCoy remains aboard to see the \"Enterprise\" defeat Nero and his crew, with Kirk becoming the commanding officer of the ship.\n\"The Guardian\" called Urban's portrayal of McCoy in the 2009 film an \"unqualified success\", and \"The New York Times\" called the character \"wild-eyed and funny\". \"Slate\" said Urban came closer than the other actors to impersonating a character's original depiction.\nDevelopment.\nKelley had worked with \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry on previous television pilots, and he was Roddenberry's first choice to play the doctor aboard the USS \"Enterprise\". However, for the rejected pilot \"\" (1964), Roddenberry went with director Robert Butler's choice of John Hoyt to play Dr. Philip Boyce. For the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" (1966), Roddenberry accepted director James Goldstone's decision to have Paul Fix play Dr. Mark Piper. Although Roddenberry wanted Kelley to play the character of ship's doctor, he did not put Kelley's name forward to NBC; the network never \"rejected\" the actor, as Roddenberry sometimes suggested.\nKelley's first broadcast appearance as Doctor Leonard McCoy was in \"The Man Trap\" (1966). Despite his character's prominence, Kelley's contract granted him only a \"featuring\" credit; he was not given \"starring\" credit until the second season, at the urging of producer Robert Justman. Kelley was apprehensive about \"Star Trek\"'s future, telling Roddenberry that the show was \"going to be the biggest hit or the biggest miss God ever made\". Kelley portrayed McCoy throughout the original \"Star Trek\" series, and voiced the character in the animated \"Star Trek\".\nKelley, who in his youth wanted to become a doctor like his uncle, but whose family could not pay for a medical education, in part drew upon his real-life experiences in creating McCoy, a doctor's \"matter-of-fact\" delivery of news of Kelley's mother's terminal cancer was the \"abrasive sand\" Kelley used in creating McCoy's demeanor. \"Star Trek\" writer D. C. Fontana said that while Roddenberry created the series, Kelley essentially created McCoy; everything done with the character was done with Kelley's input.\n\"Exquisite chemistry\" among Kelley, William Shatner, and Leonard Nimoy manifested itself in their performances as McCoy, Captain James T. Kirk, and Science Officer Spock, respectively. Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, referred to Kelley as her \"sassy gentleman friend\"; the friendship between the African-American Nichols and Southern Kelley was a real-life demonstration of the message Roddenberry hoped to convey through \"Star Trek\".\nFor the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman saw McCoy as an \"arbiter\" in Kirk and Spock's relationship. While Spock represented \"extreme logic, extreme science\" and Kirk symbolized \"extreme emotion and intuition\", McCoy's role as \"a very colorful doctor, essentially a very humanistic scientist\", represented the \"two extremes that often served as the glue that held the trio together\". They chose to reveal that McCoy befriended Kirk first, explaining the \"bias\" in their friendship and why he would often be a \"little dismissive\" of Spock. Urban said the script was \"very faithful\" to the original character, including the \"great compassion for humanity and that sense of irascibility\" with which Kelley imbued the character. New Zealand-born Urban trained with a dialect coach to create McCoy's accent and reprised the role in its sequels \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" and \"Star Trek Beyond\".\nCultural impact.\nMcCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself, but is a foil to Spock. He is Kirk's \"friend, personal bartender, confidant, counselor, and priest\". Spock and McCoy's bickering became so popular that Roddenberry wrote in a 1968 memo \"we simply didn't realize ... how much the fans loved the bickering between our Arrowsmith and our Alien\". Urban said McCoy has a \"sense of irascibility with real passion for life and doing the right thing\", and that \"Spock's logic and McCoy's moral standing gave Kirk the benefit of having three brains instead of just one.\"\nKelley said that his greatest thrill at \"Star Trek\" conventions was the number of people who told him they entered the medical profession because of the McCoy character. He received two or three letters a month from others reporting similar experiences. A friend observed that despite not becoming a doctor as he had hoped, Kelley's portrayal of McCoy had helped create many doctors. According to Kelley, \"You can win awards and that sort of thing, but to influence the youth of the country ... is an award that is not handed out by the industry\".\n\"He's dead, Jim.\".\nTwenty times on the original \"Star Trek\" series, McCoy declares someone or something deceased with the line, \"He's dead\", \"He's dead, Jim\", or something similar. The phrase so became a catchphrase of the character that Kelley joked that the line would appear on his tombstone\u2014and it appeared in the first sentence of at least one obituary\u2014but disliked repeating the line. During filming of \"\", when Spock is dying from radiation exposure, Kelley felt it would spoil the gravitas of the moment, so he and James Doohan agreed to swap their lines: McCoy warns Kirk not to open the chamber, and Scotty says, \"He's dead already\".\nUniversity of Southern California literature professor Henry Jenkins cites Dr. McCoy's \"He's dead, Jim\" line as an example of fans actively participating in the creation of an underground culture in which they derive pleasure by repeating memorable lines as part of constructing new mythologies and alternative social communities. As an example, the line appears in The Firm's 1987 novelty song \"Star Trekkin\"', which became a #1 hit in the United Kingdom.\n\"I'm a doctor, not a...\".\nAnother of McCoy's catchphrases is his \"I'm a doctor, (Jim) not a(n)...\" statements, delivered by Kelley 11 times, and three times by Karl Urban in later films. McCoy repeats the line when he must perform some task beyond his medical skills, such as when he is asked to treat the unfamiliar silicon-based Horta alien in \"The Devil in the Dark\" (1967), saying, \"I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.\" Variations of the line have also been used by doctors in other \"Trek\" series, including Julian Bashir, Phlox, and the stationed aboard \"Voyager\".\nKelley parodied the phrase in a 1992 commercial for Trivial Pursuit's 10th Anniversary Edition, in which the question is asked, \"How many chambers are there in a human heart?\" replying \"How should I know? I'm an actor, not a doctor!\".\nIt is often believed that Kelley said \"Damn it, Jim!\" before the \"I'm a doctor\" line, but in reality \"damn\" was never said on the original show (although \"damning\" was used) because the word was considered taboo on TV in the 1960s.\nReception.\nIn a rebuttal to a tongue-in-cheek analysis in the \"Canadian Medical Association Journal\", which claimed that Dr. Nick from \"The Simpsons\" was a better role model than his competitor Dr. Hibbert, both of which were published in the same journal in 1998, both doctors are cast aside for Dr. McCoy, \"TV's only true physician\" and \"someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy. A free and independent thinker and, indeed, someone even beyond role models\".\nIn 2012, IGN ranked the character Doctor McCoy, as depicted in the original series, its films, and the 2009 film \"Star Trek,\" as the fifth-top character of the \"Star Trek\" universe, behind Data, Picard, Spock, and Kirk.\nIn 2016, Doctor McCoy was ranked as the fifth-most important character of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" science-fiction universe by \"Wired\".\nIn 2016, SyFy ranked McCoy third of the six main-cast space doctors of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nIn 2017, Screen Rant ranked the reboot film (Kelvin timeline) McCoy, played by Urban, as the 17th-most attractive person in the \"Star Trek\" universe.\nIn 2018, \"The Wrap\" placed Doctor McCoy as sixth out of 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the \"Star Trek\" franchise. In 2018, CBR ranked McCoy as the 11th-best Starfleet character of \"Star Trek.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Troi is half-human, half-Betazoid, and has the psionic ability to sense emotions. She serves as the ship's counselor on USS \"Enterprise\"-D. Throughout most of the series, she holds the rank of lieutenant commander. In the seventh season, Troi successfully passes the bridge officer's examination, gaining promotion to the rank of commander while maintaining her role as counselor.\nTroi appears in all four \"Next Generation\" theatrical films and also made guest appearances on ', ', ' and '.\nHer romantic interests, family and personal life are plot elements in many \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episodes.\nDepiction.\nDeanna Troi was born on March 29, 2336, near Lake El-Nar, Betazed. Troi's parents are Betazoid Ambassador Lwaxana Troi (portrayed by Majel Barrett) and deceased human Starfleet officer Lt. Ian Andrew Troi (portrayed by Amick Byram). An older sister, Kestra, died in a drowning accident during Troi's infancy. Although Deanna Troi has little exposure to Earth culture, she attended Starfleet Academy from 2355 to 2359, as well as the University of Betazed, and earned an advanced degree in psychology. As part of Betazoid aristocratic culture, Deanna, like her mother, is a Daughter of the Fifth House.\nDeanna Troi serves as the ship's counselor aboard the Starfleet starships USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701-D) and \"Enterprise\"-E under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. In \"\", Troi leaves the \"Enterprise\" with her new husband, William Riker, who has just been promoted to captain of the USS \"Titan\".\nTroi's empathic abilities prove key to the main shows, and other popular areas are her relationships and sexuality. In \",\" she gives birth to an alien child.\nThe Betazoid race has telepathic abilities. Due to her half-human heritage, Troi has only partial telepathic abilities and, as a result, is more of an empath with clairsentience. In \"Star Trek: Nemesis\", Troi has expanded her empathic abilities; she is able to connect to another psychic and follow that empathic bond to its source. In this instance, her ability enables \"Enterprise\"-E to target and hit the Romulan vessel \"Scimitar\", despite the fact that it is cloaked. She is also able to communicate telepathically with her mother and other telepathic Betazoids or races with sufficient aptitude. Several species are resistant to the telepathy and empathy of Betazoids, such as the Ferengi, the Breen and the Ulians.\nEarly in the series, Troi finds herself working with a former lover, the newly assigned first officer of the \"USS Enterprise\", Commander William Riker. In season one, she meets a potential spouse in \",\" In later episodes, Troi has romantic involvements with several others, including a brief relationship with Klingon Starfleet officer Lieutenant Worf. A major exploration of their relationship begins with \",\" in which Worf encounters parallel universes where they are married with children. Another episode that explores a Troi-Worf relationship is \"\". However, in both cases, they are not revealed to be dating aboard the \"real\" ship, although both episodes are oriented towards exploring this concept. In \",\" the beginnings of a real-world relationship are briefly explored, though this is abruptly dropped as Worf explores other love interests in \"\", and Troi's romantic relationship with Riker is rekindled through the \"Next Generation\" films.\nAs a main cast member, Troi appears in nearly every \"TNG\" episode, though particular episodes, starting with \"The Child,\" feature her as the primary protagonist. Her name is included in the show title \"M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Troi,\" which is oriented towards an adventure she and her mother have (besides Data and Q, this is one of the few cases where a character's name is in the episode title). Other episodes principally about Troi include: \",\" \",\" \"\" and \".\" The Season 7 episode \"Thine Own Self\" deals with Troi's attempts to pass the bridge officer's exam; she succeeds after several attempts and is promoted to Commander.\nFellow officers address her in various ways. Captain Picard calls her \"Counselor,\" but when he is concerned about her or in emergencies, he calls her \"Deanna.\" Picard also refers to her as \"Commander\" in the pilot episode, \"Encounter at Farpoint,\" which is consistent with her uniform's rank pips. In the pilot episode, Riker addresses her as \"Lieutenant\" only once; he does not refer to her service rank again for several seasons. Doctor Crusher (one of her most noted female friends) usually calls her \"Troi.\" Data rarely uses her first name, preferring to call her \"Counselor Troi.\" Depending on the situation, Commander Riker calls her \"Deanna\" or \"Imzadi,\" which means \"beloved\" in the Betazoid language.\nIn several episodes, Troi falls victim to aliens. In an episode of season four (\"\"), the \"Enterprise\"\u2019s crew loses a day's memory. An entity takes over Troi to communicate with the crew as events unfold. She temporarily gains \"superhuman\" strength and effortlessly tosses Worf across the bridge, breaking his wrist. In the season-five episode, \"Violations,\" the \"Enterprise\" encounters an alien species who are telepathic and specialize in being able to bring back lost memories. One of the aliens mentally assaults Deanna and also tries to physically assault her in her quarters. Worf and one of his security teams save her. In the film \"Star Trek: Nemesis\", Shinzon's telepathic viceroy violates her mental integrity. This violation occurs in her quarters when she is with her new husband, Commander Riker; it also occurs in the \"Star Trek: Nemesis\" bonus deleted scenes, where she is attacked in the turbolift. Eventually, she uses the same connection to flip the tables on the viceroy.\nTroi is an avid connoisseur of chocolate, a fact that is significant in multiple episodes, including one in which she tells Commander Riker how to properly enjoy eating it. In the episode \",\" Beverly Crusher briefly describes Troi to Captain Picard to jog his memory and mentions that she \"loves chocolate.\" She is known for ordering chocolate-flavored desserts in Ten-Forward, and her love for desserts is frequently mentioned in the series. She talks about this with a visiting alien ambassador in \",\" who takes up her love for desserts, as in their culture they do not have this type of food.\nDream-themed episodes include \",\" where Troi appears as cake in Data's dream, and in \"Night Terrors,\" her dreams help save the ship. The dreams a suitor thinks he is having about her in \"Haven\" become a major plot point in that episode.\nDevelopment and casting.\nMarina Sirtis at first read for the role that would become Tasha Yar in 1986. She had, in total, five readings, all with Gene Roddenberry and other executives. Roddenberry took a liking to her almost immediately. Denise Crosby, who eventually won the role of Tasha, auditioned for the role of Deanna Troi. Sirtis was said to have had a more \"exotic\" feel about her.\nShe was just about to return home, in debt and jobless, when she received the phone call alerting her that she had the role of Deanna Troi. She said she would have missed the call and been on her way to England if it had been an hour later. Sirtis' US visa was expiring that day, and if she had stayed any longer, she could have run into legal trouble.\nFor Sirtis, \"Star Trek\" was her first big break. Prior to Deanna Troi, her acting career was going nowhere: \"What they told us about \"The Next Generation\" when we started was that we were guaranteed 26 episodes. So that was the longest job I've ever had.\"\nSeries creator Gene Roddenberry initially intended Troi to be \"eye candy\": beautiful, sexy, and not very bright. He also conceptualized her as having four breasts, before his wife told him this was a bad idea. Prior to filming, Sirtis was told to lose , but she thought that she had to drop even more and was often wearing plunging necklines and form-fitting dresses. After six years, the producers decided to drop the \"sexy and brainless\" Troi and make her a stronger character, represented by changing her outfit to a standard crew uniform: I was thrilled when I got my regulation Starfleet uniform... it covered up my cleavage and I got all my brains back, because when you have cleavage, you can't have brains in Hollywood... I was allowed to do things that I hadn't been allowed to do for five or six years. I went on away teams, I was in charge of staff, I had my pips back, I had phasers, I had all the equipment again, and it was fabulous. I was absolutely thrilled.\nReception.\nOne reviewer compared her to Leonard McCoy from the original \"Star Trek\" television series. In 2018, CBR ranked Counselor Troi as the 25th-best Starfleet character of \"Star Trek\", in 2018; they note her role as an empath aboard \"Enterprise\" 1701-D. In 2017, \"IndieWire\" ranked Troi as the 9th-best character on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\nIn 2016, Troi was ranked as the 24th-most important character of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" universe by \"Wired\".\nIn 2017, \"Screen Rant\" ranked Troi the 12th-most attractive person in the \"Star Trek\" universe.\nIn 2018, \"CBR\" ranked Troi the 25th-best member of Starfleet.\nIn 2019, Troi was ranked the sixth-sexiest \"Star Trek\" character by SyFy.\nIn 2020, \"Tom's Guide\" recommended the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episodes \"M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Troi\", \"\" and \"Thine Own Self\" as having some of the best moments for this character.\nIn 2020, SyFy Wire was very positive about her performance in the \"Star Trek: Picard\" episode \"Nepenthe,\" explaining that \"It features Deanna Troi at her very best, with Marina Sirtis at the height of her powers.\"\nFranchise appearances.\nBesides being a regular in \"The Next Generation\" and its films, Deanna Troi appears in three episodes of ' (\",\" \",\" and \"\") together with Reginald Barclay, and in the final episode of ', \"These Are the Voyages...,\" with William Riker.\nTroi appears in the \"\" season 1 episode \"Nepenthe,\" set twenty years after \"Nemesis\" where she is married to Riker and they have two children, Thad and Kestra. Deanna and her husband extend a warm welcome to Jean-Luc Picard and his android companion Soji when they visit the Rikers' home. Deanna and Will are both retired from Starfleet, although Will is described as being on \"active reserve.\"\nDeanna appears in a recurring capacity in the first half of season 3, which includes flashbacks to her motherhood. She is later revealed to have been abducted by the antagonists of the season and is reunited with Riker, who had fallen into an existential crisis after Thad's death and needed to temporarily separate from her to get outside help from Picard. They discuss their marital issues in their detainment, realizing their relationship had turned into one of toxic codependency and longing for adventure. The \"Enterprise\" crew reunites with the couple aboard a new incarnation of the \"USS Titan\" after Worf rescues them.\nTroi appears in the first-season finale of the animated \"\", set a year after the events of \"Nemesis\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Portrayed by LeVar Burton, he served as helmsman of the USS \"Enterprise\"-D in the of \"The Next Generation\", then occupied the role of the chief engineer for the rest of the series and in the films before appearing as a commodore in \"Picard\". La Forge has been blind since his birth and uses technological devices that allow him to see \u2013 a VISOR in the series and the first film, replaced by ocular prosthetic implants in the last three films and in \"Picard\".\nConcept and development.\nGene Roddenberry created the character in honor of George La Forge, a quadriplegic fan of the , who died in 1975. He was not the first to honor La Forge in the \"Star Trek\" franchise; a character directly named for George La Forge was written into the 1980 \"Star Trek\" novel \"The Galactic Whirlpool\" by David Gerrold.\nA casting call was placed with agencies for the role, which described him as friends with Data, and specified that La Forge should have \"perfect diction and might even have a Jamaican accent\" and instructed those agencies not to submit \"any 'street' types.\"\nLeVar Burton auditioned for the role in 1986. He had previously appeared in \"Roots\" and other major network shows. He stated that \"years ago I was doing a TV movie called \"Emergency Room\" and it was a fairly miserable experience. But there was a producer on that show, a man named Bob Justman... six, seven years later, I get this call from Bob Justman and he's working at Paramount on this new Star Trek series and he said I remember your love of the show, we've got this character, would you be interested in coming in and seeing us? And I said was [franchise creator] Gene Roddenberry involved? He said he is. And I said I'll be right there.\" Roddenberry was very pleased with Burton at his first audition. Among the other actors considered for the role were Wesley Snipes, Reggie Jackson, Kevin Peter Hall, Clarence Gilyard, and Tim Russ, who would later play Tuvok on \"\". Snipes was close to getting cast, but lost to Burton; he would later say that he was disappointed at first, but later said that he was grateful how things turned out saying if he had gotten the role he would have been in television more than film.\nBurton also commented that he was anxious about his role, because he feared that \"The Next Generation\" was going to flop: \"At the beginning, you know, there was a lot of conversation in the press at what a bad idea this was [but] I thought that since Gene was involved we had a real good shot of making a good show that would carry on in that tradition of Star Trek.\"\nThroughout the series, Burton was equipped with Geordi La Forge's trademark VISOR, which he found extremely unpleasant to wear:It's pretty much a living hell. 85 to 90% of my vision is taken away when the VISOR goes on. I bumped into everything the first season\u2014light stands, overhead microphones, cables at my feet\u2014I tripped over it all. So it's a sort of conundrum. The blind man, who puts on the VISOR and sees much more than everyone else around him, when the actor actually does that he's turned into a blind person. Then there was the pain. In the second season, we re-designed the VISOR and made it heavier and the way we actually affixed it was that we screwed it, we literally screwed it into my head and so there were screws that we would turn and there were flanges on the inside that would press into my temples and so after fifteen or twenty minutes of that I got headaches. So I had a daily headache for about six years. Which was also no fun.During the series, Burton's character was Chief Engineering Officer, and thus was often portrayed repairing machines or discovering new scientific phenomena. Burton commented how hard it sometimes was to deliver the technobabble used by La Forge in these scenes with a straight face: \"Technobabble brings with it its own challenge. I'm not an engineer, I just played one on TV. The methodology that I found most successful was to really spit it out as fast as I possibly could. Giving the illusion that I knew what I was talking about when, in fact, I really didn't.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLt. (J.G.)

His closest friend is Data, and the two of them are particularly efficient when working together on away missions. Because of his \"eyes\", Geordi can also perform some of the functions of a tricorder.\n Gene Roddenberry, Geordi La Forge's description, \"Star Trek: The Next Generation Writer/Director's Guide\", March 23, 1987.\n Asked about his favorite scenes, Burton answered that he especially liked holodeck adventures: \"The Holmes and Watson episodes for Data and Geordi, the Robin Hood episode, you know, those were a lot of fun for us. I think the holodeck was a very cool concept, you know. You can create a three dimensional reality. I mean, how cool is that?\"\nFollowing the end of the series, Burton has stated how much he gained from \"The Next Generation\"; \"When I got married my best man was Brent (Spiner, who portrayed the series character Lieutenant Commander Data) and my groomsmen were Michael (Dorn, Lieutenant Worf) and Jonathan (Frakes, Commander Riker) and Patrick (Stewart, Captain Picard). No matter what, we will always be family to each other. I mean in every respect. There have been times when there have been feuds within the family, when it hasn't been all hugs and kisses. But we have stuck together.\"\nVISOR.\nIn universe.\nIn the \"Star Trek\" fictional universe, a VISOR is a device used by the blind to artificially provide them with a sense of sight. A thin, curved device worn over the face like a pair of sunglasses, the VISOR scans the electromagnetic spectrum, creating visual input, and transmits it into the brain of the wearer via the optic nerves. The sensors are located on the convex side, that covers the eyes and attaches at small input jacks implanted in the temples. The only VISOR seen on screen was used by Geordi La Forge, who was blind from birth. VISOR is an acronym for \"Visual Instrument and Sight Organ Replacement\"; however, the complete term never appeared in the series, but only in novelizations and other written tie-in products.\nThe VISOR also caused LaForge some persistent pain, which could not be treated without interfering with the device. Beverly Crusher and Katherine Pulaski, the two high-ranking doctors who served on the ship, were unfamiliar with the device when first meeting La Forge.\nThe device does not reproduce normal human vision, but does allow the character to \"see\" energy phenomena visible to the naked human eye while expanding the wearer's full perceived spectrum to 1\u00a0Hz \u2014 100 PHz. This also allowed the character to see human vital signs such as heart rate and temperature, giving him the ability to monitor moods and even detect lies in humans (but not aliens). In the episode \"Heart of Glory\", Captain Picard keys the main viewer to Geordi's visor allowing him to see the way he does. Seeing all the overlapping and different wavelengths was highly confusing to the Captain, prompting him to ask Geordi how he was able to differentiate between them all. Geordi's response made the comparison of a child hearing many different sounds at once and eventually being able to pick out what they needed; it is a learned talent.\nIn the episode , the access to Geordi's brain through the interface makes him a target of Romulan brainwashing.\nIn the episode , Geordi uses an experimental interface to his VISOR. In an environment too dangerous for humans to be in, Geordi sees, hears, feels and acts through a robot.\nTwice in the series, Geordi refused to be granted natural vision, first by Commander Riker, who had been given extraordinary amounts of power by Q, because it would have come at the cost of Riker's humanity, and later by Doctor Katherine Pulaski.\nSometime between 2371 and 2373, before the time of the film \"\", Geordi's VISOR was replaced by cybernetic eyes, performing the same functions. On film, they are depicted using a combination of cosmetic contact lenses and CGI.\nThere was a short time period in ' where Geordi gained actual eyesight, due to the effects of fictional metaphasic radiation, in the atmosphere of the planet Ba'ku. However, the effects of the metaphasic radiation wore off after leaving the planet, and the cybernetic eyes were once again used in the film '.\nReality.\n\"New Scientist\" magazine reported on research as to whether a device similar to a VISOR can actually be created for blind or visually impaired people. Partial sight has been successfully restored to blind rats by installing an implant behind the retina.\nSeveral types of visual prosthesis are in development or trials in humans, and one device has been approved for sale in the European market. As of 2006[ [update]], 16 blind people worldwide have had sight partially restored in a procedure where electrodes implanted in their brains take impulses from a camera to allow patients to see lights and outlines of objects. There is a device developed by NASA called a Joint Optical Reflective Display, or JORDY, that is presumably named for Geordi La Forge.\nOn August 14, 2012, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published an article stating the encoding of image information by the retina into patterns of action potentials has been replicated successfully by a prosthetic device and scientists have successfully restored full vision to blind mice. Scientists were able to mimic this ocular response using glasses, and speculate that a similar pair of glasses may be available for human use within two years.\nLeVar Burton, who played the character of Geordi La Forge, disliked the VISOR prop because it restricted his peripheral vision \u2013 albeit less than its prototypes \u2013 and the constant pressure of the prop's arms on his temples caused headaches. In commentary for \"Star Trek Generations\", film writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga noted Burton also felt the prop limited him as an actor, as it denied him the use of his eyes in conveying emotion. The original prop was inspired by a one-piece women's hair clip brought to production by Michael Okuda during the initial conceptual development of the VISOR prop.\nFictional character biography.\nIn the series, Geordi was born blind and wears a VISOR, an arc-shaped prosthetic attached at the temples that provides him with vision. Interfacing directly with his brain, the device enables him to \"see\" much of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2013 radio waves, infrared, ultraviolet, and beyond, but not normal light perception, though it does allow Geordi to see the visible light section of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nLa Forge was born February 16, 2335, in Mogadishu, Somalia of the African Confederation on Earth to Silva La Forge, a Starfleet command track officer and eventual Captain of the USS \"Hera\" (NCC-62006) and Edward M. La Forge, a Starfleet exozoologist. He has also mentioned having a sister, Arianna. La Forge stated that with two parents in Starfleet he was an \"army brat\", frequently moving homes depending on where his parents were stationed around Earth (or other planets), which mirrors Burton's own youth (he was born on an American base in Germany). He attended Zefram Cochrane High School and then Starfleet Academy from 2353 to 2357. In 2357, he was assigned as an ensign aboard the USS \"Victory\" under Captain Zimbata. After his first cruise, he was transferred to the USS \"Hood\" serving with then Lt. Commander William Riker for her 2361-64 cruise, during which he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade.\nLa Forge once impressed Captain Jean-Luc Picard by staying up all night to fix a shuttle craft that Picard mentioned had a superficial problem. Upon learning this, Picard decided he wanted Geordi on his next command which ended up being the USS \"Enterprise\"-D where Geordi was assigned to him as a helmsman. At the beginning of , he was promoted to Lieutenant and named Chief Engineer; in , he rose to Lieutenant Commander, a rank that he held for the duration of the series and movies. He and the android Data, the second officer aboard the \"Enterprise-D\", quickly become friends.\nIn 2372, Geordi is transferred to the new \"Sovereign\"-class starship \"Enterprise\"-E. When the ship travels back in time to the 21st century, he works alongside Dr. Zefram Cochrane and helps him successfully launch Earth's first warp-capable vessel and achieve first contact with the Vulcans.\nDuring the Ba'ku incident, La Forge began to experience pain in his eyes after sojourning on the planet. Doctor Beverly Crusher removes his ocular implants to discover that his optic nerves have regenerated and he has gained normal sight. This effect is caused by the healing properties of the Ba'ku ring system and, at the time, it is speculated that the effect will fade after La Forge leaves Ba'ku. This diagnosis proved correct; La Forge again wears the implants in '.\nIn the of the sequel series \"\", La Forge is revealed to have fathered two daughters, Alandra and Sidney, who have joined Starfleet by 2401. Like their father, Alandra has become an engineer while Sidney has become a pilot. Alandra serves alongside Geordi while Sidney serves aboard the USS \"Titan\"; he has become overprotective of them nonetheless. La Forge has become a Commodore and is the head curator of the Starfleet Museum, wherein he has been working on a secret project for twenty years. Picard, Crusher, their son Jack, and the \"Titan\" crew, on the run from a Changeling conspiracy in Starfleet, seek La Forge's help to try to clone the ship's signals, but La Forge points out that Starfleet has upgraded their ships to \"talk\" to each other. However, when his daughters and Jack steal a cloaking device from the Museum and install it on the \"Titan\", La Forge reluctantly goes along with them, whereupon he is reunited with an altered form of Data, fighting with his \"evil twin\" Lore for control of their common android body. La Forge helps Data overcome Lore's dominance of the body, which allows Data to kill the main antagonist of the season. La Forge is reunited with the rest of the \"Enterprise\" crew; he helps Data and Crusher find the true nature of Picard's neurological disorder and loses his daughters to it, forcing La Forge to reveal his secret project: the full reconstruction of the \"Enterprise\"-D. Picard uses the \"Enterprise\" to infiltrate the antagonists' collaborators' base; La Forge assumes temporary command, letting Crusher destroy the base's power source with the \"Enterprise\"'s torpedoes, eliminating the collaborators' threat once and for all, and oversees Picard's rescue. La Forge greets his daughters, who have been returned to normal, on the \"Titan\" over video; he is last seen playing poker with his \"Enterprise\" crewmates at the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles, content with his life.\nAlternate timelines.\nIn one of the alternate universes experienced by Worf in the Season 7 episode \"\", Geordi is killed in a Cardassian attack on the \"Enterprise\" when Worf is suddenly confronted with unfamiliar tactical controls and cannot raise the shields in time. Geordi's VISOR is revealed to be the trigger of Worf's unplanned shifts through the timelines.\nIn the alternate timeline of \"The Next Generation\" series finale \"\", La Forge has, by 2395, married \"Leah\" and had three children (Alandra, Brett, and Sydney) with her. He left Starfleet and became a novelist. However, these events may never happen because of the divergence of the time line at the episode's end.\nIn the alternate 2390 future in \"\"'s \"\", La Forge is a captain and the commanding officer of the USS \"Challenger\", doing his best to stop Harry Kim and Chakotay from altering the time line. He had micro-implants in his eyes, allowing him to see without wearing his visor. However, Kim and Chakotay succeed in their mission, erasing the alternate time line. Despite trying his best to stop them, La Forge is sympathetic to their actions and even offers a full pardon if they stop. When they refuse, La Forge is forced to attack, but wishes them good luck and says that in their place, he would probably do the same. When the group's ship suffers a warp core breach and is going to explode, he offers to beam them aboard his ship so that they can survive, but they refuse and tell him to move off to a safe distance, which he does.\nIn the holographic alternate history depicted in \"Future Imperfect\", a fictitious La Forge had cloned eye implants and had no need of his VISOR.\nDuring the non-canon events of the comic book mini-series \"\" (a prequel to the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film), Geordi (now a civilian) is reunited with Data and Picard during an effort to stop a massive supernova that threatens all of existence. Geordi ultimately designs the \"Jellyfish\", the advanced spacecraft that is piloted by Ambassador Spock in the film.\nReception.\nCritics and fans have responded favorably to the character. Burton himself has complained on DVD featurettes about the lack of romantic interests for his character. At least one scholar, however, states that out of seven principal black characters across the \"Star Trek\" series, only La Forge and Tuvok \"really qualify as nerds, and neither of them compares with the extraordinary geekiness of the teenaged Wesley Crusher.\" According to Dr. Ron Eglash, the construction of the La Forge character stands up to the standards of Afrofuturism.\nIn David Greven's book \"Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek\" (2009), he described the use of the VISOR as a means to obscure the face of the character, describing it as a \"surprisingly clunky symbol of blindness\". However, he felt that the bionic eyes used in the film series were an improvement but followed a pattern of African American eye modifications in fantasy and science fiction films such as Halle Berry as Storm in \"X-Men\" (2000). Greven suggested that these changes were to create the impression that the wearer was alien in nature and to highlight the difference between that character/actor and the others in the film.\nIn 2018, TheWrap ranked Geordi as the 11th best main cast character of \"Star Trek\" shows, noting his ability to come up with technical solutions on short notice and his friendship with Data. In 2016, the character of Geordi was ranked as the 21st most important character of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" science fiction universe by \"Wired\" magazine. In 2016, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked \"\" as the 62nd greatest of the \"Star Trek\" franchise up to that time, noting that LeVar Burton has many great scenes with original cast veteran James Doohan reprising his famous character Scotty.\nIn 2017, IndieWire rated Geordi as the 8th best character on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". CBR ranked La Forge as the 13th best Starfleet character of \"Star Trek\", in 2018.\nIn 2017, Screen Rant ranked La Forge the 9th most attractive person in the \"Star Trek\" universe. In 2018, \"The Wrap\" placed La Forge as 11th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the \"Star Trek\" franchise prior to \"\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is an acknowledged linguistic genius and expert at operating the universal translator, a key instrument in allowing the crew to communicate with alien cultures.\nBiography.\nRelatively little of Sato's background was explored in the series. She briefly suffered from space sickness and claustrophobia. The fourth season episode \"\" revealed that she was once dishonourably discharged from Starfleet for running a floating poker game and breaking the arm of a Starfleet instructor who tried to break it up (she has a black belt in Aikido). She was subsequently allowed to reenlist because of her exceptional linguistic skills.\nBefore posting to the \"Enterprise\", she taught linguistics in Brazil; it is not known whether she was an active Starfleet officer at the time, or was reactivated to serve under Jonathan Archer. She later (also in \"Observer Effect\") expressed regret at leaving without saying goodbye to her students.\nFate.\nAccording to a computer bio screen, shown in the episode \"In a Mirror, Darkly\", and taken from the memory banks of the USS \"Defiant\", Sato was born in Kyoto, Japan. She was instrumental in the development of the universal translator. She eventually marries a man named Takashi Kimura, and retires from Starfleet with the rank of lieutenant commander.\nMirror Universe.\nIn the Mirror Universe, Sato held the rank of Lieutenant. In addition to being the communications officer, she acted as the \"Captain's Woman\" (a combination yeoman/concubine) of and then Commander Jonathan Archer after Archer took control of the ISS \"Enterprise\".\nAfter Archer used the USS \"Defiant\" to put down the rebellion, Sato poisoned him and took command of the ship, taking the Mirror Travis Mayweather as a new consort. Upon reaching Earth, she demanded Earth's surrender and proclaimed herself Empress.\nKey episodes.\nEpisodes in which Sato's character is expanded or plays a key role:\nReception.\nAccording to author David Greven, \"Ensign Hoshi Sato is an Asian American linguist and the communications officer. Prone to fearful fits and generally seen as ineffectual in any terms other than the linguistic aspects of her job, Hoshi is the resident screamer.\"\nConsulting producer and writer during season 1, Fred Dekker said Hoshi was his favorite character to write for as he felt she was the most human and relatable of the crew.\nIn 2001 in an interview with Ian Spelling of \"The New York Times\", actress Linda Park who portrays character Hoshi Sato on \"Enterprise\" cited \"Fight or Flight\" as an example of the progression and growth of her character during the series.\nIn 2004, IGN said \"Linda Park is possibly the most under-utilized actor on the show and shows the most potential.\"\nIn 2013, \"Slate magazine\" ranked Hoshi Sato one of the ten best crew characters in the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nIn 2015, \"Den of Geek\" noted how Hoshi showed the importance of communication and the depth of her linguistic abilities. They recommended the episodes \"\" and \"Vox Sola\" as watches for the Hoshi character.\nIn 2016, \"The Wrap\" ranked Hoshi the 37th, on a list of 39 of the best characters in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. They noted her importance as a translator but called her \"a poor man's Uhura\" and said the writers failed to flesh out the character beyond her basic premise.\n\"Wired\" ranked Lt. Commander Hoshi Sato the 27th-most important Starfleet character in the \"Star Trek\" universe."}
{"id": "27110", "revid": "18935077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27110", "title": "Romulan", "text": "Extraterrestrial humanoid species in the Star Trek franchise\nThe Romulans () are an extraterrestrial race in the American science fiction franchise \"Star Trek\". Their adopted home world is Romulus, and within the same star system they have settled a sister planet Remus. They first appeared in the series ' (1966\u20131969). They have appeared in most subsequent \"Star Trek\" releases, including ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', and '. They appear in the \"Star Trek\" feature films ' (1989), ' (1991), \"\" (2002) and \"Star Trek\" (2009). They also appear in various other spin-off media, including books, comics, toys and games.\nWriter Paul Schneider created the Romulans for the 1966 \"\" episode \"Balance of Terror\". As a basis, he considered what the ancient Roman Empire might have looked like had it developed to the point of spaceflight. Physically, the Romulans were presented as humanoid, but the show's make-up department gave them pointed ears to distinguish them from humans. In the series, which is set in the 23rd century, the Romulans were speculated as having split from another alien species, the Vulcans, in the distant past. In contrast to the Vulcans, who were presented as peaceful and logic-oriented philosopher scientists, the Romulans were depicted as militaristic, having founded an interstellar empire. The Romulans were used as antagonists for the series' protagonists, the starship USS \"Enterprise\", her crew, and their government, the United Federation of Planets.\nIn 1987, the writers of '\u2014set in the 24th century\u2014again used the Romulans as antagonists of the Federation. The show's designers gave the Romulans new costumes and added a V-shaped ridge on the foreheads of most Romulan characters, though with indications that Romulans without the ridges also existed. In the series ', Romulans without ridges are depicted as passing for Vulcans (who do not have ridges either). The 2009 film \"Star Trek\" depicted the Romulan homeworld, Romulus, being destroyed by a supernova in the year 2387. This film featured Romulans without the head ridges. The impact of Romulus's destruction forms a plot-theme in the series \"\". \nHistory.\nOriginal development.\nThe Romulans are a fictional extraterrestrial species in the Star Trek universe and were devised for the episode \"Balance of Terror\". They were reused for the second-season episode \"The Deadly Years\" and the third-season episode \"The Enterprise Incident\".\nThey are humanoid beings originating from the planet Romulus and are known for their cunning, secrecy, and often adversarial relations with other civilizations, especially the United Federation of Planets. Physiologically, Romulans are similar to Vulcans, another species in the Star Trek universe. In fact, Romulans share a common ancestry with Vulcans and are considered an offshoot of the same species. They have pointed ears and arched eyebrows, and possess great strength, intelligence, and longevity.\nThe Romulans diverged from their Vulcan counterparts millennia ago due to ideological differences. While Vulcans embraced logic and the teachings of Surak, advocating emotional control and pacifism, the Romulans rejected these principles. They embraced their emotions and maintained a more militaristic and secretive society. Romulans are known for their cunning strategies, espionage, and manipulation in political affairs. They have a powerful and formidable military, with their signature warbird starships being a symbol of their might.\nThroughout various Star Trek series and films, the Romulans have been portrayed as complex adversaries with deep-seated cultural traditions and a sense of superiority over other species. Their interactions with other factions in the Star Trek universe often involve political intrigue, espionage, and attempts to expand their influence in the galaxy. \nWhile based on the Roman Empire, they took on the adversarial role of Cold War era Communist China, with the fictional government the United Federation of Planets playing the role of the United States, and the Klingons, based on the Mongol Empire, acting the role of the Soviet Union. As a result, the Romulans were generally portrayed as mysterious, but also \"highly militaristic, aggressive by nature, and ruthless in warfare\". The make-up required for an episode including Romulans in the Original Series became too expensive and time-consuming, so the Romulans became largely overshadowed by the Klingons.\nReintroduction in the 1980s and 1990s.\nAfter the launch of \" in 1987, the show's writers introduced the Romulans in the final episode of the first season, \", which aired in the U.S. in May 1988. The episode was written by Maurice Hurley, who later acknowledged rushing it, putting together a script in a day and a half. In the episode, which is set in the year 2364, the Starfleet ship USS \"Enterprise\"-D\u2014whose crew are the series' main protagonists\u2014responds to the disappearance of Federation colonies along the Neutral Zone, fearing that it reflects growing Romulan activity in the region. Investigating, the \"Enterprise\" crew encounter a Romulan spaceship; it is stated that this is the first encounter between the two peoples for 53 years. The Romulans reveal that they have had colonies destroyed on their side of the border too, and the two species agree to share information on the issue in future. In later episodes it is revealed that these colonies were destroyed by a previously unknown species, the Borg, whom the show's writers had devised as a new alien antagonist following dissatisfaction with their previous attempt, the Ferengi. Initial thoughts by the script-writers had proposed a multi-episode storyline in which the Federation and Romulan governments would co-operate to fight the Borg; ultimately only certain elements of this idea entered \"The Neutral Zone\", and the Borg would be introduced not in the first season, but in the second-season episode \"Q Who\".\nNew costumes were designed for the actors playing Romulans, created by the show's costume designer William Theiss.\nThe newly designed Romulan ship that appeared in \"The Neutral Zone\" was built as a miniature model by Greg Jein. The ship featured a newly designed Romulan crest, featuring a stylised bird of prey clutching two planets, Romulus and Remus, in its claws. Later in the series, this ship type would be explicitly referred to as a \"warbird\". In 1989, AMT released a plastic kit of the vessel, alongside other kits for a Ferengi ship and a Klingon bird of prey vessel.\nThe Romulans were re-used for the second-season episode \"\", written by Steve Gerber and Beth Woods and first aired in March 1989. In this episode, the \"Enterprise\"-D entered the Neutral Zone to answer a distress call and ends up in conflict with a Romulan vessel, with both spaceships being disabled by an alien computer virus. \"Contagion\" was the first episode in the \"Star Trek\" franchise in which the Romulan ship was given a name, in this case the \"Haakona\". In the third-season episode \"\", written by David Kemper and Michael Piller and first screened in November 1989, the \"Enterprise\"-D is depicted rescuing a crashed Romulan ship. The episode introduced the Romulan character Tomalak, played by Andreas Katsulas, who would reappear in three further \"Next Generation\" episodes. It also further established the idea of a significant enmity between the Romulans and the Klingons, with the \"Enterprise\"'s Klingon officer, Worf (Michael Dorn), refusing to donate blood to save the life of an injured Romulan; the scriptwriters had debated whether to include this, with Dorn initially reticent.\nThree episodes later, in \"\", written by Ronald D. Moore and first screened in January 1990, a Romulan admiral is presented as seeking to defect to the Federation. The episode is the first in the franchise to include images of Romulus itself and introduced the design of a Romulan scout vessel. \"The Defector\" also includes a reference to the Battle of Cheron, an incident in the 22nd century Earth-Romulan War that was previously mentioned in \"Balance of Terror\".\n\"Deep Space Nine\" and \"Voyager\".\nFor \", the opening two-part episode of the third season of \", a Romulan link was introduced. The episode, which was written by Ira Steven Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and Ronald D. Moore, featured the introduction of a new Starfleet ship, the USS \"Defiant\"; the scriptwriters included the idea that it had been equipped with a cloaking device by the Romulans in return for intelligence that the Federation gathered on another alien power, the Dominion. A Romulan character, T'Rul (Martha Hackett), was included to oversee the device's use aboard the \"Defiant\". The show's writers had initially planned on including T'Rul as a permanent fixture on the show but decided that she did not offer enough potential for new storylines.\nThe Romulans were reused later that season in \"\", where they are presented as attempting to destroy the Deep Space Nine space station as part of their plan to collapse the nearby wormhole and thus prevent a Dominion invasion of the Alpha Quadrant, the region of space where both the Federation and Romulans reside. Three episodes later, the follow-on episodes \"Improbable Cause\" and \"\" again featured the Romulans, in this case portraying a joint mission by the Romulan Tal Shiar and Cardassian Obsidian Order to fatally cripple the Dominion by eradicating its leaders, the Founders. For these episodes, new Tal Shiar outfits were designed; Moore related that this was partly his decision, for he \"hated, underline hated, the Romulan costumes [introduced in the first season of \"The Next Generation\"]. Big shoulder pads, the quilting, I just loathed it\". Costume designer Robert Blackman noted that his team created eight new Romulan uniforms, using the same fabric as the old ones but \"dyed it down slightly, and we made them much sleeker and a little more menacing\".\n\"Star Trek: Nemesis\".\nThe Romulans were the major antagonists in the 2002 film \"Star Trek: Nemesis\", with much of the action set on Romulus. The film also introduced the Remans, inhabitants of the other planet in the Romulan system, who serve as a slave labor caste in Romulan society.\n\"Star Trek: Enterprise\".\nIn , the Romulans played a pivotal role in the episodes \"Kir'Shara\", \"Babel One\", \", and \"The Aenar\". In \"Kir'Shara\", it's revealed that Administrator V'Las of the Vulcan High Command is actually conspiring with a Romulan agent to \"reunify\" their two peoples through force. The agent, Major Talok, chases Captain Archer, T'Pol and T'Pau through the area of Vulcan known as The Forge throughout the episode, although his true nature isn't revealed until the end. In addition, in the previous episode \"\", Archer learned from Surak that during the \"Time of Awakening\", a Vulcan schism of those who \"sought a return to savage ways\" and \"marched beneath the raptor's wings\" (later the symbol of the Romulan people) perpetrate a cataclysmic nuclear attack upon Surak and his enlightened society. Soon after Surak's death, these Vulcan recidivists abandoned their homeworld to colonize the planets Romulus and Remus.\nIn \"Babel One\", \"United\", and \"The Aenar\", the Romulans plot to destabilize their sector of space by using drone ships disguised as vessels from various cultures to turn their enemies against each other. These drone ships are piloted remotely through telepresence by Gareb, a young Aenar kidnapped by the Romulans who had lied to him that he was the last of his people. The plot was exposed by the efforts of the \"Enterprise\" crew and instead resulted in the humans, Vulcans, Andorians, and Tellarites uniting to defeat the Romulan threat, bringing them closer together than ever. The \"Enterprise\" then enlists the help of Gareb's sister Jhamel who telepathically contacts her brother and informs him of the truth. Gareb turns on the Romulans, destroying one drone ship and allowing the \"Enterprise\" to destroy the other, foiling the Romulan plot. In retaliation, Romulan Admiral Valdore kills Gareb for his betrayal.\nReboot: 2009\u2013present.\nAfter \"Star Trek: Nemesis\" proved a financial failure and \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" was cancelled, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film entitled \"Star Trek: The Beginning\", which was to be set during the 22nd century Earth\u2013Romulan War. The project never materialised. Instead, the decision was made to reboot the series by creating a film using the characters of the original \"Star Trek\" series but played by new actors. Putting together a script for the new film, the director J. J. Abrams stated that he wanted Romulans to be the antagonists because they had featured less than the Klingons in the original \"Star Trek\" series. The film's writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, thought that it would feel backward to demonize the Klingons as villains again after they had been presented heroically in later \"Star Trek\" series; they also wanted to use Spock as a central character in the film and believed that the Romulan presence would continue Spock's story from his last chronological appearance in \"\".\nIn the 2009 Abrams reboot film, titled \"Star Trek\", the planet Romulus is destroyed by a supernova in the year 2387. A Romulan mining ship, the \"Narada\", survives and travels back in time to the 23rd century; its commander, Nero (Eric Bana), is committed to destroying the planet Vulcan to punish Spock for failing to save Romulus. The actors playing Romulans in this film wore three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends to the back of his character's head. The film's Romulans lacked the V-shaped ridges on the foreheads, which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series. Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Nero's crew ritually scar themselves too, forming keloids reminiscent of the \"V\"-ridges. It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough.\nPicard's reaction to the destruction of Romulus is the backstory and central premise of \"\". The series begins with Picard in self-imposed exile at his French vineyard following his resignation in protest to Starfleet's handling of Romulans and androids. Picard has two live-in Romulans at his estate. At least two groups of Romulans survived: one group formed the Romulan Free State, while the other group was evacuated to the planet of Vashti.\nIn the ' episode \"Unification III\", Ambassador Spock's dream of Vulcan/Romulan reunification has been achieved. The Romulans have returned to their ancestral homeworld (since renamed Ni'Var) and reunified with their Vulcan cousins. When the Vulcans decided to pull out of the Federation due to the apocalyptic event known as the Burn, it was actually the Romulans who wished to remain, according to Starfleet Admiral Vance. In the episode \"All Is Possible\", Ni'Var rejoins the Federation.\nRomulan Warbird.\nThe Warbird was developed by Andrew Probert with the model built by Greg Jein. In the series it was introduced in the episode \"The Neutral Zone\" and seen on a recurring basis in the franchise from then on. In the \"Star Trek\" universe, it is twice as big as Picard's Enterprise D and is powered by an artificial quantum singularity. It is noted for its size and power in \"Star Trek\" by Picard and his crew. \nIn 2017, Space.com said the Warbird was the 9th best spacecraft in the Star Trek franchise. In 2020, CNET ranked the Romulan Warbird the 16th most powerful spacecraft in \"Star Trek\".\nRomulan language.\nTwo fictional languages have been constructed for the Romulans and Remans of the Star Trek franchise.\nThe first was created by Diane Duane for her non-canon series of novels called \"Rihannsu\". In this imagining, it was an intentional creation, based on Old High Vulcan when the Romulans left Vulcan and established their own society. Duane describes it as sounding somewhat like Latin and Welsh.\nThe second was created for the television series \"\". Its script is distinct from occasional glimpses of Romulan writing in earlier series.

Kirk, is the main setting of the original \"Star Trek\" series and \"\" (1973\u201374). Matt Jefferies designed the ship, and its core components \u2013 a saucer-shaped primary hull, and cylindrical secondary hull, and a pair of outriding engine nacelles \u2013 established the core ship design for the franchise. \"Enterprise\" footage was rotoscoped for its depiction in the animated spinoff.\nShip: Refit USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701\nIntroduction: \"\" (1979)\nJefferies created an updated \"Enterprise\" design for the ' series. He left the project when \"Phase II\" halted and production began on the first \"Star Trek\" film, \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\". Several artists, including Andrew Probert, contributed to the film redesign. Several aspects of the ship, such as the engine nacelle grills, were influenced by art deco. The ship's significantly different appearance compared to the television show was attributed to an 18-month refit. The ship is heavily damaged in ' (1982), and it is destroyed in \"\" (1984).\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-A\nIntroduction: \"\" (1986)\nCaptain Kirk is given command of a new vessel named \"Enterprise\" at the end of \"Star Trek IV\". Despite being a new ship narratively, the producers used the same filming model, redressed to include the new \"NCC-1701-A\" registry. The vessel appears in the next two films, ' (1989) and ' (1991). The ship is ordered decommissioned at the end of the sixth film, and it later appears as part of the Starfleet Museum in the (2023).\n\"The Next Generation\" productions.\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-D\nIntroduction: \"\" (1987\u20131994)\nAndrew Probert designed the \"Enterprise\" created for the franchise's return to television, taking place on a new \"Enterprise\" led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard 70 years after the events in the original series. This \"Enterprise\" also appears in the first film featuring the \"Next Generation\" cast, \"Star Trek Generations\" (1994). The ship's engineering section is destroyed in \"Generations\", but its saucer section crash lands on an alien planet. In the third season of \"Star Trek: Picard\", the saucer section has been attached to a different vessel's engineering hull, and it features prominently in the show's climax before becoming part of the Fleet Museum.\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-C\nIntroduction: \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" (1990) episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"\nA third-season episode of \"The Next Generation\" includes a depiction of the \"Enterprise\"-D's predecessor, the \"Enterprise\"-C. Rick Sternbach used an illustration created by Andrew Probert as the design basis for the \"Enterprise\"-C, executing a final design that could be more easily produced on a television episode's budget. Led by Captain Rachel Garrett, the \"Enterprise\"-C is destroyed protecting a Klingon outpost from a Romulan attack, strengthening an alliance between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-B\nIntroduction: \"Star Trek: Generations\" (1994)\nThe opening of \"Generations\" depicts the maiden voyage of the \"Enterprise\"-B, during which James Kirk is lost and presumed dead. The vessel serves after Kirk's \"Enterprise\"-A and before the \"Enterprise\"-C from \"Yesterday's \"Enterprise\"\". The filming model was a modification of the \"Excelsior\" created for \"Star Trek III\", with some components added to depict damage to the ship without harming the underlying model.\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-E\nIntroduction: \"\" (1996)\nWith the \"Enterprise-\"D's loss in \"Generations\", a new film vessel for Picard and his crew was designed as the main setting for its sequels: \"Star Trek: First Contact\", ' (1998), and ' (2002). It also appears in the first-season finale of ' (2022) and the series finale of ' (2024). The ship is disabled or destroyed under Worf's command. In 2018 and 2019, io9 and SyFy, respectively, ranked the \"Enterprise\"-E, as the third-best version of starship \"Enterprise\" of the \"Star Trek\" franchise. In 2014, a building in China was designed to resemble the ship.\nReturn to television.\nShip: \"Enterprise,\" NX-01\nIntroduction: \"\" (2001\u20132005)\nStarfleet's \"Enterprise\" is the main setting of \"Star Trek: Enterprise\", which takes places a century before the original \"Star Trek\". Under the command of Captain Jonathan Archer, the vessel is the first Earth-built starship capable of reaching Warp 5. Initial designs of the \"Enterprise\" were deemed too similar to the original 1960s vessel. The final design, created by Doug Drexler, is based on the features of the \"Akira\" class created by Alex Jeager for \"Star Trek: First Contact\".\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-J\nIntroduction: \"Azati Prime\" episode of \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" (2004)\nA third-season episode of \"Enterprise\" involves Captain Archer being transported to the 26th-century \"Enterprise\"-J. Doug Drexler drew the first design only two days prior to the production meeting for the episode. The computer-generated model was created in a few hours, and Drexler later said that they would have finished it differently. He imagined that the vessel was so large that there would be universities and entire parks on board, with the turbolifts replaced by short range transporters. More than one design was created, with the final version created with elements from different designs.\nFilm franchise reboot.\nShips: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701 and USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-A\nIntroduction: \"Star Trek\" (2009)\nA new \"Enterprise\" was designed for the film franchise relaunch, which began with \"Star Trek\" and continued with \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016). The new \"Enterprise\" was conceived as a \"hot rod\" while retaining elements from the original \"Enterprise\" and \"Motion Picture\" refit. At the end of \"Star Trek Into Darkness\", \"Enterprise\" has started its five-year mission under Captain Kirk. The ship is destroyed in \"Star Trek Beyond\", and a successor \"Enterprise\", with registry NCC-1701-A, is commissioned at the film's conclusion.\nStreaming services.\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701\nIntroduction: \"Will You Take My Hand?\" episode of \"\" (2018)\n\"Star Trek: Discovery's\" first-season finale, and several episodes of the second season, depict the USS \"Enterprise\" under the command of Captain Christopher Pike. \"\" (2022\u2013present) focuses on Pike's command of the \"Enterprise\", whose exterior and interiors were slightly modified from their \"Discovery\" appearance. John Eaves, Scott Schneider, and William Budge redesigned the \"Enterprise\" for its appearance in the streaming series.\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-F\nIntroduction: \"V\u00f5x\" episode of \"\" (2023)\nThis ship appears in the penultimate episode of \"Star Trek: Picard\" (2023) at the Frontier Day festival. The ship was originally designed by Adam Ihle as part of a fan competition for \"Star Trek Online\". Ihle's design has a \"familiar and recognizable\" shape while also offering an evolution in design. \"Star Trek Online\" artist Thomas Marrone updated the video game asset, and then sent the model to the series artists to incorporate into the show.\nShip: USS \"Enterprise\", NCC-1701-G\nIntroduction: \"The Last Generation\" episode of \"Star Trek: Picard\" (2023)\nThe USS \"Titan\" is the main setting for the third season of \"Star Trek: Picard\". In the series finale, that vessel is renamed USS \"Enterprise\" and placed under the command of Captain Seven of Nine. The ship is based on designs by Bill Krause\".\"\nReception and influence.\n\"Time\" described each iteration of the \"Enterprise\" as \"a character in its own right\". \"io9\" ranked the original design of the \"Enterprise\" as the best version of the \"Enterprise\" lineage, characterizing the original as still superior to all later versions. By contrast, SyFy ranked the refit design of the \"Enterprise\" from \"The Motion Picture\" and its sequels as the franchise's best.\nOver many decades, the starship has influenced activities of NASA. This includes a successful letter writing campaign by fans to name the initial flight-test Space Shuttle \"Enterprise\", and NASA's decision to name its IXS \"Enterprise\" advanced propulsion concept vehicle after the \"Star Trek\" vessel. NetDragon Websoft based the design of its Fuzhou headquarters building on the \"Enterprise\"-E under an official license from CBS.\nCelebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has spoken highly of the influence and legacy of the original \"Enterprise\" on other fictional spaceships. Drawing a parallel to comparing athletes between eras, he said of spaceship design, \"What matters is not what they look like now, but what they looked to others at the time that they prevailed... There is only one spaceship that's earlier than [the original \"Enterprise\"], and that's the flying saucer from \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". So, what matters here is, what did [the \"Enterprise\"] look like at the time it came out (1966) compared with anything that had been imagined before? And when you consider that, that is the most astonishing machine that has ever graced the screen.\" On the ship's influence upon scientists, Tyson wrote, \"The \"Enterprise\" was the first ever spaceship represented in storytelling that was not designed to go from one place to another; [it was] only designed to explore. It was revolutionary in terms of what we would think space would, and should, be about.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27113", "revid": "40325647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27113", "title": "Secularism", "text": "Position that religion should not influence civic and state affairs\nSecularism is the principle of seeking to conduct human affairs based on naturalistic considerations, uninvolved with religion. It is most commonly thought of as the separation of religion from civil affairs and the state and may be broadened to a similar position seeking to remove or to minimize the role of religion in any public sphere. Secularism may encapsulate anti-clericalism, atheism, naturalism, non-sectarianism, neutrality on topics of religion, or antireligion. Secularism is not necessarily antithetical to religion, but may be compatible with it. As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life based on principles derived solely from the material world, without recourse to religion. It shifts the focus from religion towards \"temporal\" and material concerns.\nThere are distinct traditions of secularism like the French, Turkish, American and Indian models. These differ greatly, from the American emphasis on avoiding an established religion and freedom of belief, to the French interventionist model, and more. The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely, ranging from assertions that it is a crucial element of modernization, or that religion and traditional values are backward and divisive, to the claim that it is the only guarantor of free religious exercise. \nBoth \"religion\" and \"secular\" are Western concepts that are not universal across cultures, languages, or time; with experiences of secularism varying significantly. Secularism has origins going back to the ancient world into religious texts such as the Bible, being refined through history by religious thinkers. Secular individuals hold complex relations to religion.\nVariations.\nSecularism takes different forms with varying stances on where and how religion should be separate from other aspects of society. People of any religious denomination can support a secular society, or adopt the principles of secularism, although secularist identity is often associated with non-religious individuals such as atheists. Political secularism encompasses the schools of thought in secularism that consider the regulation of religion by a secular state. Religious minorities and non-religious citizens tend to support political secularism while members of the majority religion tend to oppose it. Secular nationalists are people that support political secularism within their own state.\nScholars identify several variations of political secularism in society. The strictest form, associated with the French laique model, advocates a state that is both firmly and officially distanced from all religions and non-religious philosophical convictions in all of its manifestations and official dealings, without exception. A more \"humanistic\" form is indifferent towards religions \"per se\" but also advocates for the states to operate on purely a rational basis of evidence-based policy and a focus on human needs and welfare, entailing non-discrimination between peoples of differing religions and non-religious philosophical convictions throughout society. A third \"liberal\" or \"pillarized\" form of secularism holds that governments may in some instances express sympathy to, provide funding to, license state services to, or otherwise allow unique special treatment of religions (common in German-speaking and Benelux secular states), so long as states nevertheless treat these convictions equally, and are neither hostile nor preferential towards any particular set of religious or non-religious philosophical convictions such as humanists. In these countries, secular humanist organizations typically receive state funding according to the same funding formulas used to provide state funding to religious groups. In Indian political discourse, the pejorative term pseudo-secularism is also used to highlight instances where it is believed that while the state purports to be secular, indifferent, or impartial towards religions, its policies in reality favour a particular religion over others. \nThere are many principles that are associated with all forms of political secularism. It typically promotes legal equality between people of different religions, opposing a legal hierarchy on the basis of religious belief or lack of religious belief. It is also associated with a separation of church and state, considering these to be two distinct entities that should be treated separately. State supremacy is a secular principle that supports obedience to the rule of law over religious diktat or canon law, while internal constraint is a secular principle that opposes governmental control over one's personal life. Under political secularism, the government can enforce how people act but not what they believe. Similarly, freedom of thought is supported by secularism. Order is supported by secularists, specifically in that one's beliefs should not be permitted to disturb the civil peace. Religious tolerance is supported both for people of other religions and for a lack of piety demonstrated by members of one's own religion. Political secularism also supports reason as a virtue. Secularists also support freedom from religion as an extension to freedom of religion.\nHistory.\nSecularism and \"secular\" is a Western concept that is not universal across cultures, languages, or history. The term \"secularism\" was coined in 1851 in Britain. In societies such as Ancient Greece, a limited secularism was practised in which religion was not involved in governance, though it was still prevalent in public life.\nSecularism's origins can be traced to the Bible itself and fleshed out throughout Christian history into the modern era. The \"Secular\" is a part of the Christian church's history, which even has \"secular clergy\", since the medieval period. The distinction between secular and religious law was emphasized in the Late Antique and early medieval West. Secular and religious entities could be distinguished in the medieval period, but coexisted and interacted naturally. Significant contributions to principles used in modern secularism came from prominent theologians and Christian writers such as St. Augustine, William of Ockham, Marsilius of Padua, Martin Luther, Roger Williams, John Locke and Talleyrand. \nIn Europe, secularism emerged as a formal ideology in the early modern period. Due to functional differentiation, religion changed from being the predominant lens through which reality was interpreted to providing only an alternative explanatory approach.\nIn 1636, Roger Williams founded the Providence Plantations as a settlement with total freedom of religion, in present-day Rhode Island. Secular ideas were strongly challenged by religious leaders and the Catholic Church in particular, causing a religious culture war. During the American Revolution, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison incorporated the ideas of John Locke into the government of the United States, including his secularism, though a true secular state was not achieved until the 20th century. French secularism in the Age of Enlightenment was based on Gallicanism, which emphasised state supremacy, as well as anti-clericalism and materialism. Revolutionary France opposed Catholic influence in the country, and it briefly replaced Christianity with the deistic Cult of Reason.\nThe first to use the already-extant word \"secularism\" in a modern sense, was the British agnostic writer George Holyoake, in 1851. Finding \"atheism\" too aggravating, he sought a term that would describe a stance advocating to conduct life based on naturalistic (secular) considerations only, but without necessarily rejecting religion, thus enabling cooperation with believers. Holyoake's definition of secularism differs from its usage by later writers. As the Humanist Heritage website notes, Holyoake provides a definition of secularism \"much akin to modern definitions of humanism... broader than just atheism.\" More modern definitions of secularism are likely to pertain to separation of church and state rather than personal beliefs.\nMany Christian countries began to undergo societal secularisation during the 20th century, with levels of belief and practice declining. Sociologists disagree as to whether this represents a periodic fluctuation or a larger trend toward long-term adoption of secularism. The principle of \"La\u00efcit\u00e9\", the French notion of strict separation, was enshrined into law in 1905. After the rise to power of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in 1923, Turkish secularism, or \"laiklik\", became a state ideology under Kemalism, aiming to modernise the country. Turkey's secular tradition prior to Atat\u00fcrk's reforms was limited, and 20th century Turkish secularism was initially modelled after French \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\". Turkey remains virtually the only Muslim-majority nation with an effective secular government, though secularism remains a controversial ideology in Turkey, and the country's ruling party AKP is more anti-Kemalist than anti-secularist. India became a secular state after it achieved independence in 1947; Mahatma Gandhi supported pluralist secularism as a means to curb tensions in the religiously diverse nation. The Indian model of secularism stressed equality of citizens regardless of faith before the law, along with some separation. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed in 1948, protecting freedom of religion in international law.\nState secularism.\nIn political terms, secularism is a movement towards the separation of religion and government, often termed the separation of church and state. This can refer to reducing ties between a government and a state religion, replacing laws based on scripture (such as \"Halakha\", \"Dharma\u015b\u0101stra\", and \"Sharia\") with civil laws, and eliminating discrimination on the basis of religion. This is said to add to democracy by protecting the rights of religious minorities. Separation of church and state is one possible strategy to be deployed by secular governments. From the democratic to the authoritarian, such governments share a concern to limit the religious side in the relationship. Each state may find its own unique policy prescriptions. These may include separation, careful monitoring and regulation of organized religion such as in France, Turkey, India and others.\nIn accord with the belief in the separation of church and state, secularists tend to prefer that politicians make decisions for secular rather than religious reasons. In this respect, policy decisions pertaining to topics like abortion, contraception, embryonic stem cell research, same-sex marriage, and sex education are prominently focused upon by American secularist organizations such as the Center for Inquiry. Religious fundamentalists often oppose a secular form of government, arguing that it contradicts the character of historically religious nations, or infringes on their rights to express themselves in the public sphere. In the United States, for example, the word \"secularism\" became equivalent to \"anti-religion\" due to such efforts. Religious minorities, however, often support secularism as a means of defending their rights against the majority.\nState secularism is most often associated with the Age of Enlightenment in Europe and it plays a major role in Western society. Some of the best known examples of states considered \"constitutionally secular\" are the United States, France, Turkey, India, Mexico, and South Korea, though none of these nations have identical forms of governance with respect to religion. For example, in India, secularism does not completely separate state and religion, while in France, secularism precludes such mutual involvement.\nFrameworks.\nSeparationist secularism enforces the separation of church and state. Under this system, the state does not support any religious group and does not enforce religious laws. Challenges facing separationist secularism include how the government should regulate secular activities of religious groups and how to govern separately from religion when citizens, including government employees, are religious. The federal judiciary of the United States interpreted the United States Constitution as supporting this system during the 20th century, based on the ideas of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson.\n\"La\u00efcit\u00e9\" is a secularist framework developed and used in France. Under this system, the state has legal supremacy over religion and enforces the restriction of religion in the public sphere. It was established by a 1905 law, and subsequent laws have restricted the use of religious iconography in public or by children. Kemalist secularism, or \"laiklik\", is an adaptation of \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" that Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk established in Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s.\nAccommodationism is a system of actively supporting religion in general without favouring a specific religious sect. Under this system, the state applies few restrictions to religion and often provides religious organizations with financial support. India uses this system, incorporating Western ideas of secularism in combination with the Indian tradition of religious and ethnic pluralism. One source of disagreement regarding accommodationism in India is the right of Muslims to live under both the civil code and Sharia simultaneously and the complications that result from this. Accommodationism also has a history in the United States, and the U.S. has increasingly moved toward accommodationism in the 21st century.\nState atheism is a total ban on religion. Under this system, the state enforces laws that do not allow religious practice or the expression of religious beliefs in society. Unlike other secularist frameworks, state atheism does not permit freedom of thought or the separation of government from personal belief. Because of this distinction, state atheism may or may not be considered a form of secularism. It is typically associated with Marxism and Communist states, in which it is described as \"scientific atheism\".\nSecular society.\nIn studies of religion, modern democracies are generally recognized as secular. This is due to the near-complete freedom of religion (religious beliefs generally are not subject to legal or social sanctions), and the lack of authority of religious leaders over political decisions. Nevertheless, it has been claimed that surveys done by Pew Research Center show Americans as generally being more comfortable with religion playing a major role in public life, while in Europe the impact of the church on public life is declining.\nMost societies become increasingly secular as the result of social, economic development and progress, rather than through the actions of a dedicated secular movement. Modern sociology has, since Max Weber, often been preoccupied with the problem of authority in secularised societies and with secularisation as a sociological or historical process. Contemporary ethical debate in the West is often described as \"secular\", as it is detached from religious considerations. Twentieth-century scholars, whose work has contributed to the understanding of these matters, include Carl L. Becker, Karl L\u00f6with, Hans Blumenberg, M. H. Abrams, Peter L. Berger, Paul B\u00e9nichou and D. L. Munby, among others.\nThere is not one singular secular culture, as different people identify as secularists for different reasons and under different belief systems. Secularism is typically associated with progressivism and social liberalism. In democratic countries, middle and upper class white urban males with high education are more likely to identify as secularist than any other demographic group. In societies where secularism is more common, such as in Western Europe, demographics of secularists are closer to even. How a society considers what is secular may also change, where nominally spiritual beliefs become part of public or private life without being recognized as religious. As secularists are a minority in most communities, secularism is often stigmatized. Proponents of religious society challenge secular society on the basis of morality, saying that secularism lacks a meaningful way to incentivize moral behaviour among its members.\nSecular philosophy.\nSecularism is considered in political philosophy and philosophy of religion. As a philosophy, secularism is closely associated with naturalism and materialism, rejecting consideration of immaterial or supernatural substances, such as a soul, in favour of a material universe. This secular materialism and rationalism forms the basis of most modern empirical science. During the Age of Enlightenment, liberal European philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, David Hume, Adam Smith, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all proposed various forms of separation of church and state. The work of well known moral philosophers such as Derek Parfit and Peter Singer, and even the whole field of contemporary bioethics, have been described as explicitly secular or non-religious.\nA major issue considered by secular philosophy is the nature of morality in a material universe. Secular ethics and secular morality describe systems of right and wrong that do not depend on religious or supernatural concepts. Much of the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche is developed in response to this issue. Under secular ethics, good is typically defined as that which contributes to \"human flourishing and justice\" rather than an abstract or idealized conception of good. Secular ethics are often considered within the frame of humanism.\nSecularism in late 20th century political philosophy.\nIt can be seen by many of the organizations (NGOs) for secularism that they prefer to define \"secularism\" as the common ground for all life stance groups, religious or atheistic, to thrive in a society that honours freedom of speech and conscience. An example of that is the National Secular Society in the UK. This is a common understanding of what secularism stands for among many of its activists throughout the world. However, many scholars of Christianity and conservative politicians will often interpret secularism as an antithesis of religion and an attempt to push religion out of society and replace it with atheism or a void of values, nihilism. This dual aspect (as noted above in \"Secular ethics\") has created difficulties in political discourse on the subject. Most political theorists in philosophy following the landmark work of John Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\" in 1971 and its following book, \"Political Liberalism\" (1993), will use the conjoined concept \"overlapping consensus\" rather than secularism. In the latter Rawls holds the idea of an overlapping consensus as one of three main ideas of political liberalism. He argues that the term \"secularism\" cannot apply; But what is a secular argument? Some think of any argument that is reflective and critical, publicly intelligible and rational, as a secular argument; [...], Nevertheless, a central feature of political liberalism is that it views all such arguments the same way it views religious ones, and therefore these secular philosophical doctrines do not provide public reasons. Secular concepts and reasoning of this kind belong to first philosophy and moral doctrine, and fall outside the domain of the political.Still, Rawl's theory is akin to Holyoake's vision of a tolerant democracy that treats all life stance groups alike. Rawl's idea is that it is in everybody's own interest to endorse \"a reasonable constitutional democracy\" with \"principles of toleration\". His work has been highly influential on scholars in political philosophy and his term, \"overlapping consensus\", seems to have for many parts replaced \"secularism\" among them. In textbooks on modern political philosophy, like Colin Farrelly's, \"An Introduction to Contemporary Political Theory\", and Will Kymlicka's, \"Contemporary Political Philosophy\", the term secularism is not even indexed and in the former it can be seen only in one footnote. However, there is no shortage of discussion and coverage of the topic it involves. It is just called \"overlapping consensus, pluralism\", \"multiculturalism\" or expressed in some other way. In The \"Oxford Handbook of Political Theory\", there is one chapter called \"Political secularism\", by Rajeev Bhargava. It covers secularism in a global context, and starts with this sentence: \"Secularism is a beleaguered doctrine.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a tetravalent non-metal (sometimes considered as a metalloid) and semiconductor. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table: carbon is above it; and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Silicon is a significant element that is essential for several physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Silicon is widely regarded as the predominant semiconductor material due to its versatile applications in various electrical devices such as transistors, solar cells, integrated circuits, and others. These may be due to its significant band gap, expansive optical transmission range, extensive absorption spectrum, surface roughening, and effective anti-reflection coating.\nBecause of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. Its oxides form a family of anions known as silicates. Its melting and boiling points of 1414\u00a0\u00b0C and 3265\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, are the second highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being surpassed only by boron.\nSilicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs in its pure form in the Earth's crust. It is widely distributed throughout space in cosmic dusts, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass), after oxygen.\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, often with very little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional silicate-based soda\u2013lime glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones.\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age) because of the large impact that elemental silicon has on the modern world economy. The small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (&lt;15%) is essential to the transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as smartphones and other computers. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices, and the semiconductors industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.\nSilicon is an essential element in biology. Only traces are required by most animals, but some sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and radiolaria, secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.\nHistory.\nOwing to the abundance of silicon in the Earth's crust, natural silicon-based materials have been used for thousands of years. Silicon rock crystals were familiar to various ancient civilizations, such as the predynastic Egyptians who used it for beads and small vases, as well as the ancient Chinese. Glass containing silica was manufactured by the Egyptians since at least 1500\u00a0BC, as well as by the ancient Phoenicians. Natural silicate compounds were also used in various types of mortar for construction of early human dwellings.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1787, Antoine Lavoisier suspected that silica might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element, but the chemical affinity of silicon for oxygen is high enough that he had no means to reduce the oxide and isolate the element. After an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808, Sir Humphry Davy proposed the name \"silicium\" for silicon, from the Latin , \"silicis\" for flint, and adding the \"-ium\" ending because he believed it to be a metal. Most other languages use transliterated forms of Davy's name, sometimes adapted to local phonology (e.g. German , Turkish ', Catalan ', Armenian or \"Silitzioum\"). A few others use instead a calque of the Latin root (e.g. Russian , from \"flint\"; Greek \"\" from \"fire\"; Finnish from \"flint\", Czech from \"quartz\", \"flint\").\nGay-Lussac and Th\u00e9nard are thought to have prepared impure amorphous silicon in 1811, through the heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride, but they did not purify and characterize the product, nor identify it as a new element. Silicon was given its present name in 1817 by Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson. He retained part of Davy's name but added \"-on\" because he believed that silicon was a nonmetal similar to boron and carbon. In 1824, J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as Gay-Lussac (reducing potassium fluorosilicate with molten potassium metal), but purifying the product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it. As a result, he is usually given credit for the element's discovery. The same year, Berzelius became the first to prepare silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4); silicon tetrafluoride had already been prepared long before in 1771 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele by dissolving silica in hydrofluoric acid. In 1846, J. Von Ebelman synthesized tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si(OC2H5)4).\nSilicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until 31 years later, by Deville. Passing silicon chloride vapors over pure aluminum produced pure, hard octahedral crystals.\nFriedrich W\u00f6hler discovered the first volatile hydrides of silicon, synthesising trichlorosilane in 1857 and silane itself in 1858, but a detailed investigation of the silanes was only carried out in the early 20th century by Alfred Stock, despite early speculation on the matter dating as far back as the beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in the 1830s. Similarly, the first organosilicon compound, tetraethylsilane, was synthesised by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1863, but detailed characterisation of organosilicon chemistry was only done in the early 20th century by Frederic Kipping.\nStarting in the 1920s, the work of William Lawrence Bragg on X-ray crystallography elucidated the compositions of the silicates, which had previously been known from analytical chemistry but had not yet been understood, together with Linus Pauling's development of crystal chemistry and Victor Goldschmidt's development of geochemistry. The middle of the 20th century saw the development of the chemistry and industrial use of siloxanes and the growing use of silicone polymers, elastomers, and resins. In the late 20th century, the complexity of the crystal chemistry of silicides was mapped, along with the solid-state physics of doped semiconductors.\nSilicon semiconductors.\nThe first semiconductor devices did not use silicon, but used galena, including German physicist Ferdinand Braun's crystal detector in 1874 and Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose's radio crystal detector in 1901. The first silicon semiconductor device was a silicon radio crystal detector, developed by American engineer Greenleaf Whittier Pickard in 1906.\nIn 1940, Russell Ohl discovered the p\u2013n junction and photovoltaic effects in silicon. In 1941, techniques for producing high-purity germanium and silicon crystals were developed for radar microwave detector crystals during World War II. In 1947, physicist William Shockley theorized a field-effect amplifier made from germanium and silicon, but he failed to build a working device, before eventually working with germanium instead. The first working transistor was a point-contact transistor built by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain later that year while working under Shockley. In 1954, physical chemist Morris Tanenbaum fabricated the first silicon junction transistor at Bell Labs. In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick at Bell Labs accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide (SiO2) could be grown on silicon. By 1957 Frosch and Derick published their work on the first manufactured SiO2 semiconductor oxide transistor: the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. In 1959, Robert Noyce developed the first silicon-based integrated circuit at Fairchild Semiconductor, building on prior work by Jack Kilby that relied on germanium as the semiconductor.\nSilicon Age.\nThe \"Silicon Age\" refers to the late 20th century to early 21st century. This is due to silicon being the dominant material used in electronics and information technology (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age), similar to how the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age were defined by the dominant materials during their respective ages of civilization.\nBecause silicon is an important element in high-technology semiconductor devices, many places in the world bear its name. For example, the Santa Clara Valley in California acquired the nickname Silicon Valley, as the element is the base material in the semiconductor industry there. Since then, many other places have been similarly dubbed, including Silicon Wadi in Israel; Silicon Forest in Oregon; Silicon Hills in Austin, Texas; Silicon Slopes in Salt Lake City, Utah; Silicon Saxony in Germany; Silicon Valley in India; Silicon Border in Mexicali, Mexico; Silicon Fen in Cambridge, England; Silicon Roundabout in London; Silicon Glen in Scotland; Silicon Gorge in Bristol, England; Silicon Alley in New York City; Silicon Beach in Los Angeles; and Dubai Silicon Oasis in Dubai.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical and atomic.\nA silicon atom has fourteen electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration [Ne]3s23p2. Of these, four are valence electrons, occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the lighter carbon and the heavier germanium, tin, and lead, it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals: hence, it can complete its octet and obtain the stable noble gas configuration of argon by forming sp3 hybrid orbitals, forming tetrahedral SiX4 derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to. The first four ionisation energies of silicon are 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4\u00a0kJ/mol respectively; these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element. Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6\u00a0pm is intermediate between those of carbon (77.2\u00a0pm) and germanium (122.3\u00a0pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40\u00a0pm, although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple Si4+ cation in reality.\nElectrical.\nAt standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops as temperature rises. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap (band gap) between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between the valence and conduction bands and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is effectively an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, or gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p\u2013n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p\u2013n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n\u2013p\u2013n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.\nCrystal structure.\nSilicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a diamond cubic crystal lattice (). It thus has a high melting point of 1414\u00a0\u00b0C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. Upon melting silicon contracts as the long-range tetrahedral network of bonds breaks up and the voids in that network are filled in, similar to water ice when hydrogen bonds are broken upon melting. It does not have any thermodynamically stable allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40\u00a0gigapascals known as Si\u2013VII (the standard modification being Si\u2013I). An allotrope called BC8 (or bc8), having a body-centred cubic lattice with eight atoms per primitive unit cell (), can be created at high pressure and remains metastable at low pressure. Its properties have been studied in detail.\nSilicon boils at 3265\u00a0\u00b0C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes (3642\u00a0\u00b0C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si\u2013Si bond is weaker than the C\u2013C bond.\nIt is also possible to construct silicene layers analogous to graphene.\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable isotopes, 28Si (92.24%), 29Si (4.67%), and 30Si (3.07%). Out of these, only the odd 29Si is of use in NMR and EPR spectroscopy, and it has nuclear spin (\"I\" =). All three are produced in Type Ia supernovae through the oxygen-burning process, with 28Si being made as part of the alpha process and hence the most abundant. The fusion of 28Si with alpha particles by photodisintegration rearrangement in stars is known as the silicon-burning process; it is the last stage of stellar nucleosynthesis before the rapid collapse and violent explosion of the star in question in a type II supernova.\nTwenty-two radioisotopes have been characterized, the two stablest being 32Si with a half-life of about 157\u00a0years, and 31Si with a half-life of 2.62\u00a0hours. All the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than seven seconds, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than one-tenth of a second. 32Si undergoes low-energy beta decay to 32P and then stable 32S. 31Si may be produced by the neutron activation of natural silicon and is thus useful for quantitative analysis; it can be easily detected by its characteristic beta decay to stable 31P, in which the emitted electron carries up to 1.48\u00a0MeV of energy.\nThe known isotopes of silicon range in mass number from 22 to 45. The most common decay mode of the isotopes with mass numbers lower than the three stable isotopes is \u03b2+ decay to aluminium isotopes, and the most common decay mode for the heavier unstable isotopes is beta decay to phosphorus isotopes as decay products. 46Si was reported in collisions of 70Zn with Be in experiments at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory.\nSilicon can enter the oceans through groundwater and riverine transport. Large fluxes of groundwater input have an isotopic composition which is distinct from riverine silicon inputs. Isotopic variations in groundwater and riverine transports contribute to variations in oceanic 30Si values. Currently, there are substantial differences in the isotopic values of deep water in the world's ocean basins. Between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, there is a deep water 30Si gradient of greater than 0.3 parts per thousand. 30Si is most commonly associated with productivity in the oceans.\nChemistry and compounds.\nCrystalline bulk silicon is rather inert, but becomes more reactive at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) that protects the material beneath from oxidation. Because of this, silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900\u00a0\u00b0C. Between 950\u00a0\u00b0C and 1160\u00a0\u00b0C, the formation rate of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases, and when 1400\u00a0\u00b0C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600\u00a0\u00b0C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300\u00a0\u00b0C, and bromine and iodine at about 500\u00a0\u00b0C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and complexed by hydrofluoric acid mixtures containing either chlorine or nitric acid to form hexafluorosilicates. It readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction may be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. In fact, molten silicon reacts virtually with every known kind of crucible material (except its own oxide, SiO2).13 This happens due to silicon's high binding forces for the light elements and to its high dissolving power for most elements.13 As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.\nTetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon, and thus octahedral coordination is also significant. For example, the electronegativity of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward catenation (formation of Si\u2013Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon, due to the concomitant weakening of the Si\u2013Si bond compared to the C\u2013C bond: the average Si\u2013Si bond energy is approximately 226\u00a0kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356\u00a0kJ/mol for the C\u2013C bond. This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the double bond rule. On the other hand, the presence of radial nodes in the 3p orbitals of silicon suggests the possibility of hypervalence, as seen in five and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as SiX5- and SiF62-. Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior, particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a metalloid rather than a nonmetal. Germanium shows more, and tin is generally considered a metal.\nSilicon shows clear differences from carbon. For example, organic chemistry has very few analogies with silicon chemistry, while silicate minerals have a structural complexity unseen in oxocarbons. Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the d-block contraction, resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict. Nevertheless, there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge\u2013O bond strength compared to the Si\u2013O bond strength results in the absence of \"germanone\" polymers that would be analogous to silicone polymers.\nOccurrence.\nSilicon is the eighth most abundant element in the universe, coming after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, and nitrogen. This differs from abundance of elements in Earth's crust due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the Solar System. Silicon makes up 27.2% of the Earth's crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it always is associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation of the Earth by planetary differentiation: Earth's core, which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate composition Fe25Ni2Co0.1S3; the mantle makes up 68.1% of the Earth's mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates, an example being olivine, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4; while the lighter siliceous minerals such as aluminosilicates rise to the surface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth's mass.\nThe crystallisation of igneous rocks from magma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as lattice energy, melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, olivine appears first, followed by pyroxene, amphibole, biotite mica, orthoclase feldspar, muscovite mica, quartz, zeolites, and finally, hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides. Many metals may substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo weathering, transport, and deposition, sedimentary rocks like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. Metamorphism also may occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.\nThere are four sources for silicon fluxes into the ocean: chemical weathering of continental rocks, river transport, dissolution of continental terrigenous silicates, and the reaction between submarine basalts and hydrothermal fluid which release dissolved silicon. All four of these fluxes are interconnected in the ocean's biogeochemical cycle as they all were initially formed from the weathering of Earth's crust.\nApproximately 300\u2013900 megatonnes of aeolian dust is deposited into the world's oceans each year. Of that value, 80\u2013240 megatonnes are in the form of particulate silicon. The total amount of particulate silicon deposition into the ocean is still less than the amount of silicon influx into the ocean via riverine transportation. Aeolian inputs of particulate lithogenic silicon into the North Atlantic and Western North Pacific oceans are the result of dust settling on the oceans from the Sahara and Gobi Desert, respectively. Riverine transports are the major source of silicon influx into the ocean in coastal regions, while silicon deposition in the open ocean is greatly influenced by the settling of aeolian dust.\nProduction.\nSilicon of 96\u201399% purity is made by carbothermically reducing quartzite or sand with highly pure coke. The reduction is carried out in an electric arc furnace, using an excess of SiO2 to prevent silicon carbide (SiC) from accumulating:\nSiO2 + 2 C \u2192 Si + 2 CO\n2 SiC + SiO2 \u2192 3 Si + 2 CO\nThis reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of phosphorus and sulfur, producing ferrosilicon. Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6\u00a0million tonnes (or two-thirds of world output) of silicon, most of it in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t), and the United States (170,000 t). Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.\nAnother reaction, sometimes used, is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as follows:\n3 SiO2 + 4 Al \u2192 3 Si + 2 Al2O3\nLeaching powdered 96\u201397% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure silicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane (silicon tetrachloride) or trichlorosilane. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of silicone production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated fractional distillation, followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure zinc metal as the reducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by zone refining. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane (SiI4). Another process used is the reduction of sodium hexafluorosilicate, a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, by metallic sodium: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside energy source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost any other material: transistor production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 1010, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 1012 are needed and attained.\nSilicon nanostructures can directly be produced from silica sand using conventional metalothermic processes, or the combustion synthesis approach. Such nanostructured silicon materials can be used in various functional applications including the anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), other ion batteries, future computing devices like memristors or photocatalytic applications.\nApplications.\nCompounds.\nMost silicon is used industrially without being purified, often with comparatively little processing from its natural form. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, silica sand, and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making Portland cement (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in building mortar and modern stucco, but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals such as granite), to make the concrete that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.\nSilica is used to make fire brick, a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware ceramics, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is porcelain, which is based on the silicate mineral kaolinite. Traditional glass (silica-based soda\u2013lime glass) also functions in many of the same ways, and also is used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based glass fibers are used for optical fiber, as well as to produce fiberglass for structural support and glass wool for thermal insulation.\nSilicones often are used in waterproofing treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.\nAlloys.\nElemental silicon is added to molten cast iron as ferrosilicon or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of transformer steel, modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties.\nThe properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. \"Metallurgical grade\" silicon is silicon of 95\u201399% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys (silumin alloys) for aluminium part casts, mainly for use in the automotive industry. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium. Metallurgical grade silicon is made by melting quartz or quartzite in a large arc furnace, in a carbothermal reduction process with carbon-containing material such as coal, coke or charcoal and woodchips for gas circulation. This production technique without iron is often used for polysilicon production for photovoltaics and also semiconductors.\nElectronics.\nMost elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy, and only approximately 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3\u20131.5 million metric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity. This typically is the \"nine-9\" or 99.9999999% purity, nearly defect-free single crystalline material.\nMonocrystalline silicon of such purity is usually produced by the Czochralski process, and is used to produce silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat. Intrinsic silicon's electrical conductivity increases with temperature due to the broadening of the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of elements with differing valence electron count (typically boron and phosphorus), which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and type (positive or negative) of activated charge carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications. In silicon photonics, silicon may be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light.\nIn common integrated circuits, a wafer of mono-crystalline silicon (Si) serves as a mechanical support for the circuits. Circuit elements (transistors) are created by doping and passivated by thin layers of silicon oxide, an insulator that is easily produced on Si surfaces by processes of thermal oxidation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (among other methods). Thermal oxidation is most common and involves exposing Si to oxygen under the specific conditions. The resulting oxide thickness can be predicted by the Deal\u2013Grove model. Silicon is the most popular material for integrated circuits due to the high stability and ease of forming its native oxide (SiO2). The insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over germanium. Germanium (Ge) was used for the first version of the transistor and has similar electronic properties to silicon such as carrier mobility and band gap. However Ge based technologies ultimately failed due to the instability of the GeO2. Germanium is still used in modern semiconductor electronics as a dopant to enhance the mobility of holes in the source and drain of PMOS.\nMonocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, large-area electronics in applications such as liquid crystal displays and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film solar cells. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.\nQuantum dots.\nSilicon quantum dots are created through the thermal processing of hydrogen silsesquioxane into nanocrystals ranging from a few nanometers to a few microns, displaying size dependent luminescent properties. The nanocrystals display large Stokes shifts converting photons in the ultraviolet range to photons in the visible or infrared, depending on the particle size, allowing for applications in quantum dot displays and luminescent solar concentrators due to their limited self absorption. A benefit of using silicon based quantum dots over cadmium or indium is the non-toxic, metal-free nature of silicon.\nAnother application of silicon quantum dots is for sensing of hazardous materials. The sensors take advantage of the luminescent properties of the quantum dots through quenching of the photoluminescence in the presence of the hazardous substance. There are many methods used for hazardous chemical sensing with a few being electron transfer, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and photocurrent generation. Electron transfer quenching occurs when the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is slightly lower in energy than the conduction band of the quantum dot, allowing for the transfer of electrons between the two, preventing recombination of the holes and electrons within the nanocrystals. The effect can also be achieved in reverse with a donor molecule having its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) slightly higher than a valence band edge of the quantum dot, allowing electrons to transfer between them, filling the holes and preventing recombination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when a complex forms between the quantum dot and a quencher molecule. The complex will continue to absorb light but when the energy is converted to the ground state it does not release a photon, quenching the material. The third method uses different approach by measuring the photocurrent emitted by the quantum dots instead of monitoring the photoluminescent display. If the concentration of the desired chemical increases then the photocurrent given off by the nanocrystals will change in response.\nBiological role.\nAlthough silicon is readily available in the form of silicates, very few organisms use it directly. Diatoms, radiolaria, and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for their skeletons. Some plants accumulate silica in their tissues and require silicon for their growth, for example rice. Silicon may be taken up by plants as orthosilicic acid (also known as monosilicic acid) and transported through the xylem, where it forms amorphous complexes with components of the cell wall. This has been shown to improve cell wall strength and structural integrity in some plants, thereby reducing insect herbivory and pathogenic infections. In certain plants, silicon may also upregulate the production of volatile organic compounds and phytohormones which play a significant role in plant defense mechanisms. In more advanced plants, silica (opal) phytoliths provide structural support.\nSeveral horticultural crops are known to protect themselves against fungal plant pathogens with silica, to such a degree that fungicide application may fail unless accompanied by sufficient silicon nutrition. Silicaceous plant defense molecules activate some phytoalexins, meaning some of them are signalling substances producing acquired immunity. When deprived, some plants will substitute with increased production of other defensive substances.\nLife on Earth is largely composed of carbon, but astrobiology considers that extraterrestrial life may have other hypothetical types of biochemistry. Silicon is considered an alternative to carbon, as it can create complex and stable molecules with four covalent bonds, required for a DNA-analog, and it is available in large quantities.\nMarine microbial influences.\nDiatoms use silicon in the biogenic silica (bSi) form, which is taken up by the silicon transport protein (SIT) to be predominantly used in the cell wall structure as frustules. Silicon enters the ocean in a dissolved form such as silicic acid or silicate. Since diatoms are one of the main users of these forms of silicon, they contribute greatly to the concentration of silicon throughout the ocean. Silicon forms a nutrient-like profile in the ocean due to the diatom productivity in shallow depths. Therefore, concentration of silicon is lower in the shallow ocean and higher in the deep ocean.\nDiatom productivity in the upper ocean contributes to the amount of silicon exported to the lower ocean. When diatom cells are lysed in the upper ocean, their nutrients such as iron, zinc, and silicon, are brought to the lower ocean through a process called marine snow. Marine snow involves the downward transfer of particulate organic matter by vertical mixing of dissolved organic matter. It has been suggested that silicon is considered crucial to diatom productivity and as long as there is silicic acid available for diatoms to use, the diatoms can contribute to other important nutrient concentrations in the deep ocean as well.\nIn coastal zones, diatoms serve as the major phytoplanktonic organisms and greatly contribute to biogenic silica production. In the open ocean, however, diatoms have a reduced role in global annual silica production. Diatoms in North Atlantic and North Pacific subtropical gyres only contribute about 5\u20137% of global annual marine silica production. The Southern Ocean produces about one-third of global marine biogenic silica. The Southern Ocean is referred to as having a \"biogeochemical divide\" since only minuscule amounts of silicon are transported out of this region.\nHuman nutrition.\nThere is some evidence that silicon is important to human health for their nail, hair, bone, and skin tissues, for example, in studies that demonstrate that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density, and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis. Silicon is needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen, of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body, and has been considered an essential element; nevertheless, it is difficult to prove its essentiality, because silicon is very common, and hence, deficiency symptoms are difficult to reproduce.\nSilicon is currently under consideration for elevation to the status of a \"plant beneficial substance by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO).\"\nSafety.\nPeople may be exposed to elemental silicon in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, or having contact with the skin or eye. In the latter two cases, silicon poses a slight hazard as an irritant. It is hazardous if inhaled. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit for silicon exposure in the workplace as 15\u00a0mg/m3 total exposure and 5\u00a0mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10\u00a0mg/m3 total exposure and 5\u00a0mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. Inhalation of crystalline silica dust may lead to silicosis, an occupational lung disease marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27116", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27116", "title": "Scandium", "text": "element with atomic number 21 (Sc)\nScandium is a chemical element; it has symbol Sc and atomic number 21. It is a silvery-white metallic d-block element. Historically, it has been classified as a rare-earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.\nScandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s, when the positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered. Its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of scandium oxide is 15\u201320 tonnes per year.\nThe properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium, just as there is between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.\nProperties.\nChemical characteristics.\nScandium is a soft metal with a silvery appearance. It develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It is susceptible to weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid () and 48.0% hydrofluoric acid (), possibly due to the formation of an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in the air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium oxide.\nIsotopes.\nIn nature, scandium is found exclusively as the isotope 45Sc, which has a nuclear spin of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7\u20442; this is its only stable isotope.\nThe known isotopes of scandium range from 37Sc to 63Sc, and the most stable radioisotopes are 46Sc with a half-life of 83.76 days, 47Sc with a half-life of 3.3492 days, 48Sc at 43.67 hours, 44Sc at 4.042 hours, and 43Sc at 3.891 hours. All others have half-lives shorter than an hour, and the majority of these shorter than 15 seconds. The most stable meta state is 44m3Sc with half-life 58.6\u00a0hours; this is the lightest isotope with a long-lived isomer.\nThe low mass isotopes are very difficult to create. The initial detection of 37Sc and 38Sc only resulted in the characterization of their mass excess.\nThe primary decay mode of ground-state scandium isotopes at masses lower than the only stable isotope, 45Sc, is electron capture (or positron emission), but the lightest isotopes (37Sc to 39Sc) undergo proton emission instead, all three of these producing calcium isotopes. The primary decay mode for heavier isotopes is beta emission, producing titanium isotopes.\nOccurrence.\nIn Earth's crust, scandium is not rare. Estimates vary from 18 to 25\u00a0ppm, which is comparable to the abundance of cobalt (20\u201330\u00a0ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant element in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun and the 26th most abundant element in the stars. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element, all of which are sources of other rare earths. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% scandium oxide.\nThe stable form of scandium is created in supernovae via the r-process. Also, scandium is created by cosmic ray spallation of the more abundant iron-peak nuclei. Example reactions are:\nProduction.\nThe world production of scandium is in the order of 15\u201320 tonnes per year, in the form of scandium oxide. The demand is slightly higher, and both the production and demand keep increasing. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare-earth mines in Bayan Obo, China, and the apatite mines in the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Since then, many other countries have built scandium-producing facilities, including 5 tonnes/year (7.5 tonnes/year ) by Nickel Asia Corporation and Sumitomo Metal Mining in the Philippines. \nIn the United States, NioCorp Development hopes to raise $1 billion toward opening a niobium mine at its Elk Creek site in southeast Nebraska, which may be able to produce as much as 95 tonnes of scandium oxide annually. In each case, scandium is a byproduct of the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide.\nTo produce metallic scandium, the oxide is converted to scandium fluoride and then reduced with metallic calcium.\nMadagascar and the Iveland-Evje region in Norway have the only deposits of minerals with high scandium content, thortveitite ), but these are not being exploited. The mineral kolbeckite has a very high scandium content but is not available in any larger deposits.\nThe absence of reliable, secure, stable, long-term production has limited the commercial applications of scandium. Despite this low level of use, scandium offers significant benefits. Particularly promising is the strengthening of aluminium alloys with as little as 0.5% scandium. Scandium-stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand for use as a high-efficiency electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.\nThe USGS reports that, from 2015 to 2019 in the US, the price of small quantities of scandium ingot has been $107 to $134 per gram, and that of scandium oxide $4 to $5 per gram.\nCompounds.\nScandium chemistry is almost completely dominated by the trivalent ion, Sc3+. The radii of M3+ ions in the table below indicate that the chemical properties of scandium ions have more in common with yttrium ions than with aluminium ions. In part because of this similarity, scandium is often classified as a lanthanide-like element.\nOxides and hydroxides.\nThe oxide Sc2O3 and the hydroxide Sc(OH)3 are amphoteric:\nSc(OH)3 + 3 OH- \u2192 [Sc(OH)6]3\u2212 (scandate ion)\nSc(OH)3 + 3 H+ + 3 H2O \u2192 [Sc(H2O)6]3+\n\u03b1- and \u03b3-ScOOH are isostructural with their aluminium hydroxide oxide counterparts. Solutions of Sc3+ in water are acidic due to hydrolysis.\nHalides and pseudohalides.\nThe halides , where X= Cl, Br, or I, are very soluble in water, but is insoluble. In all four halides, the scandium is 6-coordinated. The halides are Lewis acids; for example, dissolves in a solution containing excess fluoride ion to form . The coordination number 6 is typical for Sc(III). In the larger Y3+ and La3+ ions, coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common. Scandium triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry.\nOrganic derivatives.\nScandium forms a series of organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands (Cp), similar to the behavior of the lanthanides. One example is the chlorine-bridged dimer, and related derivatives of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands.\nUncommon oxidation states.\nCompounds that feature scandium in oxidation states other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound is one of the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.\nLower oxidation states (+2, +1, 0) have also been observed in organoscandium compounds.\nHistory.\nDmitri Mendeleev, who is referred to as the father of the periodic table, predicted the existence of an element \"ekaboron\", with an atomic mass between 40 and 48 in 1869. Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite in 1879. Nilson prepared 2\u00a0grams of scandium oxide of high purity. He named the element scandium, from the Latin \"Scandia\" meaning \"Scandinavia\". Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev.\nMetallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.\nLaser crystals of gadolinium-scandium-gallium garnet (GSGG) were used in strategic defense applications developed for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the 1980s and 1990s.\nApplications.\nAluminium alloys.\nThe main application of scandium by weight is in aluminium-scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components. These alloys contain between 0.1% and 0.5% of scandium. They were used in Russian military aircraft, specifically the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 and MiG-29.\nThe addition of scandium to aluminium limits the grain growth in the heat zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated forms smaller crystals than in other aluminium alloys, and the volume of precipitate-free zones at the grain boundaries of age-hardening aluminium alloys is reduced. The precipitate is a coherent precipitate that strengthens the aluminum matrix by applying elastic strain fields that inhibit dislocation movement (i.e., plastic deformation). has an equilibrium L12 superlattice structure exclusive to this system. \nA fine dispersion of nano scale precipitate can be achieved via heat treatment that can also strengthen the alloys through order hardening. Recent developments include the additions of transition metals such as zirconium (Zr) and rare earth metals like erbium (Er) produce shells surrounding the spherical precipitate that reduce coarsening. \nThese shells are dictated by the diffusivity of the alloying element and lower the cost of the alloy due to less Sc being substituted in part by Zr while maintaining stability and less Sc being needed to form the precipitate. These have made somewhat competitive with titanium alloys along with a wide array of applications. However, titanium alloys, which are similar in lightness and strength, are cheaper and much more widely used.\nThe alloy is as strong as titanium, light as aluminium, and hard as some ceramics.\nSome items of sports equipment, which rely on lightweight high-performance materials, have been made with scandium-aluminium alloys, including baseball bats, tent poles and bicycle frames and components. Lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium. The American firearm manufacturing company Smith &amp; Wesson produces semi-automatic pistols and revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.\nSince 2013, Apworks GmbH, a spin-off of Airbus, have marketed a high strength Scandium containing aluminium alloy processed using metal 3D-Printing (Laser Powder Bed Fusion) under the trademark Scalmalloy which claims very high strength &amp; ductility.\nLight sources.\nThe first scandium-based metal-halide lamps were patented by General Electric and made in North America, although they are now produced in all major industrialized countries. Approximately 20\u00a0kg of scandium (as ) is used annually in the United States for high-intensity discharge lamps. One type of metal-halide lamp, similar to the mercury-vapor lamp, is made from scandium triiodide and sodium iodide. This lamp is a white-light source with high color rendering index that sufficiently resembles sunlight to allow good color-reproduction with TV cameras. About 80\u00a0kg of scandium is used in metal-halide lamps/light bulbs globally per year.\nDentists use erbium-chromium-doped yttrium-scandium-gallium garnet () lasers for cavity preparation and in endodontics.\nOther.\nThe radioactive isotope 46Sc is used in oil refineries as a tracing agent. Scandium triflate is a catalytic Lewis acid used in organic chemistry.\nThe 12.4 keV nuclear transition of 45Sc has been studied as a reference for timekeeping applications, with a theoretical precision as much as three orders of magnitude better than the current caesium reference clocks.\nScandium has been proposed for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) as a dopant in the electrolyte material, typically zirconia (ZrO\u2082). Scandium oxide (Sc\u2082O\u2083) is one of several possible additives to enhance the ionic conductivity of the zirconia, improving the overall thermal stability, performance and efficiency of the fuel cell. This application would be particularly valuable in clean energy technologies, as SOFCs can utilize a variety of fuels and have high energy conversion efficiencies.\nHealth and safety.\nElemental scandium is considered non-toxic, though extensive animal testing of scandium compounds has not been done. The median lethal dose (LD50) levels for scandium chloride for rats have been determined as 755\u00a0mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 4\u00a0g/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results, compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity. Scandium appears to be handled by the body in a manner similar to gallium, with similar hazards involving its poorly soluble hydroxide.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has various physical appearances, including a brick-red powder, a vitreous black solid, and a grey metallic-looking form. It seldom occurs in this elemental state or as pure ore compounds in Earth's crust. Selenium (from 'moon') was discovered in 1817 by , who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium (named for the Earth).\nSelenium is found in , where it substitutes for sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly replaced with silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.\nAlthough trace amounts of selenium are necessary for cellular function in many animals, including humans, both elemental selenium and (especially) selenium salts are toxic in even small doses, causing selenosis. Symptoms include (in decreasing order of frequency): diarrhea, fatigue, hair loss, joint pain, nail brittleness or discoloration, nausea, headache, tingling, vomiting, and fever.\nSelenium is listed as an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, as well as in infant formula, and is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants) as well as in three deiodinase enzymes. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently not requiring any.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nSelenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with temperature changes, depending somewhat on the rate of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000\u00a0atoms per ring. Black selenium is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and converts to gray selenium at 180\u00a0\u00b0C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.\nThe red \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying the evaporation rate of the solvent (usually CS2). They all have a relatively low, monoclinic crystal symmetry (space group 14) and contain nearly identical puckered cyclooctaselenium (Se8) rings as in sulfur. The eight atoms of a ring are not equivalent (i.e. they are not mapped one onto another by any symmetry operation), and in fact in the \u03b3-monoclinic form, half the rings are in one configuration (and its mirror image) and half in another. The packing is most dense in the \u03b1 form. In the Se8 rings, the Se\u2013Se distance varies depending on where the pair of atoms is in the ring, but the average is 233.5\u00a0pm, and the Se\u2013Se\u2013Se angle is on average 105.7\u00b0. Other selenium allotropes may contain Se6 or Se7 rings.\nThe most stable and dense form of selenium is gray and has a chiral hexagonal crystal lattice (space group 152 or 154 depending on the chirality) consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se\u2013Se distance is 237.3\u00a0pm and Se\u2013Se\u2013Se angle is 103.1\u00b0. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6\u00a0pm. Gray selenium is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten selenium, or by condensing selenium vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other selenium forms are insulators, gray selenium is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.\nIsotopes.\nSelenium has seven naturally occurring isotopes. Five of these, 74Se, 76Se, 77Se, 78Se, 80Se, are stable, with 80Se being the most abundant (49.6% natural abundance). Also naturally occurring is the long-lived primordial radionuclide 82Se, with a half-life of 8.76\u00d71019 years. The non-primordial radioisotope 79Se also occurs in minute quantities in uranium ores as a product of nuclear fission. Selenium also has numerous unstable synthetic isotopes ranging from 64Se to 95Se; the most stable are 75Se with a half-life of 119.78\u00a0days and 72Se with a half-life of 8.4\u00a0days. Isotopes lighter than the stable isotopes primarily undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of arsenic, and isotopes heavier than the stable isotopes undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of bromine, with some minor neutron emission branches in the heaviest known isotopes.\nChemical compounds.\nSelenium compounds commonly exist in the oxidation states \u22122, +2, +4, and +6. It is a nonmetal (more rarely considered a metalloid) with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table, sulfur and tellurium, and also has similarities to arsenic.\nChalcogen compounds.\nSelenium forms two oxides: selenium dioxide (SeO2) and selenium trioxide (SeO3). Selenium dioxide is formed by combustion of elemental selenium:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIt is a polymeric solid that forms monomeric SeO2 molecules in the gas phase. It dissolves in water to form selenous acid, H2SeO3. Selenous acid can also be made directly by oxidizing elemental selenium with nitric acid:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnlike sulfur, which forms a stable trioxide, selenium trioxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to the dioxide above 185\u00a0\u00b0C:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt; (\u0394H \n \u221254\u00a0kJ/mol)\nSelenium trioxide is produced in the laboratory by the reaction of anhydrous potassium selenate (K2SeO4) and sulfur trioxide (SO3).\nSalts of selenous acid are called selenites. These include silver selenite (Ag2SeO3) and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3).\nHydrogen sulfide reacts with aqueous selenous acid to produce selenium disulfide:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSelenium disulfide consists of 8-membered rings. It has an approximate composition of SeS2, with individual rings varying in composition, such as Se4S4 and Se2S6. Selenium disulfide has been used in shampoo as an antidandruff agent, an inhibitor in polymer chemistry, a glass dye, and a reducing agent in fireworks.\nSelenium trioxide may be synthesized by dehydrating selenic acid, H2SeO4, which is itself produced by the oxidation of selenium dioxide with hydrogen peroxide:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHalogen compounds.\nSelenium reacts with fluorine to form selenium hexafluoride:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn comparison with its sulfur counterpart (sulfur hexafluoride), selenium hexafluoride (SeF6) is more reactive and is a toxic pulmonary irritant. Selenium tetrafluoride is a laboratory-scale fluorinating agent.\nThe only stable chlorides are selenium tetrachloride (SeCl4) and selenium monochloride (Se2Cl2), which might be better known as selenium(I) chloride and is structurally analogous to disulfur dichloride. Metastable solutions of selenium dichloride can be prepared from sulfuryl chloride and selenium (reaction of the elements generates the tetrachloride instead), and constitute an important reagent in the preparation of selenium compounds (e.g. Se7). The corresponding bromides are all known, and recapitulate the same stability and structure as the chlorides.\nThe iodides of selenium are not well known, and for a long time were believed not to exist. There is limited spectroscopic evidence that the lower iodides may form in bi-elemental solutions with nonpolar solvents, such as carbon disulfide and carbon tetrachloride; but even these appear to decompose under illumination.\nSome selenium oxyhalides\u2014seleninyl fluoride (SeOF2) and selenium oxychloride (SeOCl2)\u2014have been used as specialty solvents.\nMetal selenides.\nAnalogous to the behavior of other chalcogens, selenium forms hydrogen selenide, H2Se. It is a strongly odiferous, toxic, and colorless gas. It is more acidic than H2S. In solution it ionizes to HSe\u2212. The selenide dianion Se2\u2212 forms a variety of compounds, including the minerals from which selenium is obtained commercially. Illustrative selenides include mercury selenide (HgSe), lead selenide (PbSe), zinc selenide (ZnSe), and copper indium gallium diselenide (Cu(Ga,In)Se2). These materials are semiconductors. With highly electropositive metals, such as aluminium, these selenides are prone to hydrolysis, which may be described by this idealized equation:\nAlkali metal selenides react with selenium to form polyselenides, Sen2-, which exist as chains and rings.\nOther compounds.\nTetraselenium tetranitride, Se4N4, is an explosive orange compound analogous to tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). It can be synthesized by the reaction of selenium tetrachloride (SeCl4) with [((CH3)3Si)2N]2Se.\nSelenium reacts with cyanides to yield selenocyanates:\nOrganoselenium compounds.\nSelenium, especially in the II oxidation state, forms a variety of organic derivatives. They are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, as illustrated by the selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.\nHistory.\nSelenium (Greek \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 \"selene\" meaning \"Moon\") was discovered in 1817 by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius and Johan Gottlieb Gahn. Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden, producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. Pyrite samples from the Falun Mine produced a red solid precipitate in the lead chambers, which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the use of pyrite to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn, who wanted to use the pyrite, observed that the red precipitate gave off an odor like horseradish when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun Mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.\nIn 1873, Willoughby Smith found that the electrical conductivity of grey selenium was affected by light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell was used in the photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.\nSelenium came to medical notice later because of its toxicity to industrial workers. Selenium was also recognized as an important veterinary toxin, which is seen in animals that have eaten high-selenium plants. In 1954, the first hints of specific biological functions of selenium were discovered in microorganisms by biochemist, Jane Pinsent. It was discovered to be essential for mammalian life in 1957. In the 1970s, it was shown to be present in two independent sets of enzymes. This was followed by the discovery of selenocysteine in proteins. During the 1980s, selenocysteine was shown to be encoded by the codon UGA. The recoding mechanism was worked out first in bacteria and then in mammals (see SECIS element).\nOccurrence.\nNative (i.e., elemental) selenium is a rare mineral, which does not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals. Isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements.\nSelenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing a small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.\nIn living systems, selenium is found in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.\nCertain soils are selenium-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, selenium most often occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains significant amounts of selenium.\nTypical background concentrations of selenium do not exceed 1\u00a0ng/m3 in the atmosphere; 1\u00a0mg/kg in soil and vegetation and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/L in freshwater and seawater, 0.05 - 0.09 mg/kg average crustal abundance.\nAnthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning, and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores.\nProduction.\nSelenium is most commonly produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, such as those of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.\nIndustrial production of selenium usually involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide, which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.\nAbout 2,000\u00a0tonnes of selenium were produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in Germany (650\u00a0t), Japan (630\u00a0t), Belgium (200\u00a0t), and Russia (140\u00a0t), and the total reserves were estimated at 93,000\u00a0tonnes. These data exclude two major producers: the United States and China. A previous sharp increase was observed in 2004 from $4\u2013$5 to $27/lb. The price was relatively stable during 2004\u20132010 at about US$30\u00a0per pound (in 100\u00a0pound lots) but increased to $65/lb in 2011. The consumption in 2010 was divided as follows: metallurgy \u2013 30%, glass manufacturing \u2013 30%, agriculture \u2013 10%, chemicals and pigments \u2013 10%, and electronics \u2013 10%. China is the dominant consumer of selenium at 1,500\u20132,000\u00a0tonnes/year.\nApplications.\nManganese electrolysis.\nDuring the electrowinning of manganese, the addition of selenium dioxide decreases the power necessary to operate the electrolysis cells. China is the largest consumer of selenium dioxide for this purpose. For every tonne of manganese, an average 2\u00a0kg selenium oxide is used. \nGlass production.\nThe largest commercial use of selenium, accounting for about 50% of consumption, is for the production of glass. Selenium compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.\nAlloys.\nSelenium is used with bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The regulation of lead in drinking water applications such as in the US with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.\nLithium\u2013selenium batteries.\nThe lithium\u2013selenium (Li\u2013Se) battery was considered for energy storage in the family of lithium batteries in the 2010s.\nSolar cells.\nSelenium was used as the photoabsorbing layer in the first solid-state solar cell, which was demonstrated by the English physicist William Grylls Adams and his student Richard Evans Day in 1876. Only a few years later, Charles Fritts fabricated the first thin-film solar cell, also using selenium as the photoabsorber. However, with the emergence of silicon solar cells in the 1950s, research on selenium thin-film solar cells declined. As a result, the record efficiency of 5.0% demonstrated by Tokio Nakada and Akio Kunioka in 1985 remained unchanged for more than 30 years. In 2017, researchers from IBM achieved a new record efficiency of 6.5% by redesigning the device structure. Following this achievement, selenium has gained renewed interest as a wide bandgap photoabsorber with the potential of being integrated in tandem with lower bandgap photoabsorbers. In 2024, the first selenium-based tandem solar cell was demonstrated, showcasing a selenium top cell monolithically integrated with a silicon bottom cell. However, a significant deficit in the open-circuit voltage is currently the main limiting factor to further improve the efficiency, necessitating defect-engineering strategies for selenium thin-films to enhance the carrier lifetime. Recent theoretical studies using first-principles defect calculations have shown that selenium exhibits intrinsic point defect tolerance, suggesting that interfaces and extended defects are the primary factors limiting device performance. As of now, the only defect-engineering strategy that has been investigated for selenium thin-film solar cells involves crystallizing selenium using a laser.\nPhotoconductors.\nAmorphous selenium (\u03b1-Se) thin films have found application as photoconductors in flat-panel X-ray detectors. These detectors use amorphous selenium to capture and convert incident X-ray photons directly into electric charge. Selenium has been chosen for this application among other semiconductors owing to a combination of its favorable technological and physical properties:\nRectifiers.\nSelenium rectifiers were first used in 1933. They have mostly been replaced by silicon-based devices. One notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal-oxide varistors.\nOther uses.\nThe demand for selenium by the electronics industry is declining. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although it was still a large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors.\nZinc selenide was the first material for blue LEDs, but gallium nitride dominates that market. Cadmium selenide can be used to make quantum dots. Sheets of amorphous selenium convert X-ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid-state, flat-panel X-ray cameras. Ionized selenium (Se+24, where 24 of the outer D, S and P orbitals are stripped away due to high input energies) is one of the active mediums used in X-ray lasers. 75Se is used as a gamma source in industrial radiography.\nSelenium catalyzes some chemical reactions, but it is not widely used because of issues with toxicity. In X-ray crystallography, incorporation of one or more selenium atoms in place of sulfur helps with multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing.\nSelenium is used in the toning of photographic prints, and it is sold as a toner by numerous photographic manufacturers. Selenium intensifies and extends the tonal range of black-and-white photographic images and improves the permanence of prints. Small amounts of organoselenium compounds have been used to modify the catalysts used for the vulcanization for the production of rubber. Selenium is used in some anti-dandruff shampoos in the form of selenium disulfide such as Selsun and Vichy Dereos brands.\nPollution.\nSelenium pollution might impact some aquatic systems and may be caused by anthropogenic factors such as farming runoff and industrial processes. People who eat more fish are generally healthier than those who eat less, which suggests no major human health concern from selenium pollution, although selenium has a potential effect on humans.\nSelenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural run-off courses through dry lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in wetlands as the water evaporates. Selenium pollution of waterways also occurs when selenium is leached from coal flue ash, mining and metal smelting, crude oil processing, and landfill. High selenium levels in waterways were found to cause congenital disorders in oviparous species, including wetland birds and fish. Elevated dietary methylmercury levels can amplify the harm of selenium toxicity in oviparous species.\nSelenium is bioaccumulated in aquatic habitats, which results in higher concentrations in organisms than the surrounding water. Organoselenium compounds can be concentrated over 200,000 times by zooplankton when water concentrations are in the 0.5 to 0.8\u00a0\u03bcg Se/L range. Inorganic selenium bioaccumulates more readily in phytoplankton than zooplankton. Phytoplankton can concentrate inorganic selenium by a factor of 3000. Further concentration through bioaccumulation occurs along the food chain, as predators consume selenium-rich prey. It is recommended that a water concentration of 2\u00a0\u03bcg Se/L be considered highly hazardous to sensitive fish and aquatic birds. Selenium poisoning can be passed from parents to offspring through the egg, and selenium poisoning may persist for many generations. Reproduction of mallard ducks is impaired at dietary concentrations of 7\u00a0\u03bcg Se/L. Many benthic invertebrates can tolerate selenium concentrations up to 300\u00a0\u03bcg/L of selenium in their diet.\nBioaccumulation of selenium in aquatic environments causes fish kills depending on the species in the affected area. There are, however, a few species that have been seen to survive these events and tolerate the increased selenium. It has also been suggested that the season could have an impact on the harmful effects of selenium on fish. Substantial physiological changes may occur in fish with high tissue concentrations of selenium. Fish affected by selenium may experience swelling of the gill lamellae, which impedes oxygen diffusion across the gills and blood flow within the gills. Respiratory capacity is further reduced due to selenium binding to hemoglobin. Other problems include degeneration of liver tissue, swelling around the heart, damaged egg follicles in ovaries, cataracts, and accumulation of fluid in the body cavity and head. Selenium often causes a malformed fish fetus which may have problems feeding or respiring; distortion of the fins or spine is also common. Adult fish may appear healthy despite their inability to produce viable offspring.\nExamples.\nIn Belews Lake North Carolina, 19 species of fish were eliminated from the lake due to 150\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg Se/L wastewater discharged from 1974 to 1986 from a Duke Energy coal-fired power plant. At the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in California, thousands of fish and waterbirds were poisoned by selenium in agricultural irrigation drainage.\nBiological role.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nAlthough it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). The selenium content in the human body is believed to be in the range of 13\u201320\u00a0mg.\nSelenium is a component of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).\nThe glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes (GSH-Px) catalyze reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides.\nThe thyroid gland and every cell that uses thyroid hormone also use selenium, which is a cofactor for the three of the four known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites; the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine.\nIncreased dietary selenium reduces the effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity include the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. The selenium-containing compound selenoneine is present in the blood of bluefin tuna. Certain plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil because they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are \"Astragalus\" species (including some locoweeds), prince's plume (\"Stanleya\" sp.), woody asters (\"Xylorhiza\" sp.), and false goldenweed (\"Oonopsis\" sp.).\nNutritional sources of selenium.\nDietary selenium comes from meat, nuts, cereals, and mushrooms. Brazil nuts are the richest dietary source (though this is soil-dependent since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs).\nThe US Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of selenium for teenagers and adults is 55\u00a0\u03bcg/day. Selenium as a dietary supplement is available in many forms, including multi-vitamins/mineral supplements, which typically contain 55 or 70\u00a0\u03bcg/serving. Selenium-specific supplements typically contain either 100 or 200\u00a0\u03bcg/serving. In June 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published its final rule establishing a requirement for minimum and maximum levels of selenium in infant formula.\nGeneral health effects.\nThe effects of selenium intake on cancer have been studied in several clinical trials and epidemiologic studies in humans. Selenium may have a chemo-preventive role in cancer risk as an anti-oxidant, and it might trigger the immune response. At low levels, it is used in the body to create anti-oxidant selenoproteins, at higher doses than normal it causes cell death.\nSelenium (in close interrelation with iodine) plays a role in thyroid health. Selenium is a cofactor for the three thyroid hormone deiodinases, helping activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites. Isolated selenium deficiency is now being investigated for its role in the induction of autoimmune reactions in the thyroid gland in Hashimoto's disease. In a case of combined iodine and selenium deficiency was shown to play a thyroid-protecting role.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27118", "revid": "39450321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27118", "title": "Strontium", "text": "element with atomic number 38 (Sr)\nStrontium is a chemical element; it has symbol Sr and atomic number 38. An alkaline earth metal, it is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element that is highly chemically reactive. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally mainly in the minerals celestine and strontianite, and is mostly mined from these.\nBoth strontium and strontianite are named after Strontian, a village in Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it was identified as a new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis. During the 19th century, strontium was mostly used in the production of sugar from sugar beets (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode-ray tubes, as much as 75% of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the replacement of cathode-ray tubes with other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.\nWhile natural strontium (which is mostly the isotope strontium-88) is stable, the synthetic strontium-90 is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.\nCharacteristics.\nStrontium is a divalent silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and similar to those of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777\u00a0\u00b0C) and boiling (1377\u00a0\u00b0C) points are lower than those of calcium (842\u00a0\u00b0C and 1484\u00a0\u00b0C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727\u00a0\u00b0C), but not in the boiling point (1900\u00a0\u00b0C). The density of strontium (2.64\u00a0g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54\u00a0g/cm3) and barium (3.594\u00a0g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe standard electrode potential for the Sr2+/Sr couple is \u22122.89\u00a0V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (\u22122.84\u00a0V) and Ba2+/Ba (\u22122.92\u00a0V) couples, and close to those of the neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380\u00a0\u00b0C, at room temperature it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide . Strontium hydroxide, , is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.\nDue to the large size of the heavy s-block elements, including strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 all the way to 22 or 24 in and . The Sr2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.\nOrganostrontium compounds contain one or more strontium\u2013carbon bonds. They have been reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions. Although strontium is in the same group as magnesium, and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive. Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of these elements (Sr2+ 118\u00a0pm; Eu2+ 117\u00a0pm; Sm2+ 122\u00a0pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, strontium dicyclopentadienyl, , must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the ligand with the bulkier ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.\nBecause of its extreme reactivity with oxygen and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, such as in the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution of solvated electrons.\nIsotopes.\nNatural strontium is a mixture of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Of these isotopes, 88Sr is the most abundant, making up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies somewhat due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. This is the basis of rubidium\u2013strontium dating.\nOf the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 86Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.56\u00a0days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.91\u00a0years) has been used similarly, it is more an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its longer life (both are produced as fission products). Its presence in bones, where all strontium accumulates, can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000\u00a0km2 with greater than 10\u00a0kBq/m2 of 90Sr, or an estimated 5% of the reactor's total content of 90Sr.\nHistory.\nStrontium is named after the Scottish village of Strontian (), where it was discovered in the ores of the lead mines.\nIn 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged in the preparation of barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other \"heavy spars\" sources. This allowed Crawford to conclude on page 355 \"...\u00a0it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined.\" The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also came to the conclusion that it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow studied the mineral and proposed the name \"strontites\". He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: \"...\u00a0Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion.\" The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to \"strontium\".\nThe first large-scale application of strontium was in the production of sugar from sugar beet. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849 the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German sugar industry used the process well into the 20th century. Before World War I the beet sugar industry used 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year. The strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process, but the demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of strontianite in the M\u00fcnsterland. The mining of strontianite in Germany ended when mining of the celestine deposits in Gloucestershire started. These mines supplied most of the world strontium supply from 1884 to 1941. Although the celestine deposits in the Granada basin were known for some time the large scale mining did not start before the 1950s.\nDuring atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, it was observed that strontium-90 is one of the nuclear fission products with a relatively high yield. The similarity to calcium and the chance that the strontium-90 might become enriched in bones made research on the metabolism of strontium an important topic.\nOccurrence.\nStrontium commonly occurs in nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360\u00a0parts per million in the Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine () and the carbonate strontianite (). Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development. Because of the way it reacts with air and water, strontium only exists in nature when combined to form minerals. Naturally occurring strontium is stable, but its synthetic isotope Sr-90 is only produced by nuclear fallout.\nIn groundwater strontium behaves chemically much like calcium. At intermediate to acidic pH Sr2+ is the dominant strontium species. In the presence of calcium ions, strontium commonly forms coprecipitates with calcium minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at an increased pH. At intermediate to acidic pH, dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by cation exchange.\nThe mean strontium content of ocean water is 8\u00a0mg/L. At a concentration between 82 and 90 \u03bcmol/L of strontium, the concentration is considerably lower than the calcium concentration, which is normally between 9.6 and 11.6\u00a0mmol/L. It is nevertheless much higher than that of barium, 13\u00a0\u03bcg/L.\nProduction.\nThe major producers of strontium as celestine as of January 2024 are Spain (200,000\u00a0t), Iran (200,000\u00a0t), China (80,000\u00a0t), Mexico (35,000\u00a0t); and Argentina (700\u00a0t). Although strontium deposits occur widely in the United States, they have not been mined since 1959.\nA large proportion of mined celestine is converted to the carbonate by two processes. Either the celestine is directly leached with sodium carbonate solution or the celestine is roasted with coal to form the sulfide. The second stage produces a dark-coloured material containing mostly strontium sulfide. This so-called \"black ash\" is dissolved in water and filtered. Strontium carbonate is precipitated from the strontium sulfide solution by introduction of carbon dioxide. The sulfate is reduced to the sulfide by the carbothermic reduction:\nAbout 300,000 tons are processed in this way annually.\nThe metal is produced commercially by reducing strontium oxide with aluminium. The strontium is distilled from the mixture. Strontium metal can also be prepared on a small scale by electrolysis of a solution of strontium chloride in molten potassium chloride:\n\nApplications.\nConsuming 75% of production, the primary use for strontium was in glass for colour television cathode-ray tubes, where it prevented X-ray emission. This application for strontium has been declining because CRTs are being replaced by other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to the interaction of the X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.\nBecause strontium is so similar to calcium, it is incorporated in the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.\n87Sr/86Sr ratios are commonly used to determine the likely provenance areas of sediment in natural systems, especially in marine and fluvial environments. Dasch (1969) showed that surface sediments of Atlantic displayed 87Sr/86Sr ratios that could be regarded as bulk averages of the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of geological terrains from adjacent landmasses. A good example of a fluvial-marine system to which Sr isotope provenance studies have been successfully employed is the River Nile-Mediterranean system. Due to the differing ages of the rocks that constitute the majority of the Blue and White Nile, catchment areas of the changing provenance of sediment reaching the River Nile Delta and East Mediterranean Sea can be discerned through strontium isotopic studies. Such changes are climatically controlled in the Late Quaternary.\nMore recently, 87Sr/86Sr ratios have also been used to determine the source of ancient archaeological materials such as timbers and corn in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in teeth may also be used to track animal migrations.\nStrontium aluminate is frequently used in glow in the dark toys, as it is chemically and biologically inert.\nStrontium carbonate and other strontium salts are added to fireworks to give a deep red colour. This same effect identifies strontium cations in the flame test. Fireworks consume about 5% of the world's production. Strontium carbonate is used in the manufacturing of hard ferrite magnets.\nStrontium chloride is sometimes used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total strontium chloride hexahydrate by weight. Small amounts are used in the refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a limited use as a getter, to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may also be used for this purpose.\nThe ultra-narrow optical transition between the [Kr]5s2 1S0 electronic ground state and the metastable [Kr]5s5p 3P0 excited state of 87Sr is one of the leading candidates for the future re-definition of the second in terms of an optical transition as opposed to the current definition derived from a microwave transition between different hyperfine ground states of 133Cs. Current optical atomic clocks operating on this transition already surpass the precision and accuracy of the current definition of the second.\nRadioactive strontium.\n89Sr is the active ingredient in Metastron, a radiopharmaceutical used for bone pain secondary to metastatic bone cancer. The strontium is processed like calcium by the body, preferentially incorporating it into bone at sites of increased osteogenesis. This localization focuses the radiation exposure on the cancerous lesion.\n90Sr has been used as a power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). 90Sr produces approximately 0.93 watts of heat per gram (it is lower for the form of 90Sr used in RTGs, which is strontium fluoride). However, 90Sr has one third the lifetime and a lower density than 238Pu, another RTG fuel. The main advantage of 90Sr is that it is significantly cheaper than 238Pu and is found in nuclear waste. The latter must be prepared by irradiating 237Np with neutrons then separating the modest amounts of 238Pu. The principal disadvantage of 90Sr is the high energy beta particles produce Bremsstrahlung as they encounter nuclei of other nearby heavy atoms such as adjacent strontium. This is mostly in the range of X-rays. Thus strong beta emitters also emit significant secondary X-rays in most cases. This requires significant shielding measures which complicates the design of RTGs using 90Sr. The Soviet Union deployed nearly 1000 of these RTGs on its northern coast as a power source for lighthouses and meteorology stations.\nBiological role.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nAcantharea, a relatively large group of marine radiolarian protozoa, produce intricate mineral skeletons composed of strontium sulfate. In biological systems, calcium is substituted to a small extent by strontium. In the human body, most of the absorbed strontium is deposited in the bones. The ratio of strontium to calcium in human bones is between 1:1000 and 1:2000, roughly in the same range as in the blood serum.\nEffect on the human body.\nThe human body absorbs strontium as if it were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day. In adults, strontium consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones, but in children, strontium can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.\nThe biological half-life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1,000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published biological half-life figures are explained by strontium's complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life is estimated to be about 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected by age and sex, due to differences in bone metabolism.\nThe drug strontium ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and lessens the incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body. Despite restrictions on strontium ranelate, strontium is still contained in some supplements. There is not much scientific evidence on risks of strontium chloride when taken by mouth. Those with a personal or family history of blood clotting disorders are advised to avoid strontium.\nStrontium has been shown to inhibit sensory irritation when applied topically to the skin. Topically applied, strontium has been shown to accelerate the recovery rate of the epidermal permeability barrier (skin barrier).\nNuclear waste.\nStrontium-90 is a radioactive fission product produced by nuclear reactors used in nuclear power. It is a major component of high-level radioactivity of nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. Its 29-year half-life is short enough that its decay heat has been used to power arctic lighthouses, but long enough that it can take hundreds of years to decay to safe levels. Exposure from contaminated water and food may increase the risk of leukemia, bone cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism.\nRemediation.\nAlgae has shown selectivity for strontium in studies, where most plants used in bioremediation have not shown selectivity between calcium and strontium, often becoming saturated with calcium, which is greater in quantity and also present in nuclear waste.\nResearchers have looked at the bioaccumulation of strontium by \"Scenedesmus spinosus\" (algae) in simulated wastewater. The study claims a highly selective biosorption capacity for strontium of \"S.\u00a0spinosus\", suggesting that it may be appropriate for use in treating nuclear wastewater.\nA study of the pond alga \"Closterium moniliferum\" using non-radioactive strontium found that varying the ratio of barium to strontium in water improved strontium selectivity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27119", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27119", "title": "Silver", "text": "element with atomic number 47 (Ag)\nSilver is a chemical element; it has symbol Ag (from la\u00a0'silver') and atomic number 47. A soft, whitish-gray, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. Silver is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\"native silver\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.\nSilver has long been valued as a precious metal, commonly sold and marketed beside gold and platinum. Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \"0.940 fine\". As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures. In terms of scarcity, silver is the most abundant of the big three precious metals\u2014platinum, gold, and silver\u2014among these, platinum is the rarest with around 139 troy ounces of silver mined for every one ounce of platinum.\nOther than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term \"silverware\"), in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialised mirrors, window coatings, in catalysis of chemical reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialised confectionery. Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray film. Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.\nCharacteristics.\nSilver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of the periodic table: copper, and gold. Its 47 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Kr]4d105s1, similarly to copper ([Ar]3d104s1) and gold ([Xe]4f145d106s1); group 11 is one of the few groups in the d-block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations. This distinctive electron configuration, with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.\nSilver is a relatively soft and extremely ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallises in a face-centred cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalised, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.\nSilver has a brilliant, white, metallic luster that can take a high polish, and which is so characteristic that the name of the metal itself has become a color name. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450\u00a0nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450\u00a0nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310\u00a0nm.\nVery high electrical and thermal conductivity are common to the elements in group 11, because their single s electron is free and does not interact with the filled d subshell, as such interactions (which occur in the preceding transition metals) lower electron mobility. The thermal conductivity of silver is among the highest of all materials, although the thermal conductivity of carbon (in the diamond allotrope) and superfluid helium-4 are higher. The electrical conductivity of silver is the highest of all metals, greater even than copper. Silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal. Silver is rarely used for its electrical conductivity, due to its high cost, although an exception is in radio-frequency engineering, particularly at VHF and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those currents tend to flow on the surface of conductors rather than through the interior. During World War II in the US, tons of silver were used for the electromagnets in calutrons for enriching uranium, mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper.\nSilver readily forms alloys with copper, gold, and zinc. Zinc-silver alloys with low zinc concentration may be considered as face-centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver, as the structure of the silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added. Increasing the electron concentration further leads to body-centred cubic (electron concentration 1.5), complex cubic (1.615), and hexagonal close-packed phases (1.75).\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is ; this value is very important because of the importance of silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).\nTwenty-eight radioisotopes have been characterised, the most stable being 105Ag with a half-life of 41.29 days, 111Ag with a half-life of 7.45 days, and 112Ag with a half-life of 3.13 hours. Silver has numerous nuclear isomers, the most stable being 108mAg (\"t\"1/2 = 418 years), 110mAg (\"t\"1/2 = 249.79 days) and 106mAg (\"t\"1/2 = 8.28 days). All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives of less than three minutes.\nIsotopes of silver range in atomic mass from 92.950\u00a0Da (93Ag) to 129.950\u00a0Da (130Ag); the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 107Ag, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before 107Ag are palladium (element 46) isotopes, and the primary products after are cadmium (element 48) isotopes.\nThe palladium isotope 107Pd decays by beta emission to 107Ag with a half-life of 6.5 million years. Iron meteorites are the only objects with a high-enough palladium-to-silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107Ag abundance. Radiogenic 107Ag was first discovered in the Santa Clara meteorite in 1978. 107Pd\u2013107Ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the accretion of the Solar System must reflect the presence of unstable nuclides in the early Solar System.\nChemistry.\nSilver is a rather unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very effective in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is near the bottom of the electrochemical series (\"E\"0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799\u00a0V). In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionisation energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionisation energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilise. Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, with silver this effect is swamped by its larger second ionisation energy. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidises water.\nMost silver compounds have significant covalent character due to the small size and high first ionisation energy (730.8\u00a0kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is higher than that of lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6\u00a0kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8\u00a0kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0\u00a0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable even in the absence of \u03c0-acceptor ligands.\nSilver does not react with air, even at red heat, and thus was considered by alchemists as a noble metal, along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air to form the black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react). While silver is not attacked by non-oxidising acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.\nThe three main forms of deterioration in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of silver chloride due to long-term immersion in salt water, as well as reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly from the surface of the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.\nSilver metal is attacked by strong oxidant such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), and in the presence of potassium bromide (KBr). These compounds are used in photography to bleach silver images, converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with thiosulfate or redeveloped to intensify the original image. Silver forms cyanide complexes (silver cyanide) that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions. Silver cyanide solutions are used in electroplating of silver.\nThe common oxidation states of silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (the most stable state; for example, silver nitrate, AgNO3); +2 (highly oxidising; for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF2); and even very rarely +3 (extreme oxidising; for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF4). The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate, and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass. Indeed, silver(III) fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidising agent, krypton difluoride.\nCompounds.\nOxides and chalcogenides.\nSilver and gold have rather low chemical affinities for oxygen, lower than copper, and it is therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable. Soluble silver(I) salts precipitate dark-brown silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, upon the addition of alkali. (The hydroxide AgOH exists only in solution; otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to the oxide.) Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160\u00a0\u00b0C. This and other silver(I) compounds may be oxidised by the strong oxidising agent peroxodisulfate to black AgO, a mixed silver(I,III) oxide of formula AgIAgIIIO2. Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag2O3 and Ag3O4, are also known, as is Ag3O which behaves as a metallic conductor.\nSilver(I) sulfide, Ag2S, is very readily formed from its constituent elements and is the cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It may also be formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous Ag+ ions. Many non-stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.\nHalides.\nThe only known dihalide of silver is the difluoride, AgF2, which can be obtained from the elements under heat. A strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent, silver(II) fluoride is often used to synthesise hydrofluorocarbons.\nIn stark contrast to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic zinc blende structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the colour changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X\u2212Ag+ \u2192 XAg) decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small that it has a considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods. All four are photosensitive (though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography. The reaction involved is:\nX\u2212 + \"h\u03bd\" \u2192 X + e\u2212 (excitation of the halide ion, which gives up its extra electron into the conduction band)\nAg+ + e\u2212 \u2192 Ag (liberation of a silver ion, which gains an electron to become a silver atom)\nThe process is not reversible because the silver atom liberated is typically found at a crystal defect or an impurity site, so that the electron's energy is lowered enough that it is \"trapped\".\nOther inorganic compounds.\nWhite silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called \"lunar caustic\" because silver was called \"luna\" by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver was associated with the Moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the heavier silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.\nYellow silver carbonate, Ag2CO3 can be easily prepared by reacting aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate with a deficiency of silver nitrate. Its principal use is for the production of silver powder for use in microelectronics. It is reduced with formaldehyde, producing silver free of alkali metals:\nAg2CO3 + CH2O \u2192 2 Ag + 2 CO2 + H2\nSilver carbonate is also used as a reagent in organic synthesis such as the Koenigs\u2013Knorr reaction. In the F\u00e9tizon oxidation, silver carbonate on celite acts as an oxidising agent to form lactones from diols. It is also employed to convert alkyl bromides into alcohols.\nSilver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive explosive used in percussion caps, is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.\n 2 AgN3 (s) \u2192 3 N2 (g) + 2 Ag (s)\nCoordination compounds.\nSilver complexes tend to be similar to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate [Ag(IO5OH)2]5\u2212 and tellurate [Ag{TeO4(OH)2}2]5\u2212 complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic [AgF4]\u2212 is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.\nSilver(II) complexes are more common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, they are usually square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag2+, produced by oxidation of Ag+ by ozone, is a very strong oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilised in phosphoric acid due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines, such as [Ag(py)4]2+ and [Ag(bipy)2]2+: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. [AgF4]2\u2212 is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with \"N\"- or \"O\"-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.\nBy far the most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarised such as I\u2212. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion [Ag(H2O)4]+ is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form [Ag(NH3)2]+; silver salts are dissolved in photography due to the formation of the thiosulfate complex [Ag(S2O3)2]3\u2212; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex [Ag(CN)2]\u2212. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag\u2013C\u2261N\u2192Ag\u2013C\u2261N\u2192}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes [Ag(L\u2013L)2]+.\nOrganometallic.\nUnder standard conditions, silver does not form simple carbonyls, due to the weakness of the Ag\u2013C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6\u201315\u00a0K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag(CO)3, which dimerises at 25\u201330\u00a0K, probably by forming Ag\u2013Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl [Ag(CO)] [B(OTeF5)4] is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with alkenes and alkynes are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the platinum complexes (though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes): they are also quite unsymmetrical, showing the weak \"\u03c0\" bonding in group 11. Ag\u2013C \"\u03c3\" bonds may also be formed by silver(I), like copper(I) and gold(I), but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver(I) are even less stable than those of copper(I) (which tend to explode under ambient conditions). For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe (\u221250\u00a0\u00b0C) and CuMe (\u221215\u00a0\u00b0C) as well as those of PhAg (74\u00a0\u00b0C) and PhCu (100\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe C\u2013Ag bond is stabilised by perfluoroalkyl ligands, for example in AgCF(CF3)2. Alkenylsilver compounds are also more stable than their alkylsilver counterparts. Silver-NHC complexes are easily prepared, and are commonly used to prepare other NHC complexes by displacing labile ligands. For example, the reaction of the bis(NHC)silver(I) complex with bis(acetonitrile)palladium dichloride or chlorido(dimethyl sulfide)gold(I):\nIntermetallic.\nSilver forms alloys with most other elements on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1\u20133, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with silver in the condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4\u20139 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10\u201314 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag\u2013M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag\u2013M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver\u2013copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry comes from the fact that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).\nMost other binary alloys are of little use: for example, silver\u2013gold alloys are too soft and silver\u2013cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental amalgams are usually silver\u2013tin\u2013mercury alloys, silver\u2013copper\u2013gold alloys are very important in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver\u2013copper\u2013zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver\u2013cadmium\u2013indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"silver\" appears in Old English in various spellings, such as and . It is cognate with Old High German ; Gothic ; or Old Norse , all ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic \"*silubra\". The Balto-Slavic words for silver are rather similar to the Germanic ones (e.g. Russian [], Polish , Lithuanian ), as is the Celtiberian form \"silabur\". They may have a common Indo-European origin, although their morphology rather suggest a non-Indo-European \"Wanderwort\". Some scholars have thus proposed a Paleo-Hispanic origin, pointing to the Basque form as an evidence.\nThe chemical symbol Ag is from the Latin word for \"silver\", \"\" (compare Ancient Greek , ), from the Proto-Indo-European root *\"h\u2082er\u01f5-\" (formerly reconstructed as \"*ar\u01f5-\"), meaning 'white' or 'shining'. This was the usual Proto-Indo-European word for the metal, whose reflexes are missing in Germanic and Balto-Slavic.\nHistory.\nSilver was known in prehistoric times: the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering. Unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy, on account of its low structural strength; it was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold. For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC: the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the silver chloride produced to the metal.\nThe situation changed with the discovery of cupellation, a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores. While slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC, and one of the earliest silver extraction centres in Europe was Sardinia in the early Chalcolithic period, these techniques did not spread widely until later,\nwhen it spread throughout the region and beyond. The origins of silver production in India, China, and Japan were almost certainly equally ancient, but are not well-documented due to their great age.\nWhen the Phoenicians first came to what is now Spain, they obtained so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships, and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead. By the time of the Greek and Roman civilisations, silver coins were a staple of the economy: the Greeks were already extracting silver from galena by the 7th century BC, and the rise of Athens was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at Laurium, from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300\u00a0BC. The stability of the Roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, mostly from Spain, which Roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the New World. Reaching a peak production of 200 tonnes per year, an estimated silver stock of 10,000 tonnes circulated in the Roman economy in the middle of the second century AD, five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate around AD\u00a0800. The Romans also recorded the extraction of silver in central and northern Europe in the same time period. This production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the Roman Empire, not to resume until the time of Charlemagne: by then, tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted.\nCentral Europe became the centre of silver production during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, Steiermark, Schwaz, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, but a few of them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50\u00a0tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilisations as early as AD\u00a060\u2013120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.\nWith the discovery of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around the beginning of the 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina: the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth. The silver trade gave way to a global network of exchange. As one historian put it, silver \"went round the world and made the world go round.\" Much of this silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese. A Portuguese merchant in 1621 noted that silver \"wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural centre\". Still, much of it went to Spain, allowing Spanish rulers to pursue military and political ambitions in both Europe and the Americas. \"New World mines\", concluded several historians, \"supported the Spanish empire.\"\nIn the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined. Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after the discovery of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.\nSymbolic role.\nSilver plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore. The Greek poet Hesiod's \"Works and Days\" (lines 109\u2013201) lists different ages of man named after metals like gold, silver, bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity. Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" contains another retelling of the story, containing an illustration of silver's metaphorical use of signifying the second-best in a series, better than bronze but worse than gold:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;But when good Saturn, banish'd from above,\nWas driv'n to Hell, the world was under Jove.\nSucceeding times a silver age behold,\nExcelling brass, but more excell'd by gold.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIn folklore, silver was commonly thought to have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper \"No Silver Bullet\". Other powers attributed to silver include detection of poison and facilitation of passage into the mythical realm of fairies.\nSilver production has also inspired figurative language. Clear references to cupellation occur throughout the Old Testament of the Bible, such as in Jeremiah's rebuke to Judah: \"The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.\" (Jeremiah 6:19\u201320) Jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver, exemplifying the malleability and ductility of the metal: \"Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.\" (Jeremiah 10:9)\nSilver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom thirty pieces of silver, referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas. Ethically, silver also symbolizes greed and degradation of consciousness; this is the negative aspect, the perverting of its value.\nOccurrence and production.\nThe abundance of silver in the Earth's crust is 0.08\u00a0parts per million, almost exactly the same as that of mercury. It mostly occurs in sulfide ores, especially acanthite and argentite, Ag2S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain native silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to chlorargyrite (including horn silver), AgCl, which is prevalent in Chile and New South Wales. Most other silver minerals are silver pnictides or chalcogenides; they are generally lustrous semiconductors. Most true silver deposits, as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals, came from Tertiary vulcanism.\nThe principal sources of silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, and are still major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Crist\u00f3bal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia), and Hackett River (Canada). In Central Asia, Tajikistan is known to have some of the largest silver deposits in the world.\nSilver is usually found in nature combined with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally in the form of sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327\u00a0\u00b0C, lead oxide at 888\u00a0\u00b0C and silver melts at 960\u00a0\u00b0C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960\u00a0\u00b0C to 1000\u00a0\u00b0C in an oxidising environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.\n Ag(s) + 2Pb(s) + O2(g) \u2192 2PbO(absorbed) + Ag(l)\nToday, silver metal is primarily produced instead as a secondary byproduct of electrolytic refining of copper, lead, and zinc, and by application of the Parkes process on lead bullion from ore that also contains silver. In such processes, silver follows the non-ferrous metal in question through its concentration and smelting, and is later purified out. For example, in copper production, purified copper is electrolytically deposited on the cathode, while the less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under the anode as the so-called \"anode slime\". This is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute sulfuric acid and heating with lime or silica flux, before the silver is purified to over 99.9% purity via electrolysis in nitrate solution.\nCommercial-grade fine silver is at least 99.9% pure, and purities greater than 99.999% are available. In 2022, Mexico was the top producer of silver (6,300 tonnes or 24.2% of the world's total of 26,000 t), followed by China (3,600 t) and Peru (3,100 t).\nIn marine environments.\nSilver concentration is low in seawater (pmol/L). Levels vary by depth and between water bodies. Dissolved silver concentrations range from 0.3\u00a0pmol/L in coastal surface waters to 22.8\u00a0pmol/L in pelagic deep waters. Analysing the presence and dynamics of silver in marine environments is difficult due to these particularly low concentrations and complex interactions in the environment. Although a rare trace metal, concentrations are greatly impacted by fluvial, aeolian, atmospheric, and upwelling inputs, as well as anthropogenic inputs via discharge, waste disposal, and emissions from industrial companies. Other internal processes such as decomposition of organic matter may be a source of dissolved silver in deeper waters, which feeds into some surface waters through upwelling and vertical mixing.\nIn the Atlantic and Pacific, silver concentrations are minimal at the surface but rise in deeper waters. Silver is taken up by plankton in the photic zone, remobilized with depth, and enriched in deep waters. Silver is transported from the Atlantic to the other oceanic water masses. In North Pacific waters, silver is remobilised at a slower rate and increasingly enriched compared to deep Atlantic waters. Silver has increasing concentrations that follow the major oceanic conveyor belt that cycles water and nutrients from the North Atlantic to the South Atlantic to the North Pacific.\nThere is not an extensive amount of data focused on how marine life is affected by silver despite the likely deleterious effects it could have on organisms through bioaccumulation, association with particulate matters, and sorption. Not until about 1984 did scientists begin to understand the chemical characteristics of silver and the potential toxicity. In fact, mercury is the only other trace metal that surpasses the toxic effects of silver; the full silver toxicity extent is not expected in oceanic conditions because of its tendency to transfer into nonreactive biological compounds.\nIn one study, the presence of excess ionic silver and silver nanoparticles caused bioaccumulation effects on zebrafish organs and altered the chemical pathways within their gills. In addition, very early experimental studies demonstrated how the toxic effects of silver fluctuate with salinity and other parameters, as well as between life stages and different species such as finfish, molluscs, and crustaceans. Another study found raised concentrations of silver in the muscles and liver of dolphins and whales, indicating pollution of this metal within recent decades. Silver is not an easy metal for an organism to eliminate and elevated concentrations can cause death.\nMonetary use.\nThe earliest known coins were minted in the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600\u00a0BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Islamic dirham, the karshapana from ancient India and rupee from the time of the Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.\nThe ratio between the amount of silver used for coinage and that used for other purposes has fluctuated greatly over time; for example, in wartime, more silver tends to have been used for coinage to finance the war.\nToday, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 currency code XAG, one of only four precious metals to have one (the others being platinum, palladium, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8,000 silver coins per hour.\nPrice.\nSilver prices are normally quoted in troy ounces. One troy ounce is equal to . The London silver fix is published every working day at noon London time. This price is determined by several major international banks and is used by London bullion market members for trading that day. Prices are most commonly shown as the United States dollar (USD), the Pound sterling (GBP), and the Euro (EUR).\nApplications.\nJewellery and silverware.\nThe major use of silver besides coinage throughout most of history was in the manufacture of jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.\nBecause pure silver is very soft, most silver used for these purposes is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of silver in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.\nMedicine.\nIn medicine, silver is incorporated into wound dressings and used as an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia). The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria \"in vitro\". Silver ions interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, and synthesise cell walls; these ions also bond with the bacteria's genetic material. Silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer. Bacteria can develop resistance to the antimicrobial action of silver. Silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver\u2013tin\u2013mercury amalgams are used in dentistry. Silver diammine fluoride, the fluoride salt of a coordination complex with the formula [Ag(NH3)2]F, is a topical medicament (drug) used to treat and prevent dental caries (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.\nElectronics.\nSilver is very important in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.\nBrazing alloys.\nSilver-containing brazing alloys are used for brazing metallic materials, mostly cobalt, nickel, and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals. The basic components are silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, manganese, and phosphorus. Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage.\nChemical equipment.\nSilver is useful in the manufacture of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver crucibles (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment.\nCatalysis.\nSilver metal is a good catalyst for oxidation reactions; in fact it is somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on \u03b1-Al2O3 or silicates is a catalyst for the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230\u2013270\u00a0\u00b0C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600\u2013720\u00a0\u00b0C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.\nPhotography.\nBefore the advent of digital photography, which is now dominant, the photosensitivity of silver halides was exploited for use in traditional film photography. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and .\nColour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.\nThe market for silver nitrate and silver halides for photography has rapidly declined with the rise of digital cameras. From the peak global demand for photographic silver in 1999 (267,000,000 troy ounces or 8,304.6 tonnes) the market contracted almost 70% by 2013.\nNanoparticles.\nNanosilver particles, between 10 and 100\u00a0nanometres in size, are used in many applications. They are used in conductive inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals in much the same way as larger silver particles. In addition, according to the European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON), silver nanoparticles are used both in pigments, as well as cosmetics.\nMiscellanea.\nPure silver metal is used as a food colouring. It has the E174 designation and is approved in the European Union. Traditional Indian and Pakistani dishes sometimes include decorative silver foil known as \"vark\", and in various other cultures, silver \"drag\u00e9e\" are used to decorate cakes, cookies, and other dessert items.\nPhotochromic lenses include silver halides, so that ultraviolet light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films are used in radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it has the advantage of not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.\nThe Texas Legislature designated silver the official precious metal of Texas in 2007.\nPrecautions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nSilver compounds have low toxicity compared to those of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when ingested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. Silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, or respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts and those of the other precious metals; in most situations, silver is not a serious environmental hazard.\nIn large doses, silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to argyria, which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person's health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis, a blue tint on skin, caused by lack of oxygen.\nMetallic silver, like copper, is an antibacterial agent, which was known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl N\u00e4geli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01\u20130.1\u00a0milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due to the formation of silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.\nSome silver compounds are very explosive, such as the nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27120", "revid": "50529556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27120", "title": "Sorbian languages", "text": "West Slavic language group\nThe Sorbian languages (, ) are the Upper Sorbian language and Lower Sorbian language, two closely related and partially mutually intelligible languages spoken by the Sorbs, a West Slavic ethno-cultural minority in the Lusatia region of Eastern Germany. They are classified under the West Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: Lechitic and Czech\u2013Slovak. Historically, the languages have also been known as Wendish (named after the Wends, the earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or Lusatian. Their collective ISO 639-2 code is .\nThe two Sorbian languages, each having its own literary standard, are Upper Sorbian (), spoken by about 20,000\u201325,000 people in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (), spoken by about 7,000 people in Brandenburg. The area where the two languages are spoken is known as Lusatia ( in Upper Sorbian, in Lower Sorbian, or in German).\nHistory.\nAfter the settlement of the formerly Germanic territories (the part largely corresponding to the former East Germany) by the Slavic ancestors of the Sorbs in the 5th and 6th centuries CE, the Sorbian language (or its predecessors) had been in use in much of what was the southern half of Eastern Germany for several centuries. The language still had its stronghold in (Upper and Lower) Lusatia, where it enjoys national protection and fostering to the present day. For people living in the medieval Northern Holy Roman Empire and its precursors, especially for the Saxons, the Wends (\"Wende\") were heterogeneous groups and tribes of Slavic peoples living near Germanic settlement areas, in the area west of the River Oder, an area later entitled \"Germania Slavica\", settled by the Polabian Slav tribes in the north and by others, such as the Sorbs and the Milceni, further south (see Sorbian March).\nThe exact origin of the Sorbian language is uncertain. While some linguists consider it to be a transitory language between Lechitic and other non-Lechitic languages of West Slavic languages, others like Heinz Schuster-\u0160ewc consider it a separate dialectical group of Proto-Slavic which is a mixture of Proto-Lechitic and South Slavic languages. According to him, \"Sorbian spoken today in Upper and Lower Lusatia is what remains of an earlier extensive Old Sorbian dialect area between the Elbe/Saale rivers in the west and the Bober/Queis rivers in the east\".\nFurthermore, while some consider it a single language which later diverged to two major dialects, others consider these dialects two separate languages. There exist significant differences in phonology, morphology, and lexicon between them. Several characteristics in Upper Sorbian language indicate a close proximity to Czech language which again are absent in Lower Sorbian language. The Upper Sorbian is considered as representative of the old \"Sorbian proper\", while the Lower Sorbian would be a transitional hybrid language more akin to the Lechitic languages. According to some researchers the archaeological data cannot confirm the thesis about a single linguistic group yet supports the claim about two separated ethno-cultural groups with different ancestry whose respective territories correspond to Tornow-type ceramics (Lower Sorbian language) and Leipzig-type ceramics (Upper Sorbian language), both derivations of Prague culture.\nOutside Lusatia, the Sorbian language has been superseded by German. From the 13th century on, the language suffered official discrimination. Bible translations into Sorbian provided the foundations for its writing system.\nToday, around 60,000 Sorbs live in Germany, about 40,000 in Saxony and 20,000 in Brandenburg. Since national affiliation is not officially recorded in Germany, and identification with the Sorbian nationality is voluntary, the exact number is only an estimate. The number of active Sorbian speakers is likely lower. Unlike Upper Sorbian, Lower Sorbian is considered critically endangered. According to projections, around 7,000 people actively speak Lower Sorbian, which could become extinct within 20 to 30 years, while around 13,000 speak Upper Sorbian. According to language experts, Upper Sorbian is expected to survive into the 21st century.\nCurrently, Sorbian is taught at 25 primary schools and several secondary schools. At the Lower Sorbian Gymnasium in Cottbus and the Upper Sorbian Gymnasium in Bautzen, it is compulsory. In many primary and Sorbian schools, lessons are held in the Sorbian language. The daily newspaper \"Serbske Nowiny\" is published in Upper Sorbian, and the weekly \"Nowy Casnik\" in Lower Sorbian. In addition, the religious weekly journals \"Katolski Poso\u0142\" and \"Pomhaj B\u00f3h\" are published. The cultural magazine \"Rozhlad\" appears monthly, along with one children's magazine each in Upper and Lower Sorbian (\"P\u0142omjo\" and \"P\u0142omje\", respectively), as well as the educational magazine \"Serbska \u0161ula\".\nMitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) and Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB) also broadcast monthly half-hour TV magazines in Sorbian, as well as several hours of daily radio programming\u2014the Sorbian radio. Wikipedia editions exist in both written forms of the Sorbian language.\nGeographic distribution.\nIn Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian are officially recognized and protected as minority languages. In the officially defined Sorbian settlement area, both languages are recognized as second official languages next to German.\nThe city of Bautzen in Upper Lusatia is the centre of Upper Sorbian culture. Bilingual signs can be seen around the city, including the name of the city, \"Bautzen/\".\nTo the north, the city of Cottbus/Ch\u00f3\u015bebuz is considered the cultural centre of Lower Sorbian; there, too, bilingual signs are found.\nSorbian was also spoken in the small Sorbian (\"Wendish\") settlement of Serbin in Lee County, Texas, however no speakers remain there. Until 1949, newspapers were published in Sorbian. The local dialect was heavily influenced by surrounding speakers of German and English.\nThe German terms \"Wends\" (\"Wenden\") and \"Wendish\" (\"wendisch/Wendisch\") once denoted \"Slav(ic)\" generally; they are today mostly replaced by \"Sorbs\" (\"Sorben\") and \"Sorbian\" (\"sorbisch/Sorbisch\") with reference to Sorbian communities in Germany.\nEndangered status.\nThe use of Sorbian languages has been contracting for a number of years. The loss of Sorbian language use in emigrant communities, such as in Serbin, Texas, has not been surprising. But within the Sorbian homelands, there has also been a decrease in Sorbian identity and language use. In 2008, Sorbs protested three kinds of pressures against Sorbs: \"(1.) the destruction of Sorbian and German-Sorbian villages as a result of lignite mining; (2.) the cuts in the network of Sorbian schools in Saxony; (3.) the reduction of financial resources for the Sorbian institutions by central government.\"\nA study of Upper Sorbian found a number of trends that go against language vitality. There are policies that have led to \"unstable diglossia\". There has been a loss of language domains in which speakers have the option to use either language, and there is a disruption of the patterns by which the Sorbian language has traditionally been transmitted to the next generation. Also, there is no strong written tradition and there is not a broadly accepted formal standardized form of the language(s). There is a perception of the loss of language rights, and there are negative attitudes towards the languages and their speakers.\nLinguistic features.\nBoth Upper and Lower Sorbian have the dual for nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs; very few living Indo-European languages retain this as a productive feature of the grammar. For example, the word is used for one hand, for two hands, and for more than two hands. As with most Slavic languages, Sorbian uses no articles.\nGrammar.\nThe Sorbian languages are declined in six or seven cases:\nIn Lower Sorbian, the vocative is preserved only in a few fossilized forms.\nNotably, in addition to the singular and plural, the dual number (used for two items), inherited from Old Slavic, has also been preserved.\nIn contrast to other West Slavic languages (Czech, Slovak, Polish, Kashubian), Upper Sorbian literary language and some dialects have preserved the synthetic past tense (aorist, imperfect) to this day. This form was also common in Lower Sorbian literary language, but over the course of the 20th century, it has become increasingly rare and is hardly used today.\nLower Sorbian, however, has retained the supine (a variant of the infinitive used after verbs of motion), e.g.: \"njok spa\u015b\" (\"I don't want to sleep\") versus \"\u017ai spat\" (\"go to sleep\")\nLess demanding written texts in Sorbian can generally be understood by speakers of West Slavic languages.\nVocabulary comparison.\nThe following is selected vocabulary from the two Sorbian languages compared with other Slavic languages.\nDifferences between the two written languages.\nThere are several differences between the two written languages, Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian, particularly in the alphabet.\nIn the consonants.\nThe two written languages differ significantly in terms of consonants. For example, the letter \u0107 has been alphabetically placed after \"\u010d\" in Upper Sorbian since 2005.\nVowels.\nBoth Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian have eight vowels.\nDifferent number of syllables.\nIn some words, the number of syllables differs because Upper Sorbian has shortened them here, similarly to Czech.\nDifferences in declension\nUpper Sorbian have seven cases and Lower Sorbian have six cases.\nDifferences in case government (i.e., which case follows which preposition or verb)\nPhonological development of Sorbian.\nCommon developments and developments only in Lower Sorbian.\nAs in Polish and Czech, the two Proto-Slavic reduced vowels \u044c and \u044a in Sorbian developed early into \"e\" in stressed position. Full vowels, which stood in syllables before a reduced vowel in unstressed position, were lengthened after the fall of the reduced vowels. Over time, the opposition of short and long vowels was lost, and words were generally stressed on the first syllable; in Proto-Slavic the stress had been free. This development occurred under the influence of German and has a parallel in Czech.\nThe nasal vowels in Sorbian disappeared according to Jerzy Nalepa in the second half of the 12th century under Czech influence.\nThe affricate \"\u0292\" was, as in most other Slavic languages, simplified to \"z\", cf. \"mjeza\" (Polish: \"miedza\") (\u201cborder\u201d).\nAs in Polish and originally also in Kashubian, the soft dentals \"\u0165\" and \"\u010f\" in Sorbian changed into the affricates \"\u0107\" and \"d\u017a\". This transition already occurred in the 13th century. In Lower Sorbian, these affricates later also lost their plosive component: \"\u0107\" &gt; \"\u015b\", \"d\u017a\" &gt; \"\u017a\", except after dental spirants: \"rje\u015baz\" \u201cchain\u201d, \"da\u015b\" \u201cto give\u201d, \"kos\u0107\" \u201cbone\u201d, \"\u017aiwy\" \u201cwild\u201d, \"m\u011b\u017a\" \u201ccopper\u201d, \"pozd\u017aej\" \u201clater\u201d (compared to Upper Sorbian \"rje\u0107az\", \"da\u0107\", \"kos\u0107\", \"di\u017awi\", \"mjed\u017a\", \"pozd\u017ae\"). This change occurred in the mid-16th century in the western dialects and 100 years later in the eastern dialects, whereby the central transitional dialects as well as the dialects of Muskau and Schleife were not affected.\nSoft \"c'\", \"z'\", \"s'\" were hardened in Sorbian. When the sound \"i\" followed them, it changed to \"y\": \"ducy\" \u201cto go\u201d, \"sy\u0142a\" \u201cstrength\u201d, \"zyma\" \u201cwinter\u201d (compared to Czech \"jdouc\u00ed\", \"s\u00edla\", \"zima\"). This change probably took place in the early 15th century. A similar change (only in Lower Sorbian) occurred at the beginning of the 16th century with the soft \"\u010d'\", \"\u017e'\", \"\u0161\"': \"cysty\" \u201cclean\u201d, \"\u0161yja\" \u201cneck\u201d, \"\u017eywy\" \u201calive\u201d (cf. Upper Sorbian \"\u010disty\", \"\u0161ija\", \"\u017eiwy\").\nIn the mid-16th century, \"\u010d\" became \"c\": \"cas\" \u201ctime\u201d, \"pco\u0142a\" \u201cbee\u201d (from \"\u010das\", \"p\u010do\u0142a\"). This change did not occur only in the ending \"-u\u010dki\" and after spirants. In addition, \"\u010d\" appears in loanwords and onomatopoeic words.\nAfter \"p\", \"t\", and \"k\", the sounds \"r\" and \"r'\" in Sorbian became \"\u0159\" and \"\u0159'\". In Lower Sorbian, \"\u0159\" developed further to \"\u0161\" and \"\u0159\"' to \"\u0107\" (later \"\u015b\"): \"p\u0161awy\" \u201cright\u201d, \"t\u015bi\" \u201cthree\u201d.\nAs in Polish, the voiceless \"\u0142\" in Lower Sorbian became bilabial \"w\", with the first written records dating from the 17th century, and the soft \"\u013e\" adopted the \u201cEuropean\u201d alveolar articulation (as in German) except before front vowels.\nThe sound \"w\" in Sorbian disappeared in initial clusters \"gw-\" and \"xw-\" (Proto-Slavic \"gvozdj\" &gt; \"gozd\" \u201cdry forest\u201d, Proto-Slavic \"xvo\u0161\u010dj\" &gt; \"cho\u0161\u0107\" \u201chorsetail\u201d), at the beginning of a word before a consonant, and after a consonant before \"u\". This process probably began before the 13th century and ended in the 16th century. The soft \u201cw\u201d in the middle of words in intervocalic position and before consonants as well as at the end of words changed to \u201cj\u201d: \"rukajca\" \u201cglove\u201d (Polish: \"r\u0119kawica\"), \"mu\u017eoju / mu\u017eeju\" \u201cman\u201d (Polish: \"m\u0119\u017cowi\"), \"k\u0161ej\" \u201cblood\u201d (Polish: \"krew\").\nThe sound \"e\" changed into \"a\" in the position after soft consonants and before hard consonants: \"brjaza\" \u201cbirch\u201d, \"kolaso\" \u201cwheel\u201d, \"pjac\" \u201coven\u201d, \"la\u017ea\u015b\" \u201clie\u201d, \"pjas\" \u201cdog\u201d (cf. \"br\u011bza\", \"koleso\", \"pjec\", \"le\u017ee\u0107\"', \"pos\"). This change was completed in the mid-17th century and again did not affect the dialects of Muskau and Schleife.\nPhonological developments Only in Upper Sorbian\nIn some positions, metathesis of \"or\", \"ol\", \"er\", and \"el\" occurred in Upper Sorbian: in positions between consonants, these became \"ro\", \"lo\", \"re\", and \"le\", while at the beginning of a word, \"or\", \"ol\" became either \"ra-\", \"la-\" or \"ro-\", \"lo-\" depending on the stress.\nAs in Polish and Czech, the two Proto-Slavic reduced vowels in stressed position changed to \"e\" in Sorbian as well. Unstressed full vowels in the syllable before the reduced vowel were lengthened with the disappearance of the reduced vowels. Long \"\u0113\" and \"\u014d\" in stressed position became mid vowels in Upper Sorbian, which are written in the modern Upper Sorbian literary language as \"\u011b\" and \"\u00f3\". Proto-Slavic \"\u0113\" merged with \"\u011b\". Later, in the 19th century, \"\u00f3\" became \"o\" before reflexive pronouns and labials: \"mloko\" \u2013 \"w ml\u00f3ce\" (\u201cmilk\u201d \u2013 \u201cin milk\u201d). Over time, the contrast between long and short vowels was lost.\nSyllabic \"\u1e5b\" became \"or\" in Upper Sorbian: *k\u044armiti &gt; \"k\u1e5bmiti &gt; kormi\u0107\" (\u201cto feed\u201d), and similarly, \"\u1e5b\u02bc\" before voiceless dentals also became \"or\": *p\u044crst\u044a &gt; \"p\u1e5b\u02bcst\u044a &gt; porst\" (\u201cfinger\u201d), while in other positions it softened to \"je\": *pr\u0161t\u011bp &gt; \"p\u1e5b\u02bc\u0161t\u011bp &gt; pjer\u0161\u0107e\u0144\" (\u201cring\u201d). Syllabic \"\u1e37\" became \"o\u0142\": *d\u044alg\u044a &gt; \"d\u1e37g\u044a &gt; do\u0142h\" (\u201cdebt\u201d), or before voiceless dentals became \"\u1e37\u02bc\": *rlnj &gt; \"p\u1e37\u02bcp\u044a &gt; po\u0142ny\" (\u201cfull\u201d), and in other positions became \"el\": *vjlk &gt; \"v\u1e37\u02bck\u044a &gt; wjelk\" (\u201cwolf\u201d).\nThe nasal vowels in Sorbian disappeared, according to J. Nalepa, in the second half of the 12th century under Czech influence, while in Polish they remain to this day. The vowel \"a\" between two soft consonants became \"e\" in Upper Sorbian: \"jeje\" (\u201cegg\u201d), \"\u017eel\" (\u201ccompassion\u201d). Written evidence suggests this occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, and in some Upper Sorbian dialects, it has not occurred at all.\nJust as in Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian, the plosive \"g\" turned into the fricative \"h\" in Upper Sorbian. The \"g\" sound only appears in relatively recent loanwords or expressive words in Upper Sorbian. J. Nalepa dates the beginning of the shift \"g &gt; h\" to the late 13th century, while J. Stone places it in the 12th century, stating that the change spread from south to north. Gunter Schaarschmidt, based on texts and toponyms, assumes that the transition occurred via the intermediate sound \"\u03b3\" (as in Belarusian) and that this sound \"\u03b3\" already existed in Upper Sorbian in the 12th to 14th centuries. Later, \"h\" was mostly lost in Upper Sorbian, except before vowels and after consonants. In most dialects and in Upper Sorbian colloquial language, \"h\" also disappeared in intervocalic position. The first written evidence of this dates back to the beginning of the 17th century.\nAs mentioned, in the 13th century the soft dentals \"\u0165\" and \"\u010f\" in Sorbian became the affricates \"\u0107\" and \"d\u017a\": \"t\u011blo &gt; \u0107\u011b\u0142o\" (\u201cbody\u201d), \"dev\u0119t &gt; d\u017aewje\u0107\" (\u201cnine\u201d). In Upper Sorbian, \"\u0107\" later merged with \"\u010d\", and \"d\u017a\" with the allophone \"\u010d \u2013 d\u017e\", which led to their phonologization. The Proto-Slavic combinations \"\u0161\u010d\" and \"\u017ed\u017e\" were first simplified to \"\u0161\u0165\" and \"\u017e\u010f\" respectively, and then by affrication of \"\u0165\" and \"\u010f\" to \"\u0161\u0107\" and \"\u017ed\u017a\". Soft \"c\u02bc\", \"z\u02bc\", and \"s\u02bc\" were hardened, and the following \"i\" and \"\u011b\" changed to \"y\": Proto-Slavic \"c\u011bl\u044a &gt; cy\u0142y\", Proto-Slavic \"sila &gt; sy\u0142a\", Proto-Slavic \"zima &gt; zyma\". After \"p\", \"t\", \"k\", the sounds \"r\" and \"r\u02bc\" in Sorbian changed to \"\u0159\" and \"\u0159\u02bc\"; in Upper Sorbian, this sound later became \"\u0161\". Still later, the combination \"t\u0161\" was simplified to \"c\u02bc\".\nThe spirant \"x\" in Upper Sorbian changed to aspirated \"k\" (\"k\u02b0\") at the beginning of a word before a vowel, and elsewhere to unaspirated \"k\". This change is already evident in texts from the 16th century, though it is not reflected in modern Upper Sorbian orthography. Similar to Polish, hard \"\u0142\" was replaced with \"w\" in Upper Sorbian (first evidence from the 17th century), except in the northeastern dialects, while soft \"l\u02bc\" assumed a \u201cEuropean\u201d (alveolar) articulation (like in German), except when followed by a front vowel.\nThe sound \"w\" dropped in Sorbian in the initial clusters \"gw-\" and \"xw-\", e.g. Proto-Slavic \"gvozdj &gt; h\u00f3zd\u017a\" (\u201cnail\u201d) and Proto-Slavic \"hvogstt\u044a &gt; chr\u00f3st\" (\u201chorsetail\u201d), specifically at the beginning of a word before a consonant, and after consonants before \"u\". This process likely began before the 13th century and ended in the 16th century. The soft \"w\u02bc\" in the middle of a word in intervocalic position and before a consonant, as well as at the end of a word, became \"j\": \"praji\u0107\" (\u201cto speak\u201d) (Polish: \"prawi\u0107\"), \"mu\u017eej\" (\u201cman\u201d) (Polish: \"m\u0119\u017cowi\"), \"krej\" (\u201cblood\u201d) (Polish: \"krew\").\nBefore soft consonants at the end of a word or elsewhere before other consonants (and before originally soft dental affricates and spirants also in other positions), an epenthetic \"j\" appeared in Upper Sorbian. When \"j\" follows \"e\" or \"\u011b\", the preceding consonant becomes voiceless. The consonant \"\u0144\" is also hardened before other consonants. This change is not reflected in the spelling: \"d\u017ae\u0144\" [\u02c8d\u0361\u0292ejn] (\u201cday\u201d), \"le\u017ee\u0107\" [\u02c8lej\u0292et\u0361\u0283] (\u201cto lie\u201d), \"te\u017e\" [tej\u0283] (\u201calso\u201d), \"ch\u011b\u017ea\" [\u02c8k\u02b0ej\u0292a] (\u201chouse\u201d). This epenthetic \"j\" likely already appeared in Upper Sorbian at the end of the 16th century.\nThe replacement of the dental \"r\" by the uvular \"r\" in several Upper Sorbian dialects is attributed to German influence.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27121", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27121", "title": "Samarium", "text": "element with atomic number 62 (Sm)\nSamarium is a chemical element; it has symbol Sm and atomic number 62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually has the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide.\nDiscovered in 1879 by French chemist Paul-\u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, samarium was named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thus became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, though the name was indirect.\nSamarium occurs in concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and bastn\u00e4site, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.\nThe main commercial use of samarium is in samarium\u2013cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their permanent magnetic properties. The radioisotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells in lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and so is added to control rods of nuclear reactors. It also forms as a decay product during reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in reactor design and operation. Other uses of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and X-ray lasers. Samarium(II) iodide, in particular, is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis.\nSamarium has no biological role; some samarium salts are slightly toxic.\nPhysical properties.\nSamarium is a rare earth element with a hardness and density similar to zinc. With a boiling point of , samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium and comparable in this respect to lead and barium; this helps separation of samarium from its ores. When freshly prepared, samarium has a silvery lustre, and takes on a duller appearance when oxidized in air. Samarium is calculated to have one of the largest atomic radii of the elements; with a radius of 238\u00a0pm, only potassium, praseodymium, barium, rubidium and caesium are larger.\nIn ambient conditions, samarium has a rhombohedral structure (\u03b1 form). Upon heating to , its crystal symmetry changes to hexagonal close-packed (\"hcp\"),; it has actual transition temperature depending on metal purity. Further heating to transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (\"bcc\") phase. Heating to plus compression to 40\u00a0kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (\"dhcp\"). Higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900\u00a0kbar. In one study, the \"dhcp\" phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about and , confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the \"hcp\" or \"dhcp\" phases in ambient conditions.\nSamarium and its sesquioxide are paramagnetic at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2 bohr magnetons, are the third-lowest among lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14.8\u00a0K. Individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules. They can also be intercalated into the interstices of the bulk C60 to form a solid solution of nominal composition Sm3C60, which is superconductive at a temperature of 8\u00a0K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors \u2013 a class of high-temperature superconductor \u2013 increases their transition to normal conductivity temperature up to 56\u00a0K, the highest value achieved so far in this series.\nChemical properties.\nIn air, samarium slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at . Even when stored under mineral oil, samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.\nSamarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and rapidly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide:\nSamarium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow to pale green Sm(III) ions, which exist as complexes:\nSamarium is one of the few lanthanides with a relatively accessible +2 oxidation state, alongside Eu and Yb. ions are blood-red in aqueous solution.\nCompounds.\nOxides.\nThe most stable oxide of samarium is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. Like many samarium compounds, it exists in several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is high (2345\u00a0\u00b0C), so it is usually melted not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.\nSamarium is one of the few lanthanides that form a monoxide, SmO. This lustrous golden-yellow compound was obtained by reducing Sm2O3 with samarium metal at high temperature (1000\u00a0\u00b0C) and a pressure above 50\u00a0kbar; lowering the pressure resulted in incomplete reaction. SmO has cubic rock-salt lattice structure.\nChalcogenides.\nSamarium forms a trivalent sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with a cubic rock-salt crystal structure are known. These chalcogenides convert from a semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20\u201330\u00a0kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5\u00a0kbar. This effect results in a spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change the lattice symmetry, but there is a sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It exhibits hysteresis, i.e., when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at a much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.\nHalides.\nSamarium metal reacts with all the halogens, forming trihalides:\n2 Sm (s) + 3 X2 (g) \u2192 2 SmX3 (s) (X = F, Cl, Br or I)\nTheir further reduction with samarium, lithium or sodium metals at elevated temperatures (about 700\u2013900\u00a0\u00b0C) yields the dihalides. The diiodide can also be prepared by heating SmI3, or by reacting the metal with 1,2-diiodoethane in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at room temperature:\nSm (s) + ICH2-CH2I \u2192 SmI2 + CH2=CH2.\nIn addition to dihalides, the reduction also produces many non-stoichiometric samarium halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as Sm3F7, Sm14F33, Sm27F64, Sm11Br24, Sm5Br11 and Sm6Br13.\nSamarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide anion is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90\u00a0g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97\u00a0g/cm3).\nBorides.\nSintering powders of samarium oxide and boron, in a vacuum, yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases; the ratio between these phases can be controlled through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of samarium borides using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580\u00a0\u00b0C), SmB4 (about 2300\u00a0\u00b0C) and SmB66 (2150\u00a0\u00b0C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65\u00a0kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240\u00a0\u00b0C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formation of SmB6.\nSamarium hexaboride.\nSamarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate-valence compound where samarium is present both as Sm2+ and Sm3+ ions in a 3:7 ratio. It belongs to a class of Kondo insulators; at temperatures above 50\u00a0K, its properties are typical of a Kondo metal, with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering, whereas at lower temperatures, it behaves as a non-magnetic insulator with a narrow band gap of about 4\u201314\u00a0meV. The cooling-induced metal-insulator transition in SmB6 is accompanied by a sharp increase in the thermal conductivity, peaking at about 15\u00a0K. The reason for this increase is that electrons themselves do not contribute to the thermal conductivity at low temperatures, which is dominated by phonons, but the decrease in electron concentration reduces the rate of electron-phonon scattering.\nOther inorganic compounds.\nSamarium carbides are prepared by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and need to be studied under an inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.10\u00a0eV, the same as in silicon, and electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1\u00a0\u00b0C/min. A similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at .\nNumerous crystalline binary compounds are known for samarium and one of the group 14, 15, or 16 elements X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group. They are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements. Many of the resulting compounds are non-stoichiometric and have nominal compositions SmaXb, where the b/a ratio varies between 0.5 and 3.\nOrganometallic compounds.\nSamarium forms a cyclopentadienide and its chloroderivatives and . They are prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides of most other lanthanides, in some rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes \u03b71 or edges \u03b72 toward another neighboring samarium, thus creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as . There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.\nThe ()\u2212 ion in samarium cyclopentadienides can be replaced by the indenide ()\u2212 or cyclooctatetraenide ()2\u2212 ring, resulting in or . The latter compound has a structure similar to uranocene. There is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium, a solid that sublimates at about . Contrary to ferrocene, the rings in are not parallel but are tilted by 40\u00b0.\nA metathesis reaction in tetrahydrofuran or ether gives alkyls and aryls of samarium:\n\nHere R is a hydrocarbon group and Me = methyl.\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring samarium is composed of five stable isotopes: 144Sm, 149Sm, 150Sm, 152Sm and 154Sm, and two extremely long-lived radioisotopes, 147Sm (half-life \"t\"1/2\u00a0= 1.066\u00d71011 years) and 148Sm (6.3\u00d71015 years), with 152Sm being the most abundant (26.75%). 149Sm is listed by various sources as being stable, but some sources state that it is radioactive; the lower bound on its half-life is years. Some observationally stable samarium isotopes are predicted to decay to isotopes of neodymium. The long-lived isotopes 146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm (and 149Sm if it decays) undergo alpha decay to neodymium isotopes. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium mainly decay by electron capture to promethium, while heavier ones beta decay to europium. The known isotopes range from 129Sm to 168Sm. The half-lives of 151Sm and 145Sm are 94.6 years and 340 days, respectively. All remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than 2 days, and most these have half-life less than 48 seconds. Natural samarium has a radioactivity of 127\u00a0Bq/g, mostly due to 147Sm, whose alpha decay to 143Nd is used in samarium\u2013neodymium dating. 146Sm is an extinct radionuclide, with the half-life of 9.20\u00d7107 years. There have been searches of samarium-146 as a primordial nuclide, because its half-life is long enough such that minute quantities of the element should persist today. It can be used in radiometric dating.\nSamarium-149 is an observationally stable isotope of samarium and a product of the decay chain from the fission product 149Nd (yield 1.0888%). 149Sm is a significant neutron absorber in nuclear reactors, with a neutron poison effect that is second in importance for reactor design and operation only to 135Xe. Its neutron cross section is 41000 barns for thermal neutrons. Because samarium-149 is not radioactive and is not removed by decay, it presents problems somewhat different from those encountered with xenon-135. The equilibrium concentration (and thus the poisoning effect) builds to an equilibrium value during reactor operations in about 500 hours (about three weeks) as the isotope does not measurably vanish except through neutron capture.\nSamarium-153 is a beta emitter with a half-life of 46.285 hours. It is used to kill cancer cells in lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.\nHistory.\nDetection of samarium and related elements was announced by several scientists in the second half of the 19th century; however, most sources give priority to French chemist Paul-\u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran. Boisbaudran isolated samarium oxide and/or hydroxide in Paris in 1879 from the mineral samarskite ) and identified a new element in it via sharp optical absorption lines. Swiss chemist Marc Delafontaine announced a new element \"decipium\" (from meaning \"deceptive, misleading\") in 1878, but later in 1880\u20131881 demonstrated that it was a mix of several elements, one being identical to Boisbaudran's samarium. Though samarskite was first found in the Ural Mountains in Russia, by the late 1870s it had been found in other places, making it available to many researchers. In particular, it was found that the samarium isolated by Boisbaudran was also impure and had a comparable amount of europium. The pure samarium(III) oxide was produced only in 1901 by Eug\u00e8ne-Anatole Demar\u00e7ay, and in 1903 Wilhelm Muthmann isolated the element.\nBoisbaudran named his element \"samarium\" after the mineral samarskite, which in turn honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803\u20131870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the brothers Gustav and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. Samarium was thus the first chemical element to be named after a person. The word \"samaria\" is sometimes used to mean samarium(III) oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol \"Sm\" was suggested for samarium, but an alternative \"Sa\" was often used instead until the 1920s.\nBefore the advent of ion-exchange separation technology in the 1950s, pure samarium had no commercial uses. However, a by-product of fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mix of samarium and gadolinium that got the name \"Lindsay Mix\" after the company that made it, and was used for nuclear control rods in some early nuclear reactors. Nowadays, a similar commodity product has the name \"samarium-europium-gadolinium\" (SEG) concentrate. It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides isolated from bastn\u00e4site (or monazite). Since heavier lanthanides have more affinity for the solvent used, they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent. Not all rare-earth producers who process bastn\u00e4site do so on a large enough scale to continue by separating the components of SEG, which typically makes up only 1\u20132% of the original ore. Such producers therefore make SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors. In this manner, the valuable europium in the ore is rescued for use in making phosphor. Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium. As of 2012[ [update]], being in oversupply, samarium oxide is cheaper on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest.\nOccurrence and production.\nSamarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23\u00a0ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5\u20130.8\u00a0parts per trillion. The median value for its abundance in the Earth's crust used by the CRC Handbook is 7parts per million (ppm) and is the 40th most abundant element. Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.\nSamarium is not found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including monazite, bastn\u00e4site, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastn\u00e4site are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it is followed by the US (about 5,000\u00a0tonnes) and India (2,700\u00a0tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about US$30/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal \u2013 a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium \u2013 has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1,794\u00a0\u00b0C) and lanthanum (b.p.\u00a03,464\u00a0\u00b0C).\nVery few minerals have samarium being the most dominant element. Minerals with essential (dominant) samarium include monazite-(Sm) and florencite-(Sm). These minerals are very rare and are usually found containing other elements, usually cerium or neodymium. It is also made by neutron capture by samarium-149, which is added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. Therefore, 151Sm is present in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.\nSeparating samarium from minerals involves nearly 100 individual processes and extremely strong acids.\nGeopolitics.\nWestern militaries across the world relied on a single samarium production plant in La Rochelle, France from the 1970s until the plant's closure in 1994. The facility sourced its samarium from Australia. A $1billion United States government effort to re-open a closed rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, California resulted in the facility going bankrupt.\n, China produces all of the world's usable samarium; refining is concentrated in Baotou. The Biden administration signed two contracts for samarium production plants in the United States, but neither materialized. During US president Donald Trump's second-term tariff war, China leveled strict limits on the export of samarium, among other rare earth metals, as part of the long-running rare earths trade dispute (and larger trade war) between the two nations.\nApplications.\nMagnets.\nAn important use of samarium is samarium\u2013cobalt magnets, which are nominally or . They have high permanent magnetization, about 10,000 times that of iron and second only to neodymium magnets. However, samarium magnets resist demagnetization better; they are stable to temperatures above (cf. 300\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.\nDue to their heat resistance, samarium magnets are also used for military applications and are needed to manufacture modern aircraft and missiles. A single F-35 fighter jet contains about of samarium magnets.\nChemical reagent.\nSamarium and its compounds are important as catalysts and chemical reagents. Samarium catalysts help the decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), as well as dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate , that is , is one of the most efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel\u2013Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.\nIn its usual oxidized form, samarium is added to ceramics and glasses where it increases absorption of infrared light. As a (minor) part of mischmetal, samarium is found in the \"flint\" ignition devices of many lighters and torches.\nNeutron absorber.\nSamarium-149 has a high cross section for neutron capture (41,000\u00a0barns) and so is used in control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption \u2013 most of the fusion products of 149Sm are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000\u00a0barns, it is on the order of hundreds of barns for 150Sm, 152Sm, and 153Sm, and 6,800\u00a0barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium.\nLasers.\nSamarium-doped calcium fluoride crystals were used as an active medium in one of the first solid-state lasers designed and built by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser gave pulses of red light at 708.5\u00a0nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and so did not find practical applications. Another samarium-based laser became the first saturated X-ray laser operating at wavelengths shorter than 10 nanometers. It gave 50-picosecond pulses at 7.3 and 6.8\u00a0nm suitable for uses in holography, high-resolution microscopy of biological specimens, deflectometry, interferometry, and radiography of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and astrophysics. Saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium, resulting in the high peak energy of 0.3\u00a0mJ. The active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium-coated glass with a pulsed infrared (wavelength ~1.05\u00a0\u03bcm).\nStorage phosphor.\nIn 2007 it was shown that nanocrystalline BaFCl:Sm3+ as prepared by co-precipitation can serve as a very efficient X-ray storage phosphor. The co-precipitation leads to nanocrystallites of the order of 100\u2013200\u00a0nm in size and their sensitivity as X-ray storage phosphors is increased a remarkable ~500,000 times because of the specific arrangements and density of defect centers in comparison with microcrystalline samples prepared by sintering at high temperature. The mechanism is based on reduction of Sm3+ to Sm2+ by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the BaFCl host. The 5DJ\u20137FJ f\u2013f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed 4f6\u21924f55d transition at ~417\u00a0nm. The latter wavelength is ideal for efficient excitation by blue-violet laser diodes as the transition is electric dipole allowed and thus relatively intense (400 L/(mol\u22c5cm)).\nThe phosphor has potential applications in personal dosimetry, dosimetry and imaging in radiotherapy, and medical imaging.\nBiological role and precautions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nSamarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it is unclear whether this is from samarium or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50\u00a0\u03bcg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with ~8\u00a0\u03bcg/L being dissolved in blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and so is normally not part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic. When ingested, only 0.05% of samarium salts are absorbed into the bloodstream and the remainder are excreted. From the blood, 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited on the surface of the bones where it remains for 10 years; the remaining 10% is excreted.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
