Heinlein\nStarship Troopers is a military science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. Written in a few weeks in reaction to the US suspending nuclear tests, the story was first published as a two-part serial in \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\" as Starship Soldier, and published as a book by G. P. Putnam's Sons on November 5, 1959.\nThe story is set in a future society ruled by a human interstellar government called the Terran Federation, dominated by a military elite. Under the Terran Federation, only veterans of a primarily military Federal Service enjoy full citizenship, including the right to vote. The first-person narrative follows Juan \"Johnny\" Rico, a young man of Filipino descent, through his military service in the Mobile Infantry. He progresses from recruit to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as \"Arachnids\" or \"Bugs\". Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues, including aspects of suffrage, civic virtue, juvenile delinquency, and war; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein's own political views. Identified with a tradition of militarism in US science fiction, the novel draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs, and the Cold War. It is also a coming-of-age novel, which criticizes the US society of the 1950s, arguing that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline, and advocating corporal and capital punishment.\n\"Starship Troopers\" brought to an end Heinlein's series of juvenile novels. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and was praised by reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The novel's militarism, and the fact that government service\u00a0\u2013 most often military service\u00a0\u2013 was a prerequisite to the right to vote in the novel, led to it being frequently described as fascist. Others disagree, arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers have said that the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.\n\"Starship Troopers\" had wide influence both within and outside science fiction. Ken MacLeod stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein\". Science fiction critic Darko Suvin wrote that it is the \"ancestral text of US science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years. The novel is credited with popularizing the idea of powered armor, which became a recurring feature in science fiction books and films, as well as an object of scientific research. Heinlein's depiction of a futuristic military was also influential. Later science fiction books, such as Joe Haldeman's 1974 anti-war novel \"The Forever War\", have been described as reactions to \"Starship Troopers\". The story was adapted several times, including in a 1997 film version directed by Paul Verhoeven that satirized what the director saw as the fascist aspects of the novel.\nWriting and publication.\nRobert Heinlein was among the best-selling science fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s, along with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke; they were known as the \"big three\" that dominated US science fiction. In contrast to the others, Heinlein firmly endorsed the anti-communist sentiment of the Cold War era in his writing. Heinlein served in the US Navy for five years after graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1929. His experience in the military profoundly influenced his fiction. At some point between 1958 and 1959, Heinlein put aside the novel that would become \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and wrote \"Starship Troopers\". His motivation arose partially from his anger at US President Dwight Eisenhower's decision to suspend US nuclear tests, and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward. Writing in his 1980 volume \"Expanded Universe\", Heinlein would say that the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of nuclear weapons testing by the United States sparked his desire to write \"Starship Troopers\". Heinlein and his wife Virginia created the \"Patrick Henry League\" in an attempt to create support for the US nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views.\nLike many of Heinlein's books, \"Starship Troopers\" was completed in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by that publisher. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with that publisher completely, and to resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections to the content of the novel, particularly in its treatment of military conflict.\n\"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\" first published \"Starship Troopers\" in October and November 1959 as a two-part serial titled \"Starship Soldier\". A senior editor at Putnam's, Peter Israel, purchased the manuscript and approved revisions that made it more marketable to adults. Asked whether it was aimed at children or adults, he said at a sales conference \"Let's let the readers decide who likes it.\" The novel was eventually published by G. P. Putnam's Sons.\nSetting.\nSet approximately 700 years in the future, the book depicts an Earth ruled by a world government run by military veterans. The society is depicted as affluent, and futuristic technology shown as coexisting with educational methods from the 20th century. The rights of a full citizen, to vote and hold public office, are not universally guaranteed, and rather must be earned through Federal Service. Those who do not perform this service (of which only military service has been described) retain the rights of free speech and assembly, but can neither vote nor hold public office. People of either sex above the age of 18 are permitted to enlist; only those who complete their service receive the right to vote. Important government jobs are reserved for federal service veterans. This structure arose \"ad hoc\" after the collapse of the \"20th century Western democracies\", driven in part by an inability to control crime and juvenile delinquency, particularly in North America, and a war between an alliance of the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, against the \"Chinese Hegemony\".\nTwo extraterrestrial civilizations are depicted, respectively, as the \"Pseudo-Arachnids\" (or \"Bugs\"), and the \"Skinnies\". The \"Bugs\" are described as communal beings originating from the planet of Klendathu, and consist of multiple castes; workers, warriors, brains, and queens, similar to those of ants and termites on Earth. The warriors are the only ones who fight, and are unable to surrender in battle. It also is implied that the Bugs are technologically advanced, possessing such technologies as spaceships. The \"Skinnies\" are depicted as less communal than the Arachnids, yet more so than humans. The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids. At the opening of the story, Earth is not at war, yet such a declaration has come when Rico has completed his training. The \"Skinnies\" are initially allies of the Pseudo-Arachnids, but switch to alliance with humans, midway through the novel. Faster-than-light travel exists in this future: spacecraft use the \"Cherenkov drive\", and can travel \"Sol to Capella, forty-six lightyears, in under six weeks\".\n\"Starship Troopers\" is narrated by the main protagonist Juan \"Johnny\" Rico, a member of the \"Mobile Infantry\". It is one of the few Heinlein novels which intersperses his typical linear narrative structure with a series of flashbacks. These flashbacks are frequently to Rico's \"History and Moral Philosophy\" course in school, in which the teacher discusses the history of the structure of their society. Rico is depicted as a man of Filipino ancestry. He is from a wealthy family, whose members had never served in the military. Rico's ancestry is depicted as inconsequential, society having finally abandoned racial and gender-based prejudice.\nPlot.\nThe novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette transport \"Rodger Young\" (named after real life Medal of Honor recipient Rodger Wilton Young), serving with the platoon known as \"Rasczak's Roughnecks\". The platoon carries out a raid against a planetary colony held by Skinnies. The raid is relatively brief: the platoon lands on the planet, destroys its targets, and retreats, suffering two casualties in the process. One of them, Dizzy Flores, is rescued by Rico but dies while returning to orbit. The narrative then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school. Rico and his best friend Carl are considering joining the Federal Service after graduation; Rico is hesitant, partly due to his father's attitude towards the military. Rico makes his decision after discovering that his classmate Carmen Iba\u00f1ez also intends to enlist.\nRico's choice is taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves with a sense of estrangement. He is assigned to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the ranks to general in World War I) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialed, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without ensuring that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Disheartened, Rico thinks of resigning when he receives a letter from Jean Dubois, who taught Rico History and Moral Philosophy. Dubois reveals that he was once a lieutenant colonel in the Mobile Infantry, which gives Rico the motivation not to resign. After further training at another camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2,009 who had begun training in that regiment.\nThe \"Bug War\" has changed from minor incidents to a full-scale war during Rico's training. An Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires alerts civilians to the situation; Rico's mother is killed in the attack. Rico participates in the Battle of Klendathu, an attack on the Arachnid's home world, which turns into a disastrous defeat for the Terran Federation. Rico's ship, the \"Valley Forge\", is destroyed, and his unit is decimated; he is reassigned to the Roughnecks on board the \"Rodger Young,\" led by Lieutenant Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal. The unit carries out several raids, and Rico is promoted to corporal by Jelal after Rasczak dies in combat.\nOne of his comrades in the Roughnecks suggests that Rico go to officer training school and try to become an officer. Rico ends up going to see Jelal, and finds that Jelal already had the paperwork ready. Rico enters Officer Candidate School for a second course of training, including further courses in \"History and Moral Philosophy\". En route from the Roughnecks to the school Rico encounters his father who has also enlisted and is now a corporal, and the two reconcile. He is also visited in school by Carmen, now an ensign and ship's pilot officer in the Navy, and the two discuss their friend Carl, who had been killed earlier in the war.\nRico is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his final test: a posting to a combat unit. Under the tutelage of his company commander, Captain Blackstone, and with the aid of his platoon sergeant, his boot camp drill instructor Fleet Sergeant Zim, Rico commands a platoon during \"Operation Royalty,\" a raid to capture members of the Arachnid brain caste and queens. Rico then returns to the officer school to graduate.\nThe novel ends with him holding the rank of second lieutenant, in command of his old platoon in the \"Rodger Young\", with his father as his platoon sergeant. The platoon has been renamed \"Rico's Roughnecks\", and is about to participate in an attack on Klendathu.\nThemes.\nCommentators have written that \"Starship Troopers\" is not driven by its plot, though it contains scenes of military combat. Instead, much of the novel is given over to a discussion of ideas. In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an \"ideologically intense\" book. A 1997 review in \"Salon\" categorized it as a \"philosophical novel\". Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein's own political views. Some contend that the novel maintains a sense of irony that allows readers to draw their own conclusions; others argue that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose is to expound Heinlein's militaristic philosophy.\nMilitarism.\n\"Starship Troopers\" has been identified as being a part of a tradition in US science fiction that assumes that violent conflict and the militarization of society are inevitable and necessary. Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it is the heart of the army and the most honorable unit in it. In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that \"Starship Troopers\" \"glorifies the military... Specifically the P.B.I., the Poor Bloody Infantry, the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war's desolation\u00a0\u2013 but is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored.\" The story is based on the social Darwinist idea of society as a struggle for survival based on military strength. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence can be an effective method of settling conflict. These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein's view that in the 1950s the US government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.\nHeinlein draws an analogy between the human society in the novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be vigilant against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and US society of the 1950s. Reviewers have suggested that the Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, patriotism, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of US popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to 1950s communist countries, aims to \"reinscribe the ideologies of America's mythic frontier history\". The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of \"Starship Troopers\", of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.\nComing of age.\n\"Starship Troopers\" has been referred to as a bildungsroman or \"coming-of-age\" story for Rico, as he matures through his tenure in the infantry. His training, both at boot camp and at officer candidate school, involves learning the value of militarism, thus inviting the reader to learn it as well. This is especially true of the parts of his training that involve indoctrination, such as the claim by one of his instructors that rule by military veterans is the ideal form of government, because only they understand how to put collective well-being above the individual. The story traces Rico's transformation from a boy into a soldier, while exploring issues of identity and motivation, and traces his overall moral and social development, in a manner identified by commentators as similar to many stories about German soldiers in World War I. Rico's transformation has been likened to the common narrative within stories with military themes by scholar H. Bruce Franklin. This typical narrative is that of a sloppy and unfit civilian being knocked into shape by tough officers, whose training is \"calculated sadism\" but is depicted as fundamentally being on the right side. The letter Rico receives from Dubois, partly responsible for Rico \"crossing the hump\" with his training, is shown as a turning point in his development. The classroom scenes embedded in the story serve to explain Rico's adventures, and highlight his reactions to events around. A notable example is the execution Rico is forced to witness after a deserter from his unit murders a young girl; Rico is uncertain of his own reaction until he remembers a lecture by Dubois in which the latter argues that \"moral sense\" derives entirely from the will to survive. The concept of the American frontier is also related to the coming-of-age theme. Young protagonists across Heinlein's novels attain manhood by confronting a hostile \"wilderness\" in space; coming-of-age in a military, alien context is a common theme in Heinlein's earlier works as well. Rico's coming-of-age has also been described as being related to his relationship with his father; the journey \"outward\" through the novel also contains a search for Rico's childhood and a reunion with his estranged parent.\nMoral decline.\n\"Starship Troopers\" also critiques US society of the 1950s, suggesting that it led young people to be spoiled and undisciplined. These beliefs are expressed through the classroom lectures of Dubois, Rico's teacher for History and Moral Philosophy. Dubois praises flogging and other types of corporal punishment as a means of addressing juvenile crimes. It has been suggested that Heinlein endorsed this view, although the fact that Dubois also compares raising children to training a puppy has been used to argue that Heinlein was making use of irony. The story is strongly in favor of corporal punishment and capital punishment, as a means of correcting juvenile delinquents, part of a trend in science fiction which examines technology and outer space in an innovative manner, but is reactionary with respect to human relationships. As with other books by Heinlein, traditional schools are denigrated, while learning \"on the spot\" is extolled: Rico is able to master the things required of him in military training without undue difficulty.\nDubois also ridicules the idea of inalienable rights, such as \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\", arguing that people have only the rights that they are willing to fight and die for to protect. The novel appeals to scientific authority to justify this position; Dubois repeatedly states that his argument is mathematically demonstrable, statements which have led scholars to label the novel \"hard science fiction\", despite its social and political themes. The \"moral decline\" caused by this situation is depicted as having caused a global war between an alliance of the US, Britain, and Russia against the \"Chinese Hegemony\" in the year 1987. Despite the alliance between the US and Russia, this war has been described as demonstrating Heinlein's anti-communist beliefs, which saw \"swarming hordes\" of Chinese as a bigger threat. The novel draws some comparisons between the Chinese and the Arachnids, and suggests that the lessons of one war could be applied to the other.\nReception.\nTo Heinlein's surprise, \"Starship Troopers\" won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960. It has been acknowledged as one of the best-known and most influential works of science fiction. The novel is considered a landmark for the genre, having been described by a 1960 review as one of the ten best genre books of 1959, in a 2009 review as a key science fiction novel of the 1950s, and as the best-known example of military science fiction. The novel has been described as marking Heinlein's transition from writing juvenile fiction to a \"more mature phase\" as an author. Reviewing the book with others written for children, Floyd C. Gale of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" wrote in 1960 that \"Heinlein has penned a juvenile that \"really\" is not. This is a new and bitter and disillusioned Heinlein\". Rating it 2.5 stars out of five for children, 4.5 stars for adults, and \"?\" for civilians, he believed that the novel would be \"of exceptional interest to veterans with battle experience... but youngsters will find it melancholy and verbose\". Conversely, Michael Moorcock described it as Heinlein's last \"straight\" science fiction, before he turned to more serious writing such as \"Stranger in a Strange Land\".\nBy 1980, twenty years after its release, \"Starship Troopers\" had been translated into eleven languages and was still selling strongly. Heinlein nevertheless complained that, despite this success, almost all the mail he received about it was negative and he only heard about it \"when someone wants to chew me out\". The novel is highly contentious. Controversy surrounded its praise of the military and approval of violence, to the extent that it has frequently been described as fascist, and its implication that militarism is superior to traditional democracy. Heinlein's peers were among those who argued over the book; a comparison between a quote in \"Starship Troopers\" that \"the noblest fate that a man can endure is to place his own mortal body between his loved home and war's desolation\" and the anti-war poem \"Dulce et Decorum Est\" by Wilfred Owen began a two-year discussion in the \"Proceedings of the Institute for Twenty-First Century Studies\" from 1959 to 1961, with James Blish, Poul Anderson, Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer, Anthony Boucher, John Brunner, Brian Aldiss, among those debating \"Starship Troopers\"'s quality of writing, philosophy, and morality.\nThe writing in \"Starship Troopers\" has received varied responses, with the scenes of military training and combat receiving praise. In a 2009 retrospective, science-fiction writer Jo Walton wrote that \"Starship Troopers\" was \"military SF done extremely well\". She went on to argue that \"Heinlein was absolutely at his peak when he wrote this in 1959. He had so much technical stylistic mastery of the craft of writing science fiction that he could [tell the story] 'backwards and in high heels' and get away with it.\" Others referred to it as very readable, and found the military scenes compelling. Heinlein's descriptions of training and boot camp in the novel, based on his own experiences in the military, have been described as being rendered with remarkable skill. A 1960 review in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" praised the \"brilliantly written\" passages describing infantry combat, and also called attention to the discussion of weapons and armor, which, according to other reviewers, demonstrated Heinlein's \"undiminished talent for invention\". Scholar George Slusser described the book in 1986 as the \"ultimately convincing space-war epic\", praising in particular the \"precisely imagined\" weapons and tactics, while a 1979 science fiction encyclopedia referred to it as the \"slickest\" of Heinlein's juvenile books.\nCriticism of the style of the book has centered on its political aspects. Heinlein's discussions of his political beliefs were criticized as \"didactic\", and the novel was derided for \"exposition [that was] inserted in large indigestible chunks\". Author Ken MacLeod's 2003 analysis of the political nature of \"Starship Troopers\" stated that it was \"a book where civics infodumps and accounts of brutal boot-camp training far outweigh the thin and tensionless combat scenes\". Scientist and author Brunner compared it to a \"Victorian children's book\", while the \"Science Fiction Handbook\" published in 2009 said that the novel provided \"compelling images of a futuristic military\" and that it raised important questions, even for those who disagree with its political ideology. However, it stated that the story was weak as a tale of an alien encounter, as it did not explore alien society in any detail, but presented the Arachnids as nameless and faceless creatures that wished to destroy humanity. Boucher, founder of \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\", remarked in 1960 that Heinlein had \"forgotten to insert a story\". A 1979 summary said that though Heinlein's vision might verge on fascism, his tightly controlled narrative made his ideology seem \"vibrantly appealing\".\nCriticism of militarism.\n\"Starship Troopers\" is generally considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a \"bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification\" of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it \"a book-length recruiting poster\". In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called \"Starship Troopers\" a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it \"purports to show the life of a typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us.\" Panshin stated that there was no \"sustained human conflict\" in the book: instead, \"All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble.\" Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, \"Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do.\" Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as \"wrong-headed and retrogressive\", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete \"technological subjugation of nature\", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.\nA 1997 review of the film in \"Salon\" stated that the novel could almost be described as propaganda, and was terrifying as a result, particularly in its belief that the boot camp had to be an ingredient of any civilization. This was described as a highly unusual utopian vision. Moorcock stated that the lessons Rico learns in boot camp: \"wars are inevitable, [and] that the army is always right\". In discussing the book's utility in classroom discussions of the form of government, Alan Myers stated that its depiction of the military was of an \"unashamedly Earth-chauvinist nature\". In the words of science fiction scholar Darko Suvin, \"Starship Troopers\" was an \"unsubtle but powerful black-and-white paean to combat life\", and an example of agitprop in favor of military values.\nOther writers defended Heinlein. George Price argued that \"[Heinlein] implies, first, that war is something endured, not enjoyed, and second, that war is so unpleasant, so desolate, that it must at all costs be kept away from one's home.\" Poul Anderson also defended some of the novel's positions, arguing \"Heinlein has recognized the problem of selective versus nonselective franchise, and his proposed solution does merit discussion.\" Complaints were made against Heinlein for the lack of conscription in \"Starship Troopers\". When he wrote the novel, the military draft was still in effect in the US.\nAllegations of fascism.\nThe society within the book has frequently been described as fascist. According to the 2009 \"Science Fiction Handbook\", it had the effect of giving Heinlein a reputation as a \"fanatical warmongering fascist\". Scholar Jeffrey Cass has referred to the setting of the book as \"unremittingly grim fascism\". He has stated that the novel made an analogy between its military conflict and those of the US after World War II, and that it justified American imperialism in the name of fighting another form of imperialism. Jasper Goss has referred to it as \"crypto-fascist\". Suvin compares Heinlein's suggestion that \"all wars arise from population pressure\" to the Nazi concept of \"Lebensraum\" or \"living space\" for a superior society that was used to justify territorial expansion.\nSome reviewers have suggested that Heinlein was simply discussing the merits of a selective versus a nonselective franchise. Heinlein made a similar claim, over two decades after \"Starship Troopers\"'s publication, in his \"Expanded Universe\" and further claimed that 95 percent of \"veterans\" were not military personnel but members of the civil service. Heinlein's own description has been disputed, even among the book's defenders. Heinlein scholar James Gifford has argued that a number of quotes within the novel suggest that the characters within the book assume that the Federal Service is largely military. For instance, when Rico tells his father that he is interested in Federal Service, his father immediately explains his belief that Federal Service is a bad idea because there is no war in progress, indicating that he sees Federal Service as military in nature. Gifford states that although Heinlein's intentions may have been that Federal Service be 95 percent non-military, in relation to the actual contents of the book, Heinlein \"is wrong on this point. Flatly so.\"\nDennis Showalter, writing in 1975, defended \"Starship Troopers\", stating that the society depicted in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to Bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument is based on a literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, \"Starship Troopers\" being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961) and \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, although he continued to write into the 1980s.\nApparent utopianism.\nThe setting of the book is presented by Heinlein as utopian; its leaders are shown as good and wise, and the population as free and prosperous. Slusser wrote in 1987 that \"Starship Troopers\" depicts a world that is \"hell for human beings\", but nonetheless celebrates the ideology of its fictional society. The rulers are claimed to be the best in history, because they understand that human nature is to fight for power through the use of force. The suggestion of utopia is not explored in depth, as the lives of those outside the military are not shown in any detail. The novel suggests that the militarist philosophy espoused by many of the characters has a mathematical backing, though reviewers have commented that Heinlein does not present any basis for this.\nWriters such as Farmer, Robert A. W. Lowndes, and Michael Moorcock have criticized the novel for being a hypothetical utopia, in the sense that while Heinlein's ideas sound plausible, they have never been put to the test. Moorcock wrote an essay entitled \"Starship Stormtroopers\" in which he attacked Heinlein and other writers over similar \"Utopian fiction\". Lowndes accused Heinlein of using straw man arguments, \"countering ingenuous half-truths with brilliant half-truths\". Lowndes further argued that the Terran Federation could never be as idealistic as Heinlein portrays it to be because he never properly addressed \"whether or not [non-citizens] have at least as full a measure of civil redress against official injustice as we have today\". Farmer agreed, arguing that a \"world ruled by veterans would be as mismanaged, graft-ridden, and insane as one ruled by men who had never gotten near the odor of blood and guts\".\nRace and gender.\nAuthors and commentators have stated that the manner in which the extraterrestrial beings are portrayed in \"Starship Troopers\" has racist aspects, arguing that the nicknames \"Bugs\" and \"Skinnies\" carry racial overtones. John Brunner compared them to calling Koreans \"gooks\". Slusser argued that the term \"Bugs\" was an \"abusive and biologically inaccurate\" word that justified the violence against alien beings, a tendency which, according to Slusser, the book shared with other commercially successful science fiction.\nSome of Heinlein's other works have also been described as racist, though Franklin argues that this was not unique to Heinlein, and that he was less racist than the US government of the time. Heinlein's early novel \"Sixth Column\" was called a \"racist paean\" to a white resistance movement against an Asian horde derived from the Yellow Peril. In 1978, Moorcock wrote that \"Starship Troopers\" \"set the pattern for Heinlein's more ambitious paternalistic, xenophobic\" stories. Robert Lowndes argues that the war between the Terrans and the Arachnids is not about a quest for racial purity, but rather an extension of Heinlein's belief that man is a wild animal. According to this theory, if man lacks a moral compass beyond the will to survive, and he was confronted by another species with a similar lack of morality, then the only possible moral result would be warfare.\nThe fact that all pilots in the novel are women (in contrast to the infantry, which is entirely male) has been cited as evidence of progressive gender politics within the story, although the idea expressed by Rico that women are the motivation for men to fight in the military is a counter-example to this. A 1996 science fiction encyclopedia said that like much of Heinlein's fiction, \"Starship Troopers\" exemplified \"macho male culture\". The prosthetically enhanced soldiers in the novel, all of whom are men, have been described as an example of the \"hyper-masculinity\" brought on by the proximity of these men to technology. The story portrays the Arachnids as so alien that the only response to them can be war. Feminist scholars have described this reaction as a \"conventionally masculinist\" one. Steffen Hantke has described the mechanized suits in the novel, which make the wearer resemble a \"steel gorilla,\" as defining masculinity as \"something intensely physical, based on animal power, instinct, and aggression\". He calls this form of masculinity \"all body, so to speak, and no brain\". Thus, in Hantke's reading, \"Starship Troopers\" expresses fears of how masculinity may be preserved in an environment of high technology. This fear is exacerbated by the motifs of pregnancy and birth that Heinlein uses when describing how the soldiers in suits are dropped from spaceships piloted by women. Though Rico says he finds women \"marvelous\", he shows no desire for sexual activity; the war seems to have subsumed sex in this respect. A 1979 summary argued that despite the gestures towards women's equality, women in the story were still objects, to be protected, and to fight wars over.\nInfluence.\nHeinlein's books, and \"Starship Troopers\" in particular, had an enormous impact on political science fiction, to the extent that author Ken MacLeod has stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein,\" although many participants in this dialogue disagree with Heinlein. Science fiction critic Darko Suvin states that \"Starship Troopers\" is the \"ancestral text of US science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years.\nIn addition to his political views, Heinlein's ideas about a futuristic military as depicted in the novel were deeply influential among films, books, and television shows in later years. Roger Beaumont has suggested that \"Starship Troopers\" may some day be considered a manual for extraterrestrial warfare. Suvin refers to Juan Rico as the \"archetypal Space Soldier\". \"Starship Troopers\" included concepts in military engineering which have since been widely used in other fiction, and which have occasionally been paralleled by scientific research. The novel has been cited as the source of the idea of powered armor exoskeletons, which Heinlein describes in great detail. Such suits became a staple of military science fiction. Franchises that have employed this technology include \"Iron Man\", \"Exo Squad\", \"Halo\", \"District 9\", \"Elysium\", and \"Edge of Tomorrow\". During the shooting of the science fiction film \"Aliens\", director James Cameron required the actors playing space marines to read \"Starship Troopers\" to understand their parts, and also cited it as an influence for the space drop, terms like \"bug hunt\", and the cargo-loader exoskeleton.\n\"Starship Troopers\" had a direct influence on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel \"Armor\" was, according to the author, born out of frustration with the small amount of actual combat in \"Starship Troopers\" and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The \"Mobile Suits\" from the 1979 Nippon Sunrise anime series \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" were inspired by the powered armor from \"Starship Troopers\". The 1988 Gainax OVA series \"Gunbuster\" has plot elements similar to \"Starship Troopers\", depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in \"Ender's Game\", by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in \"Ender's Game\" to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.\nConversely, Joe Haldeman's 1974 anti-war, Hugo- and Nebula-winning science fiction novel \"The Forever War\" is popularly thought to be a direct reply to \"Starship Troopers\", and though Haldeman has stated that it is actually a result of his personal experiences in the Vietnam War, he has admitted to being influenced by \"Starship Troopers\". Haldeman said that he disagreed with \"Starship Troopers\" because it \"glorifies war\", but added that \"it's a very well-crafted novel, and I believe Heinlein was honest with it\". \"The Forever War\" contains several parallels to \"Starship Troopers\", including its setting. Commentators have described it as a reaction to Heinlein's novel, a suggestion Haldeman denies; the two novels are very different in terms of their attitude towards the military. \"The Forever War\" does not depict war as a noble pursuit, with the sides clearly defined as good and evil; instead, the novel explores the dehumanizing effect of war, influenced by the real world context of the Vietnam War. Haldeman received a letter from Heinlein, congratulating him on his Nebula Award, which \"meant more than the award itself\". According to author Spider Robinson, Heinlein approached Haldeman at the awards banquet and said the book \"may be the best future war story I've ever read!\"\nHarry Harrison's 1965 novel \"Bill, the Galactic Hero\" has also been described as a reaction to \"Starship Troopers\", while Gordon R. Dickson's 1961 novel \"Naked to the Stars\" has been called \"an obvious rejoinder\" to \"Starship Troopers\". \"Ring of Swords\", written by Eleanor Arnason in 1993, also depicts a war between two highly aggressive species, of which humans are one. The story deliberately inverts several aspects of \"Starship Troopers\": the story is told from the point of view of diplomats seeking to prevent war, rather than soldiers fighting it, and the conflict is the result of the two species being extremely similar, rather than different.\nAdaptations.\n1997 film.\nThe film rights to the novel were licensed in the 1990s, several years after Heinlein's death. The project was originally entitled \"Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine\", and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to \"Starship Troopers\". The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven (who found the book too boring to finish), and released in 1997. The screenplay, by Ed Neumeier, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military that is completely integrated with respect to sex. It had the stated intention of treating its material in an ironic or sarcastic manner, to undermine the political ideology of the novel. The mechanized suits that featured prominently in the novel were absent from the film, due to budget constraints.\nThe film used fascist imagery throughout, including portraying the Terran Federation's personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of those worn by the SS, the Nazi paramilitary. Verhoeven stated in 1997 that the first scene of the film\u00a0\u2013 an advertisement for the Mobile Infantry\u00a0\u2013 was adapted shot-for-shot from a scene in Leni Riefenstahl's \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935), specifically an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Other references to Nazism include the Albert Speer-style architecture and the propagandistic dialogue (\"Violence is the supreme authority!\"). According to Verhoeven, the references to Nazism reflected his own experience in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II.\nThe film reignited the debate over the nature of the Terran society in Heinlein's world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of creating a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film was intended to be ironic, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the jingoism of US foreign policy, the military industrial complex, and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated and targeted a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film's endeavor to critique the ideology of the novel has been disputed.\nFour sequels, ' (2004), ' (2008), ' (2012) and ' (2017) were released as straight-to-DVD films. In December 2011, Neal H. Moritz, producer of films such as the \"Fast &amp; Furious\" series and \"I Am Legend\", announced plans for a remake of the film that he claims will be more faithful to the source material. In 2016 Mark Swift and Damian Shannon were reported to be writing the film.\nAnimated series.\nAn animated TV series was also released based both on the novel and 1997 film called , it follows the exploits of the Mobile Infantry squad, \"Razak's Roughnecks\", during the SICON\u2013Bugs War between a newly united humanity and an extraterrestrial race, known as the \"Bugs,\" also sometimes referred to as Arachnids. The show focuses mainly on the Roughnecks' missions, rather than addressing the larger war. Paul Verhoeven served as an executive producer. The show ran for one season from August 1999 to April 2000.\nOther media.\nFrom October to December 1988, Sunrise and Bandai Visual produced a six-episode Japanese original video animation locally titled \"Uch\u016b no Senshi\" with mobile infantry power armor designs by Kazutaka Miyatake, based on \"Starship Troopers\". Dark Horse Comics, Mongoose Publishing and Markosia hold the license to produce comic books based on \"Starship Troopers\", written by authors including Warren Ellis, Gordon Rennie and Tony Lee. Avalon Hill published \"Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers\" in 1976, a map-and-counter board wargame featuring a number of scenarios as written in the novel. In 1998, Mythic Entertainment released \"Starship Troopers: Battlespace\". The web-based interactive game, in which players battled each other in overhead space combat, allowed players to assume either Klendathu or Federation roles, was developed alongside the film adaptation. ' was released by Mongoose Publishing in 2005, a miniature wargame which used material from the novel, film, and animated TV series. Spectre Media released \"Starship Troopers: Invasion Mobile Infantry\", a game for PCs, in 2012. Offworld Industries developed and published the 2023 game ', a cooperative multiplayer FPS available for PC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The switchboard is an essential component of a manual telephone exchange, and is operated by switchboard operators who use electrical cords or switches to establish the connections.\nThe switchboard saw the peak of its use in the 20th century before wider adoption of the electromechanical automatic telephone exchange. The automatic exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, has replaced most switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world.\nNevertheless, many manual branch exchanges remained operational into the second half of the 20th century in many enterprises. Some establishments, such as the White House, still operate a switchboard.\nElectronic devices and computer technology have given exchange operators more features. For example, a private branch exchange (PBX) in a business usually has an attendant console, or an auto-attendant function, which bypasses the operator.\nHistory.\nFollowing the invention of the telephone in 1876, the first telephones were rented in pairs which were limited to conversation between the parties operating those two instruments. The use of a central exchange was soon found to be even more advantageous than in telegraphy.\nIn May 1877, the Holmes Burglar Alarm Company in Boston, Massachusetts, established by Edwin T. Holmes, installed the first central office and switchboard that served both as a security service at night for banks and businesses, as well as a telephone system. The switchboard operated telephone instruments manufactured by Charles Williams, a licensee of the Alexander Graham Bell company.\nIn January 1878 the Boston Telephone Dispatch company had started hiring boys as telephone operators. Boys had been very successful as telegraphy operators, but their attitude, lack of patience, and behavior was unacceptable for live telephone contact, so the company began hiring women operators instead. Thus, on September 1, 1878, Boston Telephone Dispatch hired Emma Nutt as the first woman operator. Small towns typically had the switchboard installed in the operator's home so that he or she could answer calls on a 24-hour basis. In 1894, New England Telephone and Telegraph Company installed the first battery-operated switchboard on January 9 in Lexington, Massachusetts.\nEarly switchboards in large cities usually were mounted floor to ceiling in order to allow the operators to reach all the lines in the exchange. The operators were boys who would use a ladder to connect to the higher jacks. Late in the 1890s this measure failed to keep up with the increasing number of lines, and Milo G. Kellogg devised the Divided Multiple Switchboard for operators to work together, with a team on the \"A board\" and another on the \"B\". These operators were almost always women until the early 1970s, when men were once again hired. Cord switchboards were often referred to as \"cordboards\" by telephone company personnel. Conversion to panel switch and other automated switching systems first eliminated the \"B\" operator and then, usually years later, the \"A\". Rural and suburban switchboards for the most part remained small and simple. In many cases, customers knew their operator by name.\nAs telephone exchanges converted to automatic (dial) service, switchboards continued to serve specialized purposes. Before the advent of direct-dialed long-distance calls, a subscriber would need to contact the long-distance operator in order to place a toll call. In large cities, there was often a special number, such as 112, which would ring the long-distance operator directly. Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.\nThe long-distance operator would record the name and city of the person to be called, and the operator would advise the calling party to hang up and wait for the call to be completed. Each toll center had only a limited number of trunks to distant cities, and if those circuits were busy, the operator would try alternate routings through intermediate cities. The operator would plug into a trunk for the destination city, and the inward operator would answer. The inward operator would obtain the number from the local information operator and ring the call. Once the called party answered, the originating operator would advise him or her to stand by for the calling party, whom she'd then ring back, and record the starting time once the conversation began.\nIn the 1940s, with the advent of dial pulse and multi-frequency operator dialing, the operator would plug into a tandem trunk and dial the NPA (area code) and operator code for the information operator in the distant city. For instance, the New York City information operator was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, the operator would dial the call. If the distant city did not have dialable numbers, the operator would dial the code for the inward operator serving the called party, and ask her to ring the number.\nIn the 1960s, once most phone subscribers had direct long-distance dialing, a single type of operator began to serve both the local and long-distance functions. A customer might call to request a collect call, a call billed to a third number, or a person-to-person call. All toll calls from coin phones required operator assistance. The operator was also available to help complete a local or long-distance number which did not complete. For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate \"all circuits busy,\" or a problem in the destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line to see if it was busy or out of order.\nCord switchboards used for these purposes were replaced in the 1970s and 1980s by Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) and similar systems, which greatly reduced operator involvement in calls. The customer would, instead of simply dialing \"0\" for the operator, dial 0+NPA+7digits, after which an operator would answer and provide the desired service (coin collection, obtaining acceptance on a collect call, etc.), and then release the call to be automatically handled by the TSPS.\nBefore the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was common for many smaller cities to have their own operators. An NPA (area code) would usually have its largest city as its primary toll center, with smaller toll centers serving the secondary cities scattered throughout the NPA. TSPS allowed telephone companies to close smaller toll centers and consolidate operator services in regional centers which might be hundreds of miles from the subscriber.\nIn the mid-1980s the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) opened their own Operator Services offices with a system called TOPS (Traffic Operator Position System) to act as local and intraLATA telephone operators. With this the BOCs took intraLATA call traffic from AT&amp;T as well as services which were once provided on a cordboard (Toll Stations, Mobile and Marine [Ship-to-Shore]). Operators from AT&amp;T returned to work for the BOC as the intraLATA traffic was cut to the BOC.\nIn the early 1990s AT&amp;T replaced TSPS with OSPS (Operator Service Position System). The OSPS position was a computer terminal which the AT&amp;T operator entered billing information. With the advent of OSPS a feature called Interflow allowed operators on a system to answer calls from anywhere within their region.\nAs technology changed, so did the application of Interflow. Interflow was implemented nationwide by AT&amp;T. This allowed AT&amp;T to close virtually every operator office throughout the US. As of 2004[ [update]] the only AT&amp;T operator offices remaining were located in Houston, Texas, and Jacksonville, Florida.\nOperation.\nThe switchboard is usually designed to accommodate the operator, who sits facing it. It has a high back panel, which consists of rows of female jacks, each jack designated and wired as a local extension of the switchboard (which serves an individual subscriber) or as an incoming or outgoing trunk line. The jack is also associated with a lamp.\nOn the table or desk area in front of the operator are columns of 3-position toggle switches termed \"keys\", lamps, and cords. Each column consists of a front key and a rear key, a front lamp and a rear lamp, followed by a front cord and a rear cord, making up together a cord circuit. The front key is the \"talk\" key allowing the operator to speak with that particular cord pair. The rear key on older \"manual\" boards and PBXs is used to ring a telephone physically. On newer boards, the back key is used to collect (retrieve) money from coin telephones. Each of the keys has three positions: back, normal and forward. When a key is in the normal position an electrical talk path connects the front and rear cords. A key in the forward position (front key) connects the operator to the cord pair, and a key in the back position sends a ring signal out on the cord (on older manual exchanges). Each cord has a three-wire TRS phone connector: tip and ring for testing, ringing and voice; and a sleeve wire for busy signals.\nWhen a call is received, a jack lamp lights on the back panel and the operator responds by placing the rear cord into the corresponding jack and throwing the front key forward. The operator then converses with the caller, who informs the operator to whom he or she would like to speak. If it is another extension, the operator places the front cord in the associated jack and pulls the front key backwards to ring the called party. After connecting, the operator leaves both cords \"up\" with the keys in the normal position so the parties can converse. The supervision lamps light to alert the operator when the parties finish their conversation and go on-hook. Either party could \"flash\" the operator's supervision lamps by depressing their switch hook for a second and releasing it, in case they needed assistance with a problem. When the operator pulls down a cord, a pulley weight behind the switchboard pulls it down to prevent it from tangling.\nOn a trunk, on-hook and off-hook signals must pass in both directions. In a one-way trunk, the originating or A board sends a short for off-hook, and an open for on-hook, while the terminating or B board sends normal polarity or reverse polarity. This \"reverse battery\" signaling was carried over to later automatic exchanges.\nSome areas used specialized switchboards to handle calls from payphones. In North America, these \"coin boards\" were gradually phased out after the introduction of the Automated Coin Toll System that was provided by the Traffic Service Position System. Dedicated coin boards were primarily used in large, densely populated areas such as New York City where the large local calling area required special billing arrangements to allow the rate for a local call to vary based on the distance called. In less densely populated regions, calls from payphones were handled by normal assistance operators without the use of dedicated coin boards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.\nThe early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" in which the Soviet Union and the United States vied to demonstrate their technological superiority. Landmarks of this era include the launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard \"Vostok 1\") in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (\"Salyut 1\") in 1971. \nIn the 1970s, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation, the foremost example being the International Space Station (ISS), built between 1998 and 2011.\nThe 2000s brought advancements in the national space-exploration programs of China, the European Union, Japan, and India. The 2010s saw the rise of the private space industry in earnest with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules, and satellite manufacturing. In the 2020s, the two primary global programs gaining traction are Moon-focused: the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station and the U.S.-led Artemis Program, with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp, each with a set of international partners.\nHistory of exploration.\nFirst telescopes.\nThe first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey, but their first recorded use in astronomy was by Galileo Galilei in 1609. In 1668 Isaac Newton built his own reflecting telescope, the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous Galilean telescope.\nA string of discoveries in the Solar System (and beyond) followed, then and in the next centuries: the mountains of the Moon, the phases of Venus, the main satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, the rings of Saturn, many comets, the asteroids, the new planets Uranus and Neptune, and many more satellites.\nThe Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968, but the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 set a milestone. As of 1 December 2022, there were 5,284 confirmed exoplanets discovered. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100\u2013400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. HD1 is the most distant known object from Earth, reported as 33.4 billion light-years away.\nFirst outer space flights.\nMW 18014 was a German V-2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 June 1944, at the Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center in Peenem\u00fcnde. It was the first human-made object to reach outer space, attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers, which is well above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reach orbital velocity, and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the first sub-orbital spaceflight. In 1949, the Bumper-WAC reached an altitude of , becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according to NASA.\nFirst object in orbit.\nThe first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed \"Sputnik 1\" (\"Satellite 1\") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about , and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about . It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40\u00a0MHz), which emitted \"beeps\" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid. \"Sputnik 1\" was launched by an R-7 rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958.\nFirst human outer space flight.\nThe first successful human spaceflight was \"Vostok 1\" (\"East 1\"), carrying the 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight.\nFirst astronomical body space explorations.\nThe first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 which reached the Moon in 1959. The first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966. Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966.\nThe first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969, landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the Moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972.\nThe first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus, though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby of Venus to return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the Sun, launched on 16 December 1965. The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4, 1973 for Jupiter by \"Pioneer 10\", 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10, 1979 for Saturn by \"Pioneer 11\", 1986 for Uranus by \"Voyager 2\", 1989 for Neptune by \"Voyager 2\". In 2015, the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by \"Dawn\" and passed by \"New Horizons\", respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the Solar System, the Sun, the Moon, and Ceres and Pluto (two of the five recognized dwarf planets).\nThe first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7, which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes from Venus. In 1975, Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In 1971, the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later, much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft.\nFirst space station.\nSalyut 1 was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational.\nFirst interstellar space flight.\n\"Voyager 1\" became the first human-made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012. The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space.\nFarthest from Earth.\nThe Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of above the lunar surface, and 400,171\u00a0km (248,655\u00a0mi) from Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970.\nAs of 2025[ [update]] \"Voyager 1\" was at a distance of from Earth. It is the most distant human-made object from Earth.\nTargets of exploration.\nStarting in the mid-20th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft, \"Voyager 1\" and \"2\" traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun's solar wind.\nThe Sun.\nThe Sun is a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most space weather, which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount, have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/9th the orbit of Mercury.\nMercury.\nMercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets. As of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and \"MESSENGER\" missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. \"MESSENGER\" entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b). A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025, BepiColombo is to include two probes. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency. \"MESSENGER\" and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's flybys.\nFlights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable.\nVenus.\nVenus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961\u00a0Venera 1, though the 1962\u00a0Mariner 2\u00a0was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967, Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975, with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9, some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.\nEarth.\nSpace exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference.\nFor example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, \"Explorer 1\". These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000\u00a0km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.\nMoon.\nThe Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans.\nIn 1959, the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon, never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966, the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, \"Surveyor 1\" marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters. China's Chang'e 4 in 2019 and Chang'e 6 in 2024 achieved the world's first landing and sample return on the far side of the Moon. India's Chandrayaan-3 in 2023 achieved the world's first landing on the lunar south pole region.\nCrewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit. Artemis II is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in 2025, and Artemis III will perform the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.\nMars.\nThe exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan, and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth.\nThe exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of \"The Great Galactic Ghoul\" which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the \"Mars Curse\". In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of \u20b9 450 Crore (US$). The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission, it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The uncrewed exploratory probe was named \"Hope Probe\" and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail.\nPhobos.\nThe Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt, which launched on 9 November 2011, experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit. It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a \"trans-shipment point\" for spaceships traveling to Mars.\nAsteroids.\nUntil the advent of space travel, objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was \"Galileo\", which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to \"Galileo\"'s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the \"NEAR Shoemaker\" probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object, 433 Eros. The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta, two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's \"Dawn\" spacecraft, launched in 2007.\n\"Hayabusa\" was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, \"Hayabusa\" studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010.\nJupiter.\nThe exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been \"flybys\", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The \"Galileo\" and \"Juno\" spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded.\nReaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2\u00a0km/s, which is comparable to the 9.7\u00a0km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit. Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.\nJupiter has 95 known moons, many of which have relatively little known information about them.\nSaturn.\nSaturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (\"Cassini\u2013Huygens\") planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by \"Pioneer 11\", in 1980 by \"Voyager 1\", in 1982 by \"Voyager 2\" and an orbital mission by the \"Cassini\" spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017.\nSaturn has at least 62 known moons, although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan, which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the \"Huygens\" probe deployed by the \"Cassini\" spacecraft.\nUranus.\nThe exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the \"Voyager 2\" spacecraft. However, there are plans for the Chinese Tianwen 4 mission to visit it or Callisto. Given its axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. \"Voyager 2\" studied the planet's unique atmosphere and magnetosphere. \"Voyager 2\" also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.\nImages of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active.\nNeptune.\nThe exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 \"Voyager 2\" flyby, the sole visit to the system. The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought.\nAlthough the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during \"Voyager 2\"'s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras, and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100\u00a0km/h. \"Voyager 2\" also examined Neptune's ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring \"arcs\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, \"Voyager 2\" also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus, proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from \"Voyager 2\" supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, Triton, is a captured Kuiper belt object.\nPluto.\nThe dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit difficult at present). \"Voyager 1\" could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. \"Voyager 2\" never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.\nAfter an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed \"New Horizons\" was granted funding from the United States government in 2003. \"New Horizons\" was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter.\nKuiper Belt Objects.\nThe \"New Horizons\" mission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimal Arrokoth, in the Kuiper belt, in 2019. This was its first extended mission.\nComets.\nAlthough many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the \"International Cometary Explorer\" conducted the first comet fly-by (21P/Giacobini-Zinner) before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The \"Deep Impact\" probe smashed into 9P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the \"Stardust\" mission returned samples of another comet's tail. The \"Philae\" lander successfully landed on Comet Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader \"Rosetta\" mission.\nDeep space exploration.\nDeep space exploration is the branch of astronomy, astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space. Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft.\nSome of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter, nuclear power and beamed propulsion. Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.\nFuture of space exploration.\nBreakthrough Starshot.\nBreakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named \"StarChip\", to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away. It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner, Stephen Hawking, and Mark Zuckerberg.\nAsteroids.\nAn article in the science magazine \"Nature\" suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, \"a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit\"; second, \"extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars\"; and finally, \"developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin\". Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure.\nArtemis program.\nThe Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA, U.S. commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such as ESA, with the goal of landing \"the first woman and the next man\" on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars.\nIn 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1, using various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion, the Lunar Gateway, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign. NASA requested $1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020, while the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profile which is needed for evaluation and approval by the U.S. Congress. As of 2024, the first Artemis mission was launched in 2022 with the second mission, a crewed lunar flyby planned for 2025. Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the 2025\u20132027 timeframe. The first CLPS lander landed in 2024, marking the first US spacecraft to land since Apollo 17.\nRationales.\nThe research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos, is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program. It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars' worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue. In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering. Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity's knowledge.\nAnother claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead to extinction. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen Hawking, renowned British theoretical physicist, said, \"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\" Author Arthur C. Clarke (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph \"Interplanetary Flight\". He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death.\nThese motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA, Wernher von Braun, and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth. The basis of this plan was to:\nDevelop multi-stage rockets capable of placing satellites, animals, and humans in space.\nDevelopment of large, winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost-effective.\nConstruction of a large, permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions.\nLaunching the first human flights around the Moon, leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon, with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases.\nAssembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet.\nKnown as the Von Braun Paradigm, the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space. Von Braun's vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twenty-first century, with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects. The steps were followed out of order, as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started, which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station. Von Braun's Paradigm formed NASA's drive for human exploration, in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe.\nNASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration.\nOverall, the U.S. public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is \"a good investment\", compared to 21% who did not.\nHuman nature.\nSpace advocacy and space policy regularly invokes exploration as a human nature.\nTopics.\nSpaceflight.\n\"Spaceflight\" is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space.\nSpaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.\nA spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft\u2014both when unpropelled and when under propulsion\u2014is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\nSatellites.\nSatellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites.\nCommercialization of space.\nThe commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies. Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space include satellite navigation systems, satellite television, satellite communications (such as internet services) and satellite radio. The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight. Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia. Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge, something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin supported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle. Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable, stating that the use of \"passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles\". Space tourism is a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space. The purpose of this form of space travel is personal pleasure.\nPrivate spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future.\nAlien life.\nAstrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects of astronomy, biology and geology. It is focused primarily on the study of the origin, distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology (from Greek: \u03ad\u03be\u03c9, \"exo\", \"outside\"). The term \"Xenobiology\" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means \"biology of the foreigners\". Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth. In the Solar System, some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan.\nHuman spaceflight and habitation.\nTo date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for . Valeri Polyakov's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine. Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments. It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew, hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions. However, it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body; for example, space motion sickness (SMS) \u2013 a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation \u2013 plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit. Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement. Space travel can adversely affect the body's natural biological clock (circadian rhythm); sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue; and social interaction; consequently, residing in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion. Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, problems with eyesight, and radiation exposure. The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye, resulting in vision problems; the loss of bone minerals and densities; cardiovascular deconditioning; and decreased endurance and muscle mass.\nRadiation is an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer. When above the Earth's magnetic field, spacecraft are no longer protected from the sun's radiation; the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space. The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft, alerts, and dosimetry.\nFortunately, with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements, those in Mission Control are able to monitor the health of their astronauts more closely using telemedicine. One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight, but those effects can be mitigated. For example, medical systems aboard space vessels such as the International Space Station (ISS) are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness; on-board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing premature osteoporosis. Additionally, a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and a flight surgeon is available 24/7 via the ISS Mission Control Center located in Houston, Texas. Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time, communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed \u2013 sometimes by as much as 20 minutes \u2013 as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit; because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away.\nMany past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a \"steppingstone\" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006, NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024.\nBeyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property, the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty, which had been, as of 2012[ [update]], ratified by all spacefaring nations. Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars, using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization.\nHuman representation and participation.\nParticipation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration. Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been mostly secured through international space law, declaring space the \"province of all mankind\", understanding spaceflight as its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking. Additionally to international inclusion, the inclusion of women and people of colour has also been lacking. To reach a more inclusive spaceflight, some organizations like the \"Justspace Alliance\" and IAU featured \"Inclusive Astronomy\" have been formed in recent years.\nWomen.\nThe first woman to go to space was Valentina Tereshkova. She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again. All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career. This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews. After the rule changed, Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman to go to space, she was also from the Soviet Union. Sally Ride became the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program.\nSince then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in 2018, including Christina Koch and Jessica Meir. They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2026.\nDespite these developments, women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, include:\nArt.\nArtistry in and from space ranges from signals, capturing and arranging material like Yuri Gagarin's selfie in space or the image The Blue Marble, over drawings like the first one in space by cosmonaut and artist Alexei Leonov, music videos like Chris Hadfield's cover of Space Oddity on board the ISS, to permanent installations on celestial bodies like on the Moon.\nSee also.\nRobotic space exploration programs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLiving in space.\nAnimals in space.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHumans in space.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRecent and future developments.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28435", "revid": "25046916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28435", "title": "Shepherd Neame Brewery", "text": "Brewery in Faversham, England\nShepherd Neame is an English independent brewery which has been based in the market town of Faversham, Kent, for over 300 years. While 1698 is the brewery's official established date, town records show that commercial brewing has occurred on the site since 1573. Since the brewery's formation in the 16th century, ownership has passed in unbroken succession through five families. The brewery produces a range of cask ales and filtered beers. Production is around 180,000 brewers' barrels a year (). It has 286 pubs and hotels in South East England, predominantly in Kent and London. The company exports to 44 countries, including India, Sweden, Italy, Brazil, and Canada.\nHistory.\nShepherd Neame has traditionally dated the founding of the brewery to 1698, when, after responding to an advertisement in the \"Kentish Gazette\" for 11 April 1865, Richard Marsh acquired the business and the building. Further research reveals that the brewery had existed on the same site, 18 Court Street, Faversham, since 1570, or 1573, depending on sources.\nRichard Marsh lived until 1727, when his brewery was bequeathed to his widow and then to his daughter, who sold the property to Samuel Shepherd around 1741. Samuel Shepherd was from Deal, Kent. He was interested in malting when he moved to Faversham around 1730 and established himself as a Brewer of Malt by 1734. Shepherd expanded on his interest by acquiring several public houses. However, his son, Julius Shepherd, extended this trend further upon his inheritance of the brewery in 1770 when the company held four such outlets. In 1789, he set about modernising the process of malt grinding and pumping, which had been previously worked with the employment of horses, by introducing what was reputed to be the first steam engine (Boulton and Watt) to be used for this purpose outside London. He was then able to describe his business as the \"Faversham Steam Brewery\".\nHenry, his second son, born in 1780, continued the family tradition and raised his son of the same name into the business. It was this Henry Shepherd (1816\u201377) who was to be the last of the Shepherds actively involved in the company. The death of Henry senior at the age of eighty-two occurred in 1862. Although his son was not a businessman of the same determination, the firm's expansion continued adequately with John Mares, who had come to the financial assistance of the Shepherd Brewery during the recession of the mid-1840s and continued as the impetus behind \"Shepherd and Mares\" until Percy Beale Neame joined the brewery in 1864.\nThe Neame family were relative latecomers in the overall development of the Shepherd Neame Brewery. Still, as substantial property owners in the district, Charles Neame of Harefield Court and John Neame of Selling Court were acknowledged to be among the most valuable hop growers in East Kent. Theo Barker explains in the official account of the brewery that it all began with a Captain Richard Marsh, who in 1678 is recorded in the Faversham \"Wardmote Books\" as contributing by far the largest of the 'Brewers Fines' made at that date.\nMares had seen the potential of the brewery's growth with the arrival of the long-delayed railway service in 1858. He pressed the firm to prepare for such growth actively. Horse-drawn drays were used to carry the brewery's ales throughout Kent, and malts were imported by barge at Faversham Creek at its wharf, which was also used as the means to deliver its product to London until the 1850s when steamboats were beginning to prove more expeditious to the task. The railways soon even outpaced and replaced the steamboats.\nMares's unexpected death at the age of 45 in 1864 placed Percy Neame, at the age of 28, as the stronger partner with Henry Shepherd, and with the challenge left to him in Mares's successful expansion programme he brought the Faversham Brewery well into the Neame family's dominion. Jonathan Neame is the fifth generation of his family to run the business. His late father, Robert, was the company's first-ever President.\nShepherd Neame has embraced 21st-century brewing techniques, for instance, using PDX Reactor Technology for the heat treatment of wort, rather than the traditional method, using a calandria. This has led to a reduction in energy consumption of 50%. Its cask, keg, and bottling lines are all equally high tech, utilising robotics and the latest SAP software to minimise the use of natural resources, while maximising beer quality. Its cardboard packaging is 100% recyclable, and the brewery uses lightweight glass for bottled beer. It also installed a new state-of-the-art Yeast Propagation Plant, which will reduce energy consumption. The brewery has repeatedly pioneered sustainable brewing methods. It recycles 97% of the grain and hops used in the brewing process as animal feed on local farms and holds a Feed Materials Assurance Scheme certificate. Waste is separated into recyclable elements, and the waste oil from its managed pubs and the brewery's kitchens is collected and converted into biofuel. Its Water Recovery Plant, installed in 2014, allows the wastewater from brewing and cleaning to be recycled rather than sent to the drain.Along with the Three Tuns Brewery in Shropshire, Shepherd Neame claims to be the oldest brewery in Great Britain. Three Tuns was licensed in 1642, 56 years earlier than Shepherd Neame. However, there is evidence that brewing has taken place on the Shepherd Neame site since at least 1573, over a century before the establishment of the current brewery.\nBrewing and product range.\nThe brewery uses chalk-filtered mineral water from the brewery's artesian well, deep below the brewery, and 93% of the hops used in its beers are grown in Kent. In 2016, the 100 year-old solid teak mash tuns were renovated.\nAs well as its own branded beer, it also brews Thai Singha lager under licence and collaborates to produce https:// and https://.\nShepherd Neame beers are available in UK supermarkets.\nPubs.\nThe brewery has 286 pubs and hotels throughout London and South East England. The brewery's brands are typically given prominence in frontage with extensive branding. All fonts and pumps bear distinctive logos and branding, glasses are branded, and bar runners advertising house beers are commonplace.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, the use of the term \"saint\" depends on the context and denomination. Official ecclesiastical recognition, and veneration, is conferred on some denominational saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church after their approval. The saints are honored in the liturgical calendars of Evangelical Lutheranism and Anglicanism. In other nonconformist denominations, such as the Plymouth Brethren, and following from Pauline usage, \"saint\" refers broadly to any holy Christian without special recognition or selection.\nWhile the English word \"saint\" (deriving from the Latin ) originated in Christianity, historians of religion tend to use the appellation \"in a more general way to refer to the state of special holiness that many religions attribute to certain people\", referring to the Hindu rishi, Sikh bhagat or guru, the Shintoist kami, the Taoist immortal or zhenren, the Jewish tzadik, the Islamic wal\u012b/fakir, and the Buddhist arhat or bodhisattva also as saints. Depending on the religion, saints are recognized either by official declaration, as in Roman Catholicism, Oriental Orthodoxy or Eastern Orthodoxy, or by popular acclamation (see folk saint).\nEtymology.\nThe word \"hallow\" is synonymous with \"saint\", the former derived from the Old English \"h\u0101lig\", the same root as \u201choly,\u201d and refers to holy individuals. It is preserved in certain names and traditions celebrating saints, such as \"Allhallowtide\", a period that includes \"All Hallows\u2019 Eve\" (Halloween) and \"All Hallows\u2019 Day\" (November 1). The word \"saint\" itself derives from the Latin \"sanctus\", meaning \u201choly\u201d or \u201cconsecrated,\u201d and entered English through Old French \"seint\" and Middle English \"saint\", retaining its meaning as a holy person and historically used to refer to individuals regarded as holy.\nGeneral characteristics.\nThe English word \"saint\" comes from the Latin , with the Greek equivalent being (\"hagios\") 'holy'. The word appears 229 times in the Greek New Testament, and its English translation 60 times in the corresponding text of the King James Version of the Bible.\nThe word \"\" was originally a technical one in ancient Roman religion, but due to its globalized use in Christianity the modern word \"saint\" is now also used as a translation of comparable terms for persons \"worthy of veneration for their holiness or sanctity\" in other religions.\nMany religions also use similar concepts (but different terminology) to venerate persons worthy of some honor. Author John A. Coleman of the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California, wrote that saints across various cultures and religions have the following family resemblances:\nThe anthropologist Lawrence Babb, in an article about Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba, asks the question \"Who is a saint?\" and responds by saying that in the symbolic infrastructure of some religions, there is the image of a certain extraordinary spiritual person's \"miraculous powers\", to whom frequently a certain moral presence is attributed. These saintly figures, he asserts, are \"the focal points of spiritual force-fields\". They exert \"powerful attractive influence on followers but touch the inner lives of others in transforming ways as well\".\nChristianity.\nOld Testament.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, English \"saints\" most often renders terms of holiness, especially the adjective \"q\u0101d\u00f4\u0161\" (\"set apart, consecrated, holy\"), and in the plural it appears as \"holy ones\" or \"saints,\" with emphasis on consecration and ideally the absence of moral and ceremonial defilement. The Old Testament does not present a fixed category of individual \"saints,\" though related ideas appear in prophet and martyr traditions in later narratives.\nApostolic Age.\nIn the Apostolic Age, New Testament writers use \"saints\" predominantly in the plural as a collective designation for Christians in a given locality; the only clear singular instance is distributive in Philippians 4:21 (\"every saint\"), so the term marks the church as a people set apart for God rather than an elite subgroup.\nPaul makes this corporate sense explicit by identifying \"the saints\" with \"you\" in 1 Corinthians 6:2, so that \"oi hagioi\" functions as a self-designation for all Christians; he also addresses communities as \"saints\" in letter openings/closings and often speaks of \"all the saints\" to emphasize corporate unity across locations (Romans 1:7; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 1:1; Phil 1:1; Colossians 1:2).\nIn practical matters he urges \"service\" and aid \"for the saints,\" including the Jerusalem poor, sometimes with abbreviated phrasing that presumes this shared self-designation (e.g., 1 Cor 16:1; 2 Cor 8:4; 9:1, 12 \u2248 Rom 15:26). Scholars also observe covenantal\u2013eschatological and temple/priestly overtones in such language (e.g., judging the world/angels; participation in Christ\u2019s altar). Other New Testament writers vary: calling believers \"hagioi\" is common in Hebrews and Jude, it is frequent in Revelation with an emphasis on prayer/endurance and is used for the same group as \"believers/Christians,\" while 1 Peter does not use \"hagioi\" as Paul does (even as it speaks extensively of holiness).\nStandard reference works concur that \"hagioi\" designates all believers (not a special class), that the plural, collective usage predominates, and that the underlying idea is consecration/belonging to God. Later Christian traditions (e.g. Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, Protestantism) developed distinct practices of recognizing exemplary figures, but this stands apart from the New Testament\u2019s collective usage.\nCatholic Church.\nAccording to the Catholic Church, a saint may be anyone in Heaven (besides God), whether recognized on Earth or not, who forms the \"great cloud of witnesses\" (Hebrews 12:1). These \"may include our own mothers, grandmothers or other loved ones (cf. )\" who may have not always lived perfect lives, but \"amid their faults and failings they kept moving forward and proved pleasing to the Lord\". The title \"Saint\" denotes a person who has been formally canonized \u2013 that is, officially and authoritatively declared a saint \u2013 by the church as holder of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and is therefore believed to be in Heaven by the grace of God. There are many persons who the church believes to be in Heaven who have not been formally canonized and who are otherwise titled saints because of the fame of their holiness. Sometimes the word saint also denotes living Christians. The Second Vatican Council noted that some saints are commemorated by the whole church because they \"are truly of universal importance\", while many others have significance for \"a particular Church or nation or family of religious\" and their lives should be celebrated within those particular contexts.\nAccording to the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", \"The patriarchs, prophets, and certain other Old Testament figures have been and always will be honored as saints in all the church's liturgical traditions.\"\nIn his book \"Saint of the Day\", editor Leonard Foley says that the \"[Saints'] surrender to God's love was so generous an approach to the total surrender of Jesus that the Church recognizes them as heroes and heroines worthy to be held up for our inspiration. They remind us that the Church is holy, can never stop being holy and is called to show the holiness of God by living the life of Christ.\"\nThe Catholic Church teaches that it does not make or create saints, but rather recognizes them. Proofs of heroic virtue required in the process of beatification will serve to illustrate in detail the general principles exposed above upon proof of their holiness or likeness to God.\nOn 3 January 993, Pope John XV became the first pope to proclaim a person a saint from outside the diocese of Rome: on the petition of the German ruler, he had canonized Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg. Before that time, the popular \"cults\", or venerations, of saints had been local and spontaneous and were confirmed by the local bishop. Pope John XVIII subsequently permitted a cult of five Polish martyrs. Pope Benedict VIII later declared the Armenian hermit Simeon of Mantua to be a saint, but it was not until the pontificate of Pope Innocent III that the popes reserved to themselves the exclusive authority to canonize saints, so that local bishops needed the confirmation of the Pope. Walter of Pontoise was the last person in Western Europe to be canonized by an authority other than the Pope: Hugh de Boves, the Archbishop of Rouen, canonized him in 1153. Thenceforth a decree of Pope Alexander III in 1170 reserved the prerogative of canonization to the Pope, insofar as the Latin Church was concerned.\nAlban Butler published \"Lives of the Saints\" in 1756, including a total of 1,486 saints. The latest revision of this book, edited by Herbert Thurston and Donald Attwater, contains the lives of 2,565 saints. Robert Sarno, an official of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints of the Holy See, expressed that it is impossible to give an exact number of saints.\nThe veneration of saints, in Latin , or the \"cult of the Saints\", describes a particular popular devotion or entrustment of one's self to a particular saint or group of saints. Although the term \"worship\" is sometimes used, it is only used with the older English connotation of honoring or respecting (\"dulia\") a person. According to the church, divine worship is in the strict sense reserved only to God (\"latria\") and never to the saints. One is permitted to ask the saints to intercede or pray to God for persons still on Earth, just as one can ask someone on Earth to pray for him.\nA saint may be designated as a patron saint of a particular cause, profession, church or locale, or invoked as a protector against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official declarations of the church. Saints are not believed to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. Relics of saints are respected, or venerated, similar to the veneration of holy images and icons. The practice in past centuries of venerating relics of saints with the intention of obtaining healing from God through their intercession is taken from the early Church. For example, an American deacon claimed in 2000 that John Henry Newman (then a blessed) interceded with God to cure him of a physical illness. The deacon, Jack Sullivan, asserted that after addressing Newman he was cured of spinal stenosis in a matter of hours. In 2009, a panel of theologians concluded that Sullivan's recovery was the result of his prayer to Newman. According to the church, to be deemed a miracle, \"a medical recovery must be instantaneous, not attributable to treatment, disappear for good.\"\nSome of the saints have a special iconographic symbol by tradition, e.g., Saint Lawrence, deacon and martyr, is identified by a gridiron because he is believed to have been burned to death on one. This symbol is found, for instance, in the Canadian heraldry of the office responsible for the St. Lawrence Seaway.\nStages of canonization.\nFormal canonization is a lengthy process, often of many years or even centuries. There are four major steps to become a saint. The first stage in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life by an expert. After this, the official report on the candidate is submitted to the bishop of the pertinent diocese and more study is undertaken. The information is then sent to the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints of the Holy See for evaluation at the universal level of the church. If the application is approved the candidate may be granted the title \"Venerable\" (stage 2). Further investigation, step 3, may lead to the candidate's beatification with the title \"Blessed\", which is elevation to the class of the \"Beati\". Next, and at a minimum, proof of two important miracles obtained from God through the intercession of the candidate are required for formal canonization as a saint. Finally, in the last stage, after all of these procedures are complete, the pope may canonize the candidate as a saint for veneration by the universal church.\nOnce a person has been canonized, the deceased body of the saint is considered holy as a relic. The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics. \nEastern Orthodoxy.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, a saint is defined as anyone who is in Heaven besides God, whether recognised here on earth, or not. By this definition, Adam and Eve, Moses, the various prophets, and archangels are all given the title of \"Saint\". Sainthood does not necessarily reflect a moral model, but communion with God; there are many examples of people who lived in great sin and became saints by humility and repentance: Saints Mary of Egypt, Moses the Ethiopian, and Dismas, the repentant thief who was crucified with Jesus Christ. Therefore, a more complete Orthodox definition of what a saint is, has to do with the way that saints, through their humility and their love of mankind, saved inside them the entire Church, and loved all people.\nCanonization.\nThe Orthodox belief is that God reveals saints through answered prayers and other miracles. Saints are usually recognised by their local community, often by people who directly knew them. As their popularity grows they are often then recognised by the entire Church through the Holy Spirit. The word \"canonization\" means that a Christian has been found worthy to have his name placed in the canon (official list) of saints of the Church. The formal process of recognition involves deliberation by a synod of bishops. The Orthodox Church does not require the manifestation of miracles, as it does in Roman Catholicism; what is required is evidence of a virtuous life and prior local veneration of the saint.\nIf the ecclesiastical review is successful, this is followed by a service of glorification in which the saint is given a day on the liturgical calendar to be celebrated by the entire Church. This does not, however, make the person a saint; the person already was a saint and the Church ultimately recognized it.\nAs a general rule, only clergy will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession; however, in veneration the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint. The altar in an Orthodox Church usually contains relics of saints, often of martyrs. Church interiors are covered with the icons of saints. When an Orthodox Christian venerates icons of a saint he is venerating the image of God which he sees in the saint.\nBecause the Church shows no true distinction between the living and the dead, as the saints are considered to be alive in heaven, saints are referred to as if they are still alive, and are venerated, not worshipped. They are believed to be able to intercede for the living for salvation or other requests and help mankind either through direct communion with God or by personal miraculous intervention.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the title \u1f4d\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \"Hosios\" (f. \"Hosia\") is also used. This is a title attributed to saints who had lived a monastic or eremitic life equivalent to the more usual title of \"Saint\".\nOriental Orthodoxy.\nThe Oriental Orthodox churches \u2012 the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Tewahedo Church, Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church \u2012 follow a canonization process unique to each church. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, for example, has the requirement that at least 50 years must pass following a prospective saint's death before the Coptic Orthodox Church's pope can canonize the saint.\nEvangelical Lutheranism.\nIn the Lutheran Church, all Christians, whether in Heaven or on Earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors specific saints, including some of those recognized by the Catholic Church, but in a qualified way: according to the Augsburg Confession, the term \"saint\" is used in the manner of the Catholic Church only insofar as to denote a person who received exceptional grace, was sustained by faith, and whose good works are to be an example to any Christian. Evangelical-Lutherans believe that saints pray for the Christian Church in general. However, Evangelical-Lutheran belief accounts that prayers to the saints are prohibited, as they are not mediators of redemption. Philip Melanchthon, the author of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, approved honoring the saints by saying they are honored in three ways:\n1. By thanking God for examples of His mercy;\n2. By using the saints as examples for strengthening our faith; and\n3. By imitating their faith and other virtues.\nThe Lutheran Churches have liturgical calendars in which they honor individuals as saints.\nThe invocation of saints was criticized in the \"\". This criticism was rebutted by the Catholic side in the \"Confutatio Augustana\", which in turn was rebutted by the Evangelical Lutheran side in the \"Apology of the Augsburg Confession\".\nAnglicanism.\nIn the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a pious and holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be imitated, and as a \"cloud of witnesses\" that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey. The saints are seen as elder brothers and sisters in Christ. Official Anglican creeds recognize the existence of the saints in heaven.\nIn high-church contexts, such as Anglo-Catholicism, a saint is generally one to whom has been attributed (and who has generally demonstrated) a high level of holiness and sanctity. In this use, a saint is therefore not a believer only, but one who has been transformed by virtue. In Catholicism, a saint is a special sign of God's activity. The veneration of saints is sometimes misunderstood to be worship, in which case it is derisively termed \"hagiolatry\".\nSo far as invocation of the saints is concerned, one of the Church of England's Articles of Religion \"Of Purgatory\" condemns \"the Romish Doctrine concerning ...(the) Invocation of Saints\" as \"a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God\". Anglo-Catholics in Anglican provinces using the Articles often make a distinction between a \"Romish\" and a \"Patristic\" doctrine concerning the invocation of saints, permitting the latter in accordance with Article XXII. Indeed, the theologian E. J. Bicknell stated that the Anglican view acknowledges that the term \"invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis', or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.\"\nSome Anglicans and Anglican churches, particularly Anglo-Catholics, personally ask prayers of the saints. However, such a practice is seldom found in any official Anglican liturgy. Unusual examples of it are found in The Korean Liturgy 1938, the liturgy of the Diocese of Guiana 1959 and The Melanesian English Prayer Book.\nAnglicans believe that the only effective Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in terms of redemption and salvation, is God the Son, Jesus Christ. Historical Anglicanism has drawn a distinction between the intercession of the saints and the invocation of the saints. The former was generally accepted in Anglican doctrine, while the latter was generally rejected. There are some, however, in Anglicanism, who do beseech the saints' intercession. Those who beseech the saints to intercede on their behalf make a distinction between \"mediator\" and \"intercessor\", and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living Christians. Anglo-Catholics understand sainthood in a more Catholic or Orthodox way, often praying for intercessions from the saints and celebrating their feast days.\nAccording to the Church of England, a saint is one who is sanctified, as it translates in the Authorized King James Version (1611) 2 Chronicles 6:41: \nNow therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.\nMethodism.\nWhile Methodists as a whole do not venerate saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are saints, but mainly use the term to refer to biblical figures, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints\u2014such as the Twelve Apostles, John Wesley, etc.\u2014although most are named after geographical locations associated with an early circuit or prominent location. Methodist congregations observe All Saints' Day. Many encourage the study of saints, that is, the biographies of holy people.\nThe 14th Article of Religion in the United Methodist \"Book of Discipline\" states:\nThe Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.\nOther Protestantism.\nIn many Protestant churches, the word \"saint\" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar in usage to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this sense, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (i.e., a professing Christian) is a saint because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider intercessory prayers to the saints to be idolatry, since what they perceive to be an application of divine worship that should be given only to God himself is being given to other believers, dead or alive.\nWithin some Protestant traditions, \"saint\" is also used to refer to any born-again Christian. Many emphasize the traditional New Testament meaning of the word, preferring to write \"saint\" to refer to any believer, in continuity with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.\nBaptist.\n\"Saints\" in Baptist theology refers to the body of 'born-again believers'. The reference 'saints' is a derivative of the word 'sanctified', which means 'set apart for a holy purpose'. In the Apostle Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, he addresses the recipients as saints: \"To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours\". (1 Corinthians 1:2, ESV)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThe use of \"saint\" within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \"LDS Church\" In the New Testament, saints are all those who have entered into the Christian covenant of baptism. The qualification \"latter-day\" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the latter days before the Second Coming of Christ, and is used to distinguish the members of the church, which considers itself the restoration of the ancient Christian church. Members are therefore often referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\" or \"LDS\", and among themselves as \"saints\".\nOther religions.\nIn some theological literature, the use of the term \"saint\" tends to be used in non-Christian contexts as well. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized within their tradition as having fulfilled the highest aspirations of religious teaching. In English, the term \"saint\" is often used to translate this idea from many world religions. The Jewish \"\u1e25as\u012bd\" or \"tsaddiq\", the Islamic \"qidees\", the Zoroastrian \"Fravashi\", the Hindu \"Shadhus\", the Buddhist \"Arahant\" or \"Bodhisattva,\" the Daoist \"Shengren,\" the Shinto \"Kami,\" and others have all been referred to as saints.\nAfrican diaspora.\nCuban Santer\u00eda, Haitian Vodou, Trinidad Orisha-Shango, Brazilian Umbanda, Candombl\u00e9, and other similar syncretist religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshipped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the deities. The name \"santer\u00eda\" was originally a pejorative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhists in both the Theravada and Mahayana traditions hold the \"Arhats\" in special esteem, as well as highly developed Bodhisattvas.\nTibetan Buddhists hold the \"tulkus\" (reincarnates of deceased eminent practitioners) as living saints on earth.\nDruze faith.\nDue to the Christian influence on Druze faith, two Christian saints become the Druze's favorite venerated figures: Saint George and Saint Elijah. Thus, in all the villages inhabited by Druzes and Christians in central Mount Lebanon a Christian church or Druze maqam is dedicated to either one of them. According to scholar Ray Jabre Mouawad the Druzes appreciated the two saints for their bravery: Saint George because he confronted the dragon and Saint Elijah because he competed with the pagan priests of Baal and won over them. In both cases the explanations provided by Christians is that Druzes were attracted to warrior saints that resemble their own militarized society.\nHinduism.\nHindu saints are those recognized by Hindus as showing a great degree of holiness and sanctity. Hinduism has a long tradition of stories and poetry about saints. There is no formal canonization process in Hinduism, but over time, many men and women have reached the status of saints among their followers and among Hindus in general. Unlike in Christianity, Hinduism does not canonize people as saints after death, but they can be accepted as saints during their lifetime. Hindu saints have often renounced the world, and are variously called gurus, sadhus, rishis, devarishis, rajarshis, saptarishis, brahmarshis, swamis, pundits, purohits, pujaris, acharyas, pravaras, yogis, yoginis, and other names.\nSome Hindu saints are given god-like status, being seen as incarnations of Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, and other aspects of the Divine\u2014this can happen during their lifetimes, or sometimes many years after their deaths. This explains another common name for Hindu saints: godmen, is invention of western Abrahamic media to a Pagan Ideas.\nIslam.\nBesides prophets, according to Islam, saints possess blessings (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u0643\u0629, \"baraka\") and can perform miracles (Arabic: \u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a, \"Kar\u0101m\u0101t\"). Saints rank lower than prophets. However, they can intercede for people on the Day of Judgment, but their intercession is limited compared to the intercession of the Prophet Muhammad. Both the tombs of prophets and saints are visited frequently \"(Ziyarat)\" as well as visiting modern-day living saints. People seek the advice of a saint in their quest for spiritual fulfilment. Unlike saints in Christianity, Muslim saints are said to be given their rank by God and some with public duties are officially acknowledged by their Sheikh with an \"ijaz\"a, a verbal and written permission to be a spiritual guide. Unlike prophets, women like Rabia of Basra were accepted as saints.\nSaints are recognized as having specific traits they can be identified through. These include: floating lights appearing above their tomb, the body not decaying, a pleasant and miraculous odor coming from the body, appearing in the dreams of others who they pray on behalf of, appearing in two places at once, and having normally impossible knowledge.\nIslam has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called \"wali\", which literally means 'Friend [of God]'), which has declined in some parts of the Islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of Salafism. In Sunni Islam, the veneration of saints became a very common form of devotion early on, and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of \"special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\" The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both \"loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him.\" \"Belief in the miracles of saints (\"kar\u0101m\u0101t al-awliy\u0101\u02be\") ... [became a] requirement in Sunni Islam [during the classical period],\" with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of grave visitation like Ibn Taymiyyah emphatically declaring: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The Quran has pointed to it in different places, \"\"A messenger who has instructed them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them.\" (Qur'an 2:129)\" and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators.\" The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the Sufis, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law.\nVeneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the Salafi movement, whose various streams regard it as \"being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.\" In a manner similar to the Protestant Reformation, the specific traditional practices which Salafism has tried to curtail in both Sunni and Shia contexts include those of the veneration of saints, visiting their graves, seeking their intercession, and honoring their relics. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: \"[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints ... [Due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.\"\nDespite attempts by the Salafis to minimise the importance of saints in Islam, there are many living saints with huge popularity, often with millions of followers, mainly found in the Sufi orders or \"tariqat\". They follow the teachings of the Muhammad and are usually direct descendants of him. They are also scholars of the religion. Well-known modern-day saints include Sheikh Nazim al Haqqani, Sheikh Hisham Kabbani, Sheikh Mehmet al Rabbani of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order, Habib Umar bin Hafidz of the Ba'Alawi Tariqat, Sheikh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi of the Shadhili Tariqa.\nFamous Islamic saints in history include Rumi, Ibn Arabi and Al Ghazzali.\nJudaism.\nThe term \"Tzadik\", 'righteous', and its associated meanings developed in rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with \"\u1e24as\u012bd\", 'pious'.\nIn Morocco, the similarities of Moroccan Jewish and Muslim practices, including saint veneration, were used by colonial powers to claim Morocco was unified and consisted of a distinct nation, but were not sufficiently united to resist imperialism.\nSikhism.\nThe concept of \"sant\" or \"bhagat\" is found in North Indian religious thought including Sikhism, most notably in Sri Guru Granth Sahib Jee . Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, and others are known as \"Sants\" or \"Bhagats\". The term \"Sant\" is applied in the Sikh and related communities to beings that have attained enlightenment through God realization and spiritual union with God via repeatedly reciting the name of God (Naam Japna). Countless names of God exist. In Sikhism, \"Naam\" (spiritual internalization of God's name) is commonly attained through the name of Waheguru, which translates to \"Wondrous Guru\".\nSikhs are encouraged to follow the congregation of a Sant (Sadh Sangat) or \"The Company of the Holy\". \"Sants\" grace the Sadh Sangat with knowledge of the Divine God, and how to take greater steps towards obtaining spiritual enlightenment through \"Naam\". \"Sants\" are to be distinguished from \"Guru\" (such as Guru Nanak) who have compiled the path to God enlightenment in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhism states however, that any beings that have become one with God are considered synonymous with God. As such, the fully realized Sant, Guru, and God are considered one.\nNew religious movements.\nThelema is a new religious movement with a list of saints including individuals such as Roger Bacon.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It results in an oscillation that is described by a sinusoid which continues indefinitely (if uninhibited by friction or any other dissipation of energy).\nSimple harmonic motion can serve as a mathematical model for a variety of motions, but is typified by the oscillation of a mass on a spring when it is subject to the linear elastic restoring force given by Hooke's law. The motion is sinusoidal in time and demonstrates a single resonant frequency. Other phenomena can be modeled by simple harmonic motion, including the motion of a simple pendulum, although for it to be an accurate model, the net force on the object at the end of the pendulum must be proportional to the displacement (and even so, it is only a good approximation when the angle of the swing is small; see small-angle approximation). Simple harmonic motion can also be used to model molecular vibration. A mass-spring system is a classic example of simple harmonic motion.\nSimple harmonic motion provides a basis for the characterization of more complicated periodic motion through the techniques of Fourier analysis.\nIntroduction.\nThe motion of a particle moving along a straight line with an acceleration whose direction is always toward a fixed point on the line and whose magnitude is proportional to the displacement from the fixed point is called simple harmonic motion.\nIn the diagram, a simple harmonic oscillator, consisting of a weight attached to one end of a spring, is shown. The other end of the spring is connected to a rigid support such as a wall. If the system is left at rest at the equilibrium position then there is no net force acting on the mass. However, if the mass is displaced from the equilibrium position, the spring exerts a restoring elastic force that obeys Hooke's law.\nMathematically,\nformula_1\nwhere F is the restoring elastic force exerted by the spring (in SI units: N), \"k\" is the spring constant (N\u00b7m\u22121), and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position (in metres).\nFor any simple mechanical harmonic oscillator:\nOnce the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position, it experiences a net restoring force. As a result, it accelerates and starts going back to the equilibrium position. When the mass moves closer to the equilibrium position, the restoring force decreases. At the equilibrium position, the net restoring force vanishes. However, at \"x\" \n 0, the mass has momentum because of the acceleration that the restoring force has imparted. Therefore, the mass continues past the equilibrium position, compressing the spring. A net restoring force then slows it down until its velocity reaches zero, whereupon it is accelerated back to the equilibrium position again.\nAs long as the system has no energy loss, the mass continues to oscillate. Thus simple harmonic motion is a type of periodic motion. If energy is lost in the system, then the mass exhibits damped oscillation.\nNote if the real space and phase space plot are not co-linear, the phase space motion becomes elliptical. The area enclosed depends on the amplitude and the maximum momentum.\nDynamics.\nIn Newtonian mechanics, for one-dimensional simple harmonic motion, the equation of motion, which is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, can be obtained by means of Newton's second law and Hooke's law for a mass on a spring.\nformula_2\nwhere m is the inertial mass of the oscillating body, x is its displacement from the equilibrium (or mean) position, and \"k\" is a constant (the spring constant for a mass on a spring).\nTherefore,\nformula_3\nSolving the differential equation above produces a solution that is a sinusoidal function:\nformula_4 where formula_5\nThe meaning of the constants formula_6 and formula_7 can be easily found: setting formula_8 on the equation above we see that formula_9, so that formula_6 is the initial position of the particle, formula_11; taking the derivative of that equation and evaluating at zero we get that formula_12, so that formula_7 is the initial speed of the particle divided by the angular frequency, formula_14. Thus we can write:\nformula_15\nThis equation can also be written in the form:\nformula_16\nwhere\nand, since \"T\" = where \"T\" is the time period,\nformula_18\nThese equations demonstrate that the simple harmonic motion is isochronous (the period and frequency are independent of the amplitude and the initial phase of the motion).\nEnergy.\nSubstituting \"\u03c9\"2 with \"\", the kinetic energy \"K\" of the system at time \"t\" is\nformula_19\nand the potential energy is\nformula_20\nIn the absence of friction and other energy loss, the total mechanical energy has a constant value\nformula_21\nExamples.\nThe following physical systems are some examples of simple harmonic oscillator.\nMass on a spring.\nA mass \"m\" attached to a spring of spring constant \"k\" exhibits simple harmonic motion in closed space. The equation for describing the period:\nformula_22\nshows the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude, though in practice the amplitude should be small. The above equation is also valid in the case when an additional constant force is being applied on the mass, i.e. the additional constant force cannot change the period of oscillation.\nUniform circular motion.\nSimple harmonic motion can be considered the one-dimensional projection of uniform circular motion. If an object moves with angular speed \"\u03c9\" around a circle of radius \"r\" centered at the origin of the \"xy\"-plane, then its motion along each coordinate is simple harmonic motion with amplitude \"r\" and angular frequency \"\u03c9\".\nOscillatory motion.\nThe motion of a body in which it moves to and from a definite point is also called oscillatory motion or vibratory motion. The time period is able to be calculated by\nformula_23\nwhere l is the distance from rotation to the object's center of mass undergoing SHM and g is acceleration due to gravity. This is analogous to the mass-spring system.\nMass of a simple pendulum.\nIn the small-angle approximation, the motion of a simple pendulum is approximated by simple harmonic motion. The period of a mass attached to a pendulum of length \"l\" with gravitational acceleration formula_24 is given by\nformula_25\nThis shows that the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude and mass of the pendulum but not of the acceleration due to gravity, formula_24, therefore a pendulum of the same length on the Moon would swing more slowly due to the Moon's lower gravitational field strength. Because the value of formula_24 varies slightly over the surface of the earth, the time period will vary slightly from place to place and will also vary with height above sea level.\nThis approximation is accurate only for small angles because of the expression for angular acceleration \"\u03b1\" being proportional to the sine of the displacement angle:\nformula_28\nwhere \"I\" is the moment of inertia. When \"\u03b8\" is small, sin\u2009\"\u03b8\" \u2248 \"\u03b8\" and therefore the expression becomes\nformula_29\nwhich makes angular acceleration directly proportional and opposite to \"\u03b8\", satisfying the definition of simple harmonic motion (that net force is directly proportional to the displacement from the mean position and is directed towards the mean position).\nScotch yoke.\nA Scotch yoke mechanism can be used to convert between rotational motion and linear reciprocating motion. The linear motion can take various forms depending on the shape of the slot, but the basic yoke with a constant rotation speed produces a linear motion that is simple harmonic in form.\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some groups, or Traditions, perform most or all of their rituals skyclad. Whilst nudity and the practice of witchcraft have long been associated in the visual arts, this contemporary ritual nudity is typically attributed to either the influence of Gerald Gardner or to a passage from Charles Godfrey Leland's 1899 book \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", and as such is mainly attributed to the Gardnerian and Aradian covens.\nOrigins.\nGardner.\nGardner's \"Witchcraft Today\" was published in 1954. The book claimed to report on the contemporary practice of Pagan religious witchcraft in England, which had supposedly survived as an underground religion for centuries. Ritual nudity was included as a regular part of Wiccan practice, but in the modern day it is mainly used by Alexandrian, Georgian, and Blue Star Wiccans. The \"Charge of the Goddess\", a part of Gardnerian ritual liturgy, does instruct Wiccans to practice ritual in the nude. Gardner spent several years in India, and may have picked up the concept from the Digambara Jains, a religious sect in which the monks may not wear clothing.\nThe term \"Digambara\" literally means \"sky-clad\". England had close links with India at the time when Wicca first became public in England, so this usage could well have been familiar to English speakers with a knowledge of Far Eastern religions. In particular, Gerald Gardner, who first popularized Wicca in England, was a noted folklorist with an interest in Far Eastern culture who spent much of his adult life in Ceylon and Burma, so it's plausible he was familiar with this Jain term.\nDr. Leo Ruickbie also notes that the traditional and artistic representation of witches cannot be overlooked as a source for nudity in Gardner's system, citing artists such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Salvator Rosa.\nAradia.\nThe origins of this instruction have been traced to \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\". The following speech by Aradia appears at the end of the book's first chapter;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAnd as the sign that ye are truly free,\nYe shall be naked in your rites, both men\nAnd women also: this shall last until\nThe last of your oppressors shall be dead;\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nDoreen Valiente, one of Gardner's priestesses, recalls Gardner's surprise at Valiente's recognition of material from \"Aradia\" in the original version of the \"Charge\" that she was given. Valiente later rewrote the \"Charge\", preserving the lines from \"Aradia\". Valiente's version was then widely circulated and reprinted.\nAccepting \"Aradia\" as the source of skyclad practice, Robert Chartowich points to the 1998 Pazzaglini translation of these lines, which read \"Men and Women / You will all be naked, until / Yet he shall be dead, the last / Of your oppressors is dead.\" Chartowich argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland's mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause \"in your rites\".\nOutside Wiccan traditions.\nRitual nudity is not exclusive to traditional Wicca. Amongst those groups that do, only some rituals may involve ritual nudity. The Arician tradition, as an example, practices skyclad for six months of the year, and performs their ceremonies in ritual robes for the other half of the year. Within, and especially outside of, specific areas of Wicca and Pagan, reasons other than tradition may be given to explain a preference for skyclad worship. Starhawk states in \"Spiral Dance\", \"The naked body represents truth, the truth that goes deeper than social custom\" and \"is a sign that a Witch's loyalty is to the truth before any ideology or any comforting illusions.\"\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2025, with a population of 115,636, it is the fourth most populous city in Sicily, following Palermo, Catania, and Messina.\nSituated on the southeastern coast of the island, Syracuse boasts a millennia-long history: counted among the largest metropolises of the classical age, it rivaled Athens in power and splendor, which unsuccessfully attempted to subjugate it. It was the birthplace of the mathematician Archimedes, who led its defense during the Roman siege in 212 BC. Syracuse became the capital of the Byzantine Empire under Constans II. For centuries, it served as the capital of Sicily, until the Muslim invasion of 878, which led to its decline in favor of Palermo. With the Christian reconquest, it became a Norman county within the Kingdom of Sicily.\nDuring the Spanish era, it transformed into a fortress, with its historic center, Ortygia, adopting its current Baroque appearance following reconstruction after the devastating 1693 earthquake. During World War II, in 1943, the armistice that ended hostilities between the Kingdom of Italy and the Anglo-American allies was signed southwest of Syracuse, in the \"contrada\" of Santa Teresa Longarini, historically known as the Armistice of Cassibile.\nRenowned for its vast historical, architectural, and scenic wealth, Syracuse was designated by UNESCO in 2005, together with the Necropolis of Pantalica, as a World Heritage Site.\nEtymology.\nThe origins of Syracuse\u2019s name are highly uncertain. The toponym first appears on the city\u2019s ancient coinage in the 6th century BC. Among the most notable hypotheses are derivations:\nHistory.\nAncient Syracuse.\nExcavations in the area have established that the region where Syracuse arose was inhabited continuously from the Neolithic period: the so-called \"Stentinello culture,\" named after the coastal site north of Syracuse, is particularly significant, with artifacts dating back to 6000 BC.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Multifaceted city, of five names, of ancient glory, of power, of unparalleled beauty, of wise kings and blind tyrants, of long peaces and ruinous wars, of barbaric assaults and plunders: in Syracuse is written, as in every city of ancient glory, the history of human civilization and its decline.\u2014\u200a\nThe city of Syrakousai was founded by the Corinthians in 733 BC (according to the Thucydidean dating). The leader of the new colonists was the oekist Archias, and their landing place was the island of Ortygia, from which they expelled the Sicels, the previous inhabitants of the area.\nThe new Corinthian colony grew rapidly and subjugated nearby territories. Throughout its centuries-long Greek history, Syracuse had a long line of tyrants and brief periods of popular rule, mostly under oligarchy. Among the numerous men who governed the \"polis\", six stood out in the ancient world for their ingenuity, fame, and power: Gelon, Hiero I, Dionysius I, Agathocles, and Hiero II, alongside the moderate oligarchic rule of the Corinthian general Timoleon, which lasted about a decade. These leaders dominated much of Sicily, extending Syracusan presence within the Magna Graecia, and influenced the broader Mediterranean, colonizing and establishing strategic commercial outposts (such as the work of the Dionysii in the Adriatic) or subjugating cities they encountered to thwart enemies (e.g., Agathocles with his expedition to Africa).\nSyracuse was the main rival of the Phoenician capital, Carthage, which, occupying the western part of the island (called the Punic eparchy), gave rise to the Greco-Punic Wars. These two influential metropolises, through a series of peace treaties and renewed battles, fiercely shaped the entire history of Greek Sicily.\nIn addition to internal conflicts with other Siceliot \"poleis\" and Barbarians (e.g., the war against Akragas and the conflict against the Synt\u00e8leia of Ducetius, king of the Sicels), Syrakousai faced an ambitious external offensive from Athens: the Attic capital launched a massive expedition to Sicily during the Peloponnesian War, aiming to conquer the renowned coastal city, whose expansionist policies threatened Athenian interests in the West. During this conflict, the Syracusan general Hermocrates distinguished himself, later leading Syracusan soldiers to Asia Minor alongside Sparta in the final phase of the same war.\nThe Syracusan court was a hub of patronage, hosting some of the most renowned names of the Greek world, including Aeschylus, Pindar, Ibycus, Xenophon, and Plato; the latter not only stayed in the \"pentapolis\" but, according to tradition, was deeply involved in Syracusan political history, making several journeys and becoming a confidant of Dion, the main political adversary of the tyrant Dionysius II. Syracuse was the birthplace of numerous figures who contributed to the arts, philosophy, and science. Among the natives, Archimedes stands out: a mathematician, inventor, and scientist who led Syracuse during the Roman siege in 212 BC.\nAfter prolonged resistance, Roman legions entered the city, leading to its capitulation under the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus. In the heat of the conquest, a Roman soldier killed Archimedes. All of Syracuse\u2019s wealth, accumulated over centuries of hegemony and prosperity, was looted and transported to Rome. This marked a significant turning point in Mediterranean culture. However, despite losing its autonomy, Syracusae remained the main center of the island during the entire Roman era. The Syracusan province was established, and the city was designated the capital of Roman Sicily. Cicero, arriving in the 1st century BC, described it as \"the most beautiful and largest Greek city\" (\"In Verrem\", II, 4, 117), and the emperor Augustus, in the same period, sent a colony of Roman citizens to aid its repopulation.\nWith the advent of Christianity, extensive catacombs emerged in the city. The apostolic message arrived early, as the Syracusan port was central to the maritime routes of the Roman Empire, traveled by early missionaries. Tradition holds that the protobishop of Syracuse was Marcian from Antioch, sent by the apostle Peter.\nThe Acts of the Apostles record that in 61, the apostle Paul of Tarsus stayed in the city for three days. During the reign of Diocletian, on 13 December 304, the martyrdom of Lucy of Syracuse occurred.\nMedieval era.\nWith the Barbarian invasions, the Western Roman Empire declined, and in the 5th century, Syracuse became part of the Eastern Roman Empire (later known as the Byzantine Empire). By the political design of Constans II, Syracuse became the capital of the Eastern Empire, replacing Constantinople, from 663 to 668, until the emperor\u2019s assassination in a location in the city called \"the Daphne Baths\".From the 7th century, Syracuse was targeted by Arabs, with attacks intensifying in the 9th century: after repelling a first siege in 827, the city fell violently during the second siege, concluded on 21 May 878.\nThe Islamic period in Syracuse is shrouded in silence from ancient sources, particularly the early years following the brutal conquest. A \"damnatio memoriae\" contributed to the absence of Arab architectural evidence in the city. Despite the near-total destruction, Syracuse was soon reintegrated into the island\u2019s social circuits (by the Norman period, it was referenced as a focal point for trade).\nIn 1040, the Byzantine emperor Michael IV sent General George Maniakes to Syracuse to reconquer the Aretusean land. His main companions were Italic and Norman warriors, led by Harald Hardrada, William Iron Arm, Drogo of Hauteville, Arduin the Lombard, and Stephen the Caulker, the emperor\u2019s brother-in-law, who commanded the fleet. The city was conquered by them. However, after numerous victories, serious internal discord arose within Maniakes\u2019 army, forcing him to abandon Sicily. The Normans turned against the Byzantines, and the new balance led to a swift Muslim resumption of control over Syracuse.\nThe city was definitively wrested from the Arabs in 1085, following a naval battle in the Great Harbor, where the last Arab emir of Syracuse, Benavert, clashed with the Norman Robert Guiscard.\nThe new political order established by the Normans did not restore Syracuse\u2019s ancient role as Sicily\u2019s capital (as initiated by the Arabs, they maintained the capital in Palermo).\nWith the arrival of the Nordic people, the Syracusans formed a county; the first established on the island, governed by its own count in the figure of Jordan of Hauteville, nephew of Roger I of Sicily, who became the Great Count of Sicily.\nIn the 12th century, Syracuse was contested by the maritime republics of Genoa and Pisa, both aiming to establish themselves there and include it among their fiefs. In 1204, Syracuse even had a Genoese count as its feudal lord: the pirate Alamanno da Costa, who took the title of Count of Syracuse \"by the Grace of God, the King of Sicily, and the Republic of Genoa\" (Genoa claimed rights over Syracuse, as the city was allegedly promised to them by the Hohenstaufen dynast Frederick Barbarossa in exchange for personal favors, a promise later renewed by his son, Henry VI). However, Barbarossa\u2019s grandson, Frederick II, King of Sicily and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to bring Syracuse under the direct control of the Sicilian government, removing it from feudal disputes and declaring it in 1234 his \"urbs fidelissima\" (most faithful city; an epithet it retained in documents until the modern era).\nDuring the Sicilian Vespers, Syracuse declared itself a free commune; an institution that ceased with the arrival of the Aragonese to the island\u2019s government. In 1302, the city became the seat of the queens of the Kingdom of Sicily and was governed for a long time through the Queen's Chamber, which granted the Syracusans significant autonomy, \"like a state within a state,\" while their ultimate allegiance remained to the holder of the Sicilian crown.\nThe first queen of the Syracusans was Eleanor of Anjou, the last being the infanta of Navarre Germaine of Foix, granddaughter of King of France Louis XII and consort of Ferdinand II of Aragon.\nModern era.\nThanks to the deep emotional bond between Germaine of Foix and the first ruler of the Spanish Empire, Charles V of Habsburg, Syracuse had a particularly close relationship with this monarch, reflected in the extensive documentation of his deeds across various aspects of Syracusan history. The era of Charles V was marked by war against the Ottoman Empire. As a borderland between the western and eastern Mediterranean, Syracuse became a key stronghold for defending Spanish imperial borders. Charles V fortified it so robustly that it earned the title of fortress.\nIt was also the work of Spanish soldiers under Charles V that transformed Ortygia into an island by cutting the isthmus built by the Greeks about a thousand years earlier, restoring Ortygia to its original geographical form.\nIn 1529, the Order of the Knights Hospitaller moved to Syracuse: sources are divided on whether it was Charles V who directed them to the Syracusan area to keep Turkish fleets and Barbary pirates at bay, or whether it was the initiative of the Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam. The wandering knights, homeless after losing the island of Rhodes, remained in Syracuse for a year until, in April 1530, they received documents from Charles V, as King of Sicily, granting them the Maltese archipelago as a fief for their Order; in return, the Habsburg demanded loyalty to the Sicilian monarch. The knights accepted.\nSyracuse thus became a witness to the birth of the Knights Hospitaller (due to the proximity between the two islands, the knights established a close, albeit occasionally contentious, relationship with the Syracusans).\nThe 16th century was a century of major natural disasters for Syracuse: the most destructive event was the 1542 earthquake, which nearly obliterated the city. Famines and epidemics decimated the population (just decades before the earthquake, there was even anticipation of an apocalypse). Even Charles V, during the height of religious fervor (with the Spanish Inquisition active in Sicily), became convinced that unknown sinners, having provoked the \"wrath of Heaven\" (as the Syracusans claimed), had brought the calamity upon the city.\nWars and calamities continued at a relentless pace throughout the following century. Syracuse could no longer keep up with the demographic growth of other major Sicilian centers (while the population increased across most of the island, Syracuse\u2019s population steadily declined).\nIn the Spanish era, Syracuse was primarily known as Zaragoza de Sicilia (or \u00c7arago\u00e7a de Sicilia): from the outset of their presence on the island, the Spanish referred to it as the Aragonese capital Zaragoza, and in official documents, it was always distinguished as the Zaragoza of Sicily.\nAmong the major military events of the period, particularly significant for Syracuse were: the attempted invasion by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (as a response to the Muslim defeat at the Battle of Lepanto), the defeat of the Knights of Malta at Plemmirio, and the war of the Sun King, Louis XIV of France (within the 17th century Franco-Dutch War), which particularly affected the Spanish domains in the Syracusan area; during this last conflict, the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter died and was buried in Syracuse (his body was later reclaimed by the Dutch in Amsterdam).\nIn 1693, another destructive earthquake, accompanied by a tsunami, struck, affecting most of eastern Sicily. Syracuse suffered less damage than in the 1542 event but was still severely weakened. In 1700, with the premature death of Charles II of Spain, a fierce contest arose to determine the new ruler of the Spanish Empire. The War of the Spanish Succession fully involved Syracuse, as Sicily became a contested territory following the Treaty of Utrecht, through which the Duchy of Savoy was united with the Kingdom of Sicily, and Spain lost control of the latter.\nSpain, under Philip V, had no intention of relinquishing the island and defied European expectations by waging war to free Sicily from the Piedmontese and restore Iberian influence. In this context, Syracuse became a Savoyard fortress where Annibale Maffei, viceroy of Victor Amadeus II, took refuge while the Spanish army had already conquered most of the island. For the first time, the British army intervened in the Aretusean land, as George I of Great Britain aimed to prevent Spain from reclaiming its former domains.\nThe battle of 11 August 1718 between the Spanish and the English, which saw the latter\u2019s victory in Syracusan waters, marked a significant turning point: it ended relations with the Iberian Peninsula and initiated a sustained British presence in the territory.\nAfter separation from Piedmont and a brief, turbulent Austrian period, lasting about fifteen years, Syracuse became part of the domains of the Bourbons of Naples. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte ended a long period of peace by claiming France\u2019s control over the island of Malta and expelling the knights, some of whom sought aid from the Tsar of Russia, Paul I. This sparked a dispute over the Maltese archipelago, extending to the Syracusans, as Bonaparte was not averse to conquering Sicily. The Aretusean city first welcomed the British fleet of Horatio Nelson (famous for his statement about the water of the Fountain of Arethusa, which he credited for his victory over Bonaparte in Egypt) and later that of Cuthbert Collingwood, Nelson\u2019s successor as commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, who requested full naval control of Syracuse for British soldiers. British land and sea forces garrisoned the city throughout the Napoleonic Wars, leaving it exposed only after 1813 (the Napoleonic period forged a strong bond with England, such that it destabilized Syracuse\u2019s political stability).\nNotably, during the same period, Syracuse hosted the United States fleet, which remained in its port from 1803 to 1807 during the First Barbary War. The Americans, however, left the city due to strained relations with British soldiers (the memory of the American Revolutionary War was still vivid, and Britain, preparing to militarily occupy Syracuse to prevent French conquest, did not want additional armed forces present).\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, established in 1816, faced a profound crisis from the 1820s, as Sicily never accepted the union of its crown with Naples, resulting in a loss of autonomy. Syracuse joined the rebellion in the 1840s: the turning point, which eroded trust in the Bourbon government in one fell swoop, was the health crisis of 1837, when a cholera epidemic devastated the city. Revolts erupted, leading to irreconcilable conflicts between the Syracusans and Bourbon authority: Ferdinand II resorted to military force to regain control, with the armed forces enacting harsh reprisals against the population. The king then stripped the city of its status as a provincial capital, creating the Province of Noto. Thus, the Syracusans, joining the revolutionary movements of 1848 (known as the Springtime of the Peoples), welcomed British soldiers, as Great Britain, soon joined by France, positioned itself as a mediating power in the ongoing dispute between Sicilians and the Bourbons of Naples, who were forced to temporarily accept the existence of a new Kingdom of Sicily.\nDivided between British and French garrisons, Syracuse saw its brief independence end quickly, returning under Ferdinand\u2019s rule, partly due to rivalry among the European powers involved in the conflict. The definitive turning point came with the subsequent movements for the birth of the Kingdom of Italy: Syracuse, freeing itself autonomously from Bourbon rule, surrendered to the Garibaldians on 28 July 1860. The power of the Bourbon monarchs was annulled, and from 1865, the city stably resumed its role as the capital of the southeastern Sicilian province (at the time, the Province of Syracuse included the future Province of Ragusa).\nContemporary era.\nDuring the Italian colonial war and the Fascist era, Syracuse assumed its traditional strategic role, with its geographic position suited for the route between Italy and Africa. King Victor Emmanuel III resided in the city multiple times (his last stay was in 1942), as did the Duce Benito Mussolini on several occasions.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, during World War II, Syracuse endured numerous bombings. In the spring of 1941, off the city\u2019s coast, British soldiers torpedoed the liner Conte Rosso; the attack caused a severe loss of life for Italy (with over 1,200 deaths, it was the highest human toll on an Italian ship during the early phase of the conflict).\nThe city was occupied by the Allies between the night of 9 July and 10 July 1943, through Operation Ladbroke (part of the Allied invasion of Sicily). Initially, it served as the main headquarters of the AMGOT, the Allied military government that took control of Sicily. Near the \"frazione\" of Cassibile, specifically in the \"contrada\" of Santa Teresa Longarini (a few kilometers from Syracuse\u2019s southern entrance), the armistice between Italy and the Allies was secretly signed on 3 September 1943 (made public through the Badoglio Proclamation of 8 September 1943, to which it remains linked). Subsequently, the Syracuse War Cemetery was built in the city\u2019s central outskirts for fallen British soldiers (adjacent to Syracuse\u2019s monumental cemetery). After the war, the city experienced a period of reconstruction and renewed hope.\n1953 was a significant year for Syracuse, as the weeping of a Marian effigy (depicting the Immaculate Heart of Mary) occurred, an event later declared miraculous by the Church.\nIn 1954, Winston Churchill arrived in the city, officially on vacation (he had previously passed through in 1917, traveling from Vienna to Malta). The British Prime Minister would recall his stay in Syracuse as \"the most delightful vacation of his life as a traveler.\"\nBetween the late 1950s and the late 1970s, the Syracuse petrochemical complex emerged and developed in the northern periphery of the city, one of Europe\u2019s largest petrochemical complexes. This had social repercussions: for Syracuse\u2019s territories, the industry affected the Santa Panagia Bay, the \"contrada\" of Targia, and the village of Priolo Gargallo, which, becoming an industrial center, sought and gained independence from Syracuse in 1979. Petrochemical industries reached the northern entrance of the city. Beyond limited economic prosperity, the complex caused environmental degradation and pollution in the surrounding area.\nIn 1990, a violent earthquake, known as the Carlentini Earthquake, occurred on 13 December, caused significant damage to the city and sparked controversy due to the institutional silence that followed.\nOn 5 and 6 November 1994, Pope John Paul II visited the city to inaugurate the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Tears and delivered a speech to the citizens, urging them to respond to the socio-economic marginalization that risked excluding them from the life of the nation.\nIn 2005, Syracuse was included by UNESCO in the list of World Heritage Sites, together with the nearby Necropolis of Pantalica. Another significant event for the city occurred in 2009, when the Maniace Castle hosted the G8 Environment Forum, which resulted in the Carta di Siracusa on Biodiversity.\nGeography.\nSyracuse is located on the southeastern side of Sicily. Its geography is highly varied, featuring hills and natural caves, while two rivers flow along its southwestern edge. The city is predominantly bordered by the sea, which surrounds it almost entirely. The coast is mostly rocky and jagged, with various promontories, bays, small islands, and peninsulas.\nThe city is partly located on the island of Ortygia and partly on the mainland (the entire area lies within the island of Sicily). Its unique geographical position has made it famous for its sunsets (thanks to the zenith angles from which they are observed, they have been described for millennia as among the most beautiful in the world).\nThe configuration of the southern coast creates a vast natural inlet within which the Great Harbor is located: approximately 1,200 meters from the tip of Ortygia lies Cape Murro di Porco, a promontory of the Maddalena Peninsula, locally referred to simply as Isola (in reference to the toponym of a district on its eastern coast, whose origin is tied to a former, no longer existing condition of insularity). To the north of the city lies another promontory: Cape Santa Panagia, where the third port of Syracuse, the Trogilo, is believed to have been located.\nThe city faces the central Mediterranean Sea, surrounded by the basin of the Ionian Sea. Syracuse lends its name to the southeastern Sicilian escarpment, known as the \"Malta and Syracuse Escarpment\" (also called the \"Hyblaean-Maltese Escarpment\"), which is primarily responsible for the area\u2019s high seismicity. This escarpment extends east of the Syracuse territory, into the depths of the Ionian Sea, as far as the island of Malta.\nTopography.\nGeologically, the Syracuse area is part of the Hyblaean Mountains. Its topography consists of moderate peaks, the most prominent being the plateau of Epipoli, part of the easternmost Hyblaean foothills. At the base of Epipoli, located between the districts of Acradina and Neapolis, rises the Temenite Hill. The urban landscape is further marked by a rocky outcrop\u2014rich in caves\u2014known as the Crag of Akradina, with jagged walls of white limestone, referred to as the Syracuse white stone.\nWithin the Crag of Akradina lies the Cappuccini Quarry, the largest of Syracuse\u2019s \"latomie\" (extensive millennia-old quarries, documented since the Greek era). The \"latomie\" are a defining feature of the city, with numerous examples present.\nTo the north of Syracuse, the Hyblaean foothills continue, forming rocky landscapes and caves, particularly evident in the Scala Greca district. There, the Santa Panagia Quarry, carved over millennia by a torrent of meteoric water, represents the only Hyblaean quarry in contact with the sea. The physical area of Syracuse is characterized by mature karst formations.\nIn the \"contrada\" of Grotta Perciata, at the edge of the municipal territory, lies one of Sicily\u2019s most significant karst caves, for which a protected reserve was established: the Grotta Monello Natural Reserve, situated among fluvial valleys and steep, often inaccessible slopes. Inside Grotta Monello, notable stalactites and stalagmites of various shapes are found.\nHydrography.\nThe main rivers flowing through the city\u2019s area are the Anapo and the Ciane: the riverbed of the Ciane merges with that of the Anapo at its end, with the two freshwater streams sharing a single mouth in the Ionian Sea, near the alluvial plain of the Pantanelli, where the natural reserve of Syracuse\u2019s salt pans is located (the salt pans have been out of use for several years).\nIn the marshy area west of the city, at Pantanelli\u2014where the Lisimelie marshes once stood (according to ancient tradition, these marshes were so significant that the city\u2019s toponym is said to derive from them)\u2014following land reclamation works in the 20th century, several canals were dug: the Mammaiabica (which runs alongside the Ciane), Scandurra, Pismotta, and Regina.\nAnother significant river, culturally millennia-old, flows through the municipal area: the Cassibile, from which the populous \"frazione\" of Syracuse takes its name. The mouth of this river is located in the other \"frazione\" of Fontane Bianche.\nIn the historic center of the city, represented by the island of Ortygia, flows the brackish water of the Fountain of Arethusa, originating from the Hyblaean aquifers. On the Temenite Hill, within the Grotta del Ninfeo, is the outlet of the Galermi Aqueduct, notable for being Sicily\u2019s oldest aqueduct (built by the tyrant Gelon in 480 BC, it still carries the waters of the Anapo into the city).\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Mediterranean maquis characterizes Syracuse\u2019s flora and fauna: palms, prickly pears, olive groves, and citrus orchards dominate the landscape. Due to the presence of the sea, one of the Mediterranean\u2019s most significant concentrations of dwarf palms has developed, covering nearly a square kilometer. In the city, at the archaeological zone, one of Italy\u2019s most impressive centuries-old Moreton Bay fig trees can also be observed.\nOf particular interest is the river flora: the most unique plant, due to its rarity in Europe and worldwide, is the papyrus (\"Cyperus papyrus\"), which grows spontaneously in the city (observable along the Ciane).\nRegarding fauna, Syracuse plays a primary role in hosting migratory birds and its territory includes species rare elsewhere in Europe. The complex geographical configuration allows the fauna to be divided into species that are cave-dwelling (or speleological), fluvial, and predominantly marine: the marine protected area of Plemmirio serves as an important observatory for the presence of cetaceans (rorquals, dolphins, sperm whales, and other sea mammals).\nClimate.\nSyracuse\u2019s climate is cool with light rainfall in winter and extremely hot and dry in summer. Notably, the Syracusan climate is dominated by the sirocco wind. In autumn, floods can occur, with peaks exceeding 100/150 mm daily.\nOn 11 August 2021, at the station of the Sicilian Agrometeorological Information Service near the border with Floridia, the highest temperature ever recorded in Italy and Europe was registered, reaching +48.8 \u00b0C. As this station is not part of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the official Italian record remains attributed to Foggia, which recorded +47 \u00b0C on 25 June 2007 at the Amendola weather station, part of the Air Force\u2019s meteorological network (affiliated with the WMO). In January 2023, a study on sunshine hours declared Syracuse the sunniest city in Italy, with 346.83 total sunshine hours, just ahead of nearby Catania with 346.78 hours. On 18 January 2024, Syracuse recorded an anomalous heatwave and sirocco, with temperatures reaching 25.3 \u00b0C.\nSymbols.\nIn ancient times, the city featured its own symbols on its coins. Its most famous and ancient emblem was the face of Arethusa surrounded by dolphins, which made it renowned throughout the Mediterranean. Syracuse was also the first city in Sicily to depict the triskelion on its coins, significantly contributing to its spread as the island's main symbol.\nSyracuse is also one of the first geographical locations to adopt the figure of the eagle: starting from the Hellenistic period, it was depicted on metal, shown grasping a bundle of lightning bolts. This animal \u2014 always clutching the lightning, an original sign of Zeus \u2014 was revived during the Middle Ages to become the city's sole symbol, engraved on its coat of arms as early as the Swabian period.\nSubsequently, in the 15th century, a fortress completely replaced the eagle, until, in the 17th century, the city's most enduring symbols were combined to form the current coat of arms of Syracuse: a towered eagle (with a crenelated castle) surmounted by a crown.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Green, with a natural eagle in flight, lowered and with its left wing closed, crowned with a royal crown, charged on the chest with a golden castle, turreted, grasping Jupiter's lightning bolts with golden claws. Below the shield is a blue strip with the inscription S.P.Q.S.\u2014\u200a\nThe current coat of arms was granted on 8 December 1942 and is mentioned in the third article of the municipal statute. The motto placed below the shield of green color, on a blue strip, bears the inscription \"S.P.Q.S\", in Latin, \"Senatus PopulusQue Syracusanus\", translated: \"The Senate and the People of Syracuse\".\nMeanwhile, the aforementioned figure of Arethusa surrounded by dolphins is currently used alongside the biga (which, like the quadriga, was another well-known symbol of the ancient city), the Winged Victory, and the lion (a figure that appeared in the context of warfare against Carthage) to represent the coat of arms of the Free Municipal Consortium of Syracuse (formerly the province).\nThe civic banner consists of a green drape.\nMonuments and places of interest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The cultural, architectural and artistic stratification evident in the Syracuse/Pantalica ensemble bears exceptional testimony to the history and cultural diversity of the Syracuse region over three millennia from the ancient Greek period to the Baroque.\u2014\u200a\nSyracuse is among Italy's leading art cities. Rich in remarkable monuments and places of interest, it owes its numerous architectural and cultural testimonies to an equally rich and ancient history.\nUNESCO includes Syracuse among its World Heritage Sites based on four criteria, including the exceptional universal importance of the events that took place there (Criterion VI) and the extraordinary cultural diversity concentrated in a unique space (Criterion II).\nThe city encompasses a millennia-spanning architectural-cultural heritage, preserving in its museums archaeological artifacts of an even greater antiquity than its Greek foundation.\nCivil architecture.\nSyracuse's architecture almost always features white facades, tending toward beige or golden-yellow, as they were built with the Hyblaean stone, locally called \"giuggiulena\" stone, or nougat stone, due to its malleability and tones similar to the aforementioned food. For this reason, Syracuse is often architecturally referred to as the \"white city\".\nMost of the numerous and ancient noble palaces are located on the island of Ortygia, as during the medieval and Renaissance periods, the city was confined within it, while more recent Syracuse is home to administrative and governmental buildings (e.g., the hospital complex and the court of justice). Among the earliest post-classical civil constructions are the 14th-century seat of the Queen's Chamber and the 14th-century Mergulese-Montalto Palace, in Chiaramontano Gothic style. Other medieval buildings persist in the city, particularly from the Aragonese-Catalan period: examples include the Bellomo Palace and surviving elements of the Zapata-Gargallo Palace, owned by the prestigious families of the same name (a descendant founded the original village of Priolo Gargallo, Tommaso Gargallo). However, it was after the 17th-century earthquake and subsequent reconstruction that the predominant style of Syracuse emerged: Sicilian Baroque. The city gave birth to one of the main exponents of this style: the architect Rosario Gagliardi.\nThe Palazzo Vermexio, seat of the municipal government, remains one of the greatest examples of Baroque art applied to an administrative building. The ultimate evolution of Baroque was Rococo; Syracuse clearly displays its elaborate signs: palaces such as Beneventano del Bosco (whose ancient rooms hosted, at different times, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Admiral Horatio Nelson and the Bourbon sovereigns who visited the city, including the Count of Syracuse, Leopold of the Two Sicilies), the Impellizzeri, the Borgia del Casale (owned by the Syracuse branch of the influential Borgia family), and the https://, distinguished by its facades with Baroque coats of arms and a loggia accessed via a red marble staircase, were built adopting the aforementioned ornamental style.\nThe building housing the Syracuse chancery is the Archbishop's Palace; within it, various centuries of architectural transformations are visible: from Swabian construction to 18th- and 19th-century additions. Dating directly to the 19th century and reflecting Art Nouveau and Neoclassical styles (individually or sometimes both) are the palaces named: of the Superintendency of Cultural Heritage, of the Clock (so-called due to the large mechanical clock atop it), of the Old Market, and of the Chamber of Commerce.\nAlso from the 19th century is the palace of the Municipal Theatre of Syracuse, built so that \"the land of Epicharmus would have a theatre suited\" to host the artistic life of the population. A decade later, the palace of the railway station was inaugurated, followed by the maritime station building (now the seat of the Coast Guard).\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the palaces of the Hotel Des Etrangers, the Grand Hotel (both among the oldest hotels in Syracuse), and the Post Office (now also converted into an accommodation facility) were built.\nThe city\u2019s main and historic villas are essentially three: Politi, Landolina, and Reimann. The Villa Politi stands above the Syracuse quarries (originally built as the Grand Hotel Villa Politi) and was constructed in the 19th century by the Austrian noblewoman Maria Theresa Laudien, wife of the Syracusan Raffaello Politi, whose efforts earned it the reputation of an \"international salon\" (it hosted, among others, the Princes of Piedmont and Winston Churchill).\nThe Villa Landolina, located in the Neapolis district, is also a 19th-century residence. It bears the name of the Landolina family, whose most illustrious member was the archaeologist and naturalist Saverio Landolina (he rediscovered the Syracusan Venus and defended the existence of the spontaneous colony of Arethusan papyrus, also engaging in the debate on who discovered this rare plant). Adjacent to it, within its grounds, the Paolo Orsi Regional Archaeological Museum was built. A large wooded park and tombs of fallen soldiers from other nations complete its complex area.\nVilla Reimann, known primarily for its distinctive and extensive garden (covering 35,000 m\u00b2 of urban land), called the \"Garden of the Hesperides,\" is located near the Tomb of Archimedes necropolis and takes its name from the Danish noblewoman Christiane Reimann, who purchased the property in 1933. By her will, the villa is now municipal property. Also noteworthy is Villa Bonanno (also known as a castle due to its imposing appearance), now abandoned, located in Tremilia, a suburb of Syracuse: initially owned by the Scotsman Gould Francis Leckie, who in 1800 obtained the concession of the ancient ecclesiastical land, but having to abandon Sicily (Leckie clashed with the Bourbon sovereigns during the British occupation of Syracuse), the building passed to the Syracusan Bonanno barons.\nMilitary architecture.\nThe first to be built was the Euryalus Castle (located in the modern district of Belvedere), commissioned by the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse as a defensive pivot and connection point for his extensive walls, erected against the assaults of the Carthaginians and other belligerent peoples (Syracuse had just repelled Athens\u2019 offensive, necessitating increased defenses for future wars). Archimedes also contributed to the castle\u2019s construction, enhancing it with traps for the enemies of the pentapolis. The Euryalus was the military building that, millennia later, was taken as an example by Kaiser Wilhelm II for the tunnel warfare and trench warfare fought by the Germans.\nIn the first half of the 13th century, the Maniace Castle arose, in Gothic style, designed by Frederick II of Swabia on a previous fortress, itself built by the Byzantine general George Maniakes; Frederick named his construction after him. This castle, considered one of the most representative Swabian architectures, played a significant role in the city\u2019s medieval military life: used as a prison and to counter pirate raids, but when the Kingdom\u2019s sovereigns visited, it could also serve as an elegant court residence.\nOver the centuries, Syracuse became increasingly fortified. In the 16th century, under Spanish rule, most Greco-Roman monuments were destroyed (some already damaged by numerous earthquakes) to reuse their stone, building massive bastions and walls that permanently altered the city\u2019s appearance.\nThe fortifications and military regime reached such a level that 17th- and 18th-century Syracuse has been described by modern historians as \"a barracks inhabited by civilians,\" and also the \"fortress of Europe,\" designed to be impregnable. A clear description was provided by the noted 19th-century British traveler Henry Clark Barlow, who noted the numerous military structures one had to pass to enter the city, which closed its gates at sunset, leaving out those who failed to enter in time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The land-side fortifications are very powerful; one passes over drawbridges through walkways flanked by formidable batteries and commanded by firing positions directed toward the entrance gate; and when you think the fortifications are over, you find you must cross more moats, more walkways, more batteries; and when you hope to have reached the gates, there is still half a mile of trenches in prospect, bridges, moats, and batteries; and when you have passed the gates, the city is still distant, with a bridge and walls to cross.\u2014\u200a\nIt was not until the late 19th century that the massive military buildings were completely dismantled: of these, the Fort Vigilena (previously called Forte della Gradiglia) and the Fort San Giovannello (formerly Forte della Ferraria) remain prominently visible. Also framed in a military context is the palace that housed the prison during the Bourbon period: its construction was prompted by the increasingly frequent rebellions of Syracusans against the Neapolitan monarchy. Thus, with no space left in the prison behind Piazza del Duomo, the Bourbons built this new structure in 1853. The palace is currently awaiting restoration.\nIn 1735, the Military Engineers Corps barracks were built, later named after the Syracusan patriot Gaetano Abela. The Abela barracks are located within the Maniace Castle area: until 2001, they housed the Infantry Regiment and the Sapper Engineers, then became the university residence for the architecture faculty.\nAs the city expanded, so did its military architecture: in the decade before World War II, Syracuse saw the construction of the seaplane base (now home to the 34th Radar Group of the Air Force), followed by the battery Lamba Doria, occupying 48,000 m\u00b2 in the southern part of the Maddalena Peninsula. Numerous bunkers were built, scattered throughout, along with an underground fuel depot for the Syracuse Royal Air Force.\nAlso tied to World War II is the Santa Panagia battery, incorporated into the vast area of the Syracuse naval base and protected as a military archaeological asset. Additionally, of historical-military interest is the hypogeum of Piazza Duomo, as this long tunnel (running from the cathedral site to the Foro Italico, near the Marina) was one of the main shelters for the population during the bombings of the last conflict.\nAnother prevalent military architectural feature in Syracuse is its towers: the municipal area has many (a legacy of a bellicose past focused on sighting and territorial defense); the main ten are: Ognina Tower, Cuba Tower, Milocca Tower, Tonda Tower, Landolina Tower, Teatro Greco Tower, Pizzuta Tower, Targia Tower, Bosco Minniti Tower, and Modica Tower. Special mention among the towers goes to the symbolic structure of the Belvedere district: called \"u Semafuru\" (the Semaphore), a 19th-century military construction with a crenelated tower, which until 1955 had a bright antenna on top communicating in Morse code with ships passing or approaching the Port of Augusta and Port of Syracuse.\nOther.\nIn the Cappuccini Square (next to the convent of the same name and the quarry of the same name), the municipality of Syracuse is home to the Monument to the Italians Fallen in Africa, dating back to the Fascist period but assembled decades after the regime\u2019s fall. The monument commemorates soldiers who died on the African continent during the colonial war. Inside, there is a chapel dedicated to the legionnaire, while outside, a plaque was recently added to commemorate the victims of the sinking of the liner Conte Rosso, which occurred near the monument\u2019s location.\nThe city has three historic lighthouses: the green Maniace Castle lighthouse (with green light), dominating the castle\u2019s promontory; the red Massolivieri lighthouse, built on an old rural house, signaling the Maddalena Peninsula promontory; and the Capo Murro di Porco lighthouse, casting its white light over the cape that bears its name, the most famous Syracusan lighthouse and one of the most important light signals in eastern Sicily: it also appears in the miniseries \"The Island of Secrets - Kor\u00e8\". The state property office included this lighthouse among the first nine in Italy leased to be transformed into characteristic hotels while continuing to serve as maritime signals.\nPartly located on an island and crossed by rivers and canals on one side, Syracuse has built several bridges over its long history; the municipality connects Ortygia to the rest of the city via two bridges, the most monumental of which is called the Umbertino Bridge, named after King Umberto I, who reigned when it was built. The southern entrance is marked by a bridge that spans the beds of the Ciane and Anapo rivers; previously, the latter river was crossed by another stone bridge where the battle against the British took place on 10 July 1943. Another significant bridge connects the coastal road from the Fontane Bianche area to Cassibile, crossing the mouth of one of the main Hyblaean rivers.\nThe Fountain of Arethusa and the surrounding architectural structure are among the most visited sites in Syracuse: over the centuries, it has undergone many changes in appearance. It has been surrounded by large fortifications, hosted papyrus plants in its waters, and served as a washhouse for Syracusan women in post-classical times. Additionally, several sculptural works are concentrated on the island: the most prominent is the 20th-century Fountain of Diana, which depicts the main elements of the legend of the river god Alpheus, the nymph Arethusa, and her protector, Artemis (the Roman Diana). Also part of Syracuse\u2019s architectural heritage is the ancient Santa Panagia tuna fishery, of medieval origins (founded around 1100), which, with varying fortunes, remained active until the 1950s of the 20th century.\nArchaeological sites.\nThroughout the Syracuse region, significant archaeological evidence can be observed. In addition to the aforementioned sacred temple areas, the city boasts one of the Mediterranean\u2019s most extensive archaeological environments, enclosed in a park named after the district where it is located: the Neapolis Archaeological Park. Covering 240,000 m\u00b2 of urban area, it contains some of the most impressive testimonies of Greco-Roman Syracuse:\nWithin the archaeological park, there are also interesting tomb complexes: the Via dei Sepolcri (where the cult of Heroes was paid to the deceased), the Roman sarcophagi near the amphitheatre, and the Grotticelli necropolis, whose most significant feature is the presumed tomb of Archimedes, so-called because the period and location of the excavation do not align with accounts of the mathematician\u2019s death and burial: according to Cicero, he was buried south of Syracuse, possibly near the Ciane river, but the loss of the original tomb (marked by a sphere and cylinder) and centuries of tradition have consecrated this site as the symbolic tomb of the most famous ancient Syracusan.\nNecropolises are the most prevalent structural element in Syracuse\u2019s archaeological sites: the area is famous for the Sicilian peculiarity of carving their tombs in the shape of a beehive: Pantalica is the prime example, but this ancient practice is also found in Syracuse\u2019s limestone walls. There are twelve groups of necropolises from the 8th century BC to the Byzantine era; among the largest and oldest (besides the aforementioned Grotticelli) are the Fusco necropolis to the southwest, the Ospedale Civile and Santa Panagia necropolises in the center, and the large perimeter of the Targia necropolis to the north.\nOther significant sites include the Syracusan Forum (the ancient agora of the pentapolis, later a forum) and the monuments composing the Roman Gymnasium.\nAmong the remains of the oldest civilizations are: to the north, the archaeological sites of Stentinello and the Thapsos peninsula, and to the south, Ognina, which, besides showing signs of archaic contacts with Malta\u2019s inhabitants, preserves the architectural remains of subsequent historical periods.\nReligious architecture of the ancient polis.\nThe earliest religious architectural evidence dates back to the prehistoric era, while the religiosity of the ancient Greeks led to the construction of imposing votive areas in the city, such as the Altar of Hieron (the largest of its time) and numerous temples, the most significant and best-preserved being the Temple of Athena (converted into a church with the advent of Christianity).\nThe oldest temple in Syracuse is the one built for the sun god Apollo: dating to the 6th century BC, it is also the oldest Sicilian temple in Doric style dedicated to this deity and is located on the island of Ortygia, which, according to the ancient Syracusans, was given to Apollo\u2019s twin, Artemis. For the lunar goddess, the Artemision was built (next to the temple of the goddess of wisdom, Athena); Cicero described it as the most prestigious of Syracuse\u2019s ancient temples.\nAlso in the 6th century BC, in the countryside facing the sea, between the island of Ortygia and the Maddalena Peninsula, the Temple of Olympian Zeus was built, called by the Syracusans \"the two columns\" (the only architectural element still clearly visible); it is a tangible testament to the link between ancient Syracuse and the site of the sacred Olympic games.\nOn the road that once led to the sub-colony of Helorus - hence called Via Elorina - stands the monumental complex known as the Roman Gymnasium of Syracuse, within which the remains of a temple of uncertain dedication (possibly to Egyptian deities) can be observed, described by Cicero in his chronicles.\nThe polis was also famous for being the main center for the Sicilian cult of the chthonic deities Demeter and Kore, to whom a large votive area near Piazza della Vittoria was dedicated. Other votive areas dedicated to Mother Earth and her daughter were scattered throughout the city. Numerous other temple remains dedicated to the Olympians and minor deities, significant to the geographical area, are distributed across the urban and extra-urban territory.\nReligious architecture.\nChristian architecture.\nThe places of worship of the Christian religion constitute the majority of Syracuse\u2019s artistic-religious heritage. Many structures have historical significance, some even represented by natural caves, such as liturgical caves. The former Greek temple, now the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, commonly known as the Duomo, is among the most archaic and notable architectural structures of early Christianity, evolving slowly over time.\nTradition holds that the second oldest Catholic building in Syracuse after the Cathedral is the Church of San Giovannello (dedicated to John the Baptist), built in the Giudecca district. Also ancient is the Church of San Giovanni alle Catacombe, which, during Islamic domination, reportedly took on the role of the cathedral. The building lacks its roof, destroyed by natural disasters, and serves as the entrance to one of the largest catacombs in Syracuse (together with those in Rome, the most extensive in the world), that of San Giovanni. Beneath this church lies the crypt presumed to house the relics of the protobishop Marcian.\nDating to the Norman era are the Church of San Nicol\u00f2 ai Cordari (overlying a Paleochristian building), the Church of San Martino, and the Church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro, whose adjacent rotunda, as the name suggests, was built in the 17th century to serve as the sepulchre of the city\u2019s patron saint (whose mortal remains, however, remained in Venice, after being taken by the Byzantines). The Church of Santa Lucia alla Badia is another important structure dedicated to the patron saint.\nOf particular interest are the churches belonging to the Knights of Malta: their first church was that of San Sebastianello (Saint Sebastian, the co-patron saint of the Syracusans), later moving to the Church of Saints Blaise and Leonard; of the first, built in the Byzantine era, the crypt next to the prehistoric temple is visitable, while of the second, dating to the 1500s, only the external facade overlooking the Knights of Malta Square is visible.\nAmong the 20th century constructions, the Pantheon of Syracuse stands out, housing the remains of World War I fallen soldiers, and the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Tears, built to commemorate the miraculous Marian event of 1953: the conical-shaped sanctuary is the city\u2019s highest church, visible from a considerable distance.\nWithin the perimeter of the Villa Landolina (museum site) is also a small non-Catholic cemetery, containing the remains of the German poet August von Platen and some British and American fallen soldiers from the Napoleonic period.\nArchitecture of other religions.\nThe city also is home to structures of other religions. The most notable is the mikveh, dating to the Byzantine era, often described as the largest and oldest Jewish ritual bath in Europe.\nDemographics.\nIn its millennia-long history, Syracuse has experienced periods of significant population growth and severe depopulation. In the Greek era, the city saw its greatest expansion: historians differ on the exact number of inhabitants, but it is widely regarded as one of the first densely populated metropolises of antiquity. The noted London classicist Michael Grant wrote about it:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although the biggest city in the world was Pataliputra (Patna) on the Ganges, Syracuse was the largest in Europe.\u2014\u200a\nDominations, wars, and famines permanently altered Syracuse\u2019s demographic profile, reducing it in the second half of the modern era to a population of just inhabitants, with its inhabited center concentrated solely on the fortified island of Ortygia.\nA significant population growth occurred due to the economic boom from the post-World War II period onward, peaking at 125,941 inhabitants in 1991. Currently, the municipality is experiencing a sharp demographic decline, starting just over a decade ago when the population dropped from 124,083 in 2008 to 118,385 in 2011, interrupted by a slight increase in 2012-2014 but resuming from 2015 and culminating in the latest ISTAT census of 30 June 2022, which recorded a total of 115,984 inhabitants. In 2021 alone, there were 7,000 fewer residents. This marks the lowest population since the post-war period.\nThe current population is 115,636 as of 2025, confirming the demographic decline that resumed with greater intensity from 2015. Emigration, low birth rates, and increased mortality are the main factors contributing to Syracuse\u2019s progressive depopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nForeign population.\nAs of 31 December 2023, the foreign population was inhabitants, equal to 5.3% of the population. The most significant groups are:\nLanguages and dialects.\nIn antiquity, due to its active cultural and commercial movement, the Syracusan dialect was one of the \"linguae francae\" of the Greco-Mediterranean world. The language of the ancient Syracusans, found in the works of writers even far from Sicily, has been defined as the Greek-Syracusan dialect.\nLater, the local dialect was enriched by new external influences, particularly from the Latin language (itself influenced by ancient Greek).\nAround the 13th century, with the so-called Sicilian School, the islanders unified their language, passing their content and phonetic patterns to the Tuscans, thus laying the first foundation for the birth of the Italian language. The leading figure of this linguistic school was a resident of the Siracusan area: Giacomo da Lentini. The centuries-long presence of the Spanish in the city was particularly influential on the local dialect: many Syracusan words derive from the Spanish language.\nAccording to modern studies on the Sicilian language, the Syracusan dialect, despite its specific peculiarities (e.g., the letter D typically becomes an R in Syracusan speech), falls into the following two categories:\nReligion.\nAlthough ancient Syracuse was one of the most significant centers for the cult of the Greek gods \u2014 it proclaimed itself to the ancient world as the sacred land of the lunar goddess Artemis, and considered its inhabitants the chosen ones of the chthonic Demeter, also hosting for centuries some of the most powerful priests of Olympia, such as the Iamids \u2014, the change in religious belief came early: thanks to its primary maritime port for the communication routes of the Roman Empire, it was an initial destination for Christian evangelizers.\nThe tradition of Syracuse (with the earliest document on this matter dating back to the Byzantine era) has handed down the arrival of its first bishop, Marcian (or Marcianus), as early as the year 39 (just six years after the Crucifixion of Jesus), sent by the prince of the apostles, Peter, while he was still in Antioch, with the purpose of bringing the Christian message to the population of Syracuse and converting them. This is recorded in the \"Roman Martyrology\": for this reason, the Syracusans considered their first church (established within one of the main Greek temples of the city) to be the oldest in the Western world.\nSyracuse also appears in the New Testament as a landing place for the apostle Paul (the author of the letters to the Corinthians), who stayed there for three days in the year 61.\nFrom its earliest days, the establishment of the Syracusan church was contested by Eastern and Western ecclesiastical authorities, as the city had become part of the Byzantine Empire by the time of its development. The Patriarchate of Constantinople sought to appoint the bishop of Syracuse, but the popes of the Latin Church (to which the Syracusan Christian community was originally linked) expressed the same desire. In this context, the church of Syracuse became autocephalous, meaning its bishop recognized no religious authority above him. It was Pope Nicholas I, in September 860, who explicitly requested the Emperor Michael III to grant Rome, rather than Byzantium, the right to consecrate the religious leader of Syracuse, so as not to betray an ancient custom dating back to the time of the apostles. This appeal, however, was ignored by the emperor.\nAt that time, the Archdiocese of Syracuse was the most important Christian see in Sicily. Its metropolitan area encompassed the entire island, including Malta, and was responsible for the entire Christian-Byzantine region of Southern Italy. One of its bishops, Gregory Asbestas, was the instigator of the Photian Schism, a precursor to the East\u2013West Schism, which marked the separation between the Latin Church and the Greek Church. During the Iconoclastic controversy, the Syracusan archdiocese supported the veneration of sacred images.\nThe arrival of Islamic rule in the city completely altered the hegemonic context of the Syracusan church. The last bishop of the ancient era was Sophronius, who was deported by the Arabs to Palermo along with the rest of the Syracusans and the monk Theodosius, the author of the chronicle of the siege. When the Normans eventually ended Islamic rule in Syracuse, the religious context was significantly diminished: the Syracusan archbishop was no longer the metropolitan of Sicily, and the diocesan structure of the island was reorganized.\nTraditions and folklore.\nThe most popular Syracusan festival, renowned both nationally and internationally, is the feast of Saint Lucy, which begins on 13 December with a procession carrying the saint\u2019s statue through the city streets. It concludes seven days later with the Octave of Saint Lucy, when the silver statue is returned to the Cathedral. Since 1927, a young woman from Sweden, chosen in her home country and dressed in white to represent Lucy of Syracuse, has participated in the procession alongside the local population. This Swedish tradition forms the basis of the twinning between Syracuse and Stockholm.The feast of Saint Lucy is repeated on the first Sunday of May, known as the feast of Saint Lucy of the Quails, celebrated in period costumes. This event commemorates a miraculous occurrence in May 1646, when a dove (the symbol of the Holy Spirit) entered the Syracusan church dedicated to Saint Lucy, heralding the end of a famine that had brought the city to its knees. Following this unusual visit, a ship laden with grain arrived at the Aretusean port.\nNewspapers.\nSyracuse has historically been covered editorially by major publishing groups such as \"La Sicilia\" and \"Giornale di Sicilia\". In the past, \"La Sicilia\" offered a supplementary edition dedicated to the Syracuse municipal consortium, focusing on each municipality (South Zone, Hyblaean Zone, North Zone). Since 2020, the supplementary edition has been integrated into the daily edition. In 2021, the last physical office of print newspapers (\"La Sicilia\", while \"Giornale di Sicilia\" closed its Syracuse office) shut down, with editorial coverage now managed through remote collaborations. \nOnline newspapers provide the most extensive editorial coverage in the area. \"Siracusa News\", established in 2008, is the outlet with the highest number of journalists, followed by outlets such as \"Siracusa Oggi\", \"Siracusa Post\", \"Siracusa Press\", \"Nuovo Sud\", \"Web Marte\", \"Canale 8\", and \"Cammino\".\nCulture.\nEducation.\nLibraries and bookstores.\nThe city is home to several libraries, the oldest of which dates back to 1780 (as earlier ones did not survive past looting and natural disasters), named the Archiepiscopal Alagonian library, founded by Bishop Giovanni Battista Alagona. It houses a paper collection of 60,000 books. The largest is the city\u2019s municipal library, established in 1867, which holds approximately 70,000 volumes.\nAmong the Aretusean bookstores, the Casa del libro Rosario Mascali has been recognized, for the first time in Sicily, as \"a cultural asset,\" listed among Italy\u2019s historic bookstores. Notable Sicilian writers such as Quasimodo, Sciascia, and Vittorini have frequented it.\nResearch.\nIn 2015, Syracuse was selected by the National Research Council (CNR) project to become Italy\u2019s first smart city 2.0. Previously, in 2012, it had participated in the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge, selected alongside 32 other cities worldwide.\nSchools, universities, academies.\nThe municipality of Syracuse has 150 schools fulfilling compulsory education (from kindergarten to secondary school). Among its most distinctive upper secondary schools, as a maritime city, is the Nautical Institute (one of seven in Sicily and about forty in Italy), founded in 1944 and named after the patriot Alessandro Rizza (formerly Gaetano Arezzo della Targia). It has signed an agreement (managed by the Workers\u2019 Training School of the Maritime Military Arsenal) \u2013 the first of its kind in Italy \u2013 for school-work alternation with the Italian Navy. As a city with a strong tourism vocation, Syracuse\u2019s education system dedicates significant attention to training in the tourism services sector: the capital has three such institutes (which, combined with the other three in the municipal consortium, form one of the highest concentrations of tourism schools on the island).\nAlthough Syracuse is one of the oldest and currently most populous urban centers in Sicily, it does not have its own university (due to historical reasons originating in the post-ancient era). However, it can boast two significant and unique distinctions related to university history: it was from Syracuse that the decree establishing the oldest state university in Europe, the University of Naples Federico II, was issued, desired by Emperor Frederick II of Swabia in 1224, when his court resided within the walls of Syracuse; furthermore, the oldest graduate in Sicily, the Syracusan Antonio Mantello, who obtained a degree in civil law at the nearby University of Catania on 19 November 1449, also hails from this city. It was not until 1996 that a branch of the architecture faculty of the University of Catania was inaugurated in Syracuse. The online universities Pegaso and Niccol\u00f2 Cusano have recently opened their branches in the city.\nIn the theological field, the San Metodio Higher Institute of Religious Sciences, founded in 1977 and dedicated to the Syracusan who became Patriarch of Constantinople, offers a degree in religious sciences. Additionally, the city is home to the Rosario Gagliardi Academy of Fine Arts (dedicated to the Syracusan Baroque architect), the Anea naturopathy academy, and the Academy of English (a Cambridge exam center and a monitored body of the DITALS center of the Universit\u00e0 per Stranieri di Siena).\nThe Mediterranean Center for Arts and Sciences (MCAS) of Arcadia University (whose main private campus is in Pennsylvania) is a program for American students residing in Syracuse; it contributed to the establishment of the Sicily Center for International Education (SCIE), founded in 2015 in Ortygia, which offers foreign students the opportunity to learn about Italian culture through summer study programs and collaboration with other national and international institutes operating in the area. Also dedicated to foreign students is The Italian Academy (Italian Language and Culture Centre), established in 1984 in the area of the San Giovanni catacombs and the basilica above it.\nSyracuse also is home to an academic specialization school in Archaeological Heritage, founded in 1925, which is unique in both Sicily and Southern Italy. Its direction was initially entrusted to the archaeologist Paolo Orsi. The city is also the original seat of the psychotherapy institute of Gestalt HCC Italy (Gestalt Human Communication Center Italy), founded in 1979, which began its university history in Italy from this territory.\nFoundations and associations.\nThe NPO foundation of the INDA (acronym for National Institute of Ancient Drama), which includes the academy of ancient drama, was established in Syracuse in 1914. It is one of the longest-standing and most renowned theater schools for dramatic art. Thanks to it, after 2,400 years, the city\u2019s Greek theater has resumed hosting tragedies and comedies written for the first time in antiquity, while also promoting various artistic-cultural activities and taking its performances and actors across Italy and abroad (e.g., INDA at the Teatro Grande in Pompeii and at the cultural festival in Athens).\nThe city is also a significant global reference point for the study of criminal sciences and criminal law, due to the presence of the Siracusa International Institute (until 2017 known as ISISC \u2013 International Higher Institute of Criminal Sciences), a non-profit foundation established in 1972 that holds special consultative status with the United Nations. Among the institute\u2019s most significant actions is the conference where experts drafted the first text of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, adopted by all UN member states. The Siracusa International Institute, which aims to protect human rights, combat transnational organized crime, and uphold the rule of law, has always organized international advanced training courses in criminal law, conducted technical assistance programs abroad, and developed various research projects, primarily focused on countering organized crime. Its headquarters, dedicated to its founder and president Mahmoud Cherif Bassiouni, also houses the OPCO (Permanent Observatory on Organized Crime), an organ of the presidency of the Sicilian region and local territorial bodies. The Siracusa International Institute also hosts a library collection of 24,000 volumes focused on criminology and human rights from various countries.\nGiven the city\u2019s special relationship with the papyrus plant (Syracuse is the only city in Europe where it grows naturally), the Italian Institute for Egyptian Civilization (I.I.C.E.) was founded in Syracuse with its main headquarters in the city; this foundation was influenced by the established presence in Syracuse of the International Papyrus Institute, which has been dedicated since 1987 to the study and restoration of ancient Egyptian papyri. It is twinned with the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, managed the \"Papyrus Restoration Laboratory\" at the Egyptian Museum, participated in excavation campaigns in the land of the pharaohs, and hosts Egyptologists from around the world in Syracuse for conferences and seminars.\nIn 1984, to promote Baroque architecture, the International Center for Baroque Studies (CISB) was established in the city, which was one of the main contributors to the inclusion of the Late Baroque Towns of the Val di Noto in the UNESCO list. Syracuse is also the seat of the first Sicilian Hub: The Hub Syracuse (also known as The Hub Sicily), part of the Euro-South Hub.\nThe city is also culturally active in the field of sociopolitical pacification through the AIEP (International Association for Peace Education), chaired by the Scicli native and Syracuse resident by adoption Bruno Fucili (thirteen-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee), who has organized the international conference on Peace Education in the Aretusean municipality for over twenty years. Thanks to these initiatives, Syracuse was declared, in 1995, a \"city for peace and human rights.\" Among the memorable events of these Aretusean conferences is the visit in 1999 of Muhammad Ali, who signed documents in the city for a peace treaty in Burundi, where a civil war was raging.\nFurthermore, young doctors from across the Mediterranean regularly gather in the city to specialize, utilizing the Euro Mediterranean Rehabilitation Summer School (E.M.R.S.S.), managed by the Syracusan association dedicated to physical medicine and rehabilitation.\nPress and media.\nThe city is home to local editions of \"Giornale di Sicilia\", \"La Sicilia\", and \"Gazzetta del Sud\", the fortnightly opinion magazine \"La Civetta di Minerva\" (winner of the 2012 Mario Francese National Award), and the radio station Radio FM Italia.\nCinema.\nThe city has served as an open-air film set for numerous films, attracting many prominent figures from the film world, such as Harrison Ford, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, James Mangold, Peter Dinklage, Ben Mendelsohn, Joe Wright, Vittorio De Sica, Mario Monicelli, Nino Manfredi, the duo Franco and Ciccio, the Taviani brothers, Walter Chiari, Monica Bellucci, Giuseppe Tornatore, and many others.\nAmong the most significant titles are: \"Casanova '70\"; \"Rosolino Patern\u00f2, soldato\"; \"Secondo Ponzio Pilato\"; \"The Most Beautiful Couple in the World\"; \"The Voyage\"; \"Marianne and Juliane\"; \"Kaos\"; \"The Star Maker\"; \"Sicilia!\"; \"Mal\u00e8na\"; \"Nati stanchi\"; \"Letters from Sicily\"; \"Inspector Montalbano\"; \"The Moon\u2019s Child\"; \"Caravaggio\"; \"Cyrano\"; \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\".\nThe history of the city has also been the subject or inspiration for various films, such as the silent film \"Damon and Pythias\", followed by the remake \"Damon and Pythias\" (1914 film), the peplum films \"Siege of Syracuse\", \"Damon and Pythias\", \"Hercules and the Tyrants of Babylon\" (the last film in which Reg Park played Hercules), the animated film \"\" (the last DreamWorks film with traditional animation), and the fifth and final chapter of the Indiana Jones series, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" by James Mangold.\nSyracuse hosts two annual film festivals with national and international circuits: the Ares International Film and Media Festival, in its seventh edition, and the Ortigia Film Festival, in its eighth edition, which have seen the participation of artists such as Margareth Mad\u00e8, Nino Frassica, Mario Venuti, Krzysztof Zanussi, and Pietro Marcello. These festivals have been joined by the \"Tonino Accolla Award,\" a contest in honor of the Syracusan voice actor (the Italian voice of Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey, Ben Stiller, Tim Curry, and many others).\nTheatre.\nSyracuse was one of the first cities in the world to develop the form of theatrical art. While Athens is typically associated with the birth of dramatic art, the origin of comic art is attributed to the \"polis\" of Syracuse, due to the words of Plato, who in the \"Theaetetus\" (Plato, \"Theaet.\", 152e) defines the Syracusan Epicharmus as \"\"the founder of comedy\" (or also \"the prince of comedy\"), comparing him to Homer \u2013 whom he calls \"the founder of tragedy\"\" \u2013, those of Alcimus in \"To Amyntas\", and due to its Greek theatre; one of the largest and most significant theatres of antiquity. Its stage hosted Aeschylus, Phormis, Antiphon, and other great names. The glory of the Greek theatre is relived through the classical performances organized annually by the INDA.\nIn the modern era, indoor theatre buildings emerged, such as the Syracuse municipal theatre (19th century) and the Vasquez Theatre. Within the Cappuccini Quarry, the Teatro di Verdura is located, where internationally renowned actors have performed. The city also is home to a puppet theatre, called the Syracuse Small Puppet Theatre, which stages the Sicilian tradition of the Opera dei Pupi.\nArt.\nThe history of art in Syracuse is extremely diverse. From the Greek era comes one of the most appreciated art forms of the ancient city: its coinage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The coins of Syracuse deserve to be considered among the most beautiful in the world.\nThese coins are now scattered around the globe, but a portion remains preserved in Syracuse. Modern philately has celebrated the Aretusean mint by issuing the series called \"Siracusana\", as has the Italian lira, which circulated the state banknote featuring the face of Arethusa.\nAs an ancient, prestigious cultural center, the \"polis\" attracted brilliant minds, fostering every type of art. When the city was conquered by the Romans, they were astonished by the cultural and artistic achievements of the Syracusan Greeks; scholars believe that the importation of Syracusan treasures marked the beginning of \"luxuria\" among the Romans.\nThe conquest of Syracuse was a pivotal moment in bringing Latin culture closer to Greek culture (initially opposed by the Romans). Marcus Claudius Marcellus plundered so many Syracusan artworks that, once brought to Rome and placed in a temple, they are said to have constituted the first museum of the city.\nBelieve me, the statues brought from Syracuse are harmful to this city.Infesta mihi credite signa ab Syracusis illata sunt hunc urbi.\u2014Cato the Elder in Livy, I, 34, 3.\nThe architectural composition of the city well reflects the history of the peoples who succeeded one another: the Normans, who made it an active center of Norman Romanesque art during the period of the County of Sicily; the Holy Roman Empire and subsequent medieval dynasties, with extensive Gothic-style construction. The modern era is characterized by a Flemish and Renaissance imprint under the Spanish domination, and after the devastating earthquake of 1693, much of the city was rebuilt in the elaborate Baroque style, which is why Syracuse, along with other cities of the Val di Noto, is considered a prime example of Sicilian Baroque, also hosting an international center for Baroque studies. Neoclassicism was introduced, as in the rest of Sicily, by French artists. The nineteenth century saw the succession of European styles, always with a local flavor, including neo-Gothic, eclecticism, and more. The Liberty style triumphed between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, particularly in Syracuse. Art Deco and other styles such as Futurism, Rationalism, Brutalism, and others characterized the twentieth century in Syracuse. The city also preserves ancient and precious works of pictorial art by important artists who lived in the city, influencing the local school; among the most notable paintings are the \"Burial of Saint Lucy\" by Caravaggio from 1608 and the \"Annunciation\" by Antonello da Messina from 1474.\nCuisine.\nThe earliest written records of Syracuse\u2019s cuisine date back to the Greek era. Thanks to its dominant role in the Mediterranean, the city was a pioneer in introducing Sicilian culinary habits abroad. The ancient Syracusan cuisine, due to its fame, attracted both criticism and praise: Archestratus in his treatise described it as excessively elaborate and heavy. Plato negatively judged the lavishness of Syracusan banquets and the practice of eating twice a day, which he considered a cause of debauchery. Aristophanes compared the Syracusan table to the banquets of the Sybarites (a \"polis\" known for its excessive dolce vita).\nThen, my friend, if you think this is the right way, you apparently do not approve of a Syracusan table and Sicilian variety of made dishes.\u03a3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03ad, \u1f66 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03b5, \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03a3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u1f44\u03c8\u03bf\u03c5, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f14\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u03b1\u1f30\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2\u2014Plato, \"The Republic\", 404d, in Francesco Rizzo, \"Political Dialogues and Letters\".\nOn the other hand, Syracusan cuisine was highly appreciated by the ancient Greeks: noble families called Sicilian cooks to their tables, and the city of Syracuse gave birth to Mithaecus, who wrote the first cookbook in the Western world (5th century BC), and to Labdacus, whom Greek cooks considered their master in the culinary arts.\nThe most exported beverage from Syracuse was wine: \"the ancient Syracusans prepared grapes \u2013 according to the precepts prescribed by Hesiod \u2013 and the way they produced Pollio wine is the same method commonly practiced today to make good muscat wines.\" A Greek-era legend claims that Pollio was an Argive king, the first ruler of Syracuse, who gave his name to this wine, often referred to as the oldest wine in Italy.\nWith the Roman domination, Syracusan wine, honey (specifically the Hyblaean honey), and wheat were exported to Rome on a large scale. Syracusan wine and oil could be found at the tables of Augustus. In subsequent centuries, Syracusan cuisine was influenced by the foreign cultures that dominated the rest of Sicily.\nToday, Syracusan cuisine is part of the established Mediterranean diet, declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nAmong its most famous foods are olives, fish, various PAT and IGP products such as the Siracusa lemon, Sicilian red orange, Syracuse new potato, Monti Iblei olive oil, Syracuse watermelon, and the strawberry of Cassibile.\nSyracusan culinary tradition includes several first and second courses, among the most typical being Syracusan fried pasta and spaghetti with tuna bottarga, Syracusan fish soup, \"tuna alla ghiotta\", and many other dishes originating from the area. In Syracuse, they prepare impanata (a closed pizza filled with potatoes derived from the Spanish empanada), the \"pizzolo\", and arancini with rag\u00f9 (which take the classic cylindrical shape). Some of the distinctive Syracusan desserts include \"tot\u00f2\" (chocolate biscuits covered with icing), giuggiulena, cucc\u00eca, quince cheese, almond granita (the Syracusan version is mentioned in Elio Vittorini\u2019s novel The Red Carnation), the local version of Sicilian cassata, prepared with sponge cake, and almond pastries.\nEvents.\nThroughout the year, Syracuse hosts numerous events of various kinds (artistic, cultural, sporting), with national and international appeal.\nHuman geography.\nThe city bears the marks of past Greek anthropization throughout its urban layout and beyond, as ancient Syracuse was one of the largest metropolises in the world. Much of Sicily was under its control, and the exact geo-anthropological boundaries of this capital are not precisely known.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is estimated that at the peak of its development and splendor, between the 5th and 6th centuries BC, Syracuse reached a population of one million inhabitants, well before other cities that later became significant in the Mediterranean, such as Rome and Alexandria in Egypt.\u2014\u200a\nSyracuse borders to the north with the municipalities of Melilli and Priolo Gargallo, to the south with the municipality of Avola, to the west with the municipalities of Canicattini Bagni, Solarino, Floridia, Noto, and Palazzolo Acreide, while to the east it is bathed by the Ionian Sea. The Syracuse municipality has two populous historical \"frazioni\": Belvedere, located to the northwest, and Cassibile, located to the southwest; the former has a population of about 7,000 inhabitants, while the latter has around 6,500 inhabitants. Among Sicilian municipal territories, Syracuse\u2019s is one of the largest, so much so that in 1827 it extended as far as what is now Solarino, then known as San Paolo Solarino, which in that same year obtained separation from Syracuse by Royal Decree, though this became effective only two years later with the creation of the new \"comunello\"; the same process was followed by the neighboring Floridia, also in the 19th century; until 1979, Priolo Gargallo was also a hamlet of Syracuse and during that period requested and obtained municipal autonomy, significantly reducing Syracuse\u2019s northern territorial extent, leaving only Targia, while the remaining area (including the northern coastline) was divided between the municipalities of Melilli and Priolo Gargallo. In addition to the two main inhabited centers, other settlements have emerged over the years, particularly along the southern coast: Carrozzieri, Isola, Plemmirio, Terrauzza, Fanusa, Milocca, Arenella, Ognina, and Fontane Bianche. Inland, there are the hamlets of Canalicchio, Tremilia, Tivoli, and Santa Lucia Village, as well as various rural districts and scattered \"localit\u00e0\".\nUntil 2018, the urban territory was divided into nine administrative districts, which were abolished as stipulated by regional law no. 11/2015: Ortygia, Santa Lucia, Acradina, Grotta Santa, Neapolis, Tiche, Epipolae, Belvedere, and Cassibile. The main rural districts of Syracuse are: Pantanelli, Santa Teresa Longarini, and Targia, while the neighborhoods include: the island of Ortygia, which is the original and oldest part of the city; on the mainland, the remaining historic center between the Umbertine zone and the Borgata, to which the modern city center, consisting of Corso Gelone and the neighborhood of the same name, has been added; between the lower and upper parts of Syracuse, Grotta Santa and Mazzarona; in the upper area, Tisia, Zecchino, Bosco Minniti, Tiche, Santa Panagia, Scala Greca, Villaggio Miano and Pizzuta.\nAs of 2017, the city had a total population of approximately 122,000 people (slightly down from the early 1990s, when it had 125,941, and slightly up from 2011, when it had 118,442). The majority of the urban population is concentrated in the former administrative districts of Tiche (20% of the total population), Akradina (19% of the total), and Grotta Santa (18% of the total). The remaining 43% of the municipal population is distributed fairly evenly across the other six former subdivisions, including Ortigia, where 4% of the population resides.\nEconomy.\nIn the Syracuse area, there is the leading lemon-producing district in Italy and the European Union, with the production of Siracusa lemon, which records increasingly significant sales figures. Other significant productions in the area include Sicilian cheeses, the Syracuse new potato, which accounts for three-quarters of Sicilian production and is exported both within Italy and abroad, the Monti Iblei extra virgin olive oil, the Syracuse watermelon, and other agricultural products. In terms of wine production, Syracuse produces DOC wines, which include Nero d'Avola and Moscato di Siracusa. In Syracuse\u2019s waters, aquaculture of mollusks and crustaceans takes place, as well as fishing for a wide variety of fish, primarily serving local commerce.\nA significant portion of the territory is dedicated to the industrial sector of petrochemicals. The Syracuse area is home to one of the largest petrochemical hubs in Europe, which, especially in the past, recorded remarkable figures for the provincial economy, though these have gradually declined.\nDespite the hub registering absolutely significant export data for Italy (it is estimated that over 70% of the national total of refined petroleum products comes from the Syracuse hub alone, and these also account for 70% of the entire Sicilian export), the sector is currently considered to be in crisis.\nThe alternative energy sector, particularly solar energy, is under development, with various experiments in the area. There is also a globally unique lead glass recycling plant. The tertiary sector of services provides the most employment for Syracuse residents. Tourism is also growing rapidly.\nInfrastructure and transport.\nRoads.\nThe municipal territory is served by the following roads:\nRailways.\nThe municipality is served by the Siracusa railway station, located at km 312+176 of the Messina-Syracuse railway and the Siracusa\u2013Gela\u2013Canicatt\u00ec railway. To the southwest is the Syracuse Locomotive Depot.\nPorts.\nThe city\u2019s two main ports are located in Ortygia: one to the west and one to the east of the island; respectively, the Small Port or \"Lakkios\" (the Greek Marble Port) and the Great Port, connected by a channel spanned by two bridges. Considered one of the first and oldest ports in the Mediterranean, the Syracuse port boasts a millennia-long commercial history, although today the Syracuse docks are mainly dedicated to boating (Great Port) and fishing (Small Port): approximately 300 berths in the Great Port and about 700 berths in the Small Port. The commercial function is primarily handled by the Santa Panagia roadstead, which accommodates oil tankers, chemical tankers, and gas carriers, serving Lukoil at the petrochemical complex via a long pier. Other minor ports in the municipality include: the Refuge Port (also located within the Santa Panagia bay), the small port of Ognina, and the small port of Fontane Bianche.\nAirports.\nSyracuse has a seaplane base in the city, established in the early 19th century, which was active during the peak of the seaplane transport era and later became the headquarters of Syracuse\u2019s military commands. Between September 2007 and spring 2008, it was reactivated through a connection to the Enna Seaplane Base. Six kilometers southwest of the city is the Rinaura Airfield, equipped with aircraft capable of recreational or air sports activities.\nUrban mobility.\nUrban and interurban transport in Syracuse is provided by regular bus services operated by the company SAIS Autolinee.\nThe municipality has the Rossana Maiorca cycle path, which runs through the northern side of the city: this cycle path was officially included in 2019 in the cycling route called Magna Grecia Cycle Route, which stretches from Pozzallo to Lagonegro (crossing three Italian regions).\nAdministration.\nBelow is a chronological list of the last three mayors of Syracuse:"}
{"id": "28442", "revid": "12919849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28442", "title": "Sorting algorithm", "text": "Algorithm that arranges lists in order\nIn computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\nFormally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\nAlthough some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\nHistory and concepts.\nFrom the beginning of computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research, perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple, familiar statement. Among the authors of early sorting algorithms around 1951 was Betty Holberton, who worked on ENIAC and UNIVAC. Bubble sort was analyzed as early as 1956. Asymptotically optimal algorithms have been known since the mid-20th century\u00a0\u2013 new algorithms are still being invented, with the widely used Timsort dating to 2002, and the library sort being first published in 2006.\nComparison sorting algorithms have a fundamental requirement of n log n - 1.4427n + O(log n) comparisons. Algorithms not based on comparisons, such as counting sort, can have better performance.\nSorting algorithms are prevalent in introductory computer science classes, where the abundance of algorithms for the problem provides a gentle introduction to a variety of core algorithm concepts, such as big O notation, divide-and-conquer algorithms, data structures such as heaps and binary trees, randomized algorithms, best, worst and average case analysis, time\u2013space tradeoffs, and upper and lower bounds.\nSorting small arrays optimally (in the fewest comparisons and swaps) or fast (i.e. taking into account machine-specific details) is still an open research problem, with solutions only known for very small arrays (&lt;20 elements). Similarly optimal (by various definitions) sorting on a parallel machine is an open research topic.\nClassification.\nSorting algorithms can be classified by:\nStability.\nStable sorting algorithms sort equal elements in the same order that they appear in the input. For example, in the card sorting example to the right, the cards are being sorted by their rank, and their suit is being ignored. This allows the possibility of multiple different correctly sorted versions of the original list. Stable sorting algorithms choose one of these, according to the following rule: if two items compare as equal (like the two 5 cards), then their relative order will be preserved, i.e. if one comes before the other in the input, it will come before the other in the output.\nStability is important to preserve order over multiple sorts on the same data set. For example, say that student records consisting of name and class section are sorted dynamically, first by name, then by class section. If a stable sorting algorithm is used in both cases, the sort-by-class-section operation will not change the name order; with an unstable sort, it could be that sorting by section shuffles the name order, resulting in a nonalphabetical list of students.\nMore formally, the data being sorted can be represented as a record or tuple of values, and the part of the data that is used for sorting is called the \"key\". In the card example, cards are represented as a record (rank, suit), and the key is the rank. A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key, and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.\nWhen equal elements are indistinguishable, such as with integers, or more generally, any data where the entire element is the key, stability is not an issue. Stability is also not an issue if all keys are different.\nUnstable sorting algorithms can be specially implemented to be stable. One way of doing this is to artificially extend the key comparison so that comparisons between two objects with otherwise equal keys are decided using the order of the entries in the original input list as a tie-breaker. Remembering this order, however, may require additional time and space.\nOne application for stable sorting algorithms is sorting a list using a primary and secondary key. For example, suppose we wish to sort a hand of cards such that the suits are in the order clubs (\u2663), diamonds (\u2666), hearts (\u2665), spades (\u2660), and within each suit, the cards are sorted by rank. This can be done by first sorting the cards by rank (using any sort), and then doing a stable sort by suit:\nWithin each suit, the stable sort preserves the ordering by rank that was already done. This idea can be extended to any number of keys and is utilised by radix sort. The same effect can be achieved with an unstable sort by using a lexicographic key comparison, which, e.g., compares first by suit, and then compares by rank if the suits are the same.\nComparison of algorithms.\nThis analysis assumes that the length of each key is constant and that all comparisons, swaps and other operations can proceed in constant time.\nLegend:\nComparison sorts.\nBelow is a table of comparison sorts. Mathematical analysis demonstrates a comparison sort cannot perform better than \"O\"(\"n\" log \"n\") on average.\nNon-comparison sorts.\nThe following table describes integer sorting algorithms and other sorting algorithms that are not comparison sorts. These algorithms are not limited to \"\u03a9\"(\"n\" log \"n\") unless meet unit-cost random-access machine model as described below.\nSamplesort can be used to parallelize any of the non-comparison sorts, by efficiently distributing data into several buckets and then passing down sorting to several processors, with no need to merge as buckets are already sorted between each other.\nOthers.\nSome algorithms are slow compared to those discussed above, such as the bogosort with unbounded run time and the stooge sort which has \"O\"(\"n\"2.7) run time. These sorts are usually described for educational purposes to demonstrate how the run time of algorithms is estimated. The following table describes some sorting algorithms that are impractical for real-life use in traditional software contexts due to extremely poor performance or specialized hardware requirements.\nTheoretical computer scientists have invented other sorting algorithms that provide better than \"O\"(\"n\" log \"n\") time complexity assuming certain constraints, including:\nPopular sorting algorithms.\nWhile there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms predominate. Insertion sort is widely used for small data sets, while for large data sets an asymptotically efficient sort is used, primarily heapsort, merge sort, or quicksort. Efficient implementations generally use a hybrid algorithm, combining an asymptotically efficient algorithm for the overall sort with insertion sort for small lists at the bottom of a recursion. Highly tuned implementations use more sophisticated variants, such as Timsort (merge sort, insertion sort, and additional logic), used in Android, Java, and Python, and introsort (quicksort and heapsort), used (in variant forms) in some C++ sort implementations and in .NET.\nFor more restricted data, such as numbers in a fixed interval, distribution sorts such as counting sort or radix sort are widely used. Bubble sort and variants are rarely used in practice, but are commonly found in teaching and theoretical discussions.\nWhen physically sorting objects (such as alphabetizing papers, tests or books) people intuitively generally use insertion sorts for small sets. For larger sets, people often first bucket, such as by initial letter, and multiple bucketing allows practical sorting of very large sets. Often space is relatively cheap, such as by spreading objects out on the floor or over a large area, but operations are expensive, particularly moving an object a large distance \u2013 locality of reference is important. Merge sorts are also practical for physical objects, particularly as two hands can be used, one for each list to merge, while other algorithms, such as heapsort or quicksort, are poorly suited for human use. Other algorithms, such as library sort, a variant of insertion sort that leaves spaces, are also practical for physical use.\nSimple sorts.\nTwo of the simplest sorts are insertion sort and selection sort, both of which are efficient on small data, due to low overhead, but not efficient on large data. Insertion sort is generally faster than selection sort in practice, due to fewer comparisons and good performance on almost-sorted data, and thus is preferred in practice, but selection sort uses fewer writes, and thus is used when write performance is a limiting factor.\nInsertion sort.\n\"Insertion sort\" is a simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly sorted lists, and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list similar to how one puts money in their wallet. In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array's space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one. Shellsort is a variant of insertion sort that is more efficient for larger lists.\nSelection sort.\n\"Selection sort\" is an in-place comparison sort. It has O(\"n\"2) complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and also has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations.\nThe algorithm finds the minimum value, swaps it with the value in the first position, and repeats these steps for the remainder of the list. It does no more than \"n\" swaps and thus is useful where swapping is very expensive.\nEfficient sorts.\nPractical general sorting algorithms are almost always based on an algorithm with average time complexity (and generally worst-case complexity) O(\"n\" log \"n\"), of which the most common are heapsort, merge sort, and quicksort. Each has advantages and drawbacks, with the most significant being that simple implementation of merge sort uses O(\"n\") additional space, and simple implementation of quicksort has O(\"n\"2) worst-case complexity. These problems can be solved or ameliorated at the cost of a more complex algorithm.\nWhile these algorithms are asymptotically efficient on random data, for practical efficiency on real-world data various modifications are used. First, the overhead of these algorithms becomes significant on smaller data, so often a hybrid algorithm is used, commonly switching to insertion sort once the data is small enough. Second, the algorithms often perform poorly on already sorted data or almost sorted data \u2013 these are common in real-world data and can be sorted in O(\"n\") time by appropriate algorithms. Finally, they may also be unstable, and stability is often a desirable property in a sort. Thus more sophisticated algorithms are often employed, such as Timsort (based on merge sort) or introsort (based on quicksort, falling back to heapsort).\nMerge sort.\n\"Merge sort\" takes advantage of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list. It starts by comparing every two elements (i.e., 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them if the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting lists of two into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on; until at last two lists are merged into the final sorted list. Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large lists, because its worst-case running time is O(\"n\" log \"n\"). It is also easily applied to lists, not only arrays, as it only requires sequential access, not random access. However, it has additional O(\"n\") space complexity and involves a large number of copies in simple implementations.\nMerge sort has seen a relatively recent surge in popularity for practical implementations, due to its use in the sophisticated algorithm Timsort, which is used for the standard sort routine in the programming languages Python and Java (as of JDK7). Merge sort itself is the standard routine in Perl, among others, and has been used in Java at least since 2000 in JDK1.3.\nHeapsort.\n\"Heapsort\" is a much more efficient version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log \"n\") time, instead of O(\"n\") for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(\"n\" log \"n\") time, and this is also the worst-case complexity.\nRecombinant sort.\nRecombinant sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm developed by Peeyush Kumar et al in 2020. The algorithm combines bucket sort, counting sort, radix sort, hashing, and dynamic programming techniques. It employs an n-dimensional Cartesian space mapping approach consisting of two primary phases: a Hashing cycle that maps elements to a multidimensional array using a special hash function, and an Extraction cycle that retrieves elements in sorted order. Recombinant Sort achieves O(n) time complexity for best, average, and worst cases, and can process both numerical and string data types, including mixed decimal and non-decimal numbers.\nQuicksort.\n\"Quicksort\" is a divide-and-conquer algorithm which relies on a \"partition\" operation: to partition an array, an element called a \"pivot\" is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place. The lesser and greater sublists are then recursively sorted. This yields an average time complexity of O(\"n\" log \"n\"), with low overhead, and thus this is a popular algorithm. Efficient implementations of quicksort (with in-place partitioning) are typically unstable sorts and somewhat complex but are among the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. Together with its modest O(log \"n\") space usage, quicksort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms and is available in many standard programming libraries.\nThe important caveat about quicksort is that its worst-case performance is O(\"n\"2); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most complex issue in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(\"n\"2) performance, but good choice of pivots yields O(\"n\" log \"n\") performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(\"n\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"n\"). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(\"n\") operation on unsorted lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(\"n\"\u00a0log\u00a0\"n\") performance.\nIf a guarantee of O(\"n\" log \"n\") performance is important, there is a simple modification to achieve that. The idea, due to Musser, is to set a limit on the maximum depth of recursion. If that limit is exceeded, then sorting is continued using the heapsort algorithm. Musser proposed that the limit should be formula_6, which is approximately twice the maximum recursion depth one would expect on average with a randomly ordered array.\nShellsort.\n\"Shellsort\" was invented by Donald Shell in 1959. It improves upon insertion sort by moving out of order elements more than one position at a time. The concept behind Shellsort is that insertion sort performs in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; time, where k is the greatest distance between two out-of-place elements. This means that generally, they perform in \"O\"(\"n\"2), but for data that is mostly sorted, with only a few elements out of place, they perform faster. So, by first sorting elements far away, and progressively shrinking the gap between the elements to sort, the final sort computes much faster. One implementation can be described as arranging the data sequence in a two-dimensional array and then sorting the columns of the array using insertion sort.\nThe worst-case time complexity of Shellsort is an open problem and depends on the gap sequence used, with known complexities ranging from \"O\"(\"n\"2) to \"O\"(\"n\"4/3) and \u0398(\"n\" log2 \"n\"). This, combined with the fact that Shellsort is in-place, only needs a relatively small amount of code, and does not require use of the call stack, makes it is useful in situations where memory is at a premium, such as in embedded systems and operating system kernels.\nBubble sort and variants.\nBubble sort, and variants such as the Comb sort and cocktail sort, are simple, highly inefficient sorting algorithms. They are frequently seen in introductory texts due to ease of analysis, but they are rarely used in practice.\nBubble sort.\n\"Bubble sort\" is a simple sorting algorithm. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. This algorithm's average time and worst-case performance is O(\"n\"2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be used to sort a small number of items (where its asymptotic inefficiency is not a high penalty). Bubble sort can also be used efficiently on a list of any length that is nearly sorted (that is, the elements are not significantly out of place). For example, if any number of elements are out of place by only one position (e.g. 0123546789 and 1032547698), bubble sort's exchange will get them in order on the first pass, the second pass will find all elements in order, so the sort will take only 2\"n\" time.\nComb sort.\n\"Comb sort\" is a relatively simple sorting algorithm based on bubble sort and originally designed by W\u0142odzimierz Dobosiewicz in 1980. It was later rediscovered and popularized by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box with a \"Byte\" Magazine article published in April 1991. The basic idea is to eliminate \"turtles\", or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously. (\"Rabbits\", large values around the beginning of the list, do not pose a problem in bubble sort) It accomplishes this by initially swapping elements that are a certain distance from one another in the array, rather than only swapping elements if they are adjacent to one another, and then shrinking the chosen distance until it is operating as a normal bubble sort. Thus, if Shellsort can be thought of as a generalized version of insertion sort that swaps elements spaced a certain distance away from one another, comb sort can be thought of as the same generalization applied to bubble sort.\nExchange sort.\n\"Exchange sort\" is sometimes confused with bubble sort, although the algorithms are in fact distinct. Exchange sort works by comparing the first element with all elements above it, swapping where needed, thereby guaranteeing that the first element is correct for the final sort order; it then proceeds to do the same for the second element, and so on. It lacks the advantage that bubble sort has of detecting in one pass if the list is already sorted, but it can be faster than bubble sort by a constant factor (one less pass over the data to be sorted; half as many total comparisons) in worst-case situations. Like any simple O(\"n\"2) sort it can be reasonably fast over very small data sets, though in general insertion sort will be faster.\nDistribution sorts.\n\"Distribution sort\" refers to any sorting algorithm where data is distributed from their input to multiple intermediate structures which are then gathered and placed on the output. For example, both bucket sort and flashsort are distribution-based sorting algorithms. Distribution sorting algorithms can be used on a single processor, or they can be a distributed algorithm, where individual subsets are separately sorted on different processors, then combined. This allows external sorting of data too large to fit into a single computer's memory.\nCounting sort.\nCounting sort is applicable when each input is known to belong to a particular set, \"S\", of possibilities. The algorithm runs in O(|\"S\"| + \"n\") time and O(|\"S\"|) memory where \"n\" is the length of the input. It works by creating an integer array of size |\"S\"| and using the \"i\"th bin to count the occurrences of the \"i\"th member of \"S\" in the input. Each input is then counted by incrementing the value of its corresponding bin. Afterward, the counting array is looped through to arrange all of the inputs in order. This sorting algorithm often cannot be used because \"S\" needs to be reasonably small for the algorithm to be efficient, but it is extremely fast and demonstrates great asymptotic behavior as \"n\" increases. It also can be modified to provide stable behavior.\nBucket sort.\nBucket sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that generalizes counting sort by partitioning an array into a finite number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.\nA bucket sort works best when the elements of the data set are evenly distributed across all buckets.\nRadix sort.\n\"Radix sort\" is an algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. \"n\" numbers consisting of \"k\" digits each are sorted in O(\"n\" \u00b7 \"k\") time. Radix sort can process digits of each number either starting from the least significant digit (LSD) or starting from the most significant digit (MSD). The LSD algorithm first sorts the list by the least significant digit while preserving their relative order using a stable sort. Then it sorts them by the next digit, and so on from the least significant to the most significant, ending up with a sorted list. While the LSD radix sort requires the use of a stable sort, the MSD radix sort algorithm does not (unless stable sorting is desired). In-place MSD radix sort is not stable. It is common for the counting sort algorithm to be used internally by the radix sort. A hybrid sorting approach, such as using insertion sort for small bins, improves performance of radix sort significantly.\nMemory usage patterns and index sorting.\nWhen the size of the array to be sorted approaches or exceeds the available primary memory, so that (much slower) disk or swap space must be employed, the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important, and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in RAM may become impractical. In this scenario, the total number of comparisons becomes (relatively) less important, and the number of times sections of memory must be copied or swapped to and from the disk can dominate the performance characteristics of an algorithm. Thus, the number of passes and the localization of comparisons can be more important than the raw number of comparisons, since comparisons of nearby elements to one another happen at system bus speed (or, with caching, even at CPU speed), which, compared to disk speed, is virtually instantaneous.\nFor example, the popular recursive quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate RAM, but due to the recursive way that it copies portions of the array it becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in RAM, because it may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk. In that scenario, another algorithm may be preferable even if it requires more total comparisons.\nOne way to work around this problem, which works well when complex records (such as in a relational database) are being sorted by a relatively small key field, is to create an index into the array and then sort the index, rather than the entire array. (A sorted version of the entire array can then be produced with one pass, reading from the index, but often even that is unnecessary, as having the sorted index is adequate.) Because the index is much smaller than the entire array, it may fit easily in memory where the entire array would not, effectively eliminating the disk-swapping problem. This procedure is sometimes called \"tag sort\".\nAnother technique for overcoming the memory-size problem is using external sorting, for example, one of the ways is to combine two algorithms in a way that takes advantage of the strength of each to improve overall performance. For instance, the array might be subdivided into chunks of a size that will fit in RAM, the contents of each chunk sorted using an efficient algorithm (such as quicksort), and the results merged using a \"k\"-way merge similar to that used in merge sort. This is faster than performing either merge sort or quicksort over the entire list.\nTechniques can also be combined. For sorting very large sets of data that vastly exceed system memory, even the index may need to be sorted using an algorithm or combination of algorithms designed to perform reasonably with virtual memory, i.e., to reduce the amount of swapping required.\nRelated algorithms.\nRelated problems include approximate sorting (sorting a sequence to within a certain amount of the correct order), partial sorting (sorting only the \"k\" smallest elements of a list, or finding the \"k\" smallest elements, but unordered) and selection (computing the \"k\"th smallest element). These can be solved inefficiently by a total sort, but more efficient algorithms exist, often derived by generalizing a sorting algorithm. The most notable example is quickselect, which is related to quicksort. Conversely, some sorting algorithms can be derived by repeated application of a selection algorithm; quicksort and quickselect can be seen as the same pivoting move, differing only in whether one recurses on both sides (quicksort, divide-and-conquer) or one side (quickselect, decrease-and-conquer).\nA kind of opposite of a sorting algorithm is a shuffling algorithm. These are fundamentally different because they require a source of random numbers. Shuffling can also be implemented by a sorting algorithm, namely by a random sort: assigning a random number to each element of the list and then sorting based on the random numbers. This is generally not done in practice, however, and there is a well-known simple and efficient algorithm for shuffling: the Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle.\nSorting algorithms are ineffective for finding an order in many situations. Usually, when elements have no reliable comparison function (crowdsourced preferences like voting systems), comparisons are very costly (sports), or when it would be impossible to pairwise compare all elements for all criteria (search engines). In these cases, the problem is usually referred to as \"ranking\" and the goal is to find the \"best\" result for some criteria according to probabilities inferred from comparisons or rankings. A common example is in chess, where players are ranked with the Elo rating system, and rankings are determined by a instead of a sorting algorithm.\nThere are sorting algorithms for a \"noisy\" (potentially incorrect) comparator and sorting algorithms for a pair of \"fast and dirty\" (i.e. \"noisy\") and \"clean\" comparators. This can be useful when the full comparison function is costly.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a population of 148,620 and a metropolitan area of 662,057, it is the fifth-most populated city and 13th-most populated municipality in the state of New York.\nFormally established in 1820, Syracuse was named after the classical Greek city of Syracuse (\"Siracusa\" in Italian), located on the eastern coast of the Italian island of Sicily, for its similar natural features. Adjacent brine springs made the city a major producer of commercial salt into the late 19th century, earning the nickname \"The Salt City\"; it subsequently became a major industrial center until the mid-20th century, and has since been a hub for higher education, research, and services.\nSyracuse has historically functioned as a major crossroads in the state, first between the Erie Canal and its branches, then of the New York Central Railroad network established in the mid 19th century. Today, the city is at the intersection of Interstates 81 and 90, and its airport is the largest in Central New York, a five-county region of over one million inhabitants.\nSyracuse is the economic and educational center of Central New York. It hosts a number of convention sites, including a large downtown convention complex, and is home to Destiny USA, the largest shopping mall in New York and the 10th largest in the country. Prominent academic and research institutions include Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical University, SUNY ESF, Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College.\nHistory.\nFrench missionaries were the first Europeans to come to this area, arriving to work with and convert the Native Americans in the mid-17th century. At the invitation of the Onondaga Nation, one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, a Jesuit priest by the name of Simon Le Moyne, accompanied by soldiers and \"coureurs des bois\", including Pierre Esprit Radisson, set up a mission, known as \"Ste. Marie de Gannentaha\", on the northeast shore of Onondaga Lake.\nJesuit missionaries reported salty brine springs around the southern end of what they referred to as \"Salt Lake\", known today as Onondaga Lake in honor of the historic tribe. French fur traders established trade throughout the New York area among the Iroquois. Dutch and English colonists also were traders, and the English nominally claimed the area, from their upstate base at Albany, New York. During the American Revolutionary War, the highly decentralized Iroquois divided into groups and bands that supported the British, and two tribes that supported the American-born rebels, or patriots.\nSettlers came into central and western New York from eastern parts of the state and New England after the American Revolutionary War and various treaties with and land sales by Native American tribes. The subsequent designation of this area by the state of New York as the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation provided the basis for commercial salt production. Such production took place from the late 1700s through the early 1900s. Brine from wells that tapped into halite (common salt) beds in the Salina shale near Tully, New York, 15 miles south of the city, was developed in the 19th century. It is the north-flowing brine from Tully that is the source of salt for the \"salty springs\" found along the shoreline of Onondaga Lake. The rapid development of this industry in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the nicknaming of this area as \"The Salt City\".\nThe original settlement of Syracuse was a conglomeration of several small towns and villages and was not recognized with a post office by the United States Government. Establishing the post office was delayed because the settlement did not have a name. Joshua Forman wanted to name the village Corinth. When John Wilkinson applied for a post office in that name in 1820, it was denied because the same name was already in use in Saratoga County, New York. Having read a poetic description of Syracuse, Sicily (Siracusa), Wilkinson saw similarities to the lake and salt springs of this area, which had both \"salt and freshwater mingling together\". On February 4, 1820, Wilkinson proposed the name \"Syracuse\" to a group of fellow townsmen; it became the name of the village and the new post office.\nThe first Solvay Process Company plant in the United States was erected on the southwestern shore of Onondaga Lake in 1884. The village was called Solvay to commemorate the inventor Ernest Solvay. In 1861, he developed the ammonia-soda process for the manufacture of soda ash (anhydrous sodium carbonate) from brine wells dug in the southern end of Tully valley (as a source of sodium chloride) and limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate). The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process. The Syracuse Solvay plant was the incubator for a large chemical industry complex owned by Allied Signal in Syracuse. While this industry stimulated development and provided many jobs in Syracuse, it left Onondaga Lake as the most polluted in the nation.\nThe salt industry declined after the Civil War, but a new manufacturing industry arose in its place. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, numerous businesses and stores were established, including the Franklin Automobile Company, which produced the first air-cooled engine in the world; the Century Motor Vehicle Company; the Smith Corona company; and the Craftsman Workshops, the center of Gustav Stickley's handmade furniture empire.\nOn March 24, 1870, Syracuse University was founded. The State of New York granted the new university its own charter, independent of Genesee College, which had unsuccessfully tried to move to Syracuse the year before. The university was founded as coeducational. President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, \"The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... There shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman... Brains and heart shall have a fair chance...\" Syracuse implemented this policy and attracted a high proportion of women students. In the College of Liberal Arts, the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.\nThe first New York State Fair was held in Syracuse in 1841. Between 1842 and 1889, the Fair was held among 11 New York cities before finding a permanent home in Syracuse. It has been an annual event since then, except between 1942 and 1947, when the grounds were used as a military base during World War II, and in 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs part of the racial incidents happening all over the country during the 1919 Red Summer, on July 31, 1919, there was a violent riot between white and black workers of the Syracuse Globe Malleable Iron Works.\nSyracuse is home to the only \"green on top\" traffic light. The \"green on top\" traffic light was installed in 1928 as a result of local youths throwing rocks at the \"British red\" light that was originally on top. These locals became known as \"stonethrowers\" and the neighborhood now has the Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial on the corner of Tompkins Street and Milton Avenue to commemorate this history.\nWorld War II stimulated significant industrial expansion in the area: of specialty steel, fasteners, and custom machining. After the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers (General Motors and Chrysler) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was also headquarters for Carrier Corporation, and Crouse-Hinds manufactured traffic signals in the city. General Electric, with its headquarters in Schenectady to the east, had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics Parkway in Syracuse.\nThe manufacturing industry in Syracuse began to falter in the 1970s, as the industry restructured nationwide. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed to the already increasing unemployment rate. Rockwell International moved its factory outside New York state. General Electric moved its television manufacturing operations to Suffolk, Virginia, and later offshore to Asia. The Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse, relocated its manufacturing operations out of state, and outsourced some of its production to Asian facilities. Although the city population has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has remained fairly stable, growing by 2.5% since 1970. While this growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far below the national average during that period.\nThe Syracuse Community Grid project is a 2023 highway teardown project taking place in Downtown Syracuse, with the goal of improving the city.\nGeography.\nSyracuse is located at (43.046899, \u221276.144423). It is located about east of Rochester, east of Buffalo, and west of the state capital, Albany. It is also the halfway point between New York City and Toronto, about from each, Toronto to the northwest and NYC to the southeast.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.15%) water.\nThe city developed at the northeast corner of the Finger Lakes region. The city has many neighborhoods that were originally independent villages, which joined the city over the years. Although the central part of Syracuse is flat, many of its neighborhoods are on small hills such as University Hill and Tipperary Hill. Land to the north of Syracuse is generally flat, while land to the south is hilly.\nAbout 27% of Syracuse's land area is covered by 890,000 trees\u00a0\u2014a higher percentage than in Albany, Rochester, or Buffalo. The Labor Day Storm of 1998 was a derecho that destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The sugar maple accounts for 14.2% of Syracuse's trees, followed by the Northern white cedar (9.8%) and the European buckthorn (6.8%). The most common street tree is the Norway maple (24.3%), followed by the honey locust (9.3%).\nThe densest tree cover in Syracuse is in the two Valley neighborhoods, where 46.6% of the land is covered by trees. The lowest tree cover percentage is found in the densely developed downtown, which has only 4.6% trees.\nSyracuse's main water source is Skaneateles Lake, one of the country's cleanest lakes, located southwest of the city. Water from nearby Onondaga Lake is not potable due to industrial dumping that spanned many decades, leaving the lake heavily polluted. Incoming water is left unfiltered, and chlorine is added to prevent bacterial growth. Most of the environmental work to achieve lake cleanup was scheduled to be completed by 2016; however Honeywell, the company tasked with the cleanup, announced the project's completion in late 2017. For periods of drought, there is also a backup line which uses water from Lake Ontario.\nOnondaga Creek, a waterway that runs through downtown, flows northward through the city. The Onondaga Creekwalk borders this, connecting the Lakefront, Inner Harbor, Franklin Square and Armory Square neighborhoods. The creek continues through the Valley and ultimately to the Onondaga Nation. The creek is navigable, but it can be a challenge. Its channelized nature speeds up its flow, particularly in the spring, when it may be dangerous. After some youngsters drowned in the creek, some residential areas fenced-off the creek in their neighborhoods.\nNeighborhoods.\nThe City of Syracuse officially recognizes 26 neighborhoods within its boundaries. Some of these have small additional neighborhoods and districts inside of them. In addition, Syracuse also owns and operates Syracuse Hancock International Airport on the territory of four towns north of the city.\nSyracuse's neighborhoods reflect the historically ethnic and multicultural population. Traditionally, Irish, Polish and Ukrainian Americans settled on its west side (see Tipperary Hill); Jewish Americans on its east side; German and Italian Americans on the north side; and African-Americans on its south side. In recent years, large numbers of refugees from the Middle East have settled mainly on the north side as well.\nClimate.\nSyracuse has a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\"), as mean July temperatures are just above the threshold needed for a hot-summer climate. The city is known for its high snowfall, on average; Syracuse receives the most annual average snow of any metropolitan area in the United States. Syracuse usually wins the Golden Snowball Award among Upstate cities. Its record seasonal (July 1 to June 30 of the following year) snowfall so far is during the winter of 1992\u201393, while the snowiest calendar month was January 2004, with accumulated. The high snowfall is a result of the city receiving both heavy snow from the lake effect of nearby Lake Ontario (of the Great Lakes) and nor'easter snow from storms driven from the Atlantic Ocean. Snow most often falls in small (about ), almost daily doses, over a period of several days. Larger snowfalls do occur occasionally, and even more so in the northern suburbs.\nThe Blizzard of 1993 was described as the Storm of the Century. Some fell on the city within 48 hours, with falling within the first 24 hours. Syracuse received more snow than any other city in the country during this storm, which shattered a total of eight local records, including the most snow in a single snowstorm. A second notable snowfall was the Blizzard of 1966, with . The Blizzard of '58 occurred in February (16\u201317th) across Oswego and Onondaga counties.

In Summer 2014, 10 cameras were approved for installation in Downtown Syracuse, the first area not targeted because of high levels of violent crime. Live monitoring of Clinton Square for suspicious people during events and festivals was planned, although police agreed to a prohibition on the use of cameras to monitor protests. Twenty-five additional cameras were planned to be installed in 2016.\nIn spring 2017, the surveillance system was augmented with the installation of ShotSpotter gunshot detection sensors. Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner cited increasing public acceptance of police cameras and lower technology costs as factors in the decision.\nFire department.\nThe Syracuse Fire Department (SFD) has the responsibility of protecting the City of Syracuse from fires and other dangers.

Each pause in breathing can last for a few seconds to a few minutes and often occurs many times a night. A choking or snorting sound may occur as breathing resumes. Common symptoms include daytime sleepiness, snoring, and non-restorative sleep despite adequate sleep time. Because the disorder disrupts normal sleep, those affected may experience sleepiness or feel tired during the day. It is often a chronic condition.\nSleep apnea may be categorized as \"obstructive sleep apnea\" (OSA), in which breathing is interrupted by a blockage of air flow, \"central sleep apnea\" (CSA), in which regular unconscious breath simply stops, or a combination of the two. OSA is the most common form. OSA has four key contributors; these include a narrow, crowded, or collapsible upper airway, an ineffective pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleep, airway narrowing during sleep, and unstable control of breathing (high loop gain). In CSA, the basic neurological controls for breathing rate malfunction and fail to give the signal to inhale, causing the individual to miss one or more cycles of breathing. If the pause in breathing is long enough, the percentage of oxygen in the circulation can drop to a lower than normal level (hypoxemia) and the concentration of carbon dioxide can build to a higher than normal level (hypercapnia). In turn, these conditions of hypoxia and hypercapnia will trigger \"additional\" effects on the body such as Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration.\nSome people with sleep apnea are unaware they have the condition. In many cases it is first observed by a family member. An in-lab sleep study overnight is the preferred method for diagnosing sleep apnea. In the case of OSA, the outcome that determines disease severity and guides the treatment plan is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). This measurement is calculated from totaling all pauses in breathing and periods of shallow breathing lasting greater than 10 seconds and dividing the sum by total hours of recorded sleep. In contrast, for CSA the degree of respiratory effort, measured by esophageal pressure or displacement of the thoracic or abdominal cavity, is an important distinguishing factor between OSA and CSA.\nA systemic disorder, sleep apnea is associated with a wide array of effects, including increased risk of car accidents, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, insulin resistance, higher incidence of cancer, and neurodegeneration. Further research is being conducted on the potential of using biomarkers to understand which chronic diseases are associated with sleep apnea on an individual basis.\nTreatment may include lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, breathing devices, and surgery. Effective lifestyle changes may include avoiding alcohol, losing weight, smoking cessation, and sleeping on one's side. Breathing devices include the use of a CPAP machine. With proper use, CPAP improves outcomes. Evidence suggests that CPAP may improve sensitivity to insulin, blood pressure, and sleepiness. Long term compliance, however, is an issue with more than half of people not appropriately using the device. In 2017, only 15% of potential patients in developed countries used CPAP machines, while in developing countries well under 1% of potential patients used CPAP. Without treatment, sleep apnea may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, obesity, and motor vehicle collisions.\nOSA is a common sleep disorder. A large analysis in 2019 of the estimated prevalence of OSA found that OSA affects 936 million\u20141 billion people between the ages of 30\u201369 globally, or roughly every 1 in 10 people, and up to 30% of the elderly. Sleep apnea is somewhat more common in men than women, roughly a 2:1 ratio of men to women, and in general more people are likely to have it with older age and obesity. Other risk factors include being overweight, a family history of the condition, allergies, and enlarged tonsils.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe typical screening process for sleep apnea involves asking patients about common symptoms such as snoring, witnessed pauses in breathing during sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. There is a wide range in presenting symptoms in patients with sleep apnea, from being asymptomatic to falling asleep while driving. Due to this wide range in clinical presentation, some people are not aware that they have sleep apnea and are either misdiagnosed or ignore the symptoms altogether. A current area requiring further study involves identifying different subtypes of sleep apnea based on patients who tend to present with different clusters or groupings of particular symptoms.\nOSA may increase risk for driving accidents and work-related accidents due to sleep fragmentation from repeated arousals during sleep. If OSA is not treated it results in excessive daytime sleepiness and oxidative stress from the repeated drops in oxygen saturation, people are at increased risk of other systemic health problems, such as diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Subtle manifestations of sleep apnea may include treatment refractory hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias and over time as the disease progresses, more obvious symptoms may become apparent. Due to the disruption in daytime cognitive state, behavioral effects may be present. These can include moodiness, belligerence, as well as a decrease in attentiveness and energy. These effects may become intractable, leading to depression.\nRisk factors.\nObstructive sleep apnea can affect people regardless of sex, race, or age. However, risk factors include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCentral sleep apnea is more often associated with any of the following risk factors:\nMechanism.\nObstructive sleep apnea\nThe causes of obstructive sleep apnea are complex and individualized, but typical risk factors include narrow pharyngeal anatomy and craniofacial structure. When anatomical risk factors are combined with non-anatomical contributors such as an ineffective pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleep, unstable control of breathing (high loop gain), and premature awakening to mild airway narrowing, the severity of the OSA rapidly increases as more factors are present. When breathing is paused due to upper airway obstruction, carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream. Chemoreceptors in the bloodstream note the high carbon dioxide levels. The brain is signaled to awaken the person, which clears the airway and allows breathing to resume. Breathing normally will restore oxygen levels and the person will fall asleep again. This carbon dioxide build-up may be due to the decrease of output of the brainstem regulating the chest wall or pharyngeal muscles, which causes the pharynx to collapse. As a result, people with sleep apnea experience reduced or no slow-wave sleep and spend less time in REM sleep.\nCentral sleep apnea\nThere are two main mechanism that drive the disease process of CSA, sleep-related hypoventilation and post-hyperventilation hypocapnia. The most common cause of CSA is post-hyperventilation hypocapnia secondary to heart failure. This occurs because of brief failures of the ventilatory control system but normal alveolar ventilation. In contrast, sleep-related hypoventilation occurs when there is a malfunction of the brain's drive to breathe. The underlying cause of the loss of the wakefulness drive to breathe encompasses a broad set of diseases from strokes to severe kyphoscoliosis.\nComplications.\nOSA is a serious medical condition with systemic effects; patients with untreated OSA have a greater mortality risk from cardiovascular disease than those undergoing appropriate treatment. Other complications include hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Daytime fatigue and sleepiness, a common symptom of sleep apnea, is also an important public health concern regarding transportation crashes caused by drowsiness. OSA may also be a risk factor of COVID-19. People with OSA have a higher risk of developing severe complications of COVID-19. \nAlzheimer's disease and severe obstructive sleep apnea are connected because there is an increase in the protein beta-amyloid as well as white-matter damage. These are the main indicators of Alzheimer's, which in this case comes from the lack of proper rest or poorer sleep efficiency resulting in neurodegeneration. Having sleep apnea in mid-life brings a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's in older age, and if one has Alzheimer's then one is also more likely to have sleep apnea. This is demonstrated by cases of sleep apnea even being misdiagnosed as dementia. With the use of treatment through CPAP, there is a reversible risk factor in terms of the amyloid proteins. This usually restores brain structure and cognitive impairment. Evidence continues to be found supporting there is an association between BMI and Alzheimer's. There is also evidence of increased risk of developing Alzheimer's for those with a higher BMI in women ages 70 and above. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was not found to significantly improve cognitive performance, it was found to benefit other symptoms like depression, anxiety, etc.\nDiagnosis.\nClassification.\nThere are three types of sleep apnea. OSA accounts for 84%, CSA for 0.9%, and 15% of cases are mixed.\nObstructive sleep apnea.\nIn a systematic review of published evidence, the United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2017 concluded that there was uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical utility of all potential screening tools for OSA, and recommended that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults.\nThe diagnosis of OSA syndrome is made when the patient shows recurrent episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep resulting in apneas or hypopneas, respectively. Criteria defining an apnea or a hypopnea vary. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) defines an apnea as a reduction in airflow of \u2265\u200990% lasting at least 10 seconds. A hypopnea is defined as a reduction in airflow of \u2265\u200930% lasting at least 10 seconds and associated with a \u2265\u20094% decrease in pulse oxygenation, or as a \u2265\u200930% reduction in airflow lasting at least 10 seconds and associated either with a \u2265\u20093% decrease in pulse oxygenation or with an arousal.\nTo define the severity of the condition, the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) or the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) are used. While the AHI measures the mean number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, the RDI adds to this measure the respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs). The OSA syndrome is thus diagnosed if the AHI is &gt;\u20095 episodes per hour and results in daytime sleepiness and fatigue or when the RDI is \u2265\u200915 independently of the symptoms. According to the American Association of Sleep Medicine, daytime sleepiness is determined as mild, moderate and severe depending on its impact on social life. Daytime sleepiness can be assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a self-reported questionnaire on the propensity to fall asleep or doze off during daytime. Screening tools for OSA comprise the STOP questionnaire, the Berlin questionnaire and the STOP-BANG questionnaire which has been reported as being a powerful tool to detect OSA.\nCriteria.\nAccording to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, there are 4 types of criteria. The first one concerns sleep \u2013 excessive sleepiness, non-restorative sleep, fatigue or insomnia symptoms. The second and third criteria are about respiration \u2013 waking with breath holding, gasping, or choking; snoring, breathing interruptions or both during sleep. The last criterion revolved around medical issues as hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, mood disorder or cognitive impairment. Two levels of severity are distinguished, the first one is determined by a polysomnography or home sleep apnea test demonstrating 5 or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep and the higher levels are determined by 15 or more events. If the events are present less than 5 times per hour, no obstructive sleep apnea is diagnosed.\nA considerable night-to-night variability further complicates diagnosis of OSA. In unclear cases, multiple nights of testing might be required to achieve an accurate diagnosis. Since sequential nights of testing would be impractical and cost prohibitive in the sleep lab, home sleep testing for multiple nights can not only be more useful, but more reflective of what is typically happening each night.\nPolysomnography.\nNighttime in-laboratory Level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard test for diagnosis. Patients are monitored with EEG leads, pulse oximetry, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, respiratory impedance plethysmography or similar resistance belts around the chest and abdomen to detect motion, an ECG lead, and EMG sensors to detect muscle contraction in the chin, chest, and legs. A hypopnea can be based on one of two criteria. It can either be a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 4% oxygen desaturation or a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal from sleep on EEG.\nAn \"event\" can be either an apnea, characterized by complete cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds, or a hypopnea in which airflow decreases by 50 percent for 10 seconds or decreases by 30 percent if there is an associated decrease in the oxygen saturation or an arousal from sleep. To grade the severity of sleep apnea, the number of events per hour is reported as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). An AHI of less than 5 is considered normal. An AHI of 5\u201315 is mild; 15\u201330 is moderate, and more than 30 events per hour characterizes severe sleep apnea.\nCentral sleep apnea.\nThe diagnosis of CSA syndrome is made when the presence of at least 5 central apnea events occur per hour. There are multiple mechanisms that drive the apnea events. In individuals with heart failure with Cheyne-Stokes respiration, the brain's respiratory control centers are imbalanced during sleep. This results in ventilatory instability, caused by chemoreceptors that are hyperresponsive to CO2 fluctuations in the blood, resulting in high respiratory drive that leads to apnea. Another common mechanism that causes CSA is the loss of the brain's wakefulness drive to breathe.\nCSA is organized into 6 individual syndromes: Cheyne-Stokes respiration, Complex sleep apnea, Primary CSA, High altitude periodic breathing, CSA from medication, CSA from comorbidity. Like in OSA, nocturnal polysomnography is the mainstay of diagnosis for CSA. The degree of respiratory effort, measured by esophageal pressure or displacement of the thoracic or abdominal cavity, is an important distinguishing factor between OSA and CSA.\nMixed apnea.\nSome people with sleep apnea have a combination of both types; its prevalence ranges from 0.56% to 18%. The condition, also called treatment-emergent central apnea, is generally detected when obstructive sleep apnea is treated with CPAP and central sleep apnea emerges. The exact mechanism of the loss of central respiratory drive during sleep in OSA is unknown but is most likely related to incorrect settings of the CPAP treatment and other medical conditions the person has.\nManagement.\nThe treatment of obstructive sleep apnea is different than that of central sleep apnea. Treatment often starts with behavioral therapy and some people may be suggested to try a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. Many people are told to avoid alcohol, sleeping pills, and other sedatives, which can relax throat muscles, contributing to the collapse of the airway at night. The evidence supporting one treatment option compared to another for a particular person is not clear.\nChanging sleep position.\nMore than half of people with obstructive sleep apnea have some degree of positional obstructive sleep apnea, meaning that it gets worse when they sleep on their backs. Sleeping on their sides is an effective and cost-effective treatment for positional obstructive sleep apnea.\nContinuous positive airway pressure.\nFor moderate to severe sleep apnea, the most common treatment is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) device. These splint the person's airway open during sleep by means of pressurized air. The person typically wears a plastic facial mask, which is connected by a flexible tube to a small bedside CPAP machine.\nAlthough CPAP therapy is effective in reducing apneas and less expensive than other treatments, some people find it uncomfortable. Some complain of feeling trapped, having chest discomfort, and skin or nose irritation. Other side effects may include dry mouth, dry nose, nosebleeds, sore lips and gums.\nWhether or not it decreases the risk of death or heart disease is controversial with some reviews finding benefit and others not. This variation across studies might be driven by low rates of compliance\u2014analyses of those who use CPAP for at least four hours a night suggests a decrease in cardiovascular events.\nWeight loss.\nExcess body weight is thought to be an important cause of sleep apnea. People who are overweight have more tissues in the back of their throat which can restrict the airway, especially when sleeping. In weight loss studies of overweight individuals, those who lose weight show reduced apnea frequencies and improved apnoea\u2013hypopnoea index (AHI). Weight loss effective enough to relieve obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) must be 25\u201330% of body weight. For some obese people, it can be difficult to achieve and maintain this result without bariatric surgery.\nRapid palatal expansion.\nIn children, orthodontic treatment to expand the volume of the nasal airway, such as nonsurgical rapid palatal expansion is common. The procedure has been found to significantly decrease the AHI and lead to long-term resolution of clinical symptoms.\nSince the palatal suture is fused in adults, regular RPE using tooth-borne expanders cannot be performed. Mini-implant assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) has been recently developed as a non-surgical option for the transverse expansion of the maxilla in adults. This method increases the volume of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, leading to increased airflow and reduced respiratory arousals during sleep. Changes are permanent with minimal complications.\nSurgery.\nSeveral surgical procedures (sleep surgery) are used to treat sleep apnea, although they are normally a third line of treatment for those who reject or are not helped by CPAP treatment or dental appliances. Surgical treatment for obstructive sleep apnea needs to be individualized to address all anatomical areas of obstruction.\nNasal obstruction.\nOften, correction of the nasal passages needs to be performed in addition to correction of the oropharynx passage. Septoplasty and turbinate surgery may improve the nasal airway, but has been found to be ineffective at reducing respiratory arousals during sleep.\nPharyngeal obstruction.\nTonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP or UP3) are available to address pharyngeal obstruction.\nThe \"Pillar\" device is a treatment for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea; it is thin, narrow strips of polyester. Three strips are inserted into the roof of the mouth (the soft palate) using a modified syringe and local anesthetic, in order to stiffen the soft palate. This procedure addresses one of the most common causes of snoring and sleep apnea\u00a0\u2014 vibration or collapse of the soft palate. It was approved by the FDA for snoring in 2002 and for obstructive sleep apnea in 2004. A 2013 meta-analysis found that \"the Pillar implant has a moderate effect on snoring and mild-to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea\" and that more studies with high level of evidence were needed to arrive at a definite conclusion; it also found that the polyester strips work their way out of the soft palate in about 10% of the people in whom they are implanted.\nHypopharyngeal or base of tongue obstruction.\nBase-of-tongue advancement by means of advancing the genial tubercle of the mandible, tongue suspension, or hyoid suspension (aka hyoid myotomy and suspension or hyoid advancement) may help with the lower pharynx.\nOther surgery options may attempt to shrink or stiffen excess tissue in the mouth or throat, procedures done at either a doctor's office or a hospital. Small shots or other treatments, sometimes in a series, are used for shrinkage, while the insertion of a small piece of stiff plastic is used in the case of surgery whose goal is to stiffen tissues.\nMulti-level surgery.\nMaxillomandibular advancement is considered the most effective surgery for people with sleep apnea, because it increases the posterior airway space. However, health professionals are often unsure as to who should be referred for surgery and when to do so: some factors in referral may include failed use of CPAP or device use; anatomy which favors rather than impedes surgery; or significant craniofacial abnormalities which hinder device use.\nPotential complications.\nSeveral inpatient and outpatient procedures use sedation. Many drugs and agents used during surgery to relieve pain and to depress consciousness remain in the body at low amounts for hours or even days afterwards. In an individual with either central, obstructive or mixed sleep apnea, these low doses may be enough to cause life-threatening irregularities in breathing or collapses in a patient's airways. Use of analgesics and sedatives in these patients postoperatively should therefore be minimized or avoided.\nSurgery on the mouth and throat, as well as dental surgery and procedures, can result in postoperative swelling of the lining of the mouth and other areas that affect the airway. Even when the surgical procedure is designed to improve the airway, such as tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy or tongue reduction, swelling may negate some of the effects in the immediate postoperative period. Once the swelling resolves and the palate becomes tightened by postoperative scarring, however, the full benefit of the surgery may be noticed.\nA person with sleep apnea undergoing any medical treatment must make sure their doctor and anesthetist are informed about the sleep apnea. Alternative and emergency procedures may be necessary to maintain the airway of sleep apnea patients.\nOther.\nNeurostimulation.\nDiaphragm pacing, which involves the rhythmic application of electrical impulses to the diaphragm, has been used to treat central sleep apnea.\nIn April 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted pre-market approval for use of an upper airway stimulation system in people who cannot use a continuous positive airway pressure device. The Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation system is a hypoglossal nerve stimulation implant that senses respiration and applies mild electrical stimulation during inspiration, which pushes the tongue slightly forward to open the airway.\nMedications.\nThere is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any medication for OSA. This may result in part because people with sleep apnea have tended to be treated as a single group in clinical trials. Identifying specific physiological factors underlying sleep apnea makes it possible to test drugs specific to those causal factors: airway narrowing, impaired muscle activity, low arousal threshold for waking, and unstable breathing control. Those who experience low waking thresholds may benefit from eszopiclone, a sedative typically used to treat insomnia. The antidepressant desipramine may stimulate upper airway muscles and lessen pharyngeal collapsibility in people who have limited muscle function in their airways.\nThere is limited evidence for medication, but 2012 AASM guidelines suggested that acetazolamide \"may be considered\" for the treatment of central sleep apnea; zolpidem and triazolam may also be considered for the treatment of central sleep apnea, but \"only if the patient does not have underlying risk factors for respiratory depression\". Low doses of oxygen are also used as a treatment for hypoxia but are discouraged due to side effects.\nIn December 2024, the FDA approved tirzepatide, an anti-diabetic and weight loss medication, as a component in the combination treatment of adults with obesity suffering from moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. Other components of the therapy are a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.\nOral appliances.\nAn oral appliance, often referred to as a mandibular advancement splint, is a custom-made mouthpiece that shifts the lower jaw forward and opens the bite slightly, opening up the airway. These devices can be fabricated by a general dentist. Oral appliance therapy is usually successful in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. While CPAP is more effective for sleep apnea than oral appliances, oral appliances improve sleepiness and quality of life and are often better tolerated than CPAP.\nNasal EPAP.\nNasal EPAP is a bandage-like device placed over the nostrils that uses a person's own breathing to create positive airway pressure to prevent obstructed breathing.\nOral pressure therapy.\nOral pressure therapy uses a device that creates a vacuum in the mouth, pulling the soft palate tissue forward. It has been found useful in about 25% to 37% of people.\nPrognosis.\nDeath could occur from untreated OSA due to lack of oxygen to the body.\nThere is increasing evidence that sleep apnea may lead to liver function impairment, particularly fatty liver diseases (see steatosis).\nIt has been revealed that people with OSA show tissue loss in brain regions that help store memory, thus linking OSA with memory loss. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the scientists discovered that people with sleep apnea have mammillary bodies that are about 20% smaller, particularly on the left side. One of the key investigators hypothesized that repeated drops in oxygen lead to the brain injury.\nThe immediate effects of central sleep apnea on the body depend on how long the failure to breathe endures. At worst, central sleep apnea may cause sudden death. Short of death, drops in blood oxygen may trigger seizures, even in the absence of epilepsy. In people \"with\" epilepsy, the hypoxia caused by apnea may trigger seizures that had previously been well controlled by medications. In other words, a seizure disorder may become unstable in the presence of sleep apnea. In adults with coronary artery disease, a severe drop in blood oxygen level can cause angina, arrhythmias, or heart attacks (myocardial infarction). Longstanding recurrent episodes of apnea, over months and years, may cause an increase in carbon dioxide levels that can change the pH of the blood enough to cause a respiratory acidosis.\nEpidemiology.\nThe Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study estimated in 1993 that roughly one in every 15 Americans was affected by at least moderate sleep apnea. It also estimated that in middle-age as many as 9% of women and 24% of men were affected, undiagnosed and untreated.\nThe costs of untreated sleep apnea reach further than just health issues. It is estimated that in the U.S., the average untreated sleep apnea patient's annual health care costs $1,336 more than an individual without sleep apnea. This may cause $3.4 billion/year in additional medical costs. Whether medical cost savings occur with treatment of sleep apnea remains to be determined.\nFrequency and population.\nSleep disorders including sleep apnea have become an important health issue in the United States. Twenty-two million Americans have been estimated to have sleep apnea, with 80% of moderate and severe OSA cases undiagnosed.\nOSA can occur at any age, but it happens more frequently in men who are over 40 and overweight.\nHistory.\nA type of CSA was described in the German myth of Ondine's curse where the person when asleep would forget to breathe. The clinical picture of this condition has long been recognized as a character trait, without an understanding of the disease process. The term \"Pickwickian syndrome\" that is sometimes used for the syndrome was coined by the famous early 20th-century physician William Osler, who must have been a reader of Charles Dickens. The description of Joe, \"the fat boy\" in Dickens's novel \"The Pickwick Papers\", is an accurate clinical picture of an adult with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\nThe early reports of obstructive sleep apnea in the medical literature described individuals who were severely affected, often presenting with severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia and congestive heart failure.\nTreatment.\nThe management of obstructive sleep apnea was improved with the introduction of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines, first described in 1981 by Colin Sullivan and associates in Sydney, Australia. The first models were bulky and noisy, but the design was rapidly improved and by the late 1980s, CPAP was widely adopted. The availability of an effective treatment stimulated an aggressive search for affected individuals and led to the establishment of hundreds of specialized clinics dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Though many types of sleep problems are recognized, the vast majority of patients attending these centers have sleep-disordered breathing. Sleep apnea awareness day is 18 April in recognition of Colin Sullivan.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The goal of this first endeavour was to gain control of a key Cape sea route, not to establish a permanent settler colony. Full control of the colony was wrested from the Batavian Republic following the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806. The first major influx of English speakers arrived in 1820. About 5,000 British settlers, mostly rural or working class, settled in the Eastern Cape. Though the British were a minority colonist group (the Dutch had been in the region since 1652 when traders from the Dutch East India Company developed an outpost), the Cape Colony governor, Lord Charles Somerset, declared English an official language in 1822. To spread the influence of English in the colony, officials began to recruit British schoolmasters and Scottish clergy to occupy positions in the education and church systems. Another group of English speakers arrived from Britain in the 1840s and 1850s, along with the Natal settlers. These individuals were largely \"standard speakers\" like retired military personnel and aristocrats. A third wave of English settlers arrived between 1875 and 1904, and brought with them a diverse variety of English dialects. These last two waves did not have as large an influence on South African English (SAE), for \"the seeds of development were already sown in 1820\". However, the Natal wave brought nostalgia for British customs and helped to define the idea of a \"standard\" variety that resembled Southern British English.\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, English and Dutch were the official state languages, although Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch in 1925. After 1994, these two languages along with nine other Southern Bantu languages achieved equal official status.\nSAE is an extraterritorial (ET) variety of English, or a language variety that has been transported outside its mainland home. More specifically, SAE is a Southern hemisphere ET originating from later English colonisation in the 18th and 19th centuries (Zimbabwean, Australian, and New Zealand English are also Southern hemisphere ET varieties). SAE resembles British English more closely than it does American English due to the close ties that South African colonies maintained with the mainland in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, the influence of American pop culture around the world made American English more familiar in South Africa, with some American lexical items becoming alternatives to comparable British terms.\nWhite South African English.\nSeveral white South African English varieties have emerged, accompanied by varying levels of perceived social prestige. Roger Lass describes white South African English as a system of three sub-varieties spoken primarily by White South Africans, called \"The Great Trichotomy\" (a term first used to categorise Australian English varieties and subsequently applied to South African English). In this classification, the \"Cultivated\" variety closely approximates England's standard Received Pronunciation and is associated with the upper class; the \"General\" variety is a social indicator of the middle class and is the common tongue; and the \"Broad\" variety is most associated with the working class, low socioeconomic status, and little education. These three sub-varieties, Cultivated, General, and Broad, have also sometimes been called \"Conservative SAE\", \"Respectable SAE\", and \"Extreme SAE\", respectively. Broad White SAE closely approximates the second-language variety of (Afrikaans-speaking) Afrikaners called Afrikaans English. This variety has been stigmatised by middle- and upper-class SAE speakers (primarily those of British origin) and is considered a vernacular form of SAE.\nBlack South African English.\nBlack South African English, or BSAE, is spoken by individuals whose first language is an indigenous African tongue. BSAE is considered a \"new\" English because it has emerged through the education system among second-language speakers in places where English is not the majority language. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \"acrolect\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \"mesolect\". The \"basilect\" variety is less similar to the colonial language (natively-spoken English), while the \"mesolect\" is somewhat more so. Historically, BSAE has been considered a \"non-standard\" variety of English, inappropriate for formal contexts and influenced by indigenous African languages.\nAccording to the Central Statistical Services, as of 1994[ [update]] about seven million black people spoke English in South Africa. BSAE originated in the South African school system when the 1953 Bantu Education Act mandated the use of native African languages in the classroom. When this law was established, most of the native English-speaking teachers were removed from schools. This limited the exposure that black students received to standard varieties of English. As a result, the English spoken in black schools developed distinctive patterns of pronunciation and syntax, leading to the formation of BSAE. Some of these characteristic features can be linked to the mother tongues of the early BSAE speakers. The policy of mother tongue promotion in schools ultimately failed, and in 1979, the Department of Bantu Education allowed schools to choose their own language of instruction. English was largely the language of choice because it was viewed as a key tool of social and economic advancement. BSAE has contrasting pronunciation and organisation of vowels and consonants compared to the ones in standard English. For instance, \"it lacks the tense/lax contrast and central vowels in the mesolectal variety.\"\nClassification.\nThe difference between Black and White South Africans is based on their ethnic backgrounds, with them, as BSAE, being originally the first indigenous people that made a \"new\" English South Africa and developing speaking their tongue version of English and deciding not to speak South Africa's native language of English, which is mostly exclusive for them due to it not being the majority language. In SAE it is primarily used for publicising the differences between British and other forms of tongue speaking for native speakers in various communities of South Africa.\nThe local native language of Black South African \"new\" English would lean more on the syllable side and would lean less on stress timing; due to this, the speech of the language would be affected by the length of vowel deduction in \"new\" English.\nPhonology.\nBSAE emerged from the influence of local native languages on the British English variety often taught in South African schools. After dispersing BSAE has been seen as three distinct subvarieties: the basilect, mesolect, and acrolect. Not much has yet been studied on the subvarieties of BSAE, and the distinctions between them are not yet fully defined. However, there are some notable pronunciation differences in the mesolect and acrolect.\nThe vowels in BSAE can be realised as five key phonemes: /i/, pronounced in words like \"FLEECE\" or KIT, /u/ in \"FOOT\" or \"GOOSE\", /\u025b/ in \"TRAP\", \"DRESS\", or \"NURSE\", /\u0254/ in LOT or FORCE, and /a/ as in CAR. /i/ may occasionally be pronounced [\u026a] in the acrolectal variety, though there is no consistent change among speakers. One difference in the acrolect in comparison to the mesolect is that it often uses [\u028c] in place of [a].\nIn addition, many vowels that are normally diphthongs in most varieties are monophthongs in BSAE. For example, \"FACE\" in General White SAE is typically pronounced as /fe\u026as/, but in BSAE is typically pronounced /f\u025bs/.\nGrammar.\nBlack South African English analysis has not been researched or utilised enough due to its contrasting methods to Southern British norms. BSAE has contrasting pronunciation and organisation of vowels and consonants compared to the ones in more commonly used languages such as other varieties of English. Due to English being an official language of South Africa, dialects that have contrary methods in language and pronunciation to English become isolated from the speech in that area. For instance, \"it lacks the tense/lax contrast and central vowels in the mesolectal variety.\"\nIn Black South African English, the length of vowels is changeable, and vowel length can be understood as stress placement, with some deviation from Standard English. An example of this is in the word \"sev\u00e9nty\", which has primary stress on the penultimate, rather than the initial, syllable.\nAdditionally, BSAE differs from other forms of dialect by \"having shorter tone/information units and having lower pitch and decrease intensity as the sentence concludes.\"\nCertain words such as \"maybe\" are used as conditional words that imply the result of something if a thing or event were to happen. Another distinctive trait of BSAE is the use of the word \"that\" as a complementiser. BSAE also has a high frequency of the retention of question word order, 0.86 per 1000 words.\nOther findings show that the Cultural Linguistic explorations of World Englishes have been evaluating BSAE based on its cognitive sociolinguistic principles. It is a language that is still being studied due to its strong cultural and traditional ties to its mother tongues.\nHistory.\nHistorically, BSAE has been considered a \"non-standard\" variety of English, perceived as inappropriate for formal contexts, and influenced by indigenous African languages.\nBSAE, or Black South African English, has its roots in European colonialism of the African continent in the 19th century. As a result of English being pushed by the colonisers of the region, the British, English became widespread in the South African region after it became necessary for indigenous African communities to use for success under the British. Much like in other colonies of the British, English became a necessity for advancement and economic security in the colony for indigenous Africans.\nAccording to the Central Statistical Services, as of 1994, about seven million black people spoke English in South Africa. BSAE originated in the South African school system when the 1953 Bantu Education Act mandated the use of native African languages in the classroom. When this law was established, most of the native English-speaking teachers were removed from schools. This limited the exposure that black students received to standard varieties of English. As a result, the English spoken in black schools developed distinctive patterns of pronunciation and syntax, leading to the formation of BSAE. Some of these characteristic features can be linked to the mother tongues of the early BSAE speakers. The policy of mother tongue promotion in schools ultimately failed, and in 1979, the Department of Bantu Education allowed schools to choose their own language of instruction. English was largely the language of choice because it was viewed as a key tool of social and economic advancement.\nGeography.\nSouth Africa occupies the southern area of Africa, its coastline stretching more than from the desert border within Namibia on the Atlantic (western) coast southwards around the tip of Africa and then northeast to the border with Mozambique on the Indian Ocean. The low-lying coastal zone is narrow for much of that distance, soon giving way to a mountainous escarpment (Great Escarpment) that separates the coast from the high inland plateau. In some places, notably the province of KwaZulu-Natal in the east, a greater distance separates the coast from the escarpment. Although much of the country is classified as semi-arid, it has considerable variation in climate as well as topography. The total land area is . It has the 23rd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of .\nThe South African Central Plateau only contains two major rivers: The Limpopo and The Orange (with its tributary, the Vaal). These rivers mainly flow across the central places in the east and west off the coast until they reach the Atlantic Ocean through the Namibian border.\nIndian South African English.\nIndian South African English (ISAE) is a sub-variety that developed among the descendants of Indian immigrants to South Africa. The Apartheid policy, in effect from 1948 to 1991, prevented Indian children from publicly interacting with people of English heritage. This separation caused an Indian variety to develop independently from white South African English, though with phonological and lexical features still fitting under the South African English umbrella. Indian South African English includes a \"basilect\", \"mesolect\", and \"acrolect\". These terms describe varieties of a given language on a spectrum of similarity to the colonial version of that language: the \"acrolect\" being the most similar. Today, basilect speakers are generally older non-native speakers with little education; acrolect speakers closely resemble colonial native English speakers, with a few phonetic/syntactic exceptions; and mesolect speakers fall somewhere in-between. A significant factor in the development of ISAE is the linguistic background of the early immigrants. While often referred to locally as \"Hindustani,\" the primary North Indian language brought by indentured labourers (predominantly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh via Calcutta between 1860 and 1911) was identified by linguist Rajend Mesthrie as \"South African Bhojpuri (SABh)\", a koin\u00e9 formed from Bhojpuri and Awadhi languages. As this language declined throughout the 20th century and speakers shifted to English, SABh likely served as a substrate, influencing the phonology, lexicon, and syntax of the emerging Indian South African English variety, alongside influences from other Indian languages like Tamil, Telugu, and Gujarati spoken by other immigrant groups In recent decades, the dialect has come much closer to the standard language through the model taught in schools. The result is a variety of English which mixes features of Indian, South African, Standard British, creole, and foreign language learning Englishes in a unique and fascinating way.\nISAE resembles Indian English in some respects, possibly because the varieties contain speakers with shared mother tongues or because early English teachers were brought to South Africa from India, or both. Four prominent education-related lexical features shared by ISAE and Indian English are: \"tuition(s),\" which means \"extra lessons outside school that one pays for\" (i.e. \"tutoring\" in other varieties of English); \"further studies\", which means \"higher education\"; \"alphabets\", which means \"the alphabet, letters of the alphabet\"; and \"by-heart\", which means \"to learn off by heart\"; these items show the influence of Indian English teachers in South Africa. Phonologically, ISAE also shares several similarities with Indian English, though certain common features are decreasing in the South African variety. For instance, consonant retroflexion in phonemes like /\u1e0d/ and strong aspiration in consonant production (common in North Indian English) are present in both varieties, but declining in ISAE. Syllable-timed rhythm, instead of stress-timed rhythm, is still a prominent feature in both varieties, especially in more colloquial sub-varieties.\nColoured South African English.\nAbout 20% of all coloured people in South Africa speak English as a home language. They are primarily concentrated in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and northeastern parts of the Eastern Cape in the former Transkei with some transplants being found in Johannesburg.\nMany people from these regions migrated to Durban and Pietermaritzburg, where the most Anglophone coloureds can be found.\nAnglophone coloureds with European heritage have ancestry mostly from the British Isles, which, along with originating in regions with very few Afrikaans speaking people, contributed to English being the main language of the coloured people in the region.\nThe accent of Anglophone coloured people is influenced by their multiracial background, being descended from Europeans (British, German, and Afrikaners), blacks (Zulu and Xhosa), Indians (both Dravidian and Indo-Aryan) as well as other mixed people like St. Helenians, Mauritian Creoles and some Griquas. This has influenced the accent to be one of the most distinctive in Southern Africa.\nCape Flats English.\nA particular variety or sub-spectrum of South African English is Cape Flats English, originally and best associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers.\nLexicon.\nHistory of SAE dictionaries.\nIn 1913, Charles Pettman created the first South African English dictionary, entitled \"\". This work sought to identify Afrikaans terms that were emerging in the English language in South Africa. In 1924, the Oxford University Press published its first version of a South African English dictionary, \"The South African Pocket Oxford Dictionary.\" Subsequent editions of this dictionary have tried to take a \"broad editorial approach\" in including vocabulary terms native to South Africa, though the extent of this inclusion has been contested. Rhodes University (South Africa) and Oxford University (Great Britain) worked together to produce the 1978 \"Dictionary of South African English,\" which adopted a more conservative approach in its inclusion of terms. This dictionary did include, for the first time, what the dictionary writers deemed \"the jargon of townships\", or vocabulary terms found in Black journalism and literary circles. Dictionaries specialising in scientific jargon, such as the common names of South African plants, also emerged in the twentieth century. However, these works still often relied on Latin terminology and European pronunciation systems. As of 1992[ [update]], Rajend Mesthrie had produced the only available dictionary of South African Indian English.\nVocabulary.\nUnique SAE terms include:\nSAE includes lexical items borrowed from other South African languages. The following list provides a sample of some of these terms:\nBritish lexical items.\nSAE also contains several lexical items that demonstrate the British influence on this variety:\nExpressions.\nA range of SAE expressions have been borrowed from other South African languages, or are uniquely used in this variety of English. Some common expressions include:\nDemographics.\nThe South African National Census of 2011 found a total of 4,892,623 speakers of English as a first language, making up 9.6% of the national population. The provinces with significant English-speaking populations were the Western Cape (20.2% of the provincial population), Gauteng (13.3%) and KwaZulu-Natal (13.2%).\nEnglish was found to be spoken across all of South Africa's ethnic groups. A breakdown of English speakers according to the conventional racial classifications used by Statistics South Africa is described in the following table:\nExamples of South African accents.\nThe examples of South African accents in the list below were obtained from George Mason University:\nAll four of the speakers in this list have English as their first language.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The signals are usually processed in a digital representation, so speech processing can be regarded as a special case of digital signal processing, applied to speech signals. Aspects of speech processing includes the acquisition, manipulation, storage, transfer and output of speech signals. Different speech processing tasks include speech recognition, speech synthesis, speaker diarization, speech enhancement, speaker recognition, etc.\nHistory.\nEarly attempts at speech processing and recognition were primarily focused on understanding a handful of simple phonetic elements such as vowels. In 1952, three researchers at Bell Labs, Stephen. Balashek, R. Biddulph, and K. H. Davis, developed a system that could recognize digits spoken by a single speaker. Pioneering works in field of speech recognition using analysis of its spectrum were reported in the 1940s.\nLinear predictive coding (LPC), a speech processing algorithm, was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1966. Further developments in LPC technology were made by Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs during the 1970s. LPC was the basis for voice-over-IP (VoIP) technology, as well as speech synthesizer chips, such as the Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips used in the Speak &amp; Spell toys from 1978.\nOne of the first commercially available speech recognition products was Dragon Dictate, released in 1990. In 1992, technology developed by Lawrence Rabiner and others at Bell Labs was used by AT&amp;T in their Voice Recognition Call Processing service to route calls without a human operator. By this point, the vocabulary of these systems was larger than the average human vocabulary.\nBy the early 2000s, the dominant speech processing strategy started to shift away from Hidden Markov Models towards more modern neural networks and deep learning.\nIn 2012, Geoffrey Hinton and his team at the University of Toronto demonstrated that deep neural networks could significantly outperform traditional HMM-based systems on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tasks. This breakthrough led to widespread adoption of deep learning techniques in the industry.\nBy the mid-2010s, companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple had integrated advanced speech recognition systems into their virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Cortana, Alexa, and Siri. These systems utilized deep learning models to provide more natural and accurate voice interactions.\nThe development of Transformer-based models, like Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), further pushed the boundaries of natural language processing and speech recognition. These models enabled more context-aware and semantically rich understanding of speech. In recent years, end-to-end speech recognition models have gained popularity. These models simplify the speech recognition pipeline by directly converting audio input into text output, bypassing intermediate steps like feature extraction and acoustic modeling. This approach has streamlined the development process and improved performance.\nTechniques.\nDynamic time warping.\nDynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restriction and rules. The optimal match is denoted by the match that satisfies all the restrictions and the rules and that has the minimal cost, where the cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences, for each matched pair of indices, between their values.\nHidden Markov models.\nA hidden Markov model can be represented as the simplest dynamic Bayesian network. The goal of the algorithm is to estimate a hidden variable x(t) given a list of observations y(t). By applying the Markov property, the conditional probability distribution of the hidden variable \"x\"(\"t\") at time \"t\", given the values of the hidden variable \"x\" at all times, depends \"only\" on the value of the hidden variable \"x\"(\"t\" \u2212 1). Similarly, the value of the observed variable \"y\"(\"t\") only depends on the value of the hidden variable \"x\"(\"t\") (both at time \"t\").\nArtificial neural networks.\nAn artificial neural network (ANN) is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.\nPhase-aware processing.\nPhase is often assumed to be random, but contains useful information. Wrapping of phase: can be introduced due to periodical jumps on formula_1. Phase unwrapping (see, Chapter 2.3; Instantaneous phase and frequency), it can be expressed as:\nformula_2, where formula_3 is linear phase (formula_4 is temporal shift at each frame of analysis), formula_5 is phase contribution of the vocal tract and phase source.\nObtained phase estimations can be used for noise reduction: temporal smoothing of instantaneous phase and its derivatives by time (instantaneous frequency) and frequency (group delay), smoothing of phase across frequency. Joined amplitude and phase estimators can recover speech more accurately basing on assumption of von Mises distribution of phase.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Estimates of the number of Swahili speakers, including both native and second-language speakers, vary widely. They generally range from 150 million to 200 million; with most of its native speakers residing in Tanzania and Kenya.\nSwahili has a significant number of loanwords from other languages, mainly Arabic, as well as from Portuguese, English and German. Around 40% of Swahili vocabulary consists of Arabic loanwords, including the name of the language ( , a plural adjectival form of an Arabic word meaning 'of the coasts'). The loanwords date from the era of contact between Arab slave traders and the Bantu inhabitants of the east coast of Africa, which was also the time period when Swahili emerged as a lingua franca in the region.\nDue to concerted efforts by the governments of Tanzania and Kenya, Swahili is one of three official languages (the others being English and French) of the East African Community (EAC) countries, namely Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is the lingua franca of other areas in the African Great Lakes region and East and Southern Africa. Swahili is also one of the working languages of the African Union and of the Southern African Development Community. The East African Community created an institution called the \"East African Kiswahili Commission\" (EAKC) which began operations in 2015. The institution currently serves as the leading body for promoting the language in the East African region, as well as for coordinating its development and usage for regional integration and sustainable development. In recent years Somalia, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Ethiopia, and South Sudan have begun offering Swahili as a subject in schools or have developed plans to do so.\nShikomor (or Comorian), an official language in Comoros and also spoken in Mayotte (Shimaore), is closely related to Swahili and is sometimes considered a dialect of Swahili, although other authorities consider it a distinct language. In 2022, based on Swahili's growth as a prominent international language, the United Nations declared Swahili Language Day as 7 July to commemorate the date that Julius Nyerere adopted Swahili as a unifying language for African independence struggles.\nClassification.\nSwahili is a Bantu language of the Sabaki branch. In Guthrie's geographic classification, Swahili is in Bantu zone G, whereas the other Sabaki languages are in zone E70, commonly under the name \"Nyika.\" Historical linguists consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant, since it takes around 40% of its vocabulary directly from Arabic, and was initially spread along the East African coast.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Swahili\" comes from an Arabic name for the area, meaning \"coasts\":\nOrigin.\nThe core of the Swahili language originates in Bantu languages of the coast of East Africa. Much of Swahili's Bantu vocabulary has cognates in the Unguja, Pemba, and Mijikenda languages and, to a lesser extent, other East African Bantu languages. While opinions vary on the specifics, it has been historically purported that around 16\u201320% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from loan words, the vast majority Arabic, but also other contributing languages, including Persian, Hindustani, Portuguese, and Malay.\nOmani Arabic is the source of most Arabic loanwords in Swahili. In the text \"Early Swahili History Reconsidered\", however, Thomas Spear noted that Swahili retains a large amount of grammar, vocabulary, and sounds inherited from the Sabaki language. In fact, while taking account of daily vocabulary, using lists of one hundred words, 72\u201391% were inherited from the Sabaki language (which is reported as a parent language) whereas 4\u201317% were loan words from other African languages. Only 2\u20138% were from non-African languages, and Arabic loan words constituted a fraction of that. According to other sources, around 40% of the Swahili vocabulary comes from Arabic. What also remained unconsidered was that a good number of the borrowed terms had Bantu equivalents. The preferred use of Arabic loan words is prevalent along the coast, where local people, in a cultural show of proximity to, or descent from, Arab culture, would rather use loan words, whereas the people in the interior tend to use the Bantu equivalents. It was originally written in Arabic script.\nThe earliest known documents written in Swahili are letters written in Kilwa, Tanzania, in 1711 in the Arabic script that were sent to the Portuguese of Mozambique and their local allies. The original letters are preserved in the Historical Archives of Goa, India.\nColonial period.\nVarious colonial powers that ruled on the coast of East Africa played a role in the growth and spread of Swahili. With the arrival of the Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as a language of trade as well as for teaching Islam to the local Bantu peoples. This resulted in Swahili first being written in the Arabic script. The later contact with the Portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language. The language was formalised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the Berlin Conference. After seeing there was already a widespread language, the Germans formalised it as the official language to be used in schools. Thus schools in Swahili are called Shule (from German ) in government, trade and the court system. With the Germans controlling the major Swahili-speaking region in East Africa, they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin. After the First World War, Britain took over German East Africa, where they found Swahili rooted in most areas, not just the coastal regions. The British decided to formalise it as the language to be used across the East African region (although in British East Africa [Kenya and Uganda] most areas used English and various Nilotic and other Bantu languages while Swahili was mostly restricted to the coast). In June 1928, an inter-territorial conference attended by representatives of Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, and Zanzibar took place in Mombasa. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas, and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.\nCurrent status.\nOverview.\nEstimates of the total number of first- and second-language Swahili speakers vary widely, from as low as 50 million to as high as 200 million, but generally range from 60 million to 150 million.\nSwahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions of people in the five African Great Lakes countries (Kenya, DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania), where it is an official or national language. It is also the first language for many people in Tanzania, especially in the coastal regions of Tanga, Pwani, Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Lindi. In the inner regions of Tanzania, Swahili is spoken with an accent influenced by other local languages and dialects. There, it is a first language for most of the people who are born in the cities, whilst being spoken as a second language in rural areas. Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in Burundi, Comoros, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Rwanda. The language was still understood in the southern ports of the Red Sea in the 20th century. The East African Community created an institution called the East African Kiswahili Commission (EAKC) which began operations in 2015. The institution currently serves as the leading body for promoting the language in the East African region, as well as for coordinating its development and usage for regional integration and sustainable development.\nSwahili is among the first languages in Africa for which language technology applications have been developed. Arvi Hurskainen is one of the early developers. The applications include a spelling checker, part-of-speech tagging, language learning software, an analysed Swahili text corpus of 25 million words, an electronic dictionary, and machine translation between Swahili and English. The development of language technology also strengthens the position of Swahili as a modern medium of communication. \nTanzania.\nThe widespread use of Swahili as a national language in Tanzania came after Tanganyika gained independence in 1961 and the government decided that it would be used as a language to unify the new nation. This saw the use of Swahili in all levels of government, trade, art as well as schools in which primary school children are taught in Swahili, before switching to English (medium of instruction) in secondary schools (although Swahili is still taught as an independent subject). After Tanganyika and Zanzibar unification in 1964, \"Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili\" (TUKI, Institute of Swahili Research) was created from the Interterritorial Language Committee. In 1970 TUKI was merged with the University of Dar es Salaam, while \"Baraza la\" \"Kiswahili la Taifa\" (BAKITA) was formed. BAKITA is an organisation dedicated to the development and advocacy of Swahili as a means of national integration in Tanzania. Key activities mandated for the organisation include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Swahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organisations involved with Swahili, standardising the language. BAKITA vision are: \"1.To efficiently manage and coordinate the development and use of Kiswahili in Tanzania 2.To participate fully and effectively in promoting Swahili in East Africa, Africa and the entire world over\". Although other bodies and agencies can propose new vocabularies, BAKITA is the only organisation that can approve its usage in the Swahili language. Tanzanians are highly credited for shaping the language to appear the way it is now.\nKenya.\nIn Kenya, Swahili (or Kiswahili as it is referred to in the Constitution and by the Kenya Law Reform Society ) has been the national language since 1964 and is official since 2010. \"Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa\" (CHAKITA) was established in 1998 to research and promote Kiswahili language in Kenya. Kiswahili is a compulsory subject in all Kenyan primary and secondary schools.\nCongo.\nSwahili is recognized as a national language in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is widely spoken in the eastern regions. The local dialects of Swahili in Congo are known as Congo Swahili and differ considerably from Standard Swahili.\nBurundi.\nIn order to strengthen political ties with other East African Community nations, both Kiswahili and English have been taught in Burundian elementary schools since the academic year 2005/2006. Kiswahili is now used widely in Burundi but is not recognised as an official language; only French, Kirundi, and English have this distinction. Since 2013, Swahili has been included in the all Burundian education system.\nUganda.\nUganda adopted Kiswahili as one of its official languages (alongside English) in 2022, and also made it compulsory across primary and secondary schools in the country.\nSomalia.\nThe Somali language is the national and primary first language of Somalia. The Swahili language is not widespread in Somalia and has no official status nationally or regionally. Dialects of Swahili are spoken by some ethnic minorities on the Bajuni islands in the form of Kibajuni on the southern tip of the country and in the town of Brava in the form of Chimwiini; both contain a significant amount of Somali and Italian loanwords. Standard Swahili is generally only spoken by Somali nationals who have resided in Kenya and subsequently returned to Somalia. A closely related language Mushunguli (also known as Zigula, Zigua, or Chizigua) is spoken by some of the Somali Bantu ethnic minority mostly living in the Jubba Valley. It is classified as a Northeast Coast Bantu language as Swahili is and has some intelligibility with Swahili.\nIn 2024, Somalia joined the East African Community and its inclusion may facilitate the spread of the Swahili language in Somalia. Nevertheless, in Somalia, Swahili, as a foreign language, will have to compete with English, the primary global lingua franca, and Arabic, the official second language of Somalia and a liturgical language for Muslims, as popular secondary or tertiary languages. Consequently, there is significant uncertainty regarding the adoption of the Swahili language in Somalia compared to the situation in most other EAC member states.\nReligious and political identity.\nReligion.\nSwahili played a major role in spreading both Christianity and Islam in East Africa. From their arrival in East Africa, Arabs brought Islam and set up madrasas, where they used Swahili to teach Islam to the natives. As the Arab population and influence expanded, a growing number of indigenous people converted to Islam and began receiving religious and cultural instruction in Swahili, which increasingly absorbed Arabic vocabulary.\nWith the arrival of Europeans in East Africa, Christianity was introduced to the region, profoundly shaping the development of Swahili. While Arab influence remained concentrated along the coastal areas, European missionaries ventured further inland, establishing missions and promoting Christian teachings. Early outposts were located along the coast, where they encountered Swahili as a widely spoken lingua franca. Recognizing its utility and structural similarities to other indigenous languages, the Europeans adopted Swahili as a medium for evangelization, religious and general educational instruction, and, eventually, colonization.\nPolitics.\nDuring the struggle for Tanganyika independence, the Tanganyika African National Union used Swahili as a language of mass organisation and political movement. This included publishing pamphlets and radio broadcasts to rally the people to fight for independence. After gaining independence, Swahili was adopted as the national language. To this day, Tanzanians carry a sense of pride when it comes to Swahili, especially when it is used to unite over 120 tribes across Tanzania. Swahili was used to strengthen solidarity within the nation, and remains to be a key identity of the Tanzanian people.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\nStandard Swahili has five vowel phonemes: , , , , and . According to Ellen Contini-Morava, vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress. However, according to Edgar Polom\u00e9, these five phonemes can vary in pronunciation. Polom\u00e9 claims that , , , and are pronounced as such only in stressed syllables. In unstressed syllables, as well as before a prenasalized consonant, they are pronounced as , , , and . \"E\" is also commonly pronounced as mid-position after \"w\". Polom\u00e9 claims that is pronounced as such only after \"w\" and is pronounced as in other situations, especially after (\"y\"). \"A\" can be pronounced as in word-final position. Long vowels in Swahili are written as doubled vowels (for example, , \"sheep\") due to a historical process in which became elided between the second last and last vowels of a word (for example, , \"sheep\" was originally \"kondolo\", which survives in certain dialects). As a consequence, long vowels are not considered phonemic. A similar process exists in Zulu.\nConsonants.\nWhere not shown, the orthography is the same as IPA.\nSome dialects of Swahili may also have the aspirated phonemes though they are unmarked in Swahili's orthography. Multiple studies favour classifying prenasalization as consonant clusters, not as separate phonemes. Historically, nasalization has been lost before voiceless consonants, and subsequently the voiced consonants have devoiced, though they are still written \"mb, nd\" etc. The phoneme is realised as either a short trill or more commonly as a single tap by most speakers. exists in free variation with h, and is only distinguished by some speakers. In some Arabic loans (nouns, verbs, adjectives), emphasis or intensity is expressed by reproducing the original emphatic consonants and the uvular , or lengthening a vowel, where aspiration would be used in inherited Bantu words.\nTonality.\nUnlike most Bantu languages, Swahili is not tonal.\nOrthography.\nSwahili is now written in the Latin alphabet. There are a few digraphs for native sounds, \"ch\", \"sh\", \"ng'\" and \"ny\"; \"q\" and \"x\" are not used, \"c\" is not used apart from the digraph \"ch\", unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for \"k\" in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds, which many speakers outside of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.\nThe language used to be primarily written in the Ajami script, which is an Arabic script. Much literature was produced in this script. With the introduction of Latin, the use of Ajami script has been diminished significantly. However, the language continues to have a tradition of being written in Arabic script. Starting from the later half of the 19th century, continuing into the 20th century, and going on in the 21st century, a process of \"Swahilization\" of the Arabic Script has been underway by Swahili scribes and scholars. The first of such attempts was done by , a scholar and poet from Mombasa. However, the spread of a standardized indigenous variation of Arabic script for Swahili was hampered by the colonial takeover of East Africa by the United Kingdom and Germany. The usage of Arabic script was suppressed in German East Africa and to a lesser extent in British East Africa. Nevertheless, well into the 1930s and 1940s, rural literacy rate in Arabic script as well as a local preference to write Swahili in the Arabic script (an unmodified version as opposed to proposals such as that of Mwalimu Sikujua) was relatively high. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility. Thus despite a lack of official governmental backing, attempts at standardization and Swahilization of the Arabic script continued into the 20th century.\nGrammar.\nNoun classes.\nSwahili nouns are separable into classes, which are roughly analogous to genders in other languages. In Swahili, prefixes mark groups of similar objects: \u27e8m-\u27e9 marks single human beings ( 'child'), \u27e8wa-\u27e9 marks multiple humans ( 'children'), \u27e8u-\u27e9 marks abstract nouns ( 'childhood'), and so on. And just as adjectives and pronouns must agree with the gender of nouns in some languages with grammatical gender, so in Swahili adjectives, pronouns and even verbs must agree with nouns. This is a characteristic feature of all the Bantu languages.\nSemantic motivation.\nThe \"ki-/vi-\" class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12/13), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are \"kisu\" \"knife\", \"kiti\" \"chair\" (from \"mti\" \"tree, wood\"), \"chombo\" \"vessel\" (a contraction of \"ki-ombo\"). Examples of the latter are \"kitoto\" \"infant\", from \"mtoto\" \"child\"; \"kitawi\" \"frond\", from \"tawi\" \"branch\"; and \"chumba\" (\"ki-umba\") \"room\", from \"nyumba\" \"house\". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is \"approximation\" and \"resemblance\" (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like \"-y\" or \"-ish\" in English). For example, there is \"kijani\" \"green\", from \"jani\" \"leaf\" (compare English 'leafy'), \"kichaka\" \"bush\" from \"chaka\" \"clump\", and \"kivuli\" \"shadow\" from \"uvuli\" \"shade\". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such \"instantiations\" (usually not very active ones) are found: \"kifo\" \"death\", from the verb \"-fa\" \"to die\"; \"kiota\" \"nest\" from \"-ota\" \"to brood\"; \"chakula\" \"food\" from \"kula\" \"to eat\"; \"kivuko\" \"a ford, a pass\" from \"-vuka\" \"to cross\"; and \"kilimia\" \"the Pleiades\", from \"-limia\" \"to farm with\", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the \"ki-/vi-\" prefixes. One example is \"chura\" (\"ki-ura\") \"frog\", which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: \"kilema\" \"a cripple\", \"kipofu\" \"a blind person\", \"kiziwi\" \"a deaf person\". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for \"kifaru\" \"rhinoceros\", \"kingugwa\" \"spotted hyena\", and \"kiboko\" \"hippopotamus\" (perhaps originally meaning \"stubby legs\").\nAnother class with broad semantic extension is the \"m-/mi-\" class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because \"mti, miti\" \"tree(s)\" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as \"mwitu\" 'forest' and \"mtama\" 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like \"mkeka\" 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as \"mwezi\" 'moon', \"mlima\" 'mountain', \"mto\" 'river'; active things, such as \"moto\" 'fire', including active body parts (\"moyo\" 'heart', \"mkono\" 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as \"mji\" 'village', and, by analogy, \"mzinga\" 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of \"tree\", which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as \"mwavuli\" 'umbrella', \"moshi\" 'smoke', \"msumari\" 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as \"mfuo\" \"metal forging\", from \"-fua\" \"to forge\", or \"mlio\" \"a sound\", from \"-lia\" \"to make a sound\". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, \"mkono\" is an active body part, and \"mto\" is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as \"mpaka\" 'border' and \"mwendo\" 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as \"mwaka\" 'year' and perhaps \"mshahara\" 'wages'. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.\nThe other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive. In short,\nBorrowing.\nBorrowings may or may not be given a prefix corresponding to the semantic class they fall in. For example, Arabic (\"bug, insect\") was borrowed as \"mdudu\", plural \"wadudu\", with the class 1/2 prefixes \"m-\" and \"wa-\", but Arabic (\"fish scales\", plural of ) and English \"sloth\" were borrowed as simply \"fulusi\" (\"mahi-mahi\" fish) and \"slothi\" (\"sloth\"), with no prefix associated with animals (whether those of class 9/10 or 1/2).\nIn the process of naturalization of borrowings within Swahili, loanwords are often reinterpreted, or reanalysed, as if they already contain a Swahili class prefix. In such cases the interpreted prefix is changed with the usual rules. Consider the following loanwords from Arabic:\nSimilarly, English \"wire\" and Arabic (\"time\") were interpreted as having the class 11 prevocalic prefix \"w-\", and became \"waya\" and \"wakati\" with plural \"nyaya\" and \"nyakati\" respectively.\nAgreement.\nSwahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of concord but, if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1\u20132 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili \"(Kiswahili sanifu)\", based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger \"a-, wa-\" and \"m-, wa-\" in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger \"i-, zi-\". Infinitives vary between standard \"ku-\" and reduced \"i-.\" (\"Of\" is animate \"wa\" and inanimate \"ya, za.\")\nIn Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in \"a-, wa-\" and \"m-, wa-,\" and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.\nDialects and closely related languages.\nThis list is based on \"Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history\".\nDialects.\nModern standard Swahili, written in Latin, is based on \"Kiunguja,\" the dialect spoken in Zanzibar City.\nSwahili literature and poetry, traditionally written in Swahili Ajami, is based on \"Kiamu\", the dialect of Lamu on the Kenyan Coast.\nBut there are numerous other dialects of Swahili, some of which are mutually unintelligible, such as the following:\nOld dialects.\nMaho (2009) considers these to be distinct languages:\nThe rest of the dialects are divided by him into two groups:\nMaho includes the various Comorian dialects as a third group. Most other authorities consider Comorian to be a Sabaki language, distinct from Swahili.\nOther regions.\nIn Somalia, where the Afroasiatic Somali language predominates, a variant of Swahili referred to as Chimwiini (also known as Chimbalazi) is spoken along the Benadir coast by the Bravanese people. Another Swahili dialect known as Kibajuni also serves as the mother tongue of the Bajuni minority ethnic group, which lives in the tiny Bajuni Islands as well as the southern Kismayo region.\nIn Oman, there are an estimated people who speak Swahili as of 2020. Most are descendants of those repatriated after the fall of the Sultanate of Zanzibar.\nPidgins and creoles.\nThere are Swahili-based slangs, pidgins and creoles:\nOral literature.\n19th-century collections.\nIn 1870, Edward Steere published https://, a collection of 23 Swahili tales with facing-text English translation, along with a selection of proverbs and riddles. Some of the tales included are: \"Kisa cha Punda wa Dobi\", \"The Story of the Washerman's Donkey\", also known as \"The Heart of a Monkey\"; \"Mwalimu Goso\", \"Goso the Teacher\", a cumulative tale; and \"Sungura na Simba\", \"The Hare and the Lion\", a story about the trickster hare.\nHere are some of the proverbs that Steere recorded in Swahili:\nHere are some of the riddles that Steere recorded in Swahili:\nSteere also includes the formulaic announcement of a riddle:\nAn anonymous publication from 1881, https://, includes 15 stories in Swahili with English translations, plus an additional 14 Swahili stories that are not translated.

As in other jurisdictions, summary conviction offences are considered less serious than indictable offences because they are punishable by shorter prison sentences and smaller fines. Section 787 of the Criminal Code specifies that unless another punishment is provided for by law, the maximum penalty for a summary conviction offence is a sentence of 2 years less a day of imprisonment, a fine of $5,000 or both.\nAs a matter of practical effect, some common differences between summary conviction and indictable offences are provided below.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, trials for summary offences are heard in one of the territory's Magistrates' Courts, unless the defendant is accused with other indictable offence(s). Typical examples for summary offences in Hong Kong include possession of a simulated bomb, drunkenness, taking photographs in courts, careless driving and pretending to be a public officer. \nNew Zealand.\nUnder New Zealand law, summary offences are covered by the Summary Offences Act 1981, and include offences that resemble forgery, fraud, nuisance, as well as offences against public order. It also covers some aspects of search, arrest and jurisdiction, as well as regulating the sale of spray paint.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn relation to England and Wales, the expression \"summary trial\" means a trial in the magistrates' court. In such proceedings there is no jury; the appointed judge, or a panel of three lay magistrates, decides the guilt or innocence of the accused. Each summary offence is specified by statute which describes the (usually minor) offence and the judge to hear it. A summary procedure can result in a summary conviction. A \"summary offence\" is one which, if charged to an adult, can only be tried by summary procedure. Similar procedures are also used in Scotland.\nCertain offences that may be tried in a Crown Court (by jury) may be required to be tried summarily if the value involved is small; such offences are still considered either way offences, so are not thereby \"summary offences\" in the meaning of that term defined by statute. Contrariwise, certain summary offences may in certain circumstances be tried on indictment along with other offences that are themselves indictable; they do not thereby become \"indictable offences\" or \"either way offences\" but remain \"summary offences\", though tried by jury.\nSir William Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765\u20131769), described summary offences thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By a \"summary\" proceeding I mean principally such as is directed by several acts of parliament (for the common law is a stranger to it, unless in the case of contempts) for the conviction of offenders, and the inflicting of certain penalties created by those acts of parliament. In these there is no intervention of a jury, but the party accused is acquitted or condemned by the suffrage of such person only, as the statute has appointed for his judge. An institution designed professedly for the greater ease of the subject, by doing him speedy justice, and by not harassing the freeholders with frequent and troublesome attendances to try every minute offence. But it has of late been so far extended, as, if a check be not timely given, to threaten the disuse of our admirable and truly English trial by jury, unless only in capital cases.\nIn the United Kingdom, trials for summary offences are heard in one of a number of types of lower court. For England and Wales this is the Magistrates' Court. In Scotland, it is the Sheriff Court or Justice of the peace court, depending on the offence (the latter being primarily for the most minor of offences). Northern Ireland has its own Magistrates' Court system.\nUnited States.\nIn United States federal and state law, \"there are certain minor or petty offenses that may be proceeded against summarily, and without a jury\". These can include criminal and civil citations, where a person may be charged with a criminal or non-criminal infraction without the need of a physical arrest, such as in cases of non-violent fineable violations, crimes that carry little incarceration time, or non-criminal acts such as speeding. Any crime that is punishable by the controlling law for more than six months of imprisonment must have some means for a jury trial. Some states, such as California, provide that all defendants are entitled to a jury trial (irrespective of the nature of their offenses). In any case, for summary criminal offenses in the United States, convictions can still show as such on a criminal record.\nContempt of court is considered a prerogative of the court, as \"the requirement of a jury does not apply to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States\". There have been criticisms over the practice. In particular, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote in a 1964 dissent: \"It is high time, in my judgment, to wipe out root and branch the judge-invented and judge-maintained notion that judges can try criminal contempt cases without a jury.\"\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located near the Baltic Sea and the German border, it is a major seaport, the largest city of northwestern Poland, and seventh-largest city of Poland. As of 2022,[ [update]] the population was 391,566.\nSzczecin is located on the Oder River, south of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania. The city is situated along the southwestern shore of D\u0105bie Lake, on both sides of the Oder and on several large islands between the western and eastern branches of the river. It is also surrounded by dense forests, shrubland and heaths, chiefly the Wkrza\u0144ska Heath shared with Germany (Ueckerm\u00fcnde) and the Szczecin Landscape Park. Szczecin is adjacent to the town of Police and is the urban centre of the Szczecin agglomeration, an extended metropolitan area that includes communities in the German states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.\nThe city's recorded history began in the 8th century as a Lechitic Pomeranian stronghold, built at the site of the Ducal Castle. In the 10th century, Szczecin first became part of the emerging Polish state. In the following centuries it was the capital of the Duchy of Pomerania ruled by the local House of Griffin, which at various times was under the suzerainty of Poland, the Duchy of Saxony, the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark. In 1630, the city came under the control of the Swedish Empire and became in 1648 the capital of Swedish Pomerania until 1720, when it was acquired by Prussia. Following World War II the city became part of Poland again in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, resulting in a nearly complete population exchange. Szczecin was the site of large Polish protests in 1970 and 1980. In 1980, the first agreement between the protesters and the communist regime was signed in Szczecin, which paved the way for the creation of Solidarity, which contributed to the fall of communism.\nSzczecin is the administrative and industrial centre of West Pomeranian Voivodeship and is the site of the University of Szczecin, Pomeranian Medical University, Maritime University, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin Art Academy, and the see of the Szczecin-Kamie\u0144 Catholic Archdiocese. From 1999 onwards, Szczecin has served as the site of the headquarters of NATO's Multinational Corps Northeast. The city was a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2016. Its chief landmarks include the Szczecin Cathedral, the Ducal Castle, the National Museum and the Szczecin Philharmonic.\nName and etymology.\n and are the Polish and German equivalents of the same name, which is of Proto-Slavic origin, though the exact etymology is the subject of ongoing research. \nIn her \"Etymological Dictionary of Geographical Names of Poland\", Maria Malec lists 11 theories regarding the origin of the name, including derivations from either: an Old Slavic word for 'hill peak' (), the plant fuller's teasel (), or the personal name .\nOther medieval names for the town are \"Burstaborg\" (in the Knytlinga saga) and \"Burstenburgh\" (in the Annals of Waldemar). These names, which literally mean 'brush burgh', are likely derived from the translation of the city's Slavic name (assuming the second derivation mentioned above).\nThe Latin name of the city is or .\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe recorded history of Szczecin began in the eighth century, when Vikings and West Slavs settled in Pomerania. The West Slavs, or Lechites, erected a new stronghold on the site of the modern castle.\nSince the 9th century, the stronghold was fortified and expanded toward the Oder bank. Mieszko I of Poland took control of Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages and the region became part of Poland in the 10th century. However, Mieszko II Lambert (1025\u20131034) effectively lost control over the area and had to accept German suzerainty over the area of the Oder lagoon. Subsequent Polish rulers, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Liutician federation all aimed to control the territory.\nAfter the decline of the neighbouring regional centre Wolin in the 12th century, the city became an important and powerful seaport of the Baltic Sea.\nIn a campaign in the winter of 1121\u20131122, Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, gained control of the region, including the city of Szczecin and its stronghold. The Polish ruler initiated Christianization, entrusting this task to Otto of Bamberg, and the inhabitants were Christianised by two missions of Otto in 1124 and 1128. At this time, the first Christian church of Saints Peter and Paul was erected. The Poles' minted coins were commonly used in trade in this period. The population of the city at that time is estimated to be at around 5,000\u20139,000 people.\nPolish rule ended with Boleslaw's death in 1138. During the Wendish Crusade in 1147, a contingent led by the German margrave Albert the Bear, an enemy of Slavic presence in the region, papal legate, bishop Anselm of Havelberg and Konrad of Meissen besieged the town. There, a Polish contingent supplied by Mieszko III the Old joined the crusaders. However, the citizens had placed crosses around the fortifications, indicating they already had been Christianised. Duke Ratibor I of Pomerania, negotiated the disbanding of the crusading forces.\nAfter the Battle of Verchen in 1164, Stettin duke Bogus\u0142aw I, Duke of Pomerania became a vassal of the Duchy of Saxony's Henry the Lion. In 1173, Stettin castellan Wartislaw II, could not resist a Danish attack and became vassal of Denmark.&lt;ref name=\"Buchholz, p.34\"/&gt; In 1181, Bogus\u0142aw became a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1185, Bogus\u0142aw again became a Danish vassal.&lt;ref name=\"Buchholz, p.35\"/&gt; Despite falling under foreign suzerainty, local dukes maintained close ties with the fragmented Polish realm, and future Polish monarch W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks stayed at the local court of Duke Bogus\u0142aw I in 1186, on behalf of his father Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland, who also periodically was the High Duke of Poland. Following a conflict between his heirs and Canute VI of Denmark, the settlement was destroyed in 1189, but the fortress was reconstructed and manned with a Danish force in 1190. While the empire restored its superiority over the Duchy of Pomerania in the Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved in 1227,&lt;ref name=\"Buchholz, p.35\"/&gt; Stettin was one of two bridgeheads remaining under Danish control (until 1235; Wolgast until 1241/43 or 1250).\nIn the second half of the 12th century, a group of German tradesmen (\"multus populus Teutonicorum\" from various parts of the Holy Roman Empire) settled in the city around St.Jacob's Church, which was donated in 1180 by Beringer, a trader from Bamberg, and consecrated in 1187. Hohenkrug (now Zdunowo) was the first village in the Duchy of Pomerania that was clearly recorded as German (\"villa teutonicorum\") in 1173. Ostsiedlung accelerated in Pomerania during the 13th century. Duke Barnim I of Pomerania granted Stettin a local government charter in 1237, separating the German settlement from the Slavic community settled around the St. Nicholas church in the neighbourhood of Kessin (). In the charter, the Slavs were put under Germanic jurisdiction.\nWhen Barnim granted Stettin Magdeburg rights in 1243, a part of the Slavic settlement was reconstructed. The duke had to promise to level the burgh in 1249. Most Slavic inhabitants were resettled to two new suburbs north and south of the town.\nIn 1249, Barnim I also granted equivalent Magdeburg town privileges to the town of Damm (also known as Altdamm, now the D\u0105bie neighbourhood) on the eastern bank of the Oder. Damm merged with neighbouring Stettin on 15October 1939. This town had been built on the site of a former Pomeranian burg, \"Vadam\" or \"Dambe\", which Boleslaw had destroyed during his 1121 campaign.\nOn 2 December 1261, Barnim I allowed Jewish settlement in Stettin in accordance with the Magdeburg law, in a privilege renewed in 1308 and 1371. The Jewish Jordan family was granted citizenship in 1325, but none of the 22 Jews allowed to settle in the duchy in 1481 lived in the city, and in 1492, all Jews in the duchy were ordered to convert to Christianity or leave\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this order remained effective throughout the rest of the Griffin era.\nIn 1273, duke of Pozna\u0144 and future King of Poland Przemys\u0142 II married princess Ludgarda, granddaughter of Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania in the city, in order to strengthen the alliance between the two rulers.\nStettin was part of the federation of Wendish towns, a predecessor of the Hanseatic League, in 1283. The city prospered due to its participation in the Baltic Sea trade, primarily with herring, grain, and timber; craftsmanship also prospered, and more than forty guilds were established in the city. The far-reaching autonomy granted by the House of Griffins was in part reduced when the dukes reclaimed Stettin as their main residence in the late 15th century. The anti-Slavic policies of German merchants and craftsmen intensified in this period, resulting in measures such as bans on people of Slavic descent joining craft guilds, a doubling of customs tax for Slavic merchants, and bans against public usage of their native language. The more prosperous Slavic citizens were forcibly stripped of their possessions, which were then handed over to Germans. In 1514, the guild of tailors added a \"Wendenparagraph\" to its statutes, banning Slavs.\nWhile not as heavily affected by medieval witchhunts as other regions of the Holy Roman Empire, there are reports of the burning of three women and one man convicted of witchcraft in 1538.\nIn 1570, during the reign of John Frederick, Duke of Pomerania, a congress was held at Stettin ending the Northern Seven Years' War. During the war, Stettin had tended to side with Denmark, while Stralsund tended toward Sweden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as a whole, however, the Duchy of Pomerania tried to maintain neutrality. Nevertheless, a Landtag that had met in Stettin in 1563 introduced a sixfold rise in real estate taxes to finance the raising of a mercenary army for the duchy's defence. Johann Friedrich also succeeded in elevating Stettin to one of only three places allowed to coin money in the Upper Saxon Circle of the Holy Roman Empire, the other two places being Leipzig and Berlin. Bogislaw XIV, who resided in Stettin beginning in 1620, became the sole ruler and Griffin duke when Philipp Julius, Duke of Pomerania died in 1625. Before the Thirty Years' War reached Pomerania, the city, as well as the entire duchy, declined economically due to the decrease in importance of the Hanseatic League and a conflict between Stettin and Frankfurt an der Oder.\n17th to 18th centuries.\nFollowing the Treaty of Stettin of 1630, the town (along with most of Pomerania) was allied to and occupied by the Swedish Empire, which managed to keep the western parts of Pomerania after the death of BogislawXIV in 1637. From the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Stettin became the capital of Swedish Pomerania. Stettin was turned into a major Swedish fortress, which was repeatedly besieged in subsequent wars. The next Treaty of Stettin (1653) did not change this, but due to the downfall of the Swedish Empire after Charles XII, the city went to Prussia in 1720. Instead Stralsund became capital of the last remaining parts of Swedish Pomerania 1720\u20131815.\nThe city was on the path of Polish forces led by Hetman Stefan Czarniecki moving from Denmark during the Second Northern War. Czarniecki, who led his forces to the city, is today mentioned in the Polish anthem, and numerous locations in the city honour his name.\nWars inhibited the city's economic prosperity, which had undergone a deep crisis during the devastation of the Thirty Years' War and was further impeded by the new Swedish-Brandenburg-Prussian frontier, cutting Stettin off from its traditional Farther Pomeranian hinterland. Due to a Plague during the Great Northern War, the city's population dropped from 6,000 people in 1709 to 4,000 in 1711. In 1720, after the Great Northern War, Sweden was forced to cede the city to King Frederick William I of Prussia. Stettin was made the capital city of the Prussian Pomeranian province, since 1815 reorganised as the Province of Pomerania. In 1816, the city had 26,000 inhabitants.\nThe Prussian administration deprived the city of its right to administrative autonomy, abolished guild privileges as well as its status as a staple town, and subsidised manufacturers. Also, colonists were settled in the city, primarily French Huguenots. The French settlers, who numbered more than 600, established a prosperous community, greatly contributed to the city's economic revival, and were treated with reluctance by the German burghers and city authorities.\n19th to 20th centuries.\nIn October 1806, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, believing that he was facing a much larger force, and after receiving a threat of harsh treatment of the city, the Prussian commander Lieutenant General Friedrich von Romberg agreed to surrender the city to the French led by General Lasalle. In fact, Lasalle had only 800 men against Romberg's 5,300 men. In March 1809 Romberg was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for giving up Stettin without a fight. In 1809, also Polish troops were stationed in the city, while the French remained until 1813.\nFrom 1683 to 1812, one Jew was permitted to reside in Stettin, and an additional Jew was allowed to spend a night in the city in case of \"urgent business\". These permissions were repeatedly withdrawn between 1691 and 1716, also between 1726 and 1730 although else the Swedish regulation was continued by the Prussian administration. Only after the Prussian Edict of Emancipation of 11March 1812, which granted Prussian citizenship to all Jews living in the kingdom, did a Jewish community emerge in Stettin, with the first Jews settling in the town in 1814. Construction of a synagogue started in 1834; the community also owned a religious and a secular school, an orphanage since 1855, and a retirement home since 1893. The Jewish community had between 1,000 and 1,200 members by 1873 and between 2,800 and 3,000 members by 1927\u201328. These numbers dropped to 2,701 in 1930 and to 2,322 in late 1934.\nAfter the Franco Prussian war of 1870\u20131871, 1,700 French POWs were imprisoned there in deplorable conditions, resulting in the deaths of 600; After the war, Stettin remained a fortress until 1873. When part of the defensive structures were levelled, a new neighbourhood, \"Neustadt\" (\"New Town\") as well as water pipes, sewerage and drainage, and gas works were built to meet the demands of the growing population.\nStettin developed into a major Prussian port and following the unification of Germany in 1871 became part of the German Empire. While most of the province retained its agrarian character, Stettin was industrialised, and its population rose from 27,000 in 1813 to 210,000 in 1900 and 255,500 in 1925. Major industries that flourished in Stettin from 1840 were shipbuilding, chemical and food industries, and machinery construction. Starting in 1843, Stettin became connected to the major German and Pomeranian cities by railways, and the water connection to the Bay of Pomerania was enhanced by the construction of the Kaiserfahrt (now Piast) canal. The city was also a scientific centre; for example, it was home to the Entomological Society of Stettin.\nOn 20 October 1890, some of the city's Poles created the \"Society of Polish-Catholic Workers\" in the city, one of the first Polish organisations. In 1897, the city's ship works began the construction of the pre-dreadnought battleship \"Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse\". In 1914, before World WarI, the Polish community in the city numbered over 3,000 people, contributing about 2% of the population. These were primarily industrial workers and their families who came from the Pozna\u0144 (Posen) area and a few local wealthy industrialists and merchants. Among them was Kazimierz Pruszak, director of the Gollnow industrial works and a Polish patriot, who predicted the eventual \"return\" of Szczecin to Poland.\nDuring the interwar period, Stettin was Weimar Germany's largest port on the Baltic Sea, and her third-largest port after Hamburg and Bremen. Cars of the Stoewer automobile company were produced in Stettin from 1899 to 1945. By 1939, the Reichsautobahn Berlin\u2013Stettin was completed.\nStettin played a major role as an entrep\u00f4t in the development of the Scottish herring trade with the Continent, peaking at an annual export of more than 400,000 barrels in 1885, 1894 and 1898. Trade flourished until the outbreak of the First World War and resumed on a reduced scale during the years between the wars.\nIn the March 1933 German elections to the Reichstag, the Nazis and German nationalists from the German National People's Party (or DNVP) won most of the votes in the city, together winning 98,626 of 165,331 votes (59.3%), with the NSDAP getting 79,729 (47.9%) and the DNVP 18,897 (11.4%).\nIn 1935, the Wehrmacht made Stettin the headquarters for WehrkreisII, which controlled the military units in all of Mecklenburg and Pomerania. It was also the area headquarters for units stationed at StettinI and II, Swinem\u00fcnde (\u015awinouj\u015bcie), Greifswald, and Stralsund.\nIn the interwar period, the Polish minority numbered 2,000 people, less than 1% of the city's population at that time. A number of Poles were members of the Union of Poles in Germany (ZPN), which was active in the city from 1924. A Polish consulate was located in the city between 1925 and 1939. On the initiative of the consulate and ZPN activist Maksymilian Golisz, a number of Polish institutions were established, e.g., a Polish Scout team and a Polish school. German historian Musekamp writes, \"however, only very few Poles were active in these institutions, which for the most part were headed by employees of the [Polish] consulate.\" The withdrawal of the consulate from these institutions led to a general decline of these activities, which were in part upheld by Golisz and Aleksander Omieczy\u0144ski. Intensified repressions by the Nazis, who exaggerated the Polish activities to propagate an infiltration, led to the closing of the school. In 1938, the head of Szczecin's Union of Poles unit, Stanis\u0142aw Borkowski, was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg. In 1939, all Polish organisations in Stettin were disbanded by the German authorities. Golisz and Omieczy\u0144ski were murdered during the war. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, a street was named after Golisz. According to German historian Jan Musekamp, the activities of the Polish pre-war organizations were exaggerated after World War II for propaganda purposes.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Stettin was the base for the German 2nd Motorised Infantry Division, which cut across the so-called Polish Corridor and was later used in 1940 as an embarkation point for Operation Weser\u00fcbung, Germany's assault on Denmark and Norway.\nOn 15 October 1939, neighbouring municipalities were joined to Stettin, creating Gro\u00df-Stettin, with about 380,000 inhabitants, in 1940. The city had become the third-largest German city by area, after Berlin and Hamburg.\nAs the war started, the number of non-Germans in the city increased as slave workers were brought in. The first transports came in 1939 from Bydgoszcz, Toru\u0144 and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. They were mainly used in a synthetic silk factory near Stettin. The next wave of slave workers was brought in 1940, in addition to PoWs who were used for work in the agricultural industry. According to German police reports from 1940, 15,000 Polish slave workers lived within the city.\nDuring the war, 135 forced labour camps for slave workers were established in the city. Most of the 25,000 slave workers were Poles, but Czechs, Italians, Frenchmen and Belgians, as well as Dutch citizens, were also enslaved in the camps. A Nazi prison was also operated in the city, with forced labour subcamps in the region.\nIn February 1940, the Jews of Stettin were deported to the Lublin reservation. International press reports emerged, describing how the Nazis forced Jews, regardless of age, condition and gender, to sign away all property and loaded them onto trains headed to the camp, escorted by members of the SA and SS. Due to publicity given to the event, German institutions ordered such future actions to be made in a way unlikely to attract public notice. The action was the first deportation of Jews from prewar territory in Nazi Germany.\nAllied air raids in 1944 and heavy fighting between the German and Soviet armies destroyed 65% of Stettin's buildings and almost all of the city centre, the seaport, and local industries. Polish Home Army intelligence assisted in pinpointing targets for Allied bombing in the area of Stettin. The city itself was covered by the Home Army's \"Ba\u0142tyk\" structure, and Polish resistance infiltrated Stettin's naval yards. Other activities of the resistance consisted of smuggling people, including Polish and British POWs who escaped from German captivity, to Sweden, and distribution of Polish underground press.\nThe Soviet Red Army captured the city on 26April 1945. While the majority of the almost 400,000 inhabitants had left the city, between 6,000 and 20,000 inhabitants remained in late April.\nOn 28 April 1945 Polish authorities tried to gain control, but in the following month, the Polish administration was twice forced to leave. The reason for this was, according to Polish sources, that the Western Allies raised protest against the Soviet and Polish policy of creating a fait-accomplit in Eastern Germany. Finally the permanent handover occurred on 5July 1945. In the meantime, part of the German population had returned, believing it might become part of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. The Soviet authorities had already appointed the German Communists Erich Spiegel and Erich Wiesner as mayors. Stettin is located mostly west of the Oder River, which was expected to become Poland's new western border, placing Stettin in East Germany. This would have been in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement between the victorious Allied powers, which envisaged the new border to be in \"a line running from the Baltic Sea immediately west of Swinem\u00fcnde, and thence along the Oder River[...]\". Because of the returnees, the German population of the town swelled to 84,000. The mortality rate was at 20%, primarily due to starvation. However, Stettin and the mouth of the Oder River became Polish on 5July 1945, as had been decided in a treaty signed on 26July 1944 between the Soviet Union and the Soviet-controlled Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) (also known as \"the Lublin Poles\", as contrasted with the London-based Polish government-in-exile). On 4October 1945, the decisive land border of Poland was established west of the 1945 line, and the city was renamed to its historic Polish name Szczecin, but the area excluded the Police area, the Oder River itself and the port of Szczecin, which remained under Soviet administration. The Oder River was handed over to Polish administration in September 1946, followed by the port between February 1946 and May 1954.\nPost-war.\nWhile the number of pre-war inhabitants dropped to 57,215 on 31 October 1945, the systematic expulsion of Germans started on 22 February 1946 and continued until late 1947, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. In December 1946 about 17,000 German inhabitants remained, while the number of Poles living in the city reached 100,000. To ease the tensions between settlers from different regions, and help overcome fear caused by the continued presence of the Soviet troops, a special event was organised in April 1946 with 50,000 visitors in the partly destroyed city centre. Settlers from Central Poland made up about 70% of Szczecin's new population. In addition to Poles, Ukrainians from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union settled there. Also Poles repatriated from Harbin, China and Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in Szczecin in the following years. In 1945 and 1946, the city was the starting point of the northern route used by the Jewish underground organisation Brichah to channel Jewish displaced persons from Central and Eastern Europe to the American occupation zone. By 1950, the entire German population of the city had been expelled.\nSzczecin was rebuilt, and the city's industry was expanded. At the same time, Szczecin became a major Polish industrial centre and an important seaport (particularly for Silesian coal) for Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany. Cultural expansion was accompanied by a campaign resulting in the \"removal of all German traces\". In 1946, Winston Churchill prominently mentioned the city in his Iron Curtain speech: \"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent\".\nThe city witnessed anti-communist revolts in 1956, 1970 and 1980. On 30 August 1980, first of the four \"August Agreements\", which led to the first legalisation of the trade union Solidarity, was signed in Szczecin. The introduction of martial law in December 1981 met with a strike by the dockworkers of Szczecin shipyard, joined by other factories and workplaces in a general strike. All these were suppressed by the communist authorities. Pope John Paul II visited the city on 11June 1987. Another wave of strikes in Szczecin broke out in 1988 and 1989, which eventually led to the Round Table Agreement and first semi-free elections in post-war Poland.\nSzczecin has been the capital of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nSzczecin has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"), typical of Western Pomerania. The winters are colder than on the immediate coast and the summers are warm, but still with some moderation, especially due to the Baltic Sea.\nThe average air temperature in Szczecin ranges from 8 to 8.4\u00a0\u00b0C. The hottest month is July with a temperature of 15.8\u00a0\u00b0C to 20.3\u00a0\u00b0C, the coldest January from -1.1\u00a0\u00b0C to 2.6\u00a0\u00b0C. Air temperature below 0\u00a0\u00b0C occurs on average over 86 days a year, most frequently in January and February. The average annual rainfall is 537\u00a0mm, the average rainfall in the cool half-year is 225\u00a0mm, and in the warmer half-year is 350\u00a0mm. On average, 167 days with precipitation occurs.\nArchitecture and urban planning.\nSzczecin's architectural style reflects trends popular in the last half of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century: Academic art (historicist Gr\u00fcnderzeit) and Art Nouveau. In many areas built after 1945, especially in the city centre, which had been partly destroyed due to Allied bombing, social realism is prevalent.\nThe city has an abundance of green areas: parks and avenues\u00a0\u2013\u00a0wide streets with trees planted in the island separating opposing traffic (where often tram tracks are laid); and roundabouts corresponding to the Orion constellation. Szczecin's city plan resembles that of Paris, mostly because Szczecin was remodelled in the 1880s according to a design by Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, who had redesigned Paris under Napol\u00e9on III. This pattern of street design is still used in Szczecin, as many recently built (or modified) city areas include roundabouts and avenues.\nDuring the city's reconstruction in the aftermath of World War II, the communist authorities of Poland wanted the city's architecture to reflect an old Polish Piast era. Since no buildings from that time existed, instead Gothic as well as Renaissance buildings were picked as worthy of conservation. The motivation behind this decision was that Renaissance architecture was used by the Griffin dynasty, which had Lechitic and West Slavic roots and was seen to be of Piast extraction by some historians. This view was manifested, for example, by erecting respective memorials, and the naming of streets and enterprises, while German traces were replaced by symbols of three main categories: Piasts, the martyrdom of Poles, and gratitude to the Soviet and Polish armies which had ended the Nazi atrocities against Polish citizens.\nThe ruins of the former Griffin residence, initially renamed \"Piast Palace\", also played a central role in this concept and were reconstructed in Renaissance style, with all traces of later eras removed. In general, post-Renaissance buildings, especially those from the 19th and early 20th centuries, were deemed unworthy of conservation until the 1970s, and were in part used in the \"Bricks for Warsaw\" campaign (an effort to rebuild Warsaw after it had been systematically razed following the Warsaw Uprising): with 38 million bricks, Szczecin became Poland's largest brick supplier. The Old Town was rebuilt in the late 1990s, with new buildings, some of which were reconstructions of buildings destroyed in World WarII.\nThe Gothic monuments preserved to this day are parts of European Route of Brick Gothic, along with monuments of other Pomeranian cities, e.g. Stargard, Kamie\u0144 Pomorski, S\u0142awno and Che\u0142mno.\nA portion of the Szczecin Landscape Park in the forest of Puszcza Bukowa lies within Szczecin's boundaries.\nSzczecin contains 28 extant historic water pumps, known as Szczecin pumps or Berliners, which are a popular tourist attraction due to their colorful and intricate design. Fresh water for the city is supplied from nearby Lake Miedwie.\nMunicipal administration.\nThe city is administratively divided into districts (Polish: \"dzielnica\"), which are further divided into smaller neighbourhoods. The governing bodies of the latter serve the role of auxiliary local government bodies called \"Neighbourhood Councils\" (Polish: \"Rady Osiedla\"). Elections for neighbourhood councils are held up to six months after each City Council election. Voter turnout is rather low (on 20May 2007 it ranged from 1.03% to 27.75% and was 3.78% on average). Councillors are responsible mostly for small infrastructure like trees, park benches, playgrounds, etc. Other functions are mostly advisory.\nOther historical neighbourhoods.\nBabin, Barnucin, Basen G\u00f3rniczy, B\u0142\u0119d\u00f3w, Boleszyce, Bystrzyk, Cieszyce, Cie\u015bnik, Dolina, Drzetowo, Dunikowo, Glinki, Grabowo, Jezierzyce, Kaliny, K\u0119pa Barnicka, Kijewko, Kluczewko, K\u0142obucko, Kniewo, Kra\u015bnica, Krzekosz\u00f3w, Lotnisko, \u0141asztownia, Niemierzyn, Odolany, Oleszna, Podb\u00f3rz, Port, Osiedle Przyja\u017ani, Rogatka, Rudnik, Sienna, Skoki, S\u0142owie\u0144sko, Sosn\u00f3wko, Stark\u00f3w, Stoki, Struga, \u015amierdnica, os.\u015awierczewskie, Trzebusz, Urok, Widok, Zdunowo.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSince the 12th-century Christianization of the city, the majority of the population were Catholics, then since the Renaissance era, up to the end of World War II, the majority of the population were Protestants (93% in 1890), and since 1945, the majority are again Catholics. Historically, the number of inhabitants doubled from 6,081 in 1720, to 12,360 in 1740, and reached 21,255 in 1812, with only 476 Catholics and 5 Jews. By 1852 the population was 48,028, and 58,487 ten years later (1861), including 1,065 Catholics and 1,438 Jews. In 1885, it was 99,543, and by 1905 it ballooned to 224,119 settlers (incl. the military), among them 209,152 Protestants, 8,635 Catholics and 3,010 Jews. In 1939, the number of inhabitants reached 268,421 persons according to German sources including 233,424 Protestants, 10,845 Catholics, and 1,102 Jews. The current population of Szczecin by comparison was 406,427 in 2009. Following the Revolution of Dignity, Szczecin, much like most other major urban centers in Poland, saw an unprecedented influx of foreign nationals, an overwhelming majority of them Ukrainians; in July 2017 26 thousand of them were officially registered as living and working in Szczecin, with unofficial estimates going as high as 50 thousand, thus making up more than 10% of the city's inhabitants.\nPolitics.\nRecently, the city has favoured the centre right Civic Platform. Nearly two-thirds (64.54%) of votes cast in the second round of the 2010 presidential election went to the Civic Platform's Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski, and in the following year's Polish parliamentary election the party won 46.75% of the vote in the Szczecin constituency with Law and Justice second garnering 21.66% and Palikot's Movement third with 11.8%.\nArts and entertainment.\nThere are a few theatres and cinemas in Szczecin:\nand many historic places as:\nThe statue, Monument of Sailor stands at the Grunwald Square at John Paul II Avenue.\nLocal cuisine.\nThe local cuisine in Szczecin was mostly shaped in the mid-20th century by people who settled in the city from other parts and regions of Poland, including the former Eastern Borderlands. The most renowned dishes of the area are \"pasztecik szczeci\u0144ski\" and \"paprykarz szczeci\u0144ski\". Other local traditional foods and drinks include Szczecin gingerbread and beer.\n\"Pasztecik szczeci\u0144ski\" is a deep-fried yeast dough traditionally stuffed with minced meat (pork and beef) or vegetarian filling - cheese and mushrooms or cabbage and mushrooms, served in specialised bars as a fast food. The first bar serving \"pasztecik szczeci\u0144ski\", Bar \"Pasztecik\", founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46 in the centre of Szczecin. \"Pasztecik szczeci\u0144ski\" is usually served with clear red borscht.\n\"Paprykarz szczeci\u0144ski\" is a paste made by mixing fish paste (around 50%) with rice, onion, tomato concentrate, vegetable oil, salt and a mixture of spices including chili powder to put it on a sandwich. It is available in most grocery stores in the country.\nSzczecin gingerbread (\"pierniki szczeci\u0144skie\") is a traditional local gingerbread glazed with chocolate or sugar with decorations mostly referring either to the city's architecture or to maritime motifs.\nSzczecin beer (\"piwo szczeci\u0144skie\") includes various types of traditional local Polish beer: light, amber, and wheat beer. The city's brewing traditions go back over a thousand years.\nThe word \"\"szczeci\u0144ski\" or \"szczeci\u0144skie\"\" in the names of the products is an adjective from the name of the city of Szczecin, the place of its origin.\nSports.\nThere are many popular professional sports teams in Szczecin area. The most popular sport today is probably football thanks to Pogo\u0144 Szczecin. Amateur sports are played by thousands of Szczecin citizens and also in schools of all levels (elementary, secondary, university).\nOther notable teams:\nAs can be seen above, many teams in Szczecin are named after Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w, a team from the Eastern Borderlands.\nAmateur leagues.\nCyclic events.\nEvery year in September the men's tennis tournament Pekao Szczecin Open is held in Szczecin. In August, a marathon is organized in Szczecin.\nEconomy and transport.\nEconomy.\nSzczecin is a center of the maritime economy; it employs 13279 people. The seaport of Szczecin serves shipowners from all over the world and is the home port of two shipping companies: Polsteam and Euroafrica. In addition, other maritime-related companies are headquartered here.\nIn 2013, a subzone of the Szczecin-Kostrzyn-Slubice Special Economic Zone was established.\nAs of September 2016, the number of registered unemployed in Szczecin included about 8,400 residents, representing an unemployment rate of 5.0% to the economically active population.\nThe average employee salary in October 2012 was PLN 3807.73, with the number of employed workers in Szczecin - 90,754 people. According to data from the District Labor Office in Szczecin, effective 1 January 2023, the minimum wage is PLN 3490, while the average salary of residents of the capital of West Pomerania is at PLN 6733.49.\nIn 2009, the average gross monthly salary in the enterprise sector in Szczecin was PLN 3439.94.\nSzczecin's GDP is PLN 20.255 billion, which is 1/3 of the GDP of the entire province. There are 49497 zlotys per capita, about 40% more than the result for the province.\nAir.\nSzczecin is served by Solidarity Szczecin\u2013Goleni\u00f3w Airport, which is northeast of central Szczecin. There is also a grass airstrip within city limits, the Szczecin-D\u0105bie Airstrip.\nTrams.\nSzczecin has a tram network comprising 12 tram lines serving 95 tram stops and measuring in length. Tram transport is operated by the Tramwaje Szczeci\u0144skie (TS).\nSzczecin's first horse tram opened in 1879, running from Ga\u0142czy\u0144skiego Square to Staszica Street. In 1896, the first line using electric traction was opened. By 1900, the horse trams had been entirely replaced by electric trams.\nBuses.\nSzczecin has a bus network of 70 bus routes. Bus transport is operated by 4companies: SPA D\u0105bie, SPA Klonowica, SPPK and PKS Szczecin.\nOf all bus routes, 50 lines are designated as normal. At nighttime, Szczecin is served by a night bus network of 16 routes. There are also 7express bus lines, which do not serve all stops on their route.\nRoads.\nThe recently upgraded A6 motorway serves as the southern bypass of the city, and connects to the German A11 autobahn (portions of which are currently undergoing upgrade), from where one can reach Berlin in about 90 minutes (about ). Other important highways are the S3 Expressway, linking Szczecin with the more southern cities of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski, Zielona G\u00f3ra and Legnica, and the S6 Expressway, connecting Szczecin with Koszalin (and eventually Gda\u0144sk once the easternmost section is completed). Through intersections with other highways, Szczecin has convenient highway connections with a number of other major Polish cities, such as Pozna\u0144, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Wroc\u0142aw, Katowice, Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. Also planned is the construction of the S10 highway to connect the city with Bydgoszcz, Toru\u0144, P\u0142ock and Warsaw.\nRail.\nThe main railway station\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Szczecin G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is situated in the city centre (Kolumba Street). Szczecin has good railway connections with \"Solidarity\" Szczecin\u2013Goleni\u00f3w Airport and the rest of Poland, e.g., \u015awinouj\u015bcie, Ko\u0142obrzeg, Pozna\u0144, Wroc\u0142aw, Warsaw and Gda\u0144sk. Szczecin is also connected with Germany (Berlin (Gesundbrunnen) and through Pasewalk to Neubrandenburg and L\u00fcbeck), but only by two single-track, non-electrified lines. Because of this, the rail connection between Berlin and Szczecin is much slower and less convenient than what is typical for two European cities of that size and proximity.\nPort.\nThe Port of Szczecin is the third largest port in Poland and handles over 32million tons of cargo annually. This is a harbour of the Baltic Sea and the Oder river.\nFamous people.\nOver the long course of its history Szczecin has been a place of birth and of residence for many famous individuals, including Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, composer Carl Loewe, writer Alfred D\u00f6blin, actress Dita Parlo, mathematician Hermann G\u00fcnther Grassmann, Roman Catholic priest Carl Lampert, poet Konstanty Ildefons Ga\u0142czy\u0144ski, Helena Majdaniec \u2013 \"the queen of Polish Twist\", and singer Violetta Villas.\nInternational relations.\nConsulates.\nThere are 15 honorary consulates in Szczecin, of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Norway, Sweden and Ukraine.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nSzczecin is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; travel guide from Wikivoyage"}

{"id": "28462", "revid": "29707892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28462", "title": "Sudbury Neutrino Observatory", "text": "Underground laboratory in Ontario, Canada\nThe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was a neutrino observatory located 2100\u00a0m underground in Vale's Creighton Mine in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The detector was designed to detect solar neutrinos through their interactions with a large tank of heavy water.\nThe detector was turned on in May 1999, and was turned off on 28 November 2006. The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken.\nThe director of the experiment, Art McDonald, was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015 for the experiment's contribution to the discovery of neutrino oscillation.\nThe underground laboratory has been enlarged into a permanent facility and now operates multiple experiments as SNOLAB. The SNO equipment itself was being refurbished for use in the SNO+ experiment.\nExperimental motivation.\nThe first measurements of the number of solar neutrinos reaching the Earth were taken in the 1960s, and all experiments prior to SNO observed a third to a half fewer neutrinos than were predicted by the Standard Solar Model. As several experiments confirmed this deficit the effect became known as the solar neutrino problem. Over several decades many ideas were put forward to try to explain the effect, one of which was the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations. All of the solar neutrino detectors prior to SNO had been sensitive primarily or exclusively to electron neutrinos and yielded little to no information on muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos.\nIn 1984, Herb Chen of the University of California at Irvine first pointed out the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos. Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other reaction sensitive to only electron neutrino. Thus, such a detector could measure neutrino oscillations directly. A location in Canada was attractive because Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, which maintains large stockpiles of heavy water to support its CANDU reactor power plants, was willing to lend the necessary amount (worth at market prices) at no cost.\nThe Creighton Mine in Sudbury is among the deepest in the world and, accordingly, experiences a very small background flux of radiation. It was quickly identified as an ideal place for Chen's proposed experiment to be built, and the mine management was willing to make the location available for only incremental costs.\nThe SNO collaboration held its first meeting in 1984. At the time it competed with TRIUMF's KAON Factory proposal for federal funding, and the wide variety of universities backing SNO quickly led to it being selected for development. The official go-ahead was given in 1990.\nThe experiment observed the light produced by relativistic electrons in the water created by neutrino interactions. As relativistic electrons travel through a medium, they lose energy producing a cone of blue light through the Cherenkov effect, and it is this light that is directly detected.\nDetector description.\nThe SNO detector target consisted of of heavy water contained in a acrylic vessel. The detector cavity outside the vessel was filled with normal water to provide both buoyancy for the vessel and radiation shielding. The heavy water was viewed by approximately 9,600 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) mounted on a geodesic sphere at a radius of about . The cavity housing the detector was the largest in the world at such a depth, requiring a variety of high-performance rock bolting techniques to prevent rock bursts. The mining was completed in May 1993.\nThe observatory is located at the end of a drift, named the \"SNO drift\", isolating it from other mining operations. Along the drift are a number of operations and equipment rooms, all held in a clean room setting. Most of the facility is Class 3000 (fewer than 3,000 particles of 1\u00a0\u03bcm or larger per 1\u00a0ft3 of air) but the final cavity containing the detector is an even stricter Class 100.\nCharged current interaction.\nIn the charged current interaction, a neutrino converts the neutron in a deuteron to a proton. The neutrino is absorbed in the reaction and an electron is produced. Solar neutrinos have energies smaller than the mass of muons and tau leptons, so only electron neutrinos can participate in this reaction. The emitted electron carries off most of the neutrino's energy, on the order of 5\u201315\u00a0MeV, and is detectable. The proton which is produced does not have enough energy to be detected easily. The electrons produced in this reaction are emitted in all directions, but there is a slight tendency for them to point back in the direction from which the neutrino came.\nNeutral current interaction.\nIn the neutral current interaction, a neutrino dissociates the deuteron, breaking it into its constituent neutron and proton. The neutrino continues on with slightly less energy, and all three neutrino flavours are equally likely to participate in this interaction. Heavy water has a small cross section for neutrons, but when neutrons are captured by a deuterium nucleus, a gamma ray (photon) with roughly 6\u00a0MeV of energy is produced. The direction of the gamma ray is completely uncorrelated with the direction of the neutrino. Some of the neutrons produced from the dissociated deuterons make their way through the acrylic vessel into the light water jacket surrounding the heavy water, and since light water has a very large cross section for neutron capture, these neutrons are captured very quickly. Gamma rays of roughly 2.2\u00a0MeV are produced in this reaction, but because the energy of the photons is less than the detector's energy threshold (meaning they do not trigger the photomultipliers), they are not directly observable. However, when the gamma ray collides with an electron via Compton scattering, the accelerated electron can be detected through Cherenkov radiation.\nElectron elastic scattering.\nIn the elastic scattering interaction, a neutrino collides with an atomic electron and imparts some of its energy to the electron. All three neutrinos can participate in this interaction through the exchange of the neutral Z boson, and electron neutrinos can also participate with the exchange of a charged W boson. For this reason this interaction is dominated by electron neutrinos, and this is the channel through which the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector can observe solar neutrinos. This interaction is the relativistic equivalent of billiards, and for this reason the electrons produced usually point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling (away from the sun). Because this interaction takes place on atomic electrons it occurs with the same rate in both the heavy and light water.\nExperimental results and impact.\nThe first scientific results of SNO were published on 18 June 2001, and presented the first clear evidence that neutrinos oscillate (i.e. that they can transmute into one another), as they travel from the Sun. This oscillation, in turn, implies that neutrinos have non-zero masses. The total flux of all neutrino flavours measured by SNO agrees well with theoretical predictions. Further measurements carried out by SNO have since confirmed and improved the precision of the original result.\nAlthough Super-K had beaten SNO to the punch, having published evidence for neutrino oscillation as early as 1998, the Super-K results were not conclusive and did not specifically deal with solar neutrinos. SNO's results were the first to directly demonstrate oscillations in solar neutrinos. This was important to the standard solar model. In 2007, the Franklin Institute awarded the director of SNO Art McDonald with the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics. In 2015 the Nobel Prize for Physics was jointly awarded to Arthur B. McDonald, and Takaaki Kajita of the University of Tokyo, for the discovery of neutrino oscillations.\nOther possible analyses.\nThe SNO detector would have been capable of detecting a supernova within our galaxy if one had occurred while the detector was online. As neutrinos emitted by a supernova are released earlier than the photons, it is possible to alert the astronomical community before the supernova is visible. SNO was a founding member of the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) with Super-Kamiokande and the Large Volume Detector. No such supernovae have yet been detected.\nThe SNO experiment was also able to observe atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere. Due to the limited size of the SNO detector in comparison with Super-K, the low cosmic ray neutrino signal is not statistically significant at neutrino energies below 1\u00a0GeV.\nCVMR\u2019s Participation in the SNO Project.\nhttps:// (Chemical Vapour Metal Refining) played a significant role in the development of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) by supplying approximately 1,200 nickel tubes manufactured using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. According to the company\u2019s official documentation , this method produced ultra-high-purity nickel with extremely low concentrations of radioactive impurities such as uranium and thorium, which was essential for the performance of SNO\u2019s highly sensitive neutron detectors. Studies on the project confirm that the use of CVD nickel reduced radioactive contaminants by up to six orders of magnitude, ensuring the required radiopurity for neutrino measurements . The tubes supplied by CVMR formed the basis of the proportional neutron detectors (NCDs), contributing significantly to the observatory\u2019s scientific success.\nParticipating institutions.\nLarge particle physics experiments require large collaborations. With approximately 100 collaborators, SNO was a rather small group compared to collider experiments. The participating institutions have included:\nCanada.\nAlthough no longer a collaborating institution, Chalk River Laboratories led the construction of the acrylic vessel that holds the heavy water, and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited was the source of the heavy water.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28464", "revid": "320466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28464", "title": "Super-Kamiokande", "text": "Japanese neutrino observatory\nSuper-Kamiokande (abbreviation of Super-Kamioka Neutrino Detection Experiment, also abbreviated to Super-K or SK; ) is a neutrino observatory located under Mount Ikeno near the city of Hida, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. It is operated by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo with the help of an international team. It is located 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft) underground in the Mozumi Mine in Hida's Kamioka area. The observatory was designed to detect high-energy neutrinos, to search for proton decay, study solar and atmospheric neutrinos, and keep watch for supernovae in the Milky Way galaxy.\nDescription.\nSuper-K is located underground in the Mozumi Mine in Hida's Kamioka area. It consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank that is tall and in diameter holding 50,220 tonnes (55,360 US tons) of ultrapure water. The tank volume is divided by a stainless steel superstructure into an inner detector (ID) region, which is in height and in diameter, and outer detector (OD) which consists of the remaining tank volume. Mounted on the superstructure are 11,146 photomultiplier tubes (PMT) in diameter that face the ID and 1,885 PMTs that face the OD. A Tyvek and blacksheet barrier attached to the superstructure optically separates the ID and OD.\nA neutrino interaction with the electrons or nuclei of water can produce a charged particle that moves faster than the speed of light in water, which is slower than the speed of light in vacuum. This creates a cone of light known as Cherenkov radiation, which is the optical equivalent to a sonic boom. The Cherenkov light is projected as a ring on the wall of the detector and recorded by the PMTs. Using the timing and charge information recorded by each PMT, the interaction vertex, ring direction, and flavor of the incoming neutrino is determined. From the sharpness of the edge of the ring the type of particle can be inferred. The multiple scattering of electrons is large, so electromagnetic showers produce fuzzy rings. Highly relativistic muons, in contrast, travel almost straight through the detector and produce rings with sharp edges.\nHistory.\nConstruction of the predecessor of the present Kamioka Observatory, the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo began in 1982 and was completed in April 1983. The purpose of the observatory was to determine the existence of proton decay, one of the most fundamental questions of elementary particle physics.\nThe detector, named KamiokaNDE for Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment, was a tank in height and in width, containing 3,058 tonnes (3,400 US tons) of pure water and about 1,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) attached to its inner surface. The detector was upgraded, starting in 1985, to allow it to observe solar neutrinos. As a result, the detector (KamiokaNDE-II) had become sensitive enough to detect ten neutrinos from SN 1987A, a supernova which was observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud in February 1987, and to observe solar neutrinos in 1988. The ability of the Kamiokande experiment to observe the direction of electrons produced in solar neutrino interactions allowed experimenters to directly demonstrate for the first time that the Sun was a source of neutrinos.\nWhile making discoveries in neutrino astronomy and neutrino astrophysics, Kamiokande never detected a proton decay, the primary goal for its construction. The absence of any such observation pushed back the possible half-life of any potential proton decay far enough to eliminate some of the GUT models which allow for such a decay. Other models predict a longer half-life, with rarer decays.\nTo increase the chance of detecting such decays, a larger detector was needed. A higher sensitivity was also necessary to obtain a higher statistical confidence in other detections. This led to the design and construction of Super-Kamiokande, with fifteen times the volume of water and ten times as many PMTs as Kamiokande.\nThe Super-Kamiokande project was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture in 1991 for total funding of approximately $100\u00a0million. The American portion of the proposal, which was primarily to build the OD system, was approved by the United States Department of Energy in 1993 for $3 million. In addition, the United States has also contributed about 2000 20\u00a0cm PMTs recycled from the IMB experiment.\nSuper-Kamiokande started operation in 1996 and announced the first evidence of neutrino oscillation in 1998. This was the first experimental observation supporting the theory that the neutrino has non-zero mass, a possibility that theorists had speculated about for years. The 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Super-Kamiokande researcher Takaaki Kajita alongside Arthur McDonald at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory for their work confirming neutrino oscillation.\nOn 12 November 2001, about 6,600 of the photomultiplier tubes imploded in a chain reaction, as the shock wave from the concussion of each imploding tube cracked its neighbours. The detector was partially restored by redistributing the photomultiplier tubes which did not implode, and by adding protective acrylic shells that are hoped will prevent another chain reaction from recurring (Super-Kamiokande-II).\nIn July 2005, preparations began to restore the detector to its original form by reinstalling about 6,000 PMTs. The work was completed in June 2006, whereupon the detector was renamed Super-Kamiokande-III. This phase of the experiment collected data from October 2006 till August 2008. At that time, significant upgrades were made to the electronics. After the upgrade, the new phase of the experiment has been referred to as Super-Kamiokande-IV. SK-IV collected data on various natural sources of neutrinos, as well as acted as the far detector for the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.\nSK-IV continued until June 2018. After that, the detector underwent a full refurbishment during Autumn of 2018. On 29 January 2019 the detector resumed data acquisition.\nIn 2020, the detector was upgraded for the SuperKGd project by adding a gadolinium salt to the ultrapure water in order to enable the detection of antineutrinos from supernova explosions.\nDetector.\nThe Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a Cherenkov detector used to study neutrinos from different sources including the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and accelerators. It is also used to search for proton decay. The experiment began in April 1996 and was shut down for maintenance in July 2001, a period known as \"SK-I\". Since an accident occurred during maintenance, the experiment resumed in October 2002 with only half of its original number of ID-PMTs.\nIn order to prevent further accidents, all of the ID-PMTs were covered by fiber-reinforced plastic with acrylic front windows. This phase from October 2002 to another closure for an entire reconstruction in October 2005 is called \"SK-II\". In July 2006, the experiment resumed with the full number of PMTs and stopped in September 2008 for electronics upgrades. This period was known as \"SK-III\". The period after 2008 is known as \"SK-IV\". The phases and their main characteristics are summarised in table 1.\nSK-IV upgrade.\nIn the previous phases, the ID-PMTs processed signals by custom electronics modules called analog timing modules (ATMs). Charge-to-analog converters (QAC) and time-to-analog converters (TAC) are contained in these modules that had dynamic range from 0 to 450 picocoulombs (pC) with 0.2\u00a0pC resolution for charge and from \u2212300 to 1000\u00a0ns with 0.4\u00a0ns resolution for time. There were two pairs of QAC/TAC for each PMT input signal, this prevented dead time and allowed the readout of multiple sequential hits that may arise, \"e.g.\", from electrons that are decay products of stopping muons.\nThe SK system was upgraded in September 2008 in order to maintain the stability in the next decade and improve the throughput of the data acquisition systems, QTC-based electronics with Ethernet (QBEE). The QBEE provides high-speed signal processing by combining pipelined components. These components are a newly developed custom charge-to-time converter (QTC) in the form of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a multi-hit time-to-digital converter (TDC), and field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Each QTC input has three gain ranges \"Small\", \"Medium\", and \"Large\" \u2013 the resolutions for each are shown in Table.\nFor each range, analog-to-digital conversion is conducted separately, but the only range used is that with the highest resolution that is not being saturated. The overall charge dynamic range of the QTC is 0.2\u20132500\u00a0pC, five times larger than the old . The charge and timing resolution of the QBEE at the single photoelectron level is 0.1 photoelectrons and 0.3\u00a0ns respectively, both are better than the intrinsic resolution of the 20-in. PMTs used in SK. The QBEE achieves good charge linearity over a wide dynamic range. The integrated charge linearity of the electronics is better than 1%. The thresholds of the discriminators in the QTC are set to \u22120.69\u00a0mV (equivalent to 0.25 photoelectron, which is the same as for SK-III). This threshold was chosen to replicate the behavior of the detector during its previous ATM-based phases.\nSuperKGd.\nGadolinium was introduced into the Super-Kamiokande water tank in 2020 in order to distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos that arise from supernova explosions. This is known as the SK-Gd project (other names include SuperKGd, SUPERK-GD, and similar names). In the first phase of the project, 1.3 tons of a Gd salt (gadolinium sulfate octahydrate, ) were added to the ultrapure water in 2020, giving 0.02% (by mass) of the salt. This amount is about a tenth of the planned final target concentration.\nNuclear fusion in the Sun and other stars turns protons into neutrons with the emission of neutrinos. Beta decay in the Earth and in supernovas turns neutrons into protons with the emission of anti-neutrinos. The Super-Kamiokande detects electrons knocked off a water molecule producing a flash of blue Cherenkov light, and these are produced both by neutrinos and antineutrinos. A rarer instance is when an antineutrino interacts with a proton in water to produce a neutron and a positron.\nGadolinium has an affinity for neutrons and produces a bright flash of gamma rays when it absorbs one. Adding gadolinium to the Super-Kamiokande allows it to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Antineutrinos produce a double flash of light about 30 microseconds apart, first when the neutrino hits a proton and second when gadolinium absorbs a neutron. The brightness of the first flash allows physicists to distinguish between low-energy antineutrinos from the Earth and high-energy antineutrinos from supernovas. In addition to observing neutrinos from distant supernovas, the Super-Kamiokande will be able to set off an alarm to inform astronomers around the world of the presence of a supernova in the Milky Way within one second of it occurring.\nThe biggest challenge was whether the detector's water could be continuously filtered to remove impurities without removing the gadolinium at the same time. A 200-ton prototype called EGADS with added gadolinium sulfate was installed in the Kamioka mine and operated for years. It finished operation in 2018 and showed that the new water purification system would remove impurities while keeping the gadolinium concentration stable. It also showed that gadolinium sulfate would not significantly impair the transparency of the otherwise ultrapure water, or cause corrosion or deposition on existing equipment or on the new valves that will later be installed in the Hyper-Kamiokande.\nWater tank.\nThe outer shell of the water tank is a cylindrical stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The tank is self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the tank is filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 kilotonnes of water.\nPMTs and associate structure.\nThe basic unit for the ID PMTs is a \"supermodule\", a frame which supports a 3\u00d74 array of PMTs. Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width, and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames are connected to each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected to the bottom of the tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, super module simplified the initial assembly of the ID.\nEach supermodule was assembled on the tank floor and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with super module. During installation, ID PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.\nCables from each group of three PMTs are bundled together. All cables run up the outer surface of the PMT support structure, \"i.e.\", on the OD PMT plane, pass through cable ports at the top of the tank, and are then routed into the electronics huts.\nThe thickness of the OD varies slightly, but is on average about 2.6 m on top and bottom, and 2.7 m on the barrel wall, giving the OD a total mass of 18 kilotons. OD PMTs were distributed with 302 on the top layer, 308 on the bottom, and 1275 on the barrel wall.\nTo protect against low-energy background radiation from radon decay products in the air, the roof of the cavity and the access tunnels were sealed with a coating called Mine guard. Mine guard is a spray-applied polyurethane membrane developed for use as a rock support system and radon gas barrier in the mining industry.\nThe average geomagnetic field is about 450 mG and is inclined by about 45\u00b0 with respect to the horizon at the detector site. This presents a problem for the large and very sensitive PMTs which prefer a much lower ambient field. The strength and uniform direction of the geomagnetic field could systematically bias photoelectron trajectories and timing in the PMTs. To counteract this 26 sets of horizontal and vertical Helmholtz coils are arranged around the inner surfaces of the tank. With these in operation the average field in the detector is reduced to about 50\u00a0mG. The magnetic field at various PMT locations were measured before the tank was filled with water.\nA standard fiducial volume of approximately 22.5 kilo tonnes is defined as the region inside a surface drawn 2.00 m from the ID wall to minimize the anomalous response caused by natural radioactivity in the surrounding rock.\nMonitoring system.\nOnline monitoring system.\nAn online monitor computer located in the control room reads data from the DAQ host computer via an FDDI link. It provides shift operators with a flexible tool for selecting event display features, makes online and recent-history histograms to monitor detector performance, and performs a variety of additional tasks needed to efficiently monitor status and diagnose detector and DAQ problems. Events in the data stream can be skimmed off and elementary analysis tools can be applied to check data quality during calibrations or after changes in hardware or online software.\nRealtime supernova monitor.\nTo detect and identify such bursts as efficiently and promptly as possible Super-Kamiokande is equipped with an online supernova monitor system. About 10,000 total events are expected in Super-Kamiokande for a supernova explosion at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Super-Kamiokande can measure a burst with no dead-time, up to 30,000 events within the first second of a burst. Theoretical calculations of supernova explosions suggest that neutrinos are emitted over a total time-scale of tens of seconds with about a half of them emitted during the first one or two seconds. The Super-K will search for event clusters in specified time windows of 0.5, 2, and 10\u00a0s.\nData are transmitted to realtime SN-watch analysis process every 2 minutes and analysis is completed typically in 1\u00a0minute. When supernova (SN) event candidates are found, formula_1 is calculated if the event multiplicity is larger than 16, where formula_1 is defined as the average spatial distance between events, i.e.\nformula_3\nNeutrinos from supernovae interact with free protons, producing positrons which are distributed so uniformly in the detector that formula_1 for SN events should be significantly larger than for ordinary spatial clusters of events. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, formula_1 for uniformly distributed Monte Carlo events shows that no tail exists below formula_1\u2a7d1000\u00a0cm. For the \"alarm\" class of burst, the events are required to have formula_1\u2a7e900\u00a0cm for 25\u2a7dformula_8\u2a7d40 or formula_1\u2a7e750\u00a0cm for formula_8&gt;40. These thresholds were determined by extrapolation from SN1987A data.\nThe system will run special processes to check for spallation muons when burst candidates meeting \"alarm\" criteria and make a primary decision for further process. If the burst candidate passes these checks, the data will be reanalyzed using an offline process and a final decision will be made within a few hours. During the Super-Kamiokande I running, this never occurred.\nOne of the important capabilities for [Super-Kamiokande] is to reconstruct the direction to supernova. By neutrino\u2013electron scattering, formula_11, a total of 100\u2013150 events are expected in case of a supernova at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The direction to supernova can be measured with angular resolution\nformula_12\nwhere N is the number of events produced by the \u03bd\u2013e scattering. The angular resolution, therefore, can be as good as \u03b4\u03b8~3\u00b0 for a supernova at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this case, not only time profile and the energy spectrum of a neutrino burst, but also the information on direction of supernova can be provided.\nSlow control monitor and offline process monitor.\nThere is a process called the \"slow control\" monitor, as part of the online monitoring system, watches the status of the HV systems, the temperatures of electronics crates and the status of the compensating coils used to cancel the geomagnetic field. When any deviation from norms is detected, it will alert physicists to prompt to investigate, take appropriate action, or notify experts.\nTo monitor and control the offline processes that analyze and transfer data, a sophisticated set of software was developed. This monitor allows non-expert shift physicists to identify and repair common problems to minimize down time, and the software package was a significant contribution to the smooth operation of the experiment and its overall high lifetime efficiency for data taking.\nResearch.\nSolar neutrino.\nThe energy of the Sun comes from the nuclear fusion in its core where a helium atom and two electron neutrinos are generated by 4 protons. These neutrinos emitted from this reaction are called solar neutrinos. Photons, created by the nuclear fusion in the center of the Sun, take millions of years to reach the surface; on the other hand, solar neutrinos arrive at the earth in eight minutes due to their lack of interactions with matter. Hence, solar neutrinos make it possible for us to observe the inner Sun in \"real-time\" that takes millions of years for visible light.\nIn 1999, the Super-Kamiokande detected strong evidence of neutrino oscillation that successfully explained the solar neutrino problem. The Sun and about 80% of the visible stars produce their energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via\nformula_13 MeV\nConsequently, stars are a source of neutrinos, including the Sun. These neutrinos primarily come through the p-p chain in lower masses, and for cooler stars, primarily through the CNO cycle of heavier masses.\nIn the early 1990s, particularly with the uncertainties that accompanied the initial results from Kamioka II and the Ga experiments, no individual experiment required a non-astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem. But in aggregate, the Cl, Kamioka II, and Ga experiments indicated a pattern of neutrino fluxes that was not compatible with any adjustment of the SSM. This in turn helped motivate a new generation of spectacularly capable active detectors. These experiments are Super-Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), and Borexino. Super-Kamiokande was able to detect elastic scattering (ES) events\nformula_14\nwhich, due to the charged-current contribution to formula_15 scattering, has a relative sensitivity to formula_15 s and heavy-flavor neutrinos of ~7:1. Since the direction of the recoil electron is constrained to be very forward, the direction of the neutrinos are kept in the direction of recoil electrons. Here, formula_17 is provided where formula_18 is the angle between the direction of recoil electrons and the Sun's position. This shows that the formula_19 solar neutrino flux can be calculated to be formula_20. Comparing to the SSM, the ratio is formula_21. The result clearly indicates the deficit of solar neutrinos.\nAtmospheric neutrino.\nAtmospheric neutrinos are secondary cosmic rays produced by the decay of particles resulting from interactions of primary cosmic rays (mostly protons) with Earth atmosphere. The observed atmospheric neutrino events fall into four categories. Fully contained (FC) events have all their tracks in the inner detector, while partially contained (PC) events have escaping tracks from the inner detector. Upward through-going muons (UTM) are produced in the rock beneath the detector and go through the inner detector. Upward stopping muons (USM) are also produced in the rock beneath the detector, but stop in the inner detector.\nThe number of observed number of neutrinos is predicted uniformly regardless of the zenith angle. However, Super-Kamiokande found that the number of upward going muon neutrinos (generated on the other side of the Earth) is half of the number of downward going muon neutrinos in 1998. This can be explained by the neutrinos changing or oscillating into some other neutrinos that are not detected. This is called neutrino oscillation; this discovery indicates the finite mass of neutrinos and suggests an extension of the Standard Model. Neutrinos oscillate in three flavors, and all neutrinos have their rest mass. Later analysis in 2004 suggested a sinusoidal dependence of the event rate as a function of \"Length/Energy\", which confirmed the neutrino oscillations.\nK2K Experiment.\nThe K2K experiment was a neutrino experiment from June 1999 to November 2004. This experiment was designed to verify oscillations observed by Super-Kamiokande through muon neutrinos. It gives first positive measurement of neutrino oscillations in conditions that both source and detector are under control. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays an important role in the experiment as the far detector. Later experiment T2K experiment continued as the second generation follow up to the K2K experiment.\nT2K Experiment.\nT2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a neutrino experiment collaborated by several countries including Japan, United States, and others. The goal of T2K is to gain deeper understanding of parameters of neutrino oscillation. T2K has made a search for oscillations from muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos, and announced the first experimental indications for them in June 2011. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays as the \"far detector\". The Super-K detector will record the Cherenkov radiation of muons and electrons created by interactions between high-energy neutrinos and water.\nProton decay.\nThe proton is assumed to be absolutely stable in the Standard Model. However, the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) predict that protons can decay into lighter energetic charged particles such as electrons, muons, pions, or others which can be observed. Kamiokande helps to rule out some of these theories. Super-Kamiokande is currently the largest detector for observation of proton decay.\nPurification.\nWater purification system.\nSince 2002, the 50 kilotons of pure water have been continually reprocessed at a rate of about 30 tons per hour in a closed system. Now, raw mine water is recycled through the first step (particle filters and RO) for some time before other processes, which involve expensive expendables, are imposed. Initially, water from the Super-Kamiokande tank is passed through nominal 1\u00a0\u03bcm mesh filters to remove dust and particles, which reduce the transparency of the water for Cherenkov photons and provide a possible radon source inside the Super-Kamiokande detector.\nA heat exchanger is used to cool down the water in order to reduce the PMT dark noise level as well as suppress the growth of bacteria. Surviving bacteria are killed by a UV sterilizer stage. A cartridge polisher (CP) eliminates heavy ions, which also reduce water transparency and include radioactive species. The CP module increases the typical resistivity of recirculating water from 11\u00a0M\u03a9\u00a0cm to 18.24\u00a0M\u03a9\u00a0cm, approaching the chemical limit.\nOriginally, an ion-exchanger (IE) was included in the system, but it was removed when IE resin was found to be a significant radon source. The reverse osmosis (RO) step that removes additional particulates, and the introduction of Rn-reduced air into the water that increases radon removal efficiency in the vacuum degasifier (VD) stage which follows, were installed in 1999. After that, a VD removes dissolved gases in the water.\nThese dissolved gases in water are a serious background event source for solar neutrinos in the MeV energy range and the dissolved oxygen encourages the growth of bacteria. The removal efficiency is about 96%. Then, the ultra filter (UF) is introduced to remove particles whose minimum size corresponds to molecular weight approximately 10,000 (or about 10\u00a0nm diameter) thanks to hollow fiber membrane filters. Finally, a membrane degasifier (MD) removes radon dissolved in water, and the measured removal efficiency for radon is about 83%. The concentration of radon gases is miniaturized by realtime detectors. In June 2001, typical radon concentrations in water coming into the purification system from the Super-Kamiokande tank were less than 2\u00a0mBq\u00a0m\u22123, and in water output by the system, 0.4\u00b10.2\u00a0mBq\u00a0m\u22123.\nAir purification system.\nPurified air is supplied in the gap between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8\u00a0m3 of activated charcoal is used. The last 50\u00a0L of charcoal is cooled to \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18\u00a0m3/h, \u221265\u00a0\u00b0C (@+1\u00a0kg/cm2), and a few mBq m\u22123, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40\u00a0Bq\u00a0m\u22123.\nRadon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000\u20133000 Bq m\u22123 during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100\u2013300\u00a0Bq m\u22123. This variation is due to the chimney effect in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.\nIn order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100\u00a0Bq\u00a0m\u22123, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10\u00a0m3/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A \"Radon Hut\" (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40\u00a0hp air pump with 10\u00a0m3\u00a0min\u22121 /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.\nData processing.\nOffline data processing is produced both in Kamioka and in the United States.\nIn Kamioka.\nThe offline data processing system is located in Kenkyuto and is connected to Super-Kamiokande detector with 4\u00a0km FDDI optical fiber link. Data flow from online system is 450 kbytes s\u22121 on average, corresponding to 40 Gbytes day\u22121 or 14 Tbytes yr\u22121. Magnetic tapes are used in offline system to store data and most of the analysis is accomplished here. The offline processing system is designed platform-independent because different computer architectures are used for data analysis. Because of this, the data structures are based on ZEBRA bank system developed in CERN as well as the ZEBRA exchange system.\nEvent data from Super-Kamiokande online DAQ system basically contains a list of number of hit PMT, TDC, and ADC counts, GPS time-stamps, and other housekeeping data. For solar neutrino analysis, lowering the energy threshold is a constant goal, so it is a continual effort to improve the efficiency of reduction algorithms; however, changes in calibrations or reduction methods require reprocessing of earlier data. Typically, 10\u00a0Tbytes of raw data is processed every month so that a large amount of CPU power and high-speed I/O access to the raw data. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation processing is also necessary.\nOffline system was designed to meet demand of all these: tape storage of a large database (14 Tbytes yr\u22121), stable semi-realtime processing, nearly continuous re-processing and Monte Carlo simulation. The computer system consists of three major sub-systems: the data server, the CPU farm, and the network at the end of Run I.\nIn the United States.\nA system dedicated to offsite offline data processing was set up at the Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, to process raw data sent from Kamioka. Most of the reformatted raw data are copied from system facility in Kamioka. At Stony Brook, a system was set up for analysis and further processing. At Stony Brook the raw data were processed with a multi-tape DLT drive. The first-stage data reduction processes were done for the high-energy analysis and for the low-energy analysis.\nThe data reduction for the high-energy analysis was mainly for atmospheric neutrino events and proton decay search while the low-energy analysis was mainly for the solar neutrino events. The reduced data for the high-energy analysis was further filtered by other reduction processes and the resulting data were stored on disks. The reduced data for the low-energy were stored on DLT tapes and sent to University of California, Irvine, for further processing.\nThis offset analysis system continued for three years until their analysis chains were proved to produce equivalent results. Thus, in order to limit manpower, collaborations were concentrated to a single combined analysis\nResults.\nIn 1998, Super-K found first strong evidence of neutrino oscillation from the observation of muon neutrinos changed into tau-neutrinos.\nSK has set limits on proton lifetime and other rare decays and neutrino properties. SK set a lower bound on protons decaying to kaons of 5.9 \u00d7 1033 yr\nIn January 2023, from data collected during the 1996\u20132018 period, new limits were reported by Super-Kamiokande for sub-GeV dark matter excluding the dark matter\u2013nucleon elastic scattering cross section between formula_22 and formula_23 with masses from formula_24 to formula_25.\nIn popular culture.\nSuper-Kamiokande is the subject of Andreas Gursky's 2007 photograph \"Kamiokande\" and was featured in an episode of \"\".\nIn September 2018, the detector was drained for maintenance, affording a team of Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporters the opportunity to obtain 4K resolution video from within the detection tank.\nThe design of the room housing a super computer in the film \"Eagle Eye\" resembles the Super-Kamiokande detection tank.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The liberated energy transfers to the electromagnetic field, creating a new photon with a frequency, polarization, and direction of travel that are all identical to the photons of the incident wave. This is in contrast to spontaneous emission, which occurs at a characteristic rate for each of the atoms/oscillators in the upper energy state regardless of the external electromagnetic field.\nAccording to the American Physical Society, the first person to correctly predict the phenomenon of stimulated emission was Albert Einstein in a series of papers starting in 1916, culminating in what is now called the Einstein B Coefficient. Einstein's work became the theoretical foundation of the maser and the laser. The process is identical in form to atomic absorption in which the energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds stimulated emission because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a population inversion is present, the rate of stimulated emission exceeds that of absorption, and a net optical amplification can be achieved. Such a gain medium, along with an optical resonator, is at the heart of a laser or maser.\nLacking a feedback mechanism, laser amplifiers and superluminescent sources also function on the basis of stimulated emission.\nOverview.\nElectrons and their interactions with electromagnetic fields are important in our understanding of chemistry and physics.\nIn the classical view, the energy of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is larger for orbits further from the nucleus of an atom. However, quantum mechanical effects force electrons to take on discrete positions in orbitals. Thus, electrons are found in specific energy levels of an atom, two of which are shown below:\nWhen an electron absorbs energy either from light (photons) or heat (phonons), it receives that incident quantum of energy. But transitions are only allowed between discrete energy levels such as the two shown above.\nThis leads to emission lines and absorption lines.\nWhen an electron is excited from a lower to a higher energy level, it is unlikely for it to stay that way forever.\nAn electron in an excited state may decay to a lower energy state which is not occupied, according to a particular time constant characterizing that transition. When such an electron decays without external influence, emitting a photon, that is called \"spontaneous emission\". The phase and direction associated with the photon that is emitted is random. A material with many atoms in such an excited state may thus result in radiation which has a narrow spectrum (centered around one wavelength of light), but the individual photons would have no common phase relationship and would also emanate in random directions. This is the mechanism of fluorescence and thermal emission.\nAn external electromagnetic field at a frequency associated with a transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of spontaneous emission. A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this is the process of stimulated emission.\nHistory.\nStimulated emission was a theoretical discovery by Albert Einstein within the framework of the old quantum theory, wherein the emission is described in terms of photons that are the quanta of the EM field. Stimulated emission can also occur in classical models, without reference to photons or quantum-mechanics. (See also \"\".) According to physics professor and director of the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms Daniel Kleppner, Einstein's theory of radiation was ahead of its time and prefigures the modern theory of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics by several decades.\nMathematical model.\nStimulated emission can be modelled mathematically by considering an atom that may be in one of two electronic energy states, a lower level state (possibly the ground state) (1) and an \"excited state\" (2), with energies \"E\"1 and \"E\"2 respectively.\nIf the atom is in the excited state, it may decay into the lower state by the process of spontaneous emission, releasing the difference in energies between the two states as a photon. The photon will have frequency \"\u03bd\"0 and energy \"h\u03bd\"0, given by:\nformula_1\nwhere \"h\" is the Planck constant.\nAlternatively, if the excited-state atom is perturbed by an electric field of frequency \"\u03bd\"0, it may emit an additional photon of the same frequency and in phase, thus augmenting the external field, leaving the atom in the lower energy state. This process is known as stimulated emission.\nIn a group of such atoms, if the number of atoms in the excited state is given by \"N\"2, the rate at which stimulated emission occurs is given by\nformula_2\nwhere the proportionality constant \"B\"21 is known as the \"Einstein B coefficient\" for that particular transition, and \"\u03c1\"(\"\u03bd\") is the radiation density of the incident field at frequency \"\u03bd\". The rate of emission is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the excited state \"N\"2, and to the density of incident photons.\nAt the same time, there will be a process of atomic absorption which \"removes\" energy from the field while raising electrons from the lower state to the upper state. Its rate is precisely the negative of the stimulated emission rate,\nformula_3\nThe rate of absorption is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the lower state, \"N\"1. The B coefficients can be calculated using dipole approximation and time dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics as:\nformula_4\nwhere \"B\" corresponds to energy distribution in terms of frequency \"\u03bd\". The B coefficient may vary based on choice of energy distribution function used, however, the product of energy distribution function and its respective \"B\" coefficient remains same.\nEinstein showed from the form of Planck's law, that the coefficient for this transition must be identical to that for stimulated emission:\nformula_5\nThus absorption and stimulated emission are reverse processes proceeding at somewhat different rates. Another way of viewing this is to look at the \"net\" stimulated emission or absorption viewing it as a single process. The net rate of transitions from \"E\"2 to \"E\"1 due to this combined process can be found by adding their respective rates, given above:\nformula_6\nThus a net power is released into the electric field equal to the photon energy \"h\u03bd\" times this net transition rate. In order for this to be a positive number, indicating net stimulated emission, there must be more atoms in the excited state than in the lower level: formula_7. Otherwise there is net absorption and the power of the wave is reduced during passage through the medium. The special condition formula_8 is known as a population inversion, a rather unusual condition that must be effected in the gain medium of a laser.\nThe notable characteristic of stimulated emission compared to everyday light sources (which depend on spontaneous emission) is that the emitted photons have the same frequency, phase, polarization, and direction of propagation as the incident photons. The photons involved are thus mutually coherent. When a population inversion (formula_7) is present, therefore, optical amplification of incident radiation will take place.\nAlthough energy generated by stimulated emission is always at the exact frequency of the field which has stimulated it, the above rate equation refers only to excitation at the particular optical frequency formula_10 corresponding to the energy of the transition. At frequencies offset from formula_10 the strength of stimulated (or spontaneous) emission will be decreased according to the so-called line shape.\nConsidering only homogeneous broadening affecting an atomic or molecular resonance, the spectral line shape function is described as a Lorentzian distribution\nformula_12\nwhere formula_13 is the full width at half maximum or FWHM bandwidth.\nThe peak value of the Lorentzian line shape occurs at the line center, formula_14. A line shape function can be normalized so that its value at formula_10 is unity; in the case of a Lorentzian we obtain\nformula_16\nThus stimulated emission at frequencies away from formula_10 is reduced by this factor. In practice there may also be broadening of the line shape due to inhomogeneous broadening, most notably due to the Doppler effect resulting from the distribution of velocities in a gas at a certain temperature. This has a Gaussian shape and reduces the peak strength of the line shape function. In a practical problem the full line shape function can be computed through a convolution of the individual line shape functions involved. Therefore, optical amplification will add power to an incident optical field at frequency formula_18 at a rate given by\nformula_19\nStimulated emission cross section.\nThe stimulated emission cross section is\nformula_20\nwhere\nOptical amplification.\nStimulated emission can provide a physical mechanism for optical amplification. If an external source of energy stimulates more than 50% of the atoms in the ground state to transition into the excited state, then what is called a population inversion is created. When light of the appropriate frequency passes through the inverted medium, the photons are either absorbed by the atoms that remain in the ground state or the photons stimulate the excited atoms to emit additional photons of the same frequency, phase, and direction. Since more atoms are in the excited state than in the ground state then an amplification of the input intensity results.\nThe population inversion, in units of atoms per cubic metre, is\n formula_21\nwhere \"g\"1 and \"g\"2 are the degeneracies of energy levels 1 and 2, respectively.\nSmall signal gain equation.\nThe intensity (in watts per square metre) of the stimulated emission is governed by the following differential equation:\n formula_22\nas long as the intensity \"I\"(\"z\") is small enough so that it does not have a significant effect on the magnitude of the population inversion. Grouping the first two factors together, this equation simplifies as\n formula_23\nwhere\n formula_24\nis the \"small-signal gain coefficient\" (in units of radians per metre). We can solve the differential equation using separation of variables:\n formula_25\nIntegrating, we find:\n formula_26\nor\n formula_27\nwhere\n formula_28 is the optical intensity of the input signal (in watts per square metre).\nSaturation intensity.\nThe saturation intensity \"I\"S is defined as the input intensity at which the gain of the optical amplifier drops to exactly half of the small-signal gain. We can compute the saturation intensity as\n formula_29\nwhere\n formula_30 is the Planck constant, and\n formula_31 is the saturation time constant, which depends on the spontaneous emission lifetimes of the various transitions between the energy levels related to the amplification.\n formula_18 is the frequency in Hz\nThe minimum value of formula_33 occurs on resonance, where the cross section formula_34 is the largest. This minimum value is:\n formula_35\nFor a simple two-level atom with a natural linewidth formula_36, the saturation time constant formula_37.\nGeneral gain equation.\nThe general form of the gain equation, which applies regardless of the input intensity, derives from the general differential equation for the intensity \"I\" as a function of position \"z\" in the gain medium:\n formula_38\nwhere formula_39 is saturation intensity. To solve, we first rearrange the equation in order to separate the variables, intensity \"I\" and position \"z\":\n formula_40\nIntegrating both sides, we obtain\n formula_41\nor\n formula_42\nThe gain \"G\" of the amplifier is defined as the optical intensity \"I\" at position \"z\" divided by the input intensity:\n formula_43\nSubstituting this definition into the prior equation, we find the general gain equation:\n formula_44\nSmall signal approximation.\nIn the special case where the input signal is small compared to the saturation intensity, in other words,\n formula_45\nthen the general gain equation gives the small signal gain as\n formula_46\nor\n formula_47\nwhich is identical to the small signal gain equation (see above).\nLarge signal asymptotic behaviour.\nFor large input signals, where\n formula_48\nthe gain approaches unity\n formula_49\nand the general gain equation approaches a linear asymptote:\n formula_50\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28475", "revid": "49389032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28475", "title": "Siberian Husky", "text": "Dog breed\nThe Siberian Husky is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.\nSiberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people as well as the Koryak, Yukaghir and Kamchadal people of Siberia for sled pulling and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain. Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.\nLineage.\nIn 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds. Siberian Huskies show a genetic affinity with historical East Siberian dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can be traced to a lineage which is over 9,500 years old. A genomic sample of today's Siberian Husky has emerged into four genetically distinct populations: show dogs, pet dogs, racing sled dogs and Seppala Siberian Huskies.\nSeveral Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes \u2013 the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the Shar-Pei and Finnish Spitz. There is data to indicate admixture of between 1 and 3% between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.\nThe Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska in 1908 to serve as working sled dogs, and were eventually developed and used for sled dog racing.\nDescription.\nCoat.\nA Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds. It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as . The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming. An excessively long coat, sometimes referred to as a \"wooly\" or \"woolie\" coat, is considered a fault by the breed's standard as it lacks the thicker protection of the standard coat's guard hairs, obscures the dog's clear-cut outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and encrusted with snow and ice.\nSiberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns, often with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. Example coat colors are black and white, copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and the rare \"agouti\" coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting. Some other individuals also have the \"saddle back\" pattern, in which black-tipped guard hairs are restricted to the saddle area while the head, haunches and shoulders are either light red or white. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in wide variety. All coat colors from black to pure white are allowed. Merle coat patterns are not permitted by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and The Kennel Club (KC). This pattern is often associated with health issues and impure breeding.\nEyes.\nThe American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as \"an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely\". The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue or black; one of each or particoloured are acceptable (complete is heterochromia). These eye-color combinations are considered acceptable by the American Kennel Club. The parti-color does not affect the vision of the dog.\nNose.\nShow-quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. In some instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is called \"snow nose\" or \"winter nose\". This condition is called hypopigmentation in animals. \"Snow nose\" is acceptable in the show ring.\nTail.\nSiberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. When curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the \"Siberian Swirl\". The AKC recommends the tail should be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a \"sickle\" shape when excited or interested in something.\nSize.\nThe breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between tall at the withers and weighing between . Females are smaller, growing to between tall at the withers and weighing between . The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies as \"Siberian Rats\" due to their size of , versus the Alaskan Malamute's size of .\nBehavior.\nThe Husky usually howls instead of barking. They are known to mimic high-frequency noises, such as ambulance sirens, as well as human speech. They have been described as escape artists, which can include digging under, chewing through, or even jumping over fences.\nThe ASPCA classifies the breed as good with children. It also states they exhibit high energy indoors, have special exercise needs, and may be destructive \"without proper care\".\nA fence is recommended for this breed as a pet, although some have been known to overcome fences as high as . Electric pet fencing may not be effective. They need the frequent companionship of people and other dogs, and their need to feel as part of a pack is very strong.\nThe character of the Siberian Husky is friendly and gentle. A study found an association with a gene in the breed and impulsivity, inattention, and high activity.\nSiberian Huskies were ranked 77th out of 138 compared breeds for their intelligence by canine psychologist Stanley Coren. However, the rankings in Coren's published work utilized only one of three defined forms of dog intelligence, \"Working and Obedience Intelligence\", which focused on trainability\u2014a dog's ability to follow direction and commands in a direct context, specifically by trial judges in a controlled course setting.\nHealth.\nA 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. Health issues in the breed are mainly genetic, such as seizures and defects of the eye (juvenile cataracts, corneal dystrophy, canine glaucoma and progressive retinal atrophy) and congenital laryngeal paralysis. Hip dysplasia is not often found in this breed; however, as with many medium or larger-sized canines, it can occur. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals currently has the Siberian Husky ranked 155th out of a possible 160 breeds at risk for hip dysplasia, with only two percent of tested Siberian Huskies showing dysplasia.\nSiberian Huskies used for sled racing may also be prone to other ailments, such as gastric disease, bronchitis or bronchopulmonary ailments (\"ski asthma\"), and gastric erosions or ulcerations.\nThe Siberian Husky is one of the more commonly affected breeds for X-linked progressive retinal atrophy. The condition is caused by a mutation in the RPGR gene in the breed.\nModern Siberian Huskies registered in the US are almost entirely the descendants of the 1930 Siberia imports and of Leonhard Seppala's dogs, particularly Togo. The limited number of registered foundational dogs has led to some discussion about their vulnerability to the founder effect.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric (prior to 1890s).\nThe Chukotka Sled Dog is considered the progenitor to the Siberian Husky. Developed by the Chukchi people of Russia, Chukotka sled dog teams have been used since prehistoric times to pulls sleds in harsh conditions, such as hunting sea mammals on oceanic pack ice.\nOrigination of name and split from Chukotka Sled Dogs (1890s\u20131930s).\nFrom the 1890s to the 1930s, sled dogs from northeast Siberia and especially Chukotka sled dogs were actively imported in vast numbers to Alaska, to transport gold miners to the Yukon, first as part of the Klondike Gold Rush, then later the \"All-Alaska Sweepstakes\", a 408-mile (657-km) distance dog sled race from Nome, to Candle, and back. At this time, \"Esquimaux\" or \"Eskimo\" was a common pejorative term for native Arctic inhabitants with many dialectal permutations including Uskee, Uskimay and Huskemaw. Thus dogs used by Arctic people were the dogs of the Huskies, the Huskie's dogs, and eventually simply the husky dogs. Canadian and American settlers, not well-versed on Russian geography, would distinguish the Chukotka imports by referring to them as Siberian huskies as Chukotka is part of Siberia.\nSmaller, faster and more enduring than the 100- to 120-pound (45- to 54-kg) freighting dogs then in general use, they immediately dominated the Sweepstakes race. Leonhard Seppala, the foremost breeder of Siberian sled dogs of the time, participated in competitions from 1909 to the mid-1920s with a number of championships to his name.\nOn February 3, 1925, Gunnar Kaasen was the final musher in the 1925 serum run to Nome to deliver diphtheria serum from Nenana over 600 miles to Nome. This was a group effort by several sled dog teams and mushers, with the longest (264 miles or 422\u00a0km) and most dangerous segment of the run covered by Leonhard Seppala and his sled team lead dog Togo. The event is depicted in the 2019 film \"Togo\". A measure of this is also depicted in the 1995 animated film \"Balto\"; the name of Gunnar Kaasen's lead dog in his sled team was Balto, although unlike the real dog, Balto the character was portrayed as a wolf-dog in the film. In honor of this lead dog, a bronze statue was erected at Central Park in New York City. The plaque upon it is inscribed, Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the winter of 1925. Endurance \u00b7 Fidelity \u00b7 Intelligence\nSiberian huskies gained mass popularity with the story of the \"Great Race of Mercy\", the 1925 serum run to Nome, featuring Balto and Togo. Although Balto is considered the more famous, being the dog that delivered the serum to Nome after running the final 53-mile leg, it was Togo who made the longest run of the relay, guiding his musher Leonhard Seppala on a 261-mile journey that included crossing the deadly Norton Sound to Golovin, and who ultimately became a foundation dog for the Siberian Husky breed, through his progeny Toto, Molinka, Kingeak, Ammoro, Sepp III, and Togo II.\nIn 1930, exportation of the dogs from Siberia was halted. The same year saw recognition of the Siberian Husky by the American Kennel Club. Nine years later, the breed was first registered in Canada. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1938 as the \"Arctic Husky\", changing the name to Siberian Husky in 1991. Seppala owned a kennel in Alaska before moving to New England, where he became partners with Elizabeth Ricker. The two co-owned the Poland Springs kennel and began to race and exhibit their dogs all over the Northeast. The kennel was sold to Canadian Harry Wheeler in 1931, following Seppala's return to Alaska\nThe breed's foundation stock per records and studbooks consists of:Kree Vanka (Male, 1930 Siberia Import)\nTserko (Male, 1930 Siberia Import),\nTosca (Female, Harry x Kolyma)\nDuke (Male, also known as Chapman's Duke, reportedly Ici x Wanda)\nTanta of Alyeska (Female, Tuck x Toto)\nSigrid III of Foxstand (Female, Chenuk x Molinka)\nSmokey of Seppala (Male, Kingeak x Pearl)\nSepp III (Male, Togo x Dolly)\nSmoky (Male, unknown parentage)\nDushka (Female, Bonzo x Nanuk)\nKabloona (Female, Ivan x Duchess)\nRollinsford Nina of Marilyn (Female, Kotlik x Nera of Marilyn)As the breed was beginning to come to prominence, in 1933 Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd brought about 50 Siberian Huskies with him on an expedition in which he hoped to journey around the 16,000-mile coast of Antarctica. Many of the dogs were bred and trained at Chinook Kennels in New Hampshire, owned by Eva Seeley. Called Operation Highjump, the historic trek proved the worth of the Siberian Husky due to its compact size and great speed. Siberian Huskies also served in the United States Army's Arctic Search and Rescue Unit of the Air Transport Command during World War II. Their popularity was sustained into the 21st century. They were ranked 16th among American Kennel Club registrants in 2012, rising to 14th place in 2013. They have since fallen in ranking, reaching 26th of 202 as of 2024.\n1940s\u2013present.\nHuskies were extensively used as sled dogs by the British Antarctic Survey in Antarctica between 1945 and 1994. A bronze monument to all of BAS's dog teams is outside its Cambridge headquarters, with a plaque listing all the dogs' names.\nIn 1960, the US Army undertook a project to construct an under-the-ice facility for defense and space research, Camp Century, part of Project Iceworm, involving a 150+ crew who also brought with them an unofficial mascot, a Siberian Husky named Mukluk.\nDue to their high popularity combining with their high physical and mental needs, Siberians are abandoned or surrendered to shelters at high rates by new owners who do not research them fully and find themselves unable to care for them. Many decide on the breed for their looks and mythos in pop culture, and purchase pups from backyard breeders or puppy mills who do not have breeder-return contracts that responsible breeders will, designed to keep the breed out of shelters.\nSled dogs that were bred and kept by the Chukchi tribes of Siberia were thought to have gone extinct, but Benedict Allen, writing for \"Geographical\" magazine in 2006 after visiting the region, reported their survival. His description of the breeding practiced by the Chukchi mentions selection for obedience, endurance, amiable disposition, and sizing that enabled families to support them without undue difficulty.\nTraditional use and other activities.\nOriginally, huskies were used as sled dogs in the polar regions. One can differentiate huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style. Modern racing huskies (also known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs. Humans use huskies in sled-dog racing. Various companies have marketed tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions. Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.\nMany huskies, especially Siberian Huskies, are considered working dogs and are often high-energy. Exercise is extremely important for the physical and mental health of these kinds of dogs and it can also prompt a strong bond between the owner and dog. Since many owners now have huskies as pets in settings that are not ideal for sledding, other activities have been found that are good for the dog and fun for the owner.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nSkiing has a history of almost five millennia. Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in the Altai Mountains, according to an interpretation of ancient paintings. However, this continues to be debated.\nThe word \"ski\" comes from the Old Norse word \"sk\u00ed\u00f0\" which means to \"split piece of wood or firewood\".\nAsymmetrical skis were used in northern Finland and Sweden until at least the late 19th century. On one foot, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and a shorter ski was worn on the other foot for kicking. The underside of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a similar manner to modern ski waxing.\nEarly skiers used one long pole or spear. The first description of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741.\nTroops in continental Europe were equipped with skis by 1747, and into the 21st century many nations continue to equip and train specialized troops for ski warfare.\nSkiing was primarily used for transport until the mid-19th century but, since then, it has also become a recreation and sport. Military ski races were held in Norway during the 18th century, and ski warfare was studied in the late 18th century. As equipment evolved and ski lifts were developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, two main genres of skiing emerged\u2014Alpine (downhill) skiing and Nordic skiing. The main difference between the two is the type of ski binding (the way in which the ski boots are attached to the skis).\nTypes.\nAlpine.\nAlso called \"downhill skiing\", Alpine skiing typically takes place on a piste at a ski resort. It is characterized by fixed-heel bindings that attach at both the toe and the heel of the skier's boot. Ski lifts, including chairlifts, bring skiers up the slope. Backcountry skiing can be accessed by helicopter, snowcat, hiking and snowmobile. Facilities at resorts can include night skiing, apr\u00e8s-ski, and glade skiing under the supervision of the ski patrol and the ski school. Alpine skiing branched off from the older Nordic type of skiing around the 1920s when the advent of ski lifts meant that it was no longer necessary to climb back uphill. Alpine equipment has specialized to the point where it can now only be used with the help of lifts. Alpine Touring setups use specialized bindings which are switchable between locked and free-heel modes. Climbing skins are temporarily attached to the bottom of alpine skis to give them traction on snow. This permits Nordic style uphill and back-country travel on alpine skis. For downhill travel, the heels are locked and the skins are removed.\nNordic.\nThe Nordic disciplines include cross-country skiing and ski jumping, which both use bindings that attach at the toes of the skier's boots but not at the heels. Cross-country skiing may be practiced on groomed trails or in undeveloped backcountry areas. Ski jumping is practiced in certain areas that are reserved exclusively for ski jumping.\nTelemark.\nTelemark skiing is a ski turning technique and FIS-sanctioned discipline, which is named after the Telemark region of Norway. It uses equipment similar to Nordic skiing, where the ski bindings are attached only at the toes of the ski boots, allowing the skier's heel to be raised throughout the turn. However, the skis themselves are often the same width as Alpine skis.\nCompetition.\nThe following skiing disciplines are sanctioned by the FIS. Many have their own world cups and are included in the Winter Olympic Games.\nEquipment.\nEquipment used in skiing includes:\nTechnique.\nTechnique has evolved along with ski technology and ski geometry. Early techniques included the telemark turn, the stem, the stem Christie, snowplough, and parallel turn.\nNew parabolic designs like the Elan SCX have enabled the more modern carve turn.\nOn other surfaces.\nOriginally and primarily an outdoor winter sport on snow, skiing is also practiced on synthetic \"dry\" ski slopes, on sand, indoors and with ski simulators. With appropriate equipment, grass skiing and roller skiing are other alternatives which are not performed on snow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling girl group of all time. With their \"girl power\" mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl group concept by targeting a young female fanbase. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s, were a major part of the Cool Britannia era, and became popular culture icons of the decade.\nThe Spice Girls were formed by Heart Management, who held auditions to create a girl group to compete with the British boy bands popular at the time. After leaving Heart, the Spice Girls hired Simon Fuller as their manager and signed with Virgin Records. They released their debut single, \"Wannabe\", in 1996, which reached number one on the charts of 37 countries. Their debut album, \"Spice\" (1996), sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. It also produced three more number-one singles: \"Say You'll Be There\", \"2 Become 1\" and \"Who Do You Think You Are\"/\"Mama\". Their second album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), sold more than 14 million copies worldwide. The Spice Girls achieved three number-one singles from the album with \"Spice Up Your Life\", \"Too Much\" and \"Viva Forever\". Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and message of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the members.\nIn 1997, the Spice Girls made their live concert debut and released a feature film, \"Spice World\", both to commercial success. The 1998 Spiceworld Tour became the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group, attended by an estimated 2.1 million people. Halliwell left the Spice Girls during the tour. Following a number-one single with \"Goodbye\" (1998) and a successful 1999 concert tour, the Spice Girls released their R&amp;B-influenced third album, \"Forever\", in 2000. It featured their ninth number one single, \"Holler\"/\"Let Love Lead the Way\", setting a record for most UK number ones by a girl group. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls entered a hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers. They reunited for the Return of the Spice Girls Tour from 2007, the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and, without Beckham, the Spice World \u2014 2019 UK Tour. The tours won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for highest-grossing engagements, making the Spice Girls the top touring all-female group from 1998 to 2020.\nThe Spice Girls have won five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, four \"Billboard\" Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and one MTV Video Music Award. In 2000, they became the youngest recipients of the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Notable elements of the Spice Girls' symbolism include Halliwell's Union Jack dress and the nicknames given to each member by the British press. Their endorsement deals and merchandise had generated an estimated income of $500\u2013800 million by May 1998. According to the \"Music Week\" writer Paul Gorman, the Spice Girls' media exposure helped usher in an era of celebrity obsession.\nHistory.\n1994\u20131995: Formation and early years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWANTED: R.U. 18\u201323 with the ability to sing/dance? R.U. streetwise, outgoing, ambitious, and dedicated? Heart Management Ltd. are a widely successful music industry management consortium currently forming a choreographed, singing/dancing, all-female pop act for a recording deal. Open audition. Danceworks, 16 Balderton Street. Friday 4th March. 11.00am\u20135.30pm. Please bring sheet music or backing cassette.\n \u2013 Advertisement placed in \"The Stage\"\nIn the early 1990s, Bob Herbert and Chris Herbert, the father-and-son duo of Heart Management, decided to create a girl group to compete with the boy bands who dominated UK pop music at the time. With the financier Chic Murphy, they envisioned an act comprising \"five strikingly different girls\" who would each appeal to a different audience. In February 1994, Heart Management placed an advertisement in the trade paper \"The Stage\" asking for singers to audition for an all-female pop band at London's Danceworks studios. Approximately 400 women attended the audition on 4 March 1994. They were placed in groups of 10 and danced a routine to \"Stay\" by Eternal, followed by solo auditions in which they performed songs of their choice.\nAfter several weeks of deliberation, Victoria Adams, Melanie Brown, Melanie Coloma and Michelle Stephenson were among a dozen or so women who advanced to a second round of auditions in April. Suffering from a tonsillitis, Melanie Chisholm couldn't be present at the second round of auditions. However, after said auditions, Melanie Coloma was let go by the Herberts, who called Melanie C to replace her, after Geri Halliwell persuaded the Herberts to let her attend the next round of auditions. A week after the second audition, Adams, Brown, Halliwell and Stephenson were asked to attend a recall at Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, performing \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" on their own and as a group. Chisholm was also invited. The five women were selected for a band initially named Touch.\nThe group moved into a three-bedroom house in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and spent most of 1994 practising songs written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates John Thirkell and Erwin Keiles. According to Stephenson, the songs were aimed at a very young audience, and none were later used by the Spice Girls. During these first months, the group worked on demos at South Hill Park Recording Studios in Bracknell with the producer and studio owner Michael Sparkes and the songwriter and arranger Tim Hawes. They were also tasked with choreographing their own dance routines, which they worked on at Trinity Studios in Knaphill, near Woking, Surrey. A few months into the training, Stephenson was fired for a perceived lack of commitment. Heart Management turned to the group's vocal coach, Pepi Lemer, to find a replacement. After Lemer's first recommendation declined the offer, Lemer recommended her former pupil Emma Bunton, who auditioned for the Herberts and joined as the fifth member.\nAs their training continued, the group performed small showcases for a few of Heart Management's associates. In one performance, they added a rap section they had written to one of Thirkell and Keiles' songs. Keiles was furious with the changes and insisted they learn to write songs properly. The group began professional songwriting lessons; during one session, they wrote a song called \"Sugar and Spice\" with Hawes, which inspired them to change their name to Spice.\nSigning with Virgin Records.\nBy late 1994, the group felt insecure, as they still did not have an official contract with Heart Management and were frustrated with the management team's direction. They persuaded Herbert to set up a showcase performance in front of industry writers, producers and A&amp;R men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction. The Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members refused to sign the contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father. In January, the group began songwriting sessions with Richard Stannard, whom they had impressed at the showcase, and his partner Matt Rowe. During these sessions, the songs \"Wannabe\" and \"2 Become 1\" were written.\nIn March 1995, the group left Heart Management, feeling Heart was unwilling to listen to their ideas. To ensure they kept control of their work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. The next day, the group tracked down the Sheffield-based songwriter Eliot Kennedy, who had been present at the Nomis showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. Through contacts they had made at the showcase, they were also introduced to the Absolute production team. With Kennedy and Absolute's help, the group spent the next several weeks writing and recording demos for the majority of the songs that would be released on their debut album, including \"Say You'll Be There\" and \"Who Do You Think You Are\". Their demos caught the attention of Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment, who signed them to his management company in May 1995.\nBy this point, industry buzz around Spice had grown and major record labels in London and Los Angeles were keen to sign them. After a bidding war, they signed a five-album deal with Virgin Records in July 1995. Fuller took them on an extensive promotional tour in Los Angeles, where they met with studio executives in the hopes of securing film and television opportunities. Their name was changed to the Spice Girls as a rapper was already using the name Spice. The new name was chosen as industry people often referred to them derisively as \"the Spice girls\". They continued to write and record tracks for their debut album.\n1996\u20131997: Breakthrough.\nOn 8 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \"Wannabe\" in the United Kingdom. In the weeks before the release, the music video received a trial airing on music channel the Box. It was an instant hit and was aired up to seventy times a week at its peak. After the video was released, the Spice Girls had their first live broadcast TV slot on LWT's \"Surprise Surprise\". Earlier in May, they had conducted their first music press interview with Paul Gorman, the contributing editor of trade paper \"Music Week\", at Virgin Records' Paris headquarters. His piece recognised that the Spice Girls were about to institute a change in the charts away from Britpop and towards out-and-out pop. He wrote: \"Just when boys with guitars threaten to rule pop life\u2014Damon's all over \"Smash Hits\", Ash are big in \"Big!\" and Liam can't move for tabloid frenzy\u2014an all-girl, in-yer-face pop group have arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble.\" \"Wannabe\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number three before spending the next seven weeks at number one. The song proved to be a global hit, hitting number one in 37 countries, including four consecutive weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US, and becoming not only the best-selling debut single by an all-female group but also the best-selling single by an all-female group of all time.\nFollowing the release of \"Wannabe\", an article in \"Top of the Pops\" magazine identified each Spice Girl with a unique nickname based on their personalities. Though unintended, the use of these nicknames became widespread and they were later adopted globally. Riding a wave of publicity and hype, the group released their next singles in Europe. In October, \"Say You'll Be There\" was released topping the charts for two weeks. \"2 Become 1\" was released in December, becoming their first Christmas number one and selling 462,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling single of the year. The two tracks continued the group's remarkable sales, giving them three of the top five best-selling songs of 1996 in the UK. In November 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut album, \"Spice\", in Europe. The success was unprecedented and drew comparisons to Beatlemania, leading the press to dub it \"Spicemania\" and the group the \"Fab Five\". In seven weeks \"Spice\" had sold 1.8 million copies in Britain alone, making the Spice Girls the fastest-selling British act since the Beatles. In total, the album sold over 3 million copies in Britain, the best-selling album of all time in the UK by a female group, certified ten times platinum, and reached number one for fifteen non-consecutive weeks. In Europe the album became the best-selling album of 1997 and was certified 8\u00d7 Platinum by the IFPI for sales in excess of 8 million copies.\nThat same month, the Spice Girls attracted a crowd of 500,000 when they switched on the Christmas lights in Oxford Street, London. At the same time, Fuller started to set up multi-million dollar sponsorship deals for the Spice Girls with Pepsi, Walkers, Impulse, Cadbury and Polaroid. The group ended 1996 winning three trophies at the \"Smash Hits\" awards at the London Arena, including best video for \"Say You'll Be There\".\nInternational success.\nIn January 1997, \"Wannabe\" was released in the United States. It proved to be a catalyst in helping the Spice Girls break into the US market when it debuted on the Hot 100 Chart at number eleven. At the time, this was the highest-ever debut by a non-American act, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", and the joint highest entry for a debut act alongside Alanis Morissette's \"Ironic\". \"Wannabe\" reached number one in the US for four weeks. In February, \"Spice\" was released in the US, and became the best-selling album of 1997 in the US, peaking at number one, and was certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA for sales in excess of 7.4 million copies. The album was also included in the Top 100 Albums of All Time list by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) based on US sales. In total, the album sold over 23 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling album in pop music history by an all-female group.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The dress has gone down in history \u2013 along with Liz Hurley's safety-pin frock and Princess Diana's \"revenge\" gown \u2013 as one of the most memorable fashion moments of all time.\n \u2013 \"Harper's Bazaar\" on Geri Halliwell's Union Jack dress at the 1997 Brit Awards.\nLater that month, the Spice Girls performed \"Who Do You Think You Are\" to open the 1997 Brit Awards, with Geri Halliwell wearing a Union Jack mini-dress that became one of pop history's most famed outfits. At the ceremony, the group won two Brit Awards; Best British Video for \"Say You'll Be There\" and Best British Single for \"Wannabe\". In March 1997, a double A-side of \"Mama\"/\"Who Do You Think You Are\" was released in Europe, the last from \"Spice\", which once again saw them at number one, making the Spice Girls the first group since the Jackson 5 to have four consecutive number one hits.\n\"Girl Power!\", the Spice Girls' first book, was launched later that month at Virgin Megastore. It sold out its initial print run of 200,000 copies within a day, and was eventually translated into more than 20 languages. In April, \"One Hour of Girl Power\" was released; it sold 500,000 copies in the UK between April and June to become the best-selling pop video ever, and was eventually certified thirteen times platinum. In May, \"Spice World\", a film starring the group, was announced by the Spice Girls at the Cannes Film Festival. The group also performed their first live UK show for the Prince's Trust benefit concert. At the show, they breached royal protocol when Brown and then Halliwell planted kisses on Prince Charles' cheeks and pinched his bottom, causing controversy. That same month, Virgin released \"Spice Girls Present... The Best Girl Power Album... Ever!\", a multi-artist compilation album compiled by the group. It reached number two on the UK Compilation Chart and was certified Gold by the BPI. At the Ivor Novello Awards, \"Wannabe\" won the awards for International Hit of the Year and Best-Selling British Single.\n\"Spice World\" began filming in June and wrapped in August. The film was to be set to the songs from the group's second studio album, but no songs had been written when filming began. The group thus had to do all the songwriting and recording at the same time as they were filming \"Spice World\", resulting in a gruelling schedule that left them exhausted. Among the songs that were written during this period was \"Stop\", the lyrics for which cover the group's frustrations with being overworked by their management.\nIn September, the Spice Girls performed \"Say You'll Be There\" at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and won Best Dance Video for \"Wannabe\". The MTV Awards came five days after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, with tributes paid to her throughout the ceremony. Chisholm stated, \"We'd like to dedicate this award to Princess Diana, who is a great loss to our country.\" At the 1997 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, the group won four awards for New Artist of the Year, \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles Group of the Year, \"Billboard\" 200 Group of the Year and \"Billboard\" 200 Album of the Year for \"Spice\".\n\"Spiceworld\" and feature film.\nIn October 1997, the Spice Girls released the first single from their second album, \"Spiceworld\", \"Spice Up Your Life\". It entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, making it the group's fifth consecutive number-one single. That same month, the group performed their first live major concert to 40,000 fans in Istanbul, Turkey. Later, they launched the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal, then travelled to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela, who announced, \"These are my heroes.\"\nIn November, the Spice Girls released \"Spiceworld\". It set a new record for the fastest-selling album when it shipped seven million copies over the course of two weeks. Gaining favourable reviews, the album went on to sell over 10 million copies in Europe, Canada, and the United States combined, and 14 million copies worldwide.\nCriticised in the United States for releasing the album just nine months after their debut there, which gave the group two simultaneous Top 10 albums in the \"Billboard\" album charts, and suffering from over-exposure at home, the Spice Girls began to experience a media backlash. They were criticised for their number of sponsorship deals\u2014more than 20\u2014and their chart positions declined. Nevertheless, the Spice Girls remained the best-selling pop group of both 1997 and 1998.\nOn 7 November 1997, the Spice Girls performed \"Spice Up Your Life\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards and won the Best Group award. The morning of the performance, they fired Fuller and began managing themselves. To ensure a smooth transition, Halliwell allegedly stole a mobile phone from Fuller's assistant that contained the group's schedule and Fuller's business contacts. The firing was front-page news around the world. Many commentators speculated that Fuller had been the mastermind behind the group, and that the Spice Girls had lost their impetus and direction.\nLater in November, the Spice Girls became the first pop group to host ITV's \"An Audience with...\" Their show was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the population. In December 1997, the second single from \"Spiceworld\", \"Too Much\", was released, becoming the Spice Girls' second Christmas number one and their sixth consecutive number-one UK single. That month, the Spice Girls launched a feature-length film, \"Spice World\". The world premiere, at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, London, was attended by celebrities including Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry. The film was a commercial success but received poor reviews. The Spice Girls ended 1997 as the year's most played artist on American radio.\n1998: Spiceworld tour and Halliwell's departure.\nIn January 1998, the Spice Girls attended the US premiere of \"Spice World\" at the Mann's Chinese Theatre. At the 1998 American Music Awards a few days later, they won the awards for Favorite Album, Favorite New Artist and Favorite Group in the pop/rock category. In February, they won a special award for overseas success at the 1998 Brit Awards, with combined sales of more than 45 million albums and singles worldwide. That night, the group performed their next single, \"Stop\", their first not to reach number one in the UK, entering at number two. On 24 February 1998, the Spice Girls embarked on the Spiceworld Tour, starting in Dublin, Ireland, before moving to mainland Europe and North America and returning to the UK for two performances at Wembley Stadium. Later that year, the Spice Girls sang on the official England World Cup song \"(How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World\", their last song with Halliwell until 2007.\nOn 31 May 1998, Halliwell announced her departure from the Spice Girls through her solicitor. The announcement was preceded by days of frenzied press speculation after Halliwell missed two concerts in Norway and was absent from a performance on \"The National Lottery Draws\". Halliwell first cited creative differences, and later said that she was suffering from exhaustion and disillusionment. Rumours of a power struggle with Melanie Brown circulated in the press. Halliwell's departure shocked fans and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year, making international headlining news. The four remaining members were adamant that the group would carry on.\nThe North American leg of the Spiceworld Tour went on as planned, beginning in West Palm Beach, Florida, on 15 June, and grossing $93.6 million over 40 sold-out performances. The tour was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people over 97 shows with an estimated gross of $220-$250 million, the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group. It was accompanied by a documentary film, \"\". \"Viva Forever\", the last single released from \"Spiceworld\", became the Spice Girls' seventh UK number-one. The video was made before Halliwell's departure and features all five members in stop-motion animated form.\nWhile on tour in the United States, the Spice Girls wrote and recorded new material. They released a new song, \"Goodbye\", before Christmas in 1998. It was seen as a tribute to Halliwell, although parts of it had originally been written when Halliwell was still a part of the group. It became the Spice Girls' third consecutive Christmas number one, equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. In November, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other bandmates, accepting two awards on behalf of the Spice Girls for Best Pop Act and Best Group. That year, Brown and Adams announced they were pregnant. Brown was married to the dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period; she gave birth to their daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. Adams gave birth a month after to her son Brooklyn, whose father was the Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland, taking on his surname, becoming Victoria Beckham.\n1999\u20132000: \"Forever\", solo work, hiatus and split.\nBy 1999, Brown, Bunton, and Chisholm, had all released music as solo artists. They returned to the studio in August 1999 after an eight-month recording break. It was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The sound took on a more mature direction when American producers including Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on board to collaborate with the group.\nIn December 1999, the Spice Girls embarked on a UK tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, during which they showcased new songs from the third album. The eight-show tour was attended by more than 153,000 people, grossing $5.7 million in ticket sales. The first four shows, at Manchester Evening News Arena, grossed $2.6 million; the second portion of the tour saw the group play another four shows at Earls Court Arena, grossing $3.1 million. Earlier in the year, the Spice Girls recorded the song \"My Strongest Suit\" for \"Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida\", a concept album which became the musical \"Aida\". The Spice Girls performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards in March, where they received the Lifetime Achievement award. Halliwell attended but did not join her former bandmates on stage.\nIn November 2000, the Spice Girls released their third and final album, \"Forever\". With an edgier R&amp;B sound, it received lukewarm reviews. In the US, it reached number 39 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. In the UK, it was released the same week as Westlife's \"Coast to Coast\" and the chart battle was widely reported by the media; Westlife reached number one and the Spice Girls number two. The lead single, the double A-side \"Holler\" / \"Let Love Lead the Way\", became Spice Girls' ninth UK number one. It failed to enter the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The Spice Girls' only major performance of the single came at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards in November. In total, \"Forever\" sold over four million copies. The Spice Girls ceased promotional activities in December 2000, as they began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers. They insisted that the group was not splitting.\n2007\u20132008: Return of the Spice Girls and \"Greatest Hits\".\nOn 28 June 2007, all five members of the Spice Girls, held a press conference at the O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite for a worldwide concert tour, The Return of the Spice Girls Tour. The plan to re-form had long been speculated by the media, with previous attempts by the organisers of Live 8 and Concert for Diana to reunite the group as a five-piece falling through. Each member of the group was reportedly paid \u00a310 million ($20 million) to do the reunion tour. \"Giving You Everything\", an official documentary film about the reunion, was directed by Bob Smeaton and first aired on Australia's Fox8 on 16 December 2007, followed by BBC One in the UK on 31 December.\nTicket sales for the first London date of The Return of the Spice Girls Tour sold out in 38 seconds. It was reported that over one million people signed up in the UK alone and over five million worldwide for the ticket ballot on the band's official website. Sixteen additional dates in London were added, all selling out within one minute. In the United States, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Jose shows also sold out, prompting additional dates to be added. It was announced that the Spice Girls would be playing dates in Chicago and Detroit and Boston, as well as additional dates in New York to keep up with the demand. The tour opened in Vancouver on 2 December 2007, with the Spice Girls performing to an audience of 15,000 people, singing 20 songs and changing outfits a total of eight times. Along with the tour sellout, the Spice Girls licensed their name and image to the supermarket chain Tesco.\nThe Spice Girls' comeback single, \"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\", was announced as the official Children in Need charity single for 2007 and was released 5 November. The first public appearance on stage by the Spice Girls occurred at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, where they performed two songs, 1998 single \"Stop\" and the lead single from their greatest hits album, \"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\". The show was filmed by CBS on 15 November 2007 for broadcast on 4 December 2007. They also performed both songs live for the BBC Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2007 from Los Angeles. The release of \"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\" peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, making it the group's lowest-charting British single to date. The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 February 2008, it was announced that due to personal and family commitments their tour would come to an end in Toronto on 26 February 2008, meaning that tour dates in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Cape Town and Buenos Aires were cancelled.\nThe tour was the highest-grossing concert act of 2007\u20132008, measured as the twelve months ending in April 2008. It produced $107.2 million in ticket sales and merchandising, with sponsorship and ad deals bringing the total to $200 million. The tour's 17-night sellout stand at the O2 Arena in London was the highest-grossing engagement of the year, netting \u00a316.5 million (US$33 million) and drawing an audience of 256,647, winning the 2008 \"Billboard\" Touring Award for Top Boxscore. The group's comeback also netted them several other awards, including the Capital Music Icon Award, the \"Glamour\" Award for Best Band, and the Vodafone Live Music Award for Best Live Return, the last of which saw them beat out acts such as Led Zeppelin and the Sex Pistols.\n2010, 2012: \"Viva Forever!\" and London Olympics.\nAt the 2010 Brit Awards, the Spice Girls received a special award for \"Best Performance of the 30th Year\". The award was for their 1997 Brit Awards performance of \"Wannabe\" and \"Who Do You Think You Are\", with Geri Halliwell and Mel B receiving the award from Samantha Fox on behalf of the group.\nThat year, the Spice Girls collaborated with Fuller, Judy Craymer and Jennifer Saunders to develop a stage musical, \"Viva Forever!\". Similar to the ABBA musical \"Mamma Mia!\", \"Viva Forever!\" used the group's music to create an original story. In June 2012, to promote the musical, the Spice Girls reunited for a press conference at the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, where the music video for \"Wannabe\" had been filmed exactly sixteen years earlier. They also appeared in the documentary \"Spice Girls' Story: Viva Forever!\", which aired on 24 December 2012 on ITV1. \"Viva Forever!\" premiered at the West End's Piccadilly Theatre in December 2012, with all five Spice Girls in attendance. It was panned by critics and closed after seven months, with a loss of at least \u00a35 million. In 2016, Mel B said she had disliked the musical and that the Spice Girls had wanted it to instead portray their story.\nIn August 2012, the Spice Girls reunited to perform a medley of \"Wannabe\" and \"Spice Up Your Life\" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Their performance received acclaim, and became the most-tweeted moment of the Olympics with over 116,000 tweets per minute on Twitter.\n2016, 2018\u20132019: G.E.M and Spice World tour.\nOn 8 July 2016, Brown, Bunton and Halliwell released a video celebrating the 20th anniversary of \"Wannabe\" and teased news from them as a three-piece. Beckham and Chisholm opted not to take part but gave the project their blessing. A new song, \"Song for Her\", was leaked online in November. The reunion project was cancelled due to Halliwell's pregnancy.\nIn late 2018 the Spice Girls officially\nannounced their second reunion tour, with tickets going on sale in November 2018. They also revealed they would do it as a four-piece without Beckham, as she declined to join due to commitments regarding her fashion business. Each of the four participating members was reportedly paid \u00a312 million for the tour.\nOn 24 May 2019, they began the Spice World \u2013 2019 Tour of the UK and Ireland at Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland. The tour concluded with three concerts at London's Wembley Stadium, with the last taking place on 15 June 2019. Over 13 dates, the tour produced 700,000 spectators and earned $78.2 million in ticket sales. The three-night sellout stand at Wembley Stadium was the highest-grossing engagement of the year, drawing an audience of 221,971 and winning the 2019 \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for Top Boxscore. Despite sound problems in the early concerts, Anna Nicholson in \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"As nostalgia tours go, this could hardly have been bettered.\"\nAlongside the tour, the group teamed up with the children's book franchise \"Mr. Men\" to create derivative products such as books, cups, bags and coasters. On 13 June 2019, it was reported that Paramount Animation had greenlit an animated Spice Girls film with old and new songs. The project will be produced by Simon Fuller and written by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith. A director has not been announced.\n2020\u20132025: Anniversary commemorations.\nTo mark the 25th anniversary of \"Wannabe\", an EP was released in July 2021 that included previously unreleased demos. On 29 October, the Spice Girls released \"Spice25\", a deluxe reissue of \"Spice\" featuring previously unreleased demos and remixes. The deluxe release saw the album reenter the UK Albums Chart at number five.\nOn 27 September 2022, the Spice Girls announced the tracklisting for \"Spiceworld25\", the 25th anniversary edition of their album \"Spiceworld\". The new collection features previously unreleased live versions and remixes, plus previously available B-sides \"Walk of Life\" and \"Outer Space Girls\" and a megamix. Their song \"Step to Me\" was released digitally for the first time ever on the same day as the album announcement. \"Spiceworld25\" was released on 4 November 2022 and charted at number 46 on the UK Albums Chart. To promote the reissue, new music videos for \"Spice Up Your Life\" and \"Never Give Up on the Good Times\" were also released.\nRoyal Mail issued fifteen stamps from 11 January 2024 onwards to mark the 30th anniversary of the Spice Girls. \"Forever25\", the 25th anniversary edition of \"Forever\", was released on vinyl on 7 November 2025. On the same day, the group also issued a Christmas-themed EP titled \"Spice Up Your Xmas!\", featuring two previously released holiday tracks (\"Christmas Wrapping\" and \"Sleigh Ride\") alongside the group's three Christmas number-one singles.\nArtistry.\nMusical style.\nAccording to AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Spice Girls \"used dance-pop as a musical base, but they infused the music with a fiercely independent, feminist stance that was equal parts Madonna, post-riot grrrl alternative rock feminism, and a co-opting of the good-times-all-the-time stance of England's new lad culture.\" Their songs incorporated a variety of genres, which Halliwell described as a \"melding\" of the group members' eclectic musical tastes, but otherwise kept to mainstream pop conventions. Chisholm said: \"We all had different artists that we loved. Madonna was a big influence and TLC; we watched a lot of their videos.\" A regular collaborator on the group's first two albums was the production duo known as Absolute, made up of Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins. Absolute initially found it difficult to work with the group as the duo was heavily into R&amp;B music at the time, while the Spice Girls according to Wilson were \"always very poptastic\". Wilson said of the group's musical output: \"Their sound was actually not getting R&amp;B quite right.\"\nIn his biography of the band, \"\" (2004), \"Rolling Stone\" journalist David Sinclair said that the \"undeniable artistry\" of the group's songs had been overlooked. He said the Spice Girls \"instinctively had an ear for a catchy tune\" without resorting to the \"formula balladry and bland modulations\" of 90s boy bands Westlife and Boyzone. He praised their \"more sophisticated\" second album, \"Spiceworld\", saying: \"Peppered with personality, and each conveying a distinctive musical flavour and lyrical theme, these are songs which couldn't sound \"less\" 'manufactured', and which, in several cases, transcend the pop genre altogether.\"\nLyrical themes.\nThe Spice Girls' lyrics promote female empowerment and solidarity. Given the young age of their target audience, Lucy Jones of \"The Independent\" said the Spice Girls' songs were subversive for their time: \"The lyrics were active rather than passive: taking, grabbing, laying it down \u2013 all the things little girls were taught never to do. 'Stop right now, thank you very much'. 'Who do you think you are?' 'I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want'.\" Musicologist Nicola Dibben cited \"Say You'll Be There\" as an example of how the Spice Girls inverted traditional gender roles in their lyrics, depicting a man who has fallen in love and displays too much emotion and a woman who remains independent and in control. The Spice Girls emphasised the importance of sisterhood over romance in songs such as \"Wannabe\", and embraced safe sex in \"2 Become 1\".\nLauren Bravo, author of \"What Would the Spice Girls Do?: How the Girl Power Generation Grew Up\" (2018), found that even when the Spice Girls sang about romance, the message was \"cheerfully non-committal\", in contrast to the songs about breakups and unrequited love other pop stars were singing at the time. Writing for \"Bustle\", Taylor Ferber praised the female-driven lyrics as ahead of their time, citing the inclusivity and optimism of songs such as \"Spice Up Your Life\" and the sex-positivity of \"Last Time Lover\" and \"Naked\". Ferber concluded: \"Between all of their songs about friendship, sex, romance, and living life, a central theme in almost all Spice Girls music was loving yourself first.\"\nVocal arrangements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Five women in a band together, sharing songwriting credit and vocal duties equally, was a new concept in British pop in 1996.\u2014\u200a\nUnlike prior pop vocal groups, the Spice Girls shared vocals, rather than having a lead vocalist supported by others. The group did not want any one member to be considered the lead singer, and so each song was divided into one or two lines each, before all five voices harmonised in the chorus. The group faced criticism as this meant that no one voice could stand out, but Sinclair concluded that it \"was actually a clever device to ensure that they gained the maximum impact and mileage from their all-in-it-together girl-gang image\".\nThe Spice Girls' former vocal coach, Pepi Lemer, described their individual voices as distinct and easy to distinguish, citing the \"lightness\" of Bunton's voice and the \"soulful sound\" of Brown's and Chisholm's. Biographer Sean Smith cited Chisholm as the vocalist the group could not do without. Sinclair noted that while Chisholm's ad libs are a distinctive feature of certain Spice Girls songs, the difference in the amount of time her voice was featured over any other member was negligible.\nWhile vocal time was distributed equally, musicologist Nicola Dibben found that there was an \"interesting inequality\" in the way that vocal styles were distributed within the group, which she felt conformed to certain stereotypes associated with race and socioeconomic background. According to Dibben, most of the declamatory style of singing in the group's singles were performed by Brown, the only black member, and Chisholm, whom Dibben classified as white working class; this was in contrast to the more lyrical sections allotted to Beckham, whom Dibben classified as white middle class.\nSongwriting.\nThe Spice Girls did not play instruments, but co-wrote all of their songs. According to their frequent collaborator Richard Stannard, they had two approaches to songwriting: ballads were written in a traditional way with the group sitting around a piano, while songs such as \"Wannabe\" were the result of tapping into their \"mad\" energy. Eliot Kennedy, another regular co-writer, said that songwriting sessions with the Spice Girls were \"very quick and short\". He described his experience working with them:\nWhat I said to them was, \"Look, I've got a chorus\u2014check this out.\" And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody\u2014no lyrics or anything\u2014and straight away five pads and pencils came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later, the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few things here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.\nAbsolute's Paul Wilson recalled an experience whereby he and Watkins were responsible for writing the backing track and the group would then write the lyrics. Watkins added: \"I wasn't an 18-year-old girl. They always had this weird ability to come up with phrases that you'd never heard of.\" He said the members would create dance routines at the same time as writing songs, and that \"They knew what they wanted to write about, right from day one. You couldn't force your musical ideas upon them.\"\nFrom the onset, the Spice Girls established a strict 50\u201350 split of the publishing royalties between them and their songwriting collaborators. As with their vocal arrangements, they were also adamant on maintaining parity between themselves in the songwriting credits. Sinclair said:\nThe deal between themselves was a strict five-way split on their share of the songwriting royalties \"on all songs\" irrespective of what any one member of the group had (or had not) contributed to any particular song. Apart from ease of administration, this was also a symbolic expression of the unity which was so much part and parcel of the Spice philosophy.\nSinclair identified Halliwell as a major source of ideas for the Spice Girls' songs, including many of the concepts and starting points for the group's songs. Tim Hawes, who worked with the group when they were starting out, said Halliwell's strength was in writing lyrics and pop hooks, and estimated that she was responsible for 60\u201370% of the lyrics in the songs he worked on. The group's collaborators credit the other members of the group as being more active than Halliwell in constructing the melodies and harmonies of their songs. Matt Rowe, who wrote several songs with the Spice Girls, agreed that Halliwell was particularly good when it came to writing lyrics and credits the lyrics for \"Viva Forever\" to her. He felt that all five members had contributed equally to the songwriting.\nCultural impact and legacy.\nPop music resurgence and girl group boom.\nThe Spice Girls debuted at a time when alternative rock, hip-hop and R&amp;B dominated global music charts. In the group's first interview in May 1996, Halliwell told \"Music Week\": \"We want to bring some of the glamour back to pop, like Madonna had when we were growing up. Pop is about fantasy and escapism, but there's so much bullshit around at the moment.\" The modern pop phenomenon that the Spice Girls created by targeting early Millennials was credited with changing the music landscape by reviving the pop music genre, bringing about the global wave of late-1990s and early-2000s teen pop acts such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and NSYNC.\nThe Spice Girls have been credited with paving the way for the girl groups and female pop singers that have come after them. Unlike previous girl groups, such as the Andrews Sisters, whose target market was male record buyers, the Spice Girls targeted a young female fanbase. In the UK, they are further credited for disrupting the then male-dominated pop music scene. Prior to the Spice Girls, girl groups such as Bananarama had hit singles in the UK but their album sales were generally underwhelming. A common opinion within the British music industry at the time was that an all-girl pop group would not work because both girls and boys would find the concept too threatening. As a result, teen magazines such as \"Smash Hits\" and \"Top of the Pops\" initially refused to feature the Spice Girls.\nThe massive commercial success of the Spice Girls led to a boom of new girl groups in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Around 20 new girl groups were launched in the UK in 1999, followed by another 35 the next year. Groups that emerged during this period include All Saints, B*Witched, Atomic Kitten, Girl Thing, Girls@Play, Girls Aloud and the Sugababes, all hoping to emulate the Spice Girls' success. Outside of the UK and Ireland, girl groups such as New Zealand's TrueBliss, Australia's Bardot, Germany's No Angels, Belgium's K3, Spain's Bellepop, Brazil's Rouge, US's Cheetah Girls, as well as South Korea's Baby Vox and f(x) were also modelled after the Spice Girls.\nTwenty-first-century girl groups continue to cite the Spice Girls as a major source of influence, including the Pussycat Dolls, 2NE1, Girls' Generation, Little Mix, Fifth Harmony, Haim, and Blackpink. Solo female artists who have been similarly influenced by the group include Jess Glynne, Anne-Marie, Foxes, Alexandra Burke, JoJo, Charli XCX, Rita Ora, Billie Eilish, and Beyonc\u00e9. During her 2005 \"Reflections\" concert series, Filipino singer Regine Velasquez performed a medley of five Spice Girls songs as a tribute to the group, citing them as a major influence on her music. Danish singer-songwriter M\u00d8 decided to pursue music after watching the Spice Girls on TV as a child, saying in a 2014 interview: \"I have them and only them to thank\u2014or to blame\u2014for becoming a singer.\" 16-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Adele credits the Spice Girls as a major influence in regard to her love and passion for music, stating that \"they made me what I am today\".\nGirl power.\n\"Girl power\" was a label for the particular facet of feminist empowerment embraced by the band, emphasising female confidence, individuality and sisterhood. The Spice Girls' particular approach to \"girl power\" was seen as a boisterous, independent, and sex-positive response to \"lad culture\". The phrase was regularly espoused by all five members\u2014although most closely associated with Halliwell\u2014and was often delivered with a peace sign. The \"girl power\" slogan was originally coined by US punk band Bikini Kill in 1991 and subsequently appeared in a few songs in the early and mid-1990s; most notably, it was the title of British pop duo Shampoo's 1996 single which Halliwell later said was her introduction to the phrase. Although the term did not originate with them, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 that \"girl power\" exploded onto the mainstream consciousness. According to Chisholm, the band were inspired to champion this cause as a result of the sexism they encountered when they were first starting out in the music business. Industry insiders credit Halliwell as being the author of the group's \"girl power\" manifesto, while Halliwell herself once spoke of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher as being \"the pioneer of our ideology\".\nIn all, the focused, consistent presentation of \"girl power\" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. The Spice Girls' brand of postfeminism was distinctive and its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women; by being politically neutral, it did not alienate consumers with different allegiances. Virgin's director of press Robert Sandall explained the novelty of the group: \"There had never been a group of girls who were addressing themselves specifically to a female audience before.\" Similarly, John Harlow of \"The Sunday Times\" believed it was this \"loyal[ty] to their sex\" that set the Spice Girls apart from their predecessors, enabling them to win over young female fans where previous girl groups had struggled. While \"girl power\" put a name to a social phenomenon, it was met with mixed reactions. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism\u2014popularised as \"girl power\"\u2014in the 1990s, with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. Conversely, critics dismiss it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic and accuse the group of commercialising the social movement. Regardless, \"girl power\" became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nIn summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, \"The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.\"\nIn keeping with their \"girl power\" manifesto, the Spice Girls' songs have been praised for their \"genuinely empowering messages about friendship and sisterhood,\" which set them apart from the typical love songs their pop contemporaries were singing. \"Billboard\" magazine said their lyrics \"demonstrated real, noncompetitive female friendship,\" adding that the messages the Spice Girls imparted have held up well compared to the lyrics sung by later girl groups such as the Pussycat Dolls. The group's debut single \"Wannabe\" has been hailed as an \"iconic girl power anthem\". In 2016, the United Nations launched their #WhatIReallyReallyWant Global Goals campaign by filming a remake of the \"Wannabe\" music video to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which premiered on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian \"viral sensation\" Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world. In response to the remake, Beckham said, \"How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls' girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?\"\nAt the 43rd People's Choice Awards in 2017, Blake Lively dedicated her \"Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress\" award to \"girl power\" in her acceptance speech; she credited the Spice Girls, saying: \"What was so neat about them was that they're all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.\" In 2018, \"Rolling Stone\" named the Spice Girls' \"girl power\" ethos on \"The Millennial 100\", a list of 100 people, music, cultural touchstones and movements that have shaped the Millennial generation. Writing in 2019 about the group's influence on what she called the \"Spice Girls Generation\", Caity Weaver of \"The New York Times\" concluded, \"Marketing ploy or not, 'Girl power' had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"\nCool Britannia.\nThe term \"Cool Britannia\" became prominent in the media in the 1990s and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by New Labour and the new British prime minister Tony Blair. Coming out of a period of 18 years of Conservative government, Tony Blair and New Labour were seen as young, cool and appealing, a driving force in giving Britain a feeling of euphoria and optimism.\nAlthough by no means responsible for the onset of \"Cool Britannia\", the arrival of the Spice Girls added to the new image and re-branding of Britain, and underlined the growing world popularity of British, rather than American, pop music. This fact was underlined at the 1997 Brit Awards; the group won two awards but it was Halliwell's iconic red, white and blue Union Jack mini-dress that appeared in media coverage around the world, becoming an enduring image of \"Cool Britannia\". The Spice Girls were identified as part of another British Invasion of the US, and in 2016, \"Time\" acknowledged the Spice Girls as \"arguably the most recognisable face\" of \"Cool Britannia\".\nImage, nicknames and fashion trends.\nThe Spice Girls' image was deliberately aimed at young girls, an audience of formidable size and potential. Instrumental to their range of appeal within this demographic was their five distinct personalities and styles, which encouraged fans to identify with one member or another. This rejection of a homogeneous group identity was a stark departure from previous groups such as the Beatles and the Supremes, and the Spice Girls model has since been used to style other pop groups such as One Direction.\nThe band's image was inadvertently bolstered by the nicknames bestowed on them by the British press. After a lunch with the Spice Girls in the wake of \"Wannabe\"'s release, Peter Loraine, the then-editor of \"Top of the Pops\" magazine, and his editorial staff decided to devise nicknames for each member of the group based on their personalities. Loraine explained, \"In the magazine we used silly language and came up with nicknames all the time so it came naturally to give them names that would be used by the magazine and its readers; it was never meant to be adopted globally.\" Shortly after using the nicknames in a magazine feature on the group, Loraine received calls from other British media outlets requesting permission to use them, and before long the nicknames were synonymous with the Spice Girls. Jennifer Cawthron, one of the magazine's staff writers, explained how the nicknames were chosen:\nVictoria was 'Posh Spice', because she was wearing a Gucci-style mini dress and seemed pouty and reserved. Emma wore pigtails and sucked a lollipop, so obviously she was 'Baby Spice'. Mel C spent the whole time leaping around in her tracksuit, so we called her 'Sporty Spice'. I named Mel B 'Scary Spice' because she was so shouty. And Geri was 'Ginger Spice', simply because of her hair. Not much thought went into that one.\nIn a 2020 interview, Chisholm explained that the Spice Girls' image came about unintentionally when, after initially trying to coordinate their outfits as was expected of girl groups at the time, the group decided to just dress in their own individual styles. According to Chisholm, they \"never thought too much more of it\" until after \"Wannabe\" was released and the press gave them their nicknames. The group embraced the nicknames and grew into caricatures of themselves, which Chisholm said was \"like a protection mechanism because it was like putting on this armour of being this, this character, rather than it actually being you.\"\nEach Spice Girl adopted a distinct, over-the-top trademark style that served as an extension of her public persona.\nThe Spice Girls are considered style icons of the 1990s; their image and styles becoming inextricably tied to the band's identity. They are credited with setting 1990s fashion trends such as Buffalo platform shoes and double bun hairstyles. Their styles have inspired other celebrities including Katy Perry, Charli XCX, and Bollywood actress Anushka Ranjan. Lady Gaga performed as Emma Bunton (Baby Spice) in high school talent shows and Emma Stone chose the name \"Emma\" inspired by Emma Bunton after she previously used the name Riley Stone. The group have also been noted for the memorable outfits they have worn, the most iconic being Halliwell's Union Jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards. The dress was sold at a charity auction to the Las Vegas Hard Rock Cafe for \u00a341,320, giving Halliwell the \"Guinness World Record\" at that time for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold.\nCommercialisation and celebrity culture.\nAt the height of Spicemania, the Spice Girls were involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, they advertised for an unprecedented number of brands and became the most merchandised group in music history. The group were also a frequent feature of the global press. As a result, said biographer David Sinclair, \"So great was the daily bombardment of Spice images and Spice product that it quickly became oppressive even to people who were well disposed towards the group.\" This was parodied in the video for their song \"Spice Up Your Life\", which depicts a futuristic dystopian city covered in billboards and adverts featuring the group. Similarly, the North American leg of their 1998 Spiceworld Tour introduced a whole new concert revenue stream when it became the first time advertising was used in a pop concert. Overall, the Spice Girls' earnings in the 1990s were on par with that of a medium-sized corporation thanks in large part to their marketing endeavours, with their global gross income estimated at $500\u2013800 million by May 1998.\nIn his analysis of the group's enduring influence on 21st-century popular culture, John Mckie of the BBC observed that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past, \"the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band\". Christopher Barrett and Ben Cardew of \"Music Week\" credited Fuller's \"ground-breaking\" strategy of marketing the Spice Girls as a brand with revolutionising the pop music industry, \"paving the way for everything from The White Stripes cameras to U2 iPods and Girls Aloud phones.\" Barrett further noted that pop music and brand synergy have become inextricably linked in the modern music industry, which he attributed to the \"remarkable\" impact of the Spice Girls. \"The Guardian\"'s Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the group's true legacy: \"[T]hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand, of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse, of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since.\"\nThe mainstream media embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success. The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi. Paul Gorman of \"Music Week\" said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s: \"They inaugurated the era of cheesy celebrity obsession which pertains today. There is lineage from them to the Kardashianisation not only of the music industry, but the wider culture.\" The \"Irish Independent\"'s Tanya Sweeney agreed that \"[t]he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls' naked ambitions\", while Mckie predicted that, \"[f]or all that modern stars from Katy Perry to Lionel Messi exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage, the scale of the Spice Girls' breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated\u2014at least not by a music act.\"\n1990s and gay icons.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Much as the Spice Girls broke (and still retain) records for chart-climbing in their prime, they remain an anomaly of the pop machine\u2014still household-name famous two decades on. Perhaps it was their original prowess, or the press's continued fascination with them, but the Spice Girls remain a cultural touchstone while their contemporaries... have struggled to.\u2014\u200a\nThe Spice Girls have been labelled the biggest pop phenomenon of the 1990s due to the international record sales, iconic symbolism, global cultural influence and apparent omnipresence they held during the decade. The group appeared on the cover of the July 1997 edition of \"Rolling Stone\" accompanied with the headline, \"Spice Girls Conquer the World\". At the 2000 Brit Awards, the group received the Outstanding Contribution to Music Award in honour of their success in the global music scene in the 1990s. The iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is partly attributed to their era-defining outfits, the most notable being the Union Jack dress that Halliwell wore at the 1997 Brit Awards. The dress has achieved iconic status, becoming one of the most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture. The status of the Spice Girls as 1990s pop culture icons is also attributed to their vast marketing efforts and willingness to be a part of a media-driven world. Their unprecedented appearances in adverts and the media solidified the group as a phenomenon\u2014an icon of the decade and for British music.\nA study conducted by the British Council in 2000 found that the Spice Girls were the second-best-known Britons internationally\u2014only behind then-Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2014and the best-known Britons in Asia. The group were featured in VH1's \"I Love the '90s\" and the sequel \"\"; the series covered cultural moments from 1990s with the Spice Girls' rise to fame representing the year 1997, while Halliwell quitting the group represented 1998. In 2006, ten years after the release of their debut single, the Spice Girls were voted the biggest cultural icons of the 1990s with 80 per cent of the votes in a UK poll of 1,000 people carried out for the board game \"Trivial Pursuit\", stating that \"Girl Power\" defined the decade. The Spice Girls also ranked number ten in the E! TV special, \"The 101 Reasons the '90s Ruled\".\nSome sources, especially those in the United Kingdom, regard the Spice Girls as gay icons. In a 2007 UK survey of more than 5,000 gay men and women, Beckham placed 12th and Halliwell placed 43rd in a ranking of the top 50 gay icons. Halliwell was the recipient of the Honorary Gay Award at the 2016 Attitude Awards and Chisholm was given the \"Celebrity Ally\" award at the 2021 British LGBT Awards. In a 2005 interview, Bunton attributed their large gay following to the group's fun-loving nature, open-mindedness and their love of fashion and dressing up. The LGBTQ magazine \"Gay Times\" credits the Spice Girls as having been \"ferocious advocates of the community\" throughout their whole career. According to Bunton, the LGBTQ community was a big influence on the group's music. A desire to be more inclusive also led the group to change the lyrics in \"2 Become 1\"; the lyric \"Any deal that we endeavour/boys and girls feel good together\" appears in their debut album but was changed to \"Once again if we endeavour/love will bring us back together\" for the single and music video release.\nPortrayal in the media.\nThe Spice Girls became media icons in Great Britain and a regular feature of the British press. During the peak of their worldwide fame in 1997, the paparazzi were constantly seen following them everywhere to obtain stories and gossip about the group, such as a supposed affair between Emma Bunton and manager Simon Fuller, or constant split rumours which became fodder for numerous tabloids. Rumours of in-fighting and conflicts within the group also made headlines, with the rumours suggesting that Geri Halliwell and Melanie Brown in particular were fighting to be the leader of the group. Brown, who later admitted that she used to be a \"bitch\" to Halliwell, said the problems had stayed in the past. The rumours reached their height when the Spice Girls dismissed their manager Simon Fuller during the power struggles, with Fuller reportedly receiving a \u00a310 million severance cheque to keep quiet about the details of his sacking. Months later, in May 1998, Halliwell would leave the band amid rumours of a falling out with Brown; the news of Halliwell's departure was covered as a major news story by media around the world, and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the decade.\nIn February 1997 at the Brit Awards, Halliwell's Union Jack dress from the Spice Girls' live performance made all the front pages the next day. During the ceremony, Halliwell's breasts were exposed twice, causing controversy. In the same year, nude glamour shots of Halliwell taken earlier in her career were released, causing some scandal.\nThe stories of their encounters with other celebrities also became fodder for the press; for example, in May 1997, at The Prince's Trust 21st-anniversary concert, Brown and Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles's cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him \"you're very sexy\" and also pinched his bottom. In November, the British royal family were considered fans of the Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: \"These are my heroes. This is one of the greatest moments in my life\" in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, \"It is the second greatest moment in my life, the first time I met them was the greatest\". Prince Charles would later send Halliwell a personal letter \"with lots of love\" when he heard that she had quit the Spice Girls. In 1998 the video game magazine \"Nintendo Power\" created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: \"What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?\".\nVictoria Adams started dating football player David Beckham in late 1997 after they had met at a charity football match. The couple announced their engagement in 1998 and were dubbed \"Posh and Becks\" by the media, becoming a cultural phenomenon in their own right.\nOther brand ventures.\nFilm.\nThe group made their film debut in \"Spice World\" with director Bob Spiers. Meant to accompany their second album, the style and content of the movie was in the same vein as the Beatles' films in the 1960s such as \"A Hard Day's Night\". The light-hearted comedy, intended to capture the spirit of the Spice Girls, featured Richard E. Grant, Alan Cumming, Roger Moore, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Elton John, Richard O'Brien, Bob Hoskins, Jennifer Saunders, Elvis Costello and Meat Loaf.\n\"Spice World\" was released in December 1997 and proved to be a hit at the box office, taking in over $100 million worldwide. Despite being a commercial success, the film was widely panned by critics; the movie was nominated for seven awards at the 1999 Golden Raspberry Awards where the Spice Girls collectively won the award for \"Worst Actress\". Considered a cult classic, several critics have reevaluated the film more positively in the years following its initial release. Since 2014, the Spice Bus, which was driven by Meat Loaf in the film, has been on permanent display at the Island Harbour Marina on the Isle of Wight, England.\nTelevision.\nThe Spice Girls have hosted and starred in various television specials. In November 1997, they became the first pop group to host ITV's \"An Audience with...\"; their show featured an all-female audience and was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the country's population. The group hosted the Christmas Day edition of \"Top of the Pops\" on BBC1 in 1996. The following year, a special Christmas Eve edition of the BBC series was dedicated to them, titled \"Spice Girls on Top of the Pops\". The group have also starred in numerous MTV television specials, including \"Spice Girls: Girl Power A\u2013Z\" and \"MTV Ultrasound, Sugar and Spice and Everything Nice\". Their concerts have also been broadcast in various countries: Girl Power! Live in Istanbul (1997) was broadcast on ITV, Showtime, and Fox Family Channel; Spiceworld Tour (1998) was broadcast on Sky Box Office; and Christmas in Spiceworld (1999) was broadcast on Sky One and Fox Kids, among others.\nThe group have starred in television commercials for brands such as Pepsi, Polaroid, Walkers, Impulse and Tesco. They have also released a few official documentary films, including ' (1999) and \"Giving You Everything\" (2007). Making-of documentaries for their film \"Spice World\" were broadcast on Channel 5 and MTV. The Spice Girls have been the subject of numerous unofficial documentary films, commissioned and produced by individuals independent of the group, including \"Raw Spice\" (2001), \"Seven Days That Shook the Spice Girls\" (2002), and ' (2021). The group have had episodes dedicated to them in several music biography series, including VH1's \"Behind the Music\", \"E! True Hollywood Story\" and MTV's \"BioRhythm\".\nMerchandise and sponsorship deals.\nIn the late 1990s, the Spice Girls were involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon that saw them become the most merchandised group in music history. They negotiated lucrative endorsement deals with numerous brands, including Pepsi, Asda, Cadbury and Target, which led to accusations of overexposure and \"selling out\". The group was estimated to have earned over \u00a3300 million ($500 million) from their marketing endeavours in 1997 alone. Their subsequent reunion concert tours saw the Spice Girls launch new sponsorship and advertising campaigns with the likes of Tesco and Victoria's Secret in 2007, and Walkers and \"Mr. Men\" in 2019.\nViva Forever!\n\"Viva Forever!\" is a jukebox musical written by Jennifer Saunders, produced by Judy Craymer and directed by Paul Garrington. Based on the songs of the Spice Girls, the musical ran at the Piccadilly Theatre in the West End from 11 December 2012 to 29 June 2013.\nCareer records and achievements.\nAs a group, the Spice Girls have received a number of notable awards, including five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, four \"Billboard\" Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award and three World Music Awards. They have also been recognised for their songwriting achievements with two Ivor Novello Awards. In 2000, they received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, making them the youngest recipients of the Lifetime Achievement award whose previous winners include Elton John, the Beatles and Queen.\nThe Spice Girls are the best-selling British act of the 1990s, having comfortably outsold all of their peers including Oasis and the Prodigy. They are the best-selling girl group of all time. They have sold 100 million records worldwide, achieving certified sales of 13 million albums in Europe, 14 million records in the US and 2.4 million in Canada. The group achieved the highest-charting debut for a UK group on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number five with \"Say You'll Be There\". They are also the first British band since the Rolling Stones in 1975 to have two top-ten albums in the US \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart at the same time (\"Spice\" and \"Spiceworld\"). In addition to this, the Spice Girls also achieved the highest-ever annual earnings by an all-female group with an income of \u00a329.6 million (approximately US$49 million) in 1998. In 1999, they ranked sixth in \"Forbes\"' inaugural Celebrity 100 Power Ranking, which made them the highest-ranking musicians.\nThey produced a total of nine number one singles in the UK\u2014tied with ABBA behind Take That (eleven), the Shadows (twelve), Madonna (thirteen), Westlife (fourteen), Cliff Richard (fourteen), the Beatles (seventeen) and Elvis Presley (twenty-one). The group had three consecutive Christmas number-one singles in the UK (\"2 Become 1\", 1996; \"Too Much\", 1997; \"Goodbye\", 1998); they only share this record with the Beatles and LadBaby. Their first single, \"Wannabe\", is the most successful song released by an all-female group. Debuting on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart at number eleven, it is also the highest-ever-charting debut by a British band in the US, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and the joint highest entry for a debut act, tying with Alanis Morissette.\n\"Spice\" is the 18th-best-selling album of all time in the UK with over 3 million copies sold, and topped the charts for 15 non-consecutive weeks, the most by a female group in the UK. It is also the best-selling album of all time by a girl group, with sales of over 23 million copies worldwide. \"Spiceworld\" shipped 7 million copies in just two weeks, including 1.4 million in Britain alone\u2014the largest-ever shipment of an album over 14 days. They are also the first act (and so far only female act) to have their first six singles (\"Wannabe\", \"Say You'll Be There\", \"2 Become 1\", \"Mama\"/\"Who Do You Think You Are\", \"Spice Up Your Life\" and \"Too Much\") make number one on the UK charts. Their run was broken by \"Stop\", which peaked at number two in March 1998.\nThe Spice Girls have the highest-grossing concert tours by an all-female group across two decades (2000\u20132020), grossing nearly $150 million in ticket sales across 58 shows. They are also the most-merchandised group in music history. Their Spice Girls dolls are the best-selling celebrity dolls of all time with sales of over 11 million; the dolls were the second-best-selling toy, behind the \"Teletubbies\", of 1998 in the US according to the trade publication \"Playthings\". Their film, \"Spice World\", broke the record for the highest-ever weekend debut on Super Bowl weekend (25 January 1998) in the US, with box office sales of $10,527,222. \"Spice World\" topped the UK video charts on its first week of release, selling over 55,000 copies on its first day in stores and 270,000 copies in the first week.\nIn popular culture.\nIn February 1997, the \"Sugar Lumps\", a satirical version of the Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu and Jennifer Saunders, filmed a video for British charity Comic Relief. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls who really want to become pop stars like the Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-syncing the song \"Who Do You Think You Are\". The Sugar Lumps later joined the Spice Girls during their live performance of the song on Comic Relief's telethon \"Red Nose Day\" event in March 1997. In January 1998, a fight between animated versions of the Spice Girls and pop band Hanson was the headlining matchup in MTV's claymation parody \"Celebrity Deathmatch Deathbowl '98\" special that aired during the Super Bowl XXXII halftime. The episode became the highest-rated special in the network's history and MTV turned the concept into a full-fledged television series soon after.\nIn March 2013, the \"Glee\" characters Brittany (Heather Morris), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), Marley (Melissa Benoist), Kitty (Becca Tobin) and Unique (Alex Newell) dressed up as the Spice Girls and performed the song \"Wannabe\" on the 17th episode of the fourth season of the show. In April 2016, the Italian variety show \"Laura &amp; Paola\" on Rai 1 featured the hosts, Grammy Award-winning singer Laura Pausini and actress Paola Cortellesi, and their guests, Francesca Michielin, Margherita Buy and Claudia Gerini, dressed up as the Spice Girls to perform a medley of Spice Girls songs as part of a 20th-anniversary tribute to the band. In December 2016, the episode \"Who Needs Josh When You Have a Girl Group?\" of the musical comedy drama series \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" featured cast members Rachel Bloom, Gabrielle Ruiz and Vella Lovell performing an original song titled \"Friendtopia\", a parody of the Spice Girls' songs and \"girl power\" philosophy. In 2022, Derry Girls Featured an episode which featured the main protagonists Erin, Orla, Michelle, Clare and James performing \"Who do you think you are\". Rapper Amin\u00e9's 2017 single \"Spice Girl\" is a reference to the group, and the song's music video includes an appearance by Brown. Other songs that reference the Spice Girls include \"Grigio Girls\" by Lady Gaga, \"My Name Is\" by Eminem, \"Polka Power!\" (a reference to \"Girl Power\") by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, \"Playinwitme\" by Kyle and Kehlani, \"Kinky\" by Kesha, and \"Spicy\" by Diplo, Herve Pagez and Charli XCX.\nIn the late 1990s, Spice Girls parodies appeared in various American sketch comedy shows including \"Saturday Night Live\" (SNL), \"Mad TV\" and \"All That\". A January 1998 episode of SNL featured cast members, including guest host Sarah Michelle Gellar, impersonating the Spice Girls for two \"An Important Message About ...\" sketches. In September 1998, the show once again featured cast members, including guest host Cameron Diaz, impersonating the Spice Girls for a sketch titled \"A Message from the Spice Girls\". Nickelodeon's \"All That\" had recurring sketches with the fictional boy band \"The Spice Boys\", featuring cast members Nick Cannon as \"Sweaty Spice\", Kenan Thompson as \"Spice Cube\", Danny Tamberelli as \"Hairy Spice\", Josh Server as \"Mumbly Spice\", and a skeleton prop as \"Dead Spice\".\nParodies of the Spice Girls have also appeared in major advertising campaigns. In 1997, Jack in the Box, an American fast-food chain restaurant, sought to capitalise on \"Spice mania\" in America by launching a national television campaign using a fictional girl group called the Spicy Crispy Chicks (a take off of the Spice Girls) to promote the new Spicy Crispy Sandwich. The Spicy Crispy Chicks concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the 'Meaty Cheesy Boys'. At the 1998 Association of Independent Commercial Producers (AICP) Show, one of the Spicy Crispy Chicks commercials won the top award for humour. In 2001, prints adverts featuring a parody of the Spice Girls, along with other British music icons consisting of the Beatles, Elton John, Freddie Mercury and the Rolling Stones, were used in the Eurostar national advertising campaign in France. The campaign won the award for Best Outdoor Campaign at the French advertising CDA awards. In September 2016, an Apple Music advert premiered during the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards that featured comedian James Corden dressed up as various music icons including all five of the Spice Girls.\nOther notable groups of people have been labelled as some variation of a play-on-words on the Spice Girls' name as an allusion to the band. In 1997, the term \"Spice Boys\" emerged in the British media as a term coined to characterise the \"pop star\" antics and lifestyles off the pitch of a group of Liverpool F.C. footballers that includes Jamie Redknapp, David James, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Jason McAteer. The label has stuck with these footballers ever since, with John Scales, one of the so-called Spice Boys, admitting in 2015 that, \"We're the Spice Boys and it's something we have to accept because it will never change.\" In the Philippines, the \"Spice Boys\" tag was given to a group of young Congressmen of the House of Representatives who initiated the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada in 2001. The Australian/British string quartet Bond were dubbed by the international press as the \"Spice Girls of classical music\" during their launch in 2000 due to their \"sexy\" image and classical crossover music that incorporated elements of pop and dance music. A spokeswoman for the quartet said in response to the comparisons, \"In fact, they are much better looking than the Spice Girls. But we don't welcome comparisons. The Bond girls are proper musicians; they have paid their dues.\" The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) doubles team of Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova, two-time Grand Slam and two-time WTA Finals Doubles champions, dubbed themselves the \"Spice Girls of tennis\" in 1999. Hingis and Kournikova, along with fellow WTA players Venus and Serena Williams, were also labelled the \"Spice Girls of tennis\", then later the \"Spite Girls\", by the media in the late 1990s due to their youthfulness, popularity and brashness.\nGrant Morrison's limited series \"The Multiversity\" (2014\u20132015) had a team of five women called Lady Blackhawks, inspired by Spice Girls' names and hair they were named Killah (Scary), Monkey (Sporty), Red (Ginger), Princess (Posh) and Pixie (Baby).\nWax sculptures of the Spice Girls are currently on display at the famed Madame Tussaud's New York wax museum. The sculptures of the Spice Girls (sans Halliwell) were first unveiled in December 1999, making them the first pop band to be modelled as a group since the Beatles in 1964 at the time. A sculpture of Halliwell was later made in 2002, and was eventually displayed with the other Spice Girls' sculptures after Halliwell reunited with the band in 2007. Since 2008, , a travelling exhibition of around 5,000 Spice Girls memorabilia and merchandise, has been shown in museums across the UK. The Spice Girls Exhibition, a collection of over 1,000 Spice Girls items owned by Alan Smith-Allison, was held at the Trakasol Cultural Centre in Limassol Marina, Cyprus in the summer of 2016. Wannabe 1996\u20132016: A Spice Girls Art Exhibition, an exhibition of Spice Girls-inspired art, was held at The Ballery in Berlin in 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the group's debut single, \"Wannabe\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sometimes called statistical physics or statistical thermodynamics, its applications include many problems in a wide variety of fields such as biology, neuroscience, computer science, information theory and sociology. Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.\nStatistical mechanics arose out of the development of classical thermodynamics, a field for which it was successful in explaining macroscopic physical properties\u2014such as temperature, pressure, and heat capacity\u2014in terms of microscopic parameters that fluctuate about average values and are characterized by probability distributions.\nWhile classical thermodynamics is primarily concerned with thermodynamic equilibrium, statistical mechanics has been applied in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to the issues of microscopically modeling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions and flows of particles and heat. The fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem is the basic knowledge obtained from applying non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to study the simplest non-equilibrium situation of a steady state current flow in a system of many particles.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLudwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on his work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics.\nDavid L. Goodstein, States of Matter\nIn 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published \"Hydrodynamica\" which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.\nThe founding of the field of statistical mechanics is generally credited to three physicists:\nIn 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by Rudolf Clausius, the Scottish physicist Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range. This was the first-ever statistical law in physics. Maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium. Five years later, in 1864, Boltzmann, a young student in Vienna, came across Maxwell's paper and spent much of his life developing the subject further.\nStatistical mechanics was initiated in the 1870s with the work of Boltzmann, much of which was collectively published in his 1896 \"Lectures on Gas Theory\". Boltzmann's original papers on the statistical interpretation of thermodynamics, the \"H\"-theorem, transport theory, thermal equilibrium, the equation of state of gases, and similar subjects, occupy about 2,000 pages in the proceedings of the Vienna Academy and other societies. Boltzmann introduced the concept of an equilibrium statistical ensemble and also investigated for the first time non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, with his \"H\"-theorem.\nThe term \"statistical mechanics\" was coined by the American mathematical physicist Gibbs in 1884. According to Gibbs, the term \"statistical\", in the context of mechanics, i.e. statistical mechanics, was first used by Maxwell in 1871:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"In dealing with masses of matter, while we do not perceive the individual molecules, we are compelled to adopt what I have described as the statistical method of calculation, and to abandon the strict dynamical method, in which we follow every motion by the calculus.\"\u2014\u200a\n\"Probabilistic mechanics\" might today seem a more appropriate term, but \"statistical mechanics\" is firmly entrenched. Shortly before his death, Gibbs published in 1902 \"Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics\", a book which formalized statistical mechanics as a fully general approach to address all mechanical systems\u2014macroscopic or microscopic, gaseous or non-gaseous. Gibbs' methods were initially derived in the framework classical mechanics, however they were of such generality that they were found to adapt easily to the later quantum mechanics, and still form the foundation of statistical mechanics to this day.\nPrinciples: mechanics and ensembles.\nIn physics, two types of mechanics are usually examined: classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. For both types of mechanics, the standard mathematical approach is to consider two concepts:\nUsing these two concepts, the state at any other time, past or future, can in principle be calculated.\nThere is however a disconnect between these laws and everyday life experiences, as we do not find it necessary (nor even theoretically possible) to know exactly at a microscopic level the simultaneous positions and velocities of each molecule while carrying out processes at the human scale (for example, when performing a chemical reaction). Statistical mechanics fills this disconnection between the laws of mechanics and the practical experience of incomplete knowledge, by adding some uncertainty about which state the system is in.\nWhereas ordinary mechanics only considers the behaviour of a single state, statistical mechanics introduces the statistical ensemble, which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The statistical ensemble is a probability distribution over all possible states of the system. In classical statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a single phase point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a phase space with canonical coordinate axes. In quantum statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states and can be compactly summarized as a density matrix.\nAs is usual for probabilities, the ensemble can be interpreted in different ways:\nThese two meanings are equivalent for many purposes, and will be used interchangeably in this article.\nHowever the probability is interpreted, each state in the ensemble evolves over time according to the equation of motion. Thus, the ensemble itself (the probability distribution over states) also evolves, as the virtual systems in the ensemble continually leave one state and enter another. The ensemble evolution is given by the Liouville equation (classical mechanics) or the von Neumann equation (quantum mechanics). These equations are simply derived by the application of the mechanical equation of motion separately to each virtual system contained in the ensemble, with the probability of the virtual system being conserved over time as it evolves from state to state.\nOne special class of ensemble is those ensembles that do not evolve over time. These ensembles are known as \"equilibrium ensembles\" and their condition is known as \"statistical equilibrium\". Statistical equilibrium occurs if, for each state in the ensemble, the ensemble also contains all of its future and past states with probabilities equal to the probability of being in that state. (By contrast, \"mechanical equilibrium\" is a state with a balance of forces that has ceased to evolve.) The study of equilibrium ensembles of isolated systems is the focus of statistical thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics addresses the more general case of ensembles that change over time, and/or ensembles of non-isolated systems.\nStatistical thermodynamics.\nThe primary goal of statistical thermodynamics (also known as equilibrium statistical mechanics) is to derive the classical thermodynamics of materials in terms of the properties of their constituent particles and the interactions between them. In other words, statistical thermodynamics provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in thermodynamic equilibrium, and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material.\nWhereas statistical mechanics proper involves dynamics, here the attention is focused on \"statistical equilibrium\" (steady state). Statistical equilibrium does not mean that the particles have stopped moving (mechanical equilibrium), rather, only that the ensemble is not evolving.\nFundamental postulate.\nA sufficient (but not necessary) condition for statistical equilibrium with an isolated system is that the probability distribution is a function only of conserved properties (total energy, total particle numbers, etc.).\nThere are many different equilibrium ensembles that can be considered, and only some of them correspond to thermodynamics. Additional postulates are necessary to motivate why the ensemble for a given system should have one form or another.\nA common approach found in many textbooks is to take the \"equal a priori probability postulate\". This postulate states that\n \"For an isolated system with an exactly known energy and exactly known composition, the system can be found with \"equal probability\" in any microstate consistent with that knowledge.\"\nThe equal a priori probability postulate therefore provides a motivation for the microcanonical ensemble described below. There are various arguments in favour of the equal a priori probability postulate:\nOther fundamental postulates for statistical mechanics have also been proposed. For example, recent studies show that the theory of statistical mechanics can be built without the equal a priori probability postulate. One such formalism is based on the fundamental thermodynamic relation together with the following set of postulates:\nwhere the third postulate can be replaced by the following:\nThree thermodynamic ensembles.\nThere are three equilibrium ensembles with a simple form that can be defined for any isolated system bounded inside a finite volume. These are the most often discussed ensembles in statistical thermodynamics. In the macroscopic limit (defined below) they all correspond to classical thermodynamics.\n describes a system with a precisely given energy and fixed composition (precise number of particles). The microcanonical ensemble contains with equal probability each possible state that is consistent with that energy and composition.\n describes a system of fixed composition that is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath of a precise temperature. The canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy but identical composition; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy.\n describes a system with non-fixed composition (uncertain particle numbers) that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a thermodynamic reservoir. The reservoir has a precise temperature, and precise chemical potentials for various types of particle. The grand canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy and varying numbers of particles; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy and total particle numbers.\nFor systems containing many particles (the thermodynamic limit), all three of the ensembles listed above tend to give identical behaviour. It is then simply a matter of mathematical convenience which ensemble is used. The Gibbs theorem about equivalence of ensembles was developed into the theory of concentration of measure phenomenon, which has applications in many areas of science, from functional analysis to methods of artificial intelligence and big data technology.\nImportant cases where the thermodynamic ensembles \"do not\" give identical results include:\nIn these cases the correct thermodynamic ensemble must be chosen as there are observable differences between these ensembles not just in the size of fluctuations, but also in average quantities such as the distribution of particles. The correct ensemble is that which corresponds to the way the system has been prepared and characterized\u2014in other words, the ensemble that reflects the knowledge about that system.\nCalculation methods.\nOnce the characteristic state function for an ensemble has been calculated for a given system, that system is 'solved' (macroscopic observables can be extracted from the characteristic state function). Calculating the characteristic state function of a thermodynamic ensemble is not necessarily a simple task, however, since it involves considering every possible state of the system. While some hypothetical systems have been exactly solved, the most general (and realistic) case is too complex for an exact solution. Various approaches exist to approximate the true ensemble and allow calculation of average quantities.\nExact.\nThere are some cases which allow exact solutions.\nMonte Carlo.\nAlthough some problems in statistical physics can be solved analytically using approximations and expansions, most current research utilizes the large processing power of modern computers to simulate or approximate solutions. A common approach to statistical problems is to use a Monte Carlo simulation to yield insight into the properties of a complex system. Monte Carlo methods are important in computational physics, physical chemistry, and related fields, and have diverse applications including medical physics, where they are used to model radiation transport for radiation dosimetry calculations.\nThe Monte Carlo method examines just a few of the possible states of the system, with the states chosen randomly (with a fair weight). As long as these states form a representative sample of the whole set of states of the system, the approximate characteristic function is obtained. As more and more random samples are included, the errors are reduced to an arbitrarily low level.\nNon-equilibrium statistical mechanics.\nMany physical phenomena involve quasi-thermodynamic processes out of equilibrium, for example:\nAll of these processes occur over time with characteristic rates. These rates are important in engineering. The field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is concerned with understanding these non-equilibrium processes at the microscopic level. (Statistical thermodynamics can only be used to calculate the final result, after the external imbalances have been removed and the ensemble has settled back down to equilibrium.)\nIn principle, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics could be mathematically exact: ensembles for an isolated system evolve over time according to deterministic equations such as Liouville's equation or its quantum equivalent, the von Neumann equation. These equations are the result of applying the mechanical equations of motion independently to each state in the ensemble. These ensemble evolution equations inherit much of the complexity of the underlying mechanical motion, and so exact solutions are very difficult to obtain. Moreover, the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and do not destroy information (the ensemble's Gibbs entropy is preserved). In order to make headway in modelling irreversible processes, it is necessary to consider additional factors besides probability and reversible mechanics.\nNon-equilibrium mechanics is therefore an active area of theoretical research as the range of validity of these additional assumptions continues to be explored. A few approaches are described in the following subsections.\nStochastic methods.\nOne approach to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate stochastic (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys information contained in the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes, a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the randomness is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as chaotic or pseudorandom influences on the variables of interest. By replacing these correlations with randomness proper, the calculations can be made much easier.\nNear-equilibrium methods.\nAnother important class of non-equilibrium statistical mechanical models deals with systems that are only very slightly perturbed from equilibrium. With very small perturbations, the response can be analysed in linear response theory. A remarkable result, as formalized by the fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem, is that the response of a system when near equilibrium is precisely related to the fluctuations that occur when the system is in total equilibrium. Essentially, a system that is slightly away from equilibrium\u2014whether put there by external forces or by fluctuations\u2014relaxes towards equilibrium in the same way, since the system cannot tell the difference or \"know\" how it came to be away from equilibrium.\nThis provides an indirect avenue for obtaining numbers such as ohmic conductivity and thermal conductivity by extracting results from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Since equilibrium statistical mechanics is mathematically well defined and (in some cases) more amenable for calculations, the fluctuation\u2013dissipation connection can be a convenient shortcut for calculations in near-equilibrium statistical mechanics.\nA few of the theoretical tools used to make this connection include:\nHybrid methods.\nAn advanced approach uses a combination of stochastic methods and linear response theory. As an example, one approach to compute quantum coherence effects (weak localization, conductance fluctuations) in the conductance of an electronic system is the use of the Green\u2013Kubo relations, with the inclusion of stochastic dephasing by interactions between various electrons by use of the Keldysh method.\nApplications.\nThe ensemble formalism can be used to analyze general mechanical systems with uncertainty in knowledge about the state of a system. Ensembles are also used in:\nStatistical physics explains and quantitatively describes superconductivity, superfluidity, turbulence, collective phenomena in solids and plasma, and the structural features of liquid. It underlies the modern astrophysics and virial theorem. In solid state physics, statistical physics aids the study of liquid crystals, phase transitions, and critical phenomena. Many experimental studies of matter are entirely based on the statistical description of a system. These include the scattering of cold neutrons, X-ray, visible light, and more. Statistical physics also plays a role in materials science, nuclear physics, astrophysics, chemistry, biology and medicine (e.g. study of the spread of infectious diseases).\nAnalytical and computational techniques derived from statistical physics of disordered systems, can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks. Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.\nQuantum statistical mechanics.\nQuantum statistical mechanics is statistical mechanics applied to quantum mechanical systems. In quantum mechanics, a statistical ensemble (probability distribution over possible quantum states) is described by a density operator \"S\", which is a non-negative, self-adjoint, trace-class operator of trace 1 on the Hilbert space \"H\" describing the quantum system. This can be shown under various mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics. One such formalism is provided by quantum logic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Two solstices occur annually, around 20\u201322 June and 20\u201322 December. In many countries, the seasons of the year are defined by reference to the solstices and the equinoxes.\nThe term \"solstice\" can also be used in a broader sense, as the day when this occurs. For locations not too close to the equator or the poles, the dates with the longest and shortest periods of daylight are the summer and winter solstices, respectively. Terms with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context are \"June solstice\" and \"December solstice\", referring to the months in which they take place every year.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"solstice\" is derived from the Latin ('sun') and ('to stand still'), because at the solstices, the Sun's declination appears to \"stand still\"; that is, the seasonal movement of the Sun's daily path (as seen from Earth) reaches a northern or southern limit before reversing direction.\n\"Solstice\" first entered into English in the Middle English period. An older term in English is its calque \"sunstead\" (), which became rare after the 17th century. \"Sunstead\" is cognate with other terms with the same meaning in other Germanic language such as and . A similar English calque of the Latin term is \"sunstay\" which was first used in the 16th century and is now also rare.\nDefinitions and frames of reference.\nFor an observer at the North Pole, the Sun reaches the highest position in the sky once a year in June. The day this occurs is called the June solstice day. Similarly, for an observer on the South Pole, the Sun reaches the highest position on the December solstice day. When it is the summer solstice at one Pole, it is the winter solstice on the other. The Sun's westerly motion never ceases as Earth is continually in rotation. However, at the moment of solstice the Sun's motion in declination (i.e. vertically) appears to stop for an instant, and then reverse. In that sense, solstice means \"sun-standing\".\nThis modern scientific word descends from a Latin scientific word in use in the late Roman Republic of the 1st century BC: \"solstitium\". Pliny uses it a number of times in his \"Natural History\" with a similar meaning that it has today. It contains two Latin-language morphemes, \"sol\", \"sun\", and \"-stitium\", \"stoppage\". The Romans used \"standing\" to refer to a component of the relative velocity of the Sun as it is observed in the sky. Relative velocity is the motion of an object from the point of view of an observer in a frame of reference. From a fixed position on the ground, the Sun appears to orbit around Earth.\nTo an observer in an inertial frame of reference, planet Earth is seen to rotate about an axis and orbit around the Sun in an elliptical path with the Sun at one focus. Earth's axis is tilted with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit and this axis maintains a position that changes little with respect to the background of stars. An observer on Earth therefore sees a solar path that is the result of both rotation and revolution.\nThe component of the Sun's motion seen by an earthbound observer caused by the revolution of the tilted axis\u2014which, keeping the same angle in space, is oriented toward or away from the Sun\u2014is an observed daily increment (and lateral offset) of the elevation of the Sun at noon for approximately six months and observed daily decrement for the remaining six months. At maximum or minimum elevation, the relative yearly motion of the Sun perpendicular to the horizon stops and reverses direction.\nOutside of the tropics, the maximum elevation occurs at the summer solstice and the minimum at the winter solstice. The path of the Sun, or ecliptic, sweeps north and south between the northern and southern hemispheres. The lengths of time when the sun is up are longer around the summer solstice and shorter around the winter solstice, except near the equator. When the Sun's path crosses the equator, the length of the nights at latitudes +L\u00b0 and \u2212L\u00b0 are of equal length. This is known as an equinox. There are two solstices and two equinoxes in a tropical year.\nBecause of the variation in the rate at which the sun's right ascension changes, the days of longest and shortest daylight do not coincide with the solstices for locations very close to the equator. At the equator, the longest day is around 23 December and the shortest around 16 September (see graph). Inside the Arctic or Antarctic Circles the sun is up all the time for days or even months.\nRelationship to seasons.\nThe seasons occur because the Earth's axis of rotation is not perpendicular to its orbital plane (the plane of the ecliptic) but currently makes an angle of about 23.44\u00b0 (called the obliquity of the ecliptic), and because the axis keeps its orientation with respect to an inertial frame of reference. As a consequence, for half the year the Northern Hemisphere is inclined toward the Sun while for the other half year the Southern Hemisphere has this distinction. The two moments when the inclination of Earth's rotational axis has maximum effect are the solstices.\nAt the June solstice the subsolar point is further north than any other time: at latitude 23.44\u00b0 north, known as the Tropic of Cancer. Similarly at the December solstice the subsolar point is further south than any other time: at latitude 23.44\u00b0 south, known as the Tropic of Capricorn. The subsolar point will cross every latitude between these two extremes exactly twice per year.\nAlso during the June solstice, places on the Arctic Circle (latitude 66.56\u00b0 north) will see the Sun just on the horizon during midnight, and all places north of it will see the Sun above horizon for 24 hours. That is the midnight sun or midsummer-night sun or polar day. On the other hand, places on the Antarctic Circle (latitude 66.56\u00b0 south) will see the Sun just on the horizon during midday, and all places south of it will not see the Sun above horizon at any time of the day. That is the polar night. During the December Solstice, the effects on both hemispheres are just the opposite. This sees polar sea ice re-grow annually due to lack of sunlight on the air above and surrounding sea. The warmest and coldest periods of the year in temperate regions are offset by about one month from the solstices, delayed by the earth's thermal inertia.\nCultural aspects.\nAncient Greek names and concepts.\nThe concept of the solstices was embedded in ancient Greek celestial navigation. As soon as they discovered that the Earth was spherical they devised the concept of the celestial sphere, an imaginary spherical surface rotating with the heavenly bodies (\"ouranioi\") fixed in it (the modern one does not rotate, but the stars in it do). As long as no assumptions are made concerning the distances of those bodies from Earth or from each other, the sphere can be accepted as real and is in fact still in use. The Ancient Greeks use the term\" \"\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\" (heliost\u0101sio)\", meaning \"stand of the Sun\".\nThe stars move across the inner surface of the celestial sphere along the circumferences of circles in parallel planes perpendicular to the Earth's axis extended indefinitely into the heavens and intersecting the celestial sphere in a celestial pole. The Sun and the planets do not move in these parallel paths but along another circle, the ecliptic, whose plane is at an angle, the obliquity of the ecliptic, to the axis, bringing the Sun and planets across the paths of and in among the stars.*\nCleomedes states:\nThe band of the Zodiac (\"z\u014ddiakos kuklos\", \"zodiacal circle\") is at an oblique angle (\"loksos\") because it is positioned between the tropical circles and equinoctial circle touching each of the tropical circles at one point ... This Zodiac has a determinable width (set at 8\u00b0 today) ... that is why it is described by three circles: the central one is called \"heliacal\" (\"h\u0113liakos\", \"of the sun\").\nThe term heliacal circle is used for the ecliptic, which is in the center of the zodiacal circle, conceived as a band including the noted constellations named on mythical themes. Other authors use Zodiac to mean ecliptic, which first appears in a gloss of unknown author in a passage of Cleomedes where he is explaining that the Moon is in the zodiacal circle as well and periodically crosses the path of the Sun. As some of these crossings represent eclipses of the Moon, the path of the Sun is given a synonym, the \"ekleiptikos (kuklos)\" from \"ekleipsis\", \"eclipse\".\nEnglish names.\nThe two solstices can be distinguished by different pairs of names, depending on which feature one wants to stress.\nSolstice terms in East Asia.\nThe traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 solar terms (\u7bc0\u6c23). Xi\u00e0zh\u00ec or Geshi (Chinese and Japanese: \u590f\u81f3lit. summer's extreme) is the 10th solar term, and marks the summer solstice. It begins when the Sun reaches the celestial longitude of 90\u00b0 (around 21 June) and ends when the Sun reaches the longitude of 105\u00b0 (around 7 July). Xi\u00e0zh\u00ec more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 90\u00b0.\nD\u014dngzh\u00ec or T\u014dji (Chinese and Japanese: \u51ac\u81f3lit. winter's extreme) is the 22nd solar term, and marks the winter solstice. It begins when the Sun reaches the celestial longitude of 270\u00b0 (around 23 December) and ends when the Sun reaches the longitude of 285\u00b0 (around 5 January). D\u014dngzh\u00ec more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 270\u00b0.\nThe solstices (as well as the equinoxes) mark the middle of the seasons in East Asian calendars. Here, the Chinese character \u81f3 means \"extreme\", so the terms for the solstices directly signify the summits of summer and winter.\nSolstice celebrations.\nThe term \"solstice\" can also be used in a wider sense, as the date (day) that such a passage happens. The solstices, together with the equinoxes, are connected with the seasons. In some languages they are considered to start or separate the seasons; in others they are considered to be centre points (in England, in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, the period around the northern solstice is known as midsummer). Midsummer's Day, defined as St. Johns Day by the Christian Church, is 24 June, about three days after the solstice itself). Similarly 25 December is the start of the Christmas celebration, and is the day the Sun begins to return to the Northern Hemisphere. The traditional British and Irish main rent and meeting days of the year, \"the usual quarter days,\" were often those of the solstices and equinoxes.\nMany cultures celebrate various combinations of the winter and summer solstices, the equinoxes, and the midpoints between them, leading to various holidays arising around these events. During the southern or winter solstice, Christmas is the most widespread contemporary holiday, while Yalda, Saturnalia, Karachun, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and Yule are also celebrated around this time. In East Asian cultures, the Dongzhi Festival is celebrated on the winter solstice. For the northern or summer solstice, Christian cultures celebrate the feast of St. John from June 23 to 24 (see St. John's Eve, Ivan Kupala Day), while Modern Pagans observe Midsummer, known as Litha among Wiccans. For the vernal (spring) equinox, several springtime festivals are celebrated, such as the Persian Nowruz, the observance in Judaism of Passover, the rites of Easter in most Christian churches, as well as the Wiccan Ostara. The autumnal equinox is associated with the Jewish holiday of Sukkot and the Wiccan Mabon. \nIn the southern tip of South America, the Mapuche people celebrate We Tripantu (the New Year) a few days after the northern solstice, on 24 June. Further north, the Atacama people formerly celebrated this date with a noise festival, to call the Sun back. Further east, the Aymara people celebrate their New Year on 21 June. A celebration occurs at sunrise, when the sun shines directly through the Gate of the Sun in Tiwanaku. Other Aymara New Year feasts occur throughout Bolivia, including at the site of El Fuerte de Samaipata.\nIn the Hindu calendar, two sidereal solstices are named Makara Sankranti which marks the start of Uttarayana and Karka Sankranti which marks the start of Dakshinayana. The former occurs around 14 January each year, while the latter occurs around 14 July each year. These mark the movement of the Sun along a sidereally fixed zodiac (precession is ignored) into Makara, the zodiacal sign which corresponds with Capricorn, and into Karka, the zodiacal sign which corresponds with Cancer, respectively.\nThe Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station celebrates every year on 21 June a midwinter party, to celebrate that the Sun is at its lowest point and coming back.\nThe Fremont Solstice Parade takes place every summer solstice in Fremont, Seattle, Washington in the United States.\nThe reconstructed Cahokia Woodhenge, a large timber circle located at the Mississippian culture Cahokia archaeological site near Collinsville, Illinois, is the site of annual equinox and solstice sunrise observances. Out of respect for Native American beliefs these events do not feature ceremonies or rituals of any kind.\nSolstice determination.\nUnlike the equinox, the solstice time is not easy to determine. The changes in solar declination become smaller as the Sun gets closer to its maximum/minimum declination. The days before and after the solstice, the declination speed is less than 30 arcseconds per day which is less than &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204460 of the angular size of the Sun, or the equivalent to just 2 seconds of right ascension.\nThis difference is hardly detectable with indirect viewing based devices like sextant equipped with a vernier, and impossible with more traditional tools like a gnomon or an astrolabe. It is also hard to detect the changes in sunrise/sunset azimuth due to the atmospheric refraction changes. Those accuracy issues render it impossible to determine the solstice day based on observations made within the 3 (or even 5) days surrounding the solstice without the use of more complex tools.\nAccounts do not survive but Greek astronomers must have used an approximation method based on interpolation, which is still used by some amateurs. This method consists of recording the declination angle at noon during some days before and after the solstice, trying to find two separate days with the same declination. When those two days are found, the halfway time between both noons is estimated solstice time. An interval of 45 days has been postulated as the best one to achieve up to a quarter-day precision, in the solstice determination.\nIn 2012, the journal DIO http:// that accuracy of one or two hours with balanced errors can be attained by observing the Sun's equal altitudes about S = twenty degrees (or d = about 20 days) before and after the summer solstice because the average of the two times will be early by q arc minutes where q is (\u03c0e cosA)/3 times the square of S in degrees (e = earth orbit eccentricity, A = earth's perihelion or Sun's apogee), and the noise in the result will be about 41 hours divided by d if the eye's sharpness is taken as one arc minute.\nAstronomical almanacs define the solstices as the moments when the Sun passes through the solstitial colure, i.e. the times when the apparent geocentric celestial longitude of the Sun is equal to 90\u00b0 (June solstice) or 270\u00b0 (December solstice). The dates of the solstice varies each year and may occur a day earlier or later depending on the time zone. Because the earth's orbit takes slightly longer than a calendar year of 365 days, the solstices occur slightly later each calendar year, until a leap day re-aligns the calendar with the orbit. Thus the solstices always occur between June 20 and 22 and between December 20 and 23 in a four-year-long cycle with the 21st and 22nd being the most common dates, as can be seen in the schedule at the start of the article.\nIn the constellations.\nUsing the current official IAU constellation boundaries\u2014and taking into account the variable precession speed and the rotation of the ecliptic\u2014the solstices shift through the constellations as follows (expressed in astronomical year numbering in which the year 0 = 1 BC, \u22121 = 2 BC, etc.):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 as part of the Soviet space program. It sent a radio signal back to Earth for three weeks before its three silver-zinc batteries became depleted. Aerodynamic drag caused it to fall back into the atmosphere on January 4, 1958.\nIt was a polished metal sphere in diameter with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable by amateur radio operators, and the 65\u00b0 orbital inclination made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth.\nThe satellite's success was unanticipated by the United States. This precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race. The launch was the beginning of a new era of political, military, technological, and scientific developments. The word \"sputnik\" is Russian for \"satellite\" when interpreted in an astronomical context; its other meanings are \"spouse\" or \"travelling companion\".\nTracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at a peak speed of about , taking 96.20 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002\u00a0MHz, which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world. The signals continued for 22 days until the transmitter batteries depleted on 26 October 1957. On 4 January 1958, after three months in orbit, Sputnik 1 burned up while reentering Earth's atmosphere, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth, and travelling a distance of approximately .\nEtymology.\n, romanized as (), means 'Satellite-One'. The Russian word for satellite, , was coined in the 18th century by combining the prefix ('fellow') and ('traveler'), thereby meaning 'fellow-traveler', a meaning corresponding to the Latin root ('guard, attendant or companion'), which is the origin of English \"satellite\". (In the West, dating from the 1930s, the term fellow traveler was already used as a pejorative to describe people who were philosophically sympathetic to communism.)\nIn English, 'Sputnik' is widely recognized as a proper name; however, this is not the case in Russian. In the Russian language, \"sputnik\" is the general term for the artificial satellites of any country and the natural satellites of any planet. The incorrect attribution of 'Sputnik' as a proper name can be traced back to an article released by \"The New York Times\" on 6 October 1957, titled \"Soviet 'Sputnik' Means A Traveler's Traveler\". In the referenced article, the term 'Sputnik' was portrayed as bearing a poetic connotation arising from its linguistic origins. This connotation incorrectly indicated that it was bestowed with the specific proper name 'Fellow-Traveler-One', rather than being designated by the general term 'Satellite-One'. In Russian-language references, Sputnik 1 is recognised by the technical name of 'Satellite-One'.\nBefore the launch.\nSatellite construction project.\nOn 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to the Minister of the Defense Industry, Dimitri Ustinov. Korolev forwarded a report by Mikhail Tikhonravov, with an overview of similar projects abroad. Tikhonravov had emphasised that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.\nOn 29 July 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced through his press secretary that, during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), the United States would launch an artificial satellite. Four days later, Leonid Sedov, a leading Soviet physicist, announced that they too would launch an artificial satellite. On 8 August, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite. On 30 August, Vasily Ryabikov\u2014the head of the State Commission on the R-7 rocket test launches\u2014held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.\nOn 30 January 1956, the Council of Ministers approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named \"Object D\", was planned to be completed in 1957\u201358; it would have a mass of and would carry of scientific instruments. The first test launch of \"Object D\" was scheduled for 1957. Work on the satellite was to be divided among institutions as follows:\nPreliminary design work was completed in July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its ion composition, the solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites; a system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.\nBy the end of 1956, it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low specific impulse produced by the completed R-7 engines (304\u00a0seconds instead of the planned 309 to 310\u00a0seconds). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958. Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.\nFearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in April\u2013May 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light (), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated 'Object PS', PS meaning \"\"prosteishiy sputnik\",\" or \"elementary satellite\". This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations. The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71), was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.\nLaunch vehicle preparation and launch site selection.\nThe R-7 rocket was initially designed as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954. The rocket was the most powerful in the world; it was designed with excess thrust since they were unsure how heavy the hydrogen bomb payload would be. The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO, the Russian abbreviation for \"Chief Directorate of the Rocket Forces\") designation 8K71. At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104, and Type A.\nSeveral modifications were made to the R-7 rocket to adapt it to 'Object D', including upgrades to the main engines, the removal of a radio package on the booster, and a new payload fairing that made the booster almost four metres (14 feet) shorter than its ICBM version. Object D would later be launched as Sputnik 3 after the much lighter 'Object PS' (Sputnik 1) was launched first. The trajectory of the launch vehicle and the satellite were initially calculated using arithmometers and six-digit trigonometric tables. More complex calculations were carried out on a newly-installed computer at the Academy of Sciences.\nA special reconnaissance commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket proving ground, the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as \"NIIP-5\", or \"GIK-5\" in the post-Soviet time. The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958. Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units.\nThe first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until 98 seconds after launch when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed downrange. Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10\u201311 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch. The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July. An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about from the pad.\nThe launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 Moscow Time, was successful. The rocket's core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of after travelling . On 27 August, the TASS issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September, was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry, and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfil its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1, allowing the delay in the rocket's military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.\nOn 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named Sputnik and indexed as 8K71PS, arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began. Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from , its length with PS-1 was and the thrust at liftoff was .\nObservation complex.\nPS-1 was not designed to be controlled; it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to NII-4. Located back in Moscow (at Bolshevo), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the Ministry of Defence that was dedicated to missile development. The six observatories were clustered around the launch site, with the closest situated from the launch pad.\nA second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite's ground track. These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam, Sary-Shagan, Yeniseysk, Klyuchi, Yelizovo, Makat in Guryev Oblast, and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai. Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters.\nThe observatories used a trajectory measurement system called \"Tral\", developed by OKB MEI (Moscow Energy Institute), by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on the R-7 rocket's core stage. The data were useful even after the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket; Sputnik's location was calculated from data on the location of the second stage, which followed Sputnik at a known distance. Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means, such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of , but radar could track it for almost .\nOutside the Soviet Union, the satellite was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries. The booster rocket was located and tracked by the British using the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the only telescope in the world able to do so by radar. Canada's Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1.\nDesign.\nSputnik 1 was designed to meet a set of guidelines and objectives such as:\nThe chief constructor of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov. The satellite was a diameter sphere, assembled from two hemispheres that were hermetically sealed with O-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had a mass of . The hemispheres were 2\u00a0mm thick, and were covered with a highly polished 1\u00a0mm-thick heat shield made of an aluminium\u2013magnesium\u2013titanium alloy, AMG6T. The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1, led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin. Each antenna was made up of two whip-like parts, in length, and had an almost spherical radiation pattern.\nThe power supply, with a mass of , was in the shape of an octagonal nut with the radio transmitter in its hole. It consisted of three silver-zinc batteries, developed at the All-Union Research Institute of Power Sources (VNIIT) under the leadership of Nikolai S. Lidorenko. Two of these batteries powered the radio transmitter and one powered the temperature regulation system. The batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks, and operated for 22 days. The power supply was turned on automatically at the moment of the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket.\nThe satellite had a one-watt, radio transmitting unit inside, developed by Vyacheslav I. Lappo from \"NII-885\", the Moscow Electronics Research Institute, that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002\u00a0MHz. Signals on the first frequency were transmitted in 0.3 s pulses (near f = 3\u00a0Hz) (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch. If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded , the fan was turned on; when it fell below , the fan was turned off by the dual thermal switch. If the temperature exceeded or fell below , another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses. Sputnik \"1\" was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurised to . The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.\nWhile attached to the rocket, Sputnik 1 was protected by a cone-shaped payload fairing, with a height of . The fairing separated from both Sputnik and the spent R-7 second stage at the same time as the satellite was ejected. Tests of the satellite were conducted at OKB-1 under the leadership of Oleg G. Ivanovsky.\nLaunch and mission.\nThe control system of the Sputnik rocket was adjusted to an intended orbit of , with an orbital period of 101.5 minutes. The trajectory had been calculated earlier by Georgi Grechko, using the USSR Academy of Sciences' mainframe computer.\nThe Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34 UTC (5 October at the launch site) from Site No.1 at NI\nP-5. Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight. At shutdown, the 7.5-tonne core stage (with PS-1 attached) had attained an altitude of above sea level, a velocity of , and a velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial elliptical orbit of by , with an apogee approximately lower than intended, and an inclination of 65.10\u00b0 and a period of 96.20 minutes.\nSeveral engines did not fire on time, almost aborting the mission. A fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of the powered flight and the engine thrust being 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were of LOX remaining at cutoff.\nAt 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage and the satellite's transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of Sputnik 1's \"beep-beep-beep\" tones confirmed the satellite's successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 passed below the horizon. The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.\nThe designers, engineers, and technicians who developed the rocket and satellite watched the launch from the range. After the launch they drove to the mobile radio station to listen for signals from the satellite. They waited about 90 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting before Korolev called Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.\nOn the first orbit the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) transmitted: \"As result of great, intense work of scientific institutes and design bureaus the first artificial Earth satellite has been built\". The R-7 core stage, with a mass of 7.5 tonnes and a length of 26 metres, also reached Earth orbit. It was a first magnitude object following behind the satellite and visible at night. Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking. A small highly polished sphere, the satellite was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus harder to follow optically. The batteries ran out on 26 October 1957, after the satellite completed 326 orbits.\nThe core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while Sputnik 1 orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth. It is presumed Sputnik 1 may have broken up above the Western United States. A man in Encino, CA, woke up one morning and noticed something glowing in his backyard. Upon inspection, it proved to be plastic tubing of the type used in Sputnik. No one has been able to prove whether this in fact was part of the satellite.\nReception.\nOrganised through the citizen science project Operation Moonwatch, teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the satellite at dawn and during the evening twilight as it passed overhead. The USSR requested amateur and professional radio operators to tape record the signal being transmitted from the satellite. One of the first observations of it in the western world was made at the school observatory in Rodewisch (Saxony).\nNews reports at the time pointed out that \"anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe.\" Directions, provided by the American Radio Relay League, were to \"Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.\" The first recording of Sputnik 1's signal was made by RCA engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over NBC radio. However, as Sputnik rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by W2AEE, the ham radio station of Columbia University. Students working in the university's FM station, WKCR, made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the Sputnik signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).\nThe Soviet Union agreed to transmit on frequencies that worked with the United States' existing infrastructure, but later announced the lower frequencies. Asserting that the launch \"did not come as a surprise\", the White House refused to comment on any military aspects. On 5 October, the Naval Research Laboratory captured recordings of Sputnik 1 during four crossings over the United States. The USAF Cambridge Research Center collaborated with Bendix-Friez, Westinghouse Broadcasting, and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to obtain a video of Sputnik's rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by WBZ-TV in Boston.\nThe success of Sputnik 1 seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.\nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik 1 spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.\nIn Britain, the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about human progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the Space Age. However, when the USSR launched Sputnik 2, containing the dog Laika, the media narrative returned to one of anti-Communism and many people sent protests to the Soviet embassy and the RSPCA.\nPropaganda.\nSputnik 1 was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West. When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik's signals on the radio and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26-metre (85 foot) core stage of the R-7. Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, on 7 November 1957.\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 surprised the American public, and shattered the perception created by American propaganda of the United States as the technological superpower, and the Soviet Union as a backward country. Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery. Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Army Ballistic Missile Agency built Explorer 1, and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of \"Vanguard TV-3\" on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the Space Race. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race, resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research, and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems. The federal government began investing in science, engineering, and mathematics at all levels of education. An advanced research group was assembled for military purposes. These research groups developed weapons such as ICBMs and missile defence systems, as well as spy satellites for the U.S.\nLegacy.\nInitially, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower was not surprised by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7's capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts. General James M. Gavin wrote in 1958 that he had predicted to the Army Scientific Advisory Panel on 12 September 1957 that the Soviets would launch a satellite within 30 days, and that on 4 October he and Wernher von Braun had agreed that a launch was imminent. The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive. Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights. Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down. To set a precedent for \"freedom of space\" before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites, the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own \"civilian\" satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year. Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of anxiety was inflamed by Democratic politicians, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind. One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of \"impact\" upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture. As public and the government became interested in space and related science and technology, the phenomenon was sometimes dubbed the \"Sputnik craze\".\nThe U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including Explorer 1, Project SCORE, and Courier 1B. However, public reaction to the Sputnik crisis spurred America to action in the Space Race, leading to the creation of both the Advanced Research Projects Agency (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, in 1972), and NASA (through the National Aeronautics and Space Act), as well as increased U.S. government spending on scientific research and education through the National Defense Education Act.\nSputnik also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in mathematics and science. After the launch of Sputnik, a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)\nOne consequence of the Sputnik shock was the perception of a \"missile gap\". This became a dominant issue in the 1960 presidential campaign.\nThe Communist Party newspaper \"Pravda\" only printed a few paragraphs about Sputnik 1 on 4 October.\nSputnik also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the X-15 rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the Apollo command and service module and Saturn V launch vehicle's second stage, was moved by the launch of Sputnik to think of space as being the next step for America. Astronauts Alan Shepard (who was the first American in space) and Deke Slayton later wrote of how the sight of Sputnik 1 passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 led to the resurgence of the suffix \"-nik\" in the English language. The American writer Herb Caen was inspired to coin the term \"beatnik\" in an article about the Beat Generation in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" on 2 April 1958.\nThe flag of the Russian city of Kaluga (which, as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's place of work and residency, is very dedicated to space and space travel) features a small Sputnik in the canton.\nOn 3 October 2007 Google celebrated Sputnik's 50th anniversary with a Google Doodle.\nSatellite navigation.\nThe launch of Sputnik also planted the seeds for the development of modern satellite navigation. Two American physicists, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) decided to monitor Sputnik's radio transmissions and within hours realized that, because of the Doppler effect, they could pinpoint where the satellite was along its orbit. The Director of the APL gave them access to their UNIVAC computer to do the then heavy calculations required.\nEarly the next year, Frank McClure, the deputy director of the APL, asked Guier and Weiffenbach to investigate the inverse problem: pinpointing the user's location, given the satellite's. At the time, the Navy was developing the submarine-launched Polaris missile, which required them to know the submarine's location. This led them and APL to develop the TRANSIT system, a forerunner of modern Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.\nSurviving examples.\nBackups.\nAt least two vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built apparently as backup units. The first resides near Moscow in the corporate museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only. The second is a flight-ready backup at the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson, United States, which also has an engineering model of the Sputnik 2.\nModels.\nThe Museum of Flight in Seattle, United States has a Sputnik 1, but it has no internal components, though it does have casings and moulded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which may be an engineering model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer, who donated it to the museum.\nThe Sputnik 1 EMC/EMI is a class of full-scale laboratory models of the satellite. The models, manufactured by OKB-1 and NII-885 (headed by Mikhail Ryazansky), were introduced on 15 February 1957. They were made to test ground electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electromagnetic interference (EMI).\nReplicas.\nIn 1959, the Soviet Union donated a replica of Sputnik to the United Nations. There are other full-size Sputnik replicas (with varying degrees of accuracy) on display in locations around the world, including the National Air and Space Museum in the United States, the Science Museum in the United Kingdom, the Powerhouse Museum in Australia, and outside the Russian embassy in Spain.\nThree one-third scale student-built replicas of Sputnik 1 were deployed from the Mir space station between 1997 and 1999. The first, named Sputnik 40 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, was deployed in November 1997. Sputnik 41 was launched a year later, and Sputnik 99 was deployed in February 1999. A fourth replica was launched, but never deployed, and was destroyed when Mir was deorbited.\nPrivate owners.\nTwo more Sputniks are claimed to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott and Jay S. Walker.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SJ Games' early titles were microgames initially sold in 4\u00d77\u00a0inch Ziploc bags, and later in the similarly sized Pocket Box. Games such as \"Ogre\", \"Car Wars\", \"Illuminati\", and \"G.E.V.\" (an \"Ogre\" spin-off) were popular during SJ Games' early years. Game designers such as Loren Wiseman and Jonathan Leistiko have worked for Steve Jackson Games.\nIn April 2014, game designer Phil Reed became CEO of the company. In 2023, Reed stepped down, citing concerns about his health and personal life. Meredith Placko, previously CEO of paint company Turbo Dork, took his place. In April 2025, Placko announced she would resign her position and go back to Turbo Dork as its CEO.\nToday SJ Games publishes a variety of games, such as card games, board games, strategy games, and in different genres, such as fantasy, science fiction, and gothic horror. It also published the book \"Principia Discordia\", the sacred text of the Discordian religion.\nRaid by the Secret Service.\nOn March 1, 1990, the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games, seizing three computers, two laser printers, dozens of floppy disks, and the master copy of \"GURPS Cyberpunk\"; a genre toolkit for cyberpunk games, written by Loyd Blankenship, an employee at the time. The Secret Service believed that Blankenship had illegally accessed Bell South systems, and uploaded a document possibly affecting 9-1-1 systems onto Steve Jackson Games's public bulletin board system and/or another board known as Phoenix which he also administered; and, furthermore, that \"GURPS Cyberpunk\" would help others commit computer crimes. During their investigation, the Secret Service also read (and deleted) private emails on one of the computers. Though the materials were later returned in June, Steve Jackson Games filed suit in federal court, winning at trial.\nThe raid led to the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which was founded in July 1990.\nKickstarter project.\nIn April\u2013May 2012, Steve Jackson Games ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for a new \"Designer's Edition\" of \"Ogre\". The final game was planned to weigh 14 pounds or more, partly because the high level of extra funding achieved in the Kickstarter enabled significant game additions.\nGames published.\nSteve Jackson Games' main product line, in terms of sales, is the \"Munchkin\" card game, followed by the role-playing system \"GURPS\".\nMagazines.\nPublication history.\nGaming magazines produced by Steve Jackson Games have included:\nMentions in third-party media.\nIn \"Uplink\", a 2001 computer hacking simulation game by British software company Introversion Software, there is a company named Steve Jackson Games.

{"id": "28486", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28486", "title": "Stella Artois", "text": "Belgian pilsner beer\nStella Artois ( , ) is a pilsner beer, first brewed in 1926 by Brouwerij Artois in Leuven, Belgium. In its original form, the beer is 5.2 per cent ABV, the country's standard for pilsners. The beer is sold in many EU countries, but also in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, where it has a reduced ABV. Stella Artois is owned by Interbrew International B.V. which is a subsidiary of the world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.\nHistory.\nStella Artois branding prominently features the date 1366. According to the Stella Artois website, this is when \"a tradition of brewing beer had been established in Leuven, Belgium.\" The Dutch website biernet.nl reports that the Den Hoorn brewery in Leuven \"certainly existed\" by 1366, as a record of excise duties from that year are on record at the city register. However, the Stella Artois website reports that the first clear reference to the Den Hoorn brewery in Leuven is 100 years later, from 1466. S\u00e9bastien Artois, the brand's namesake, first began apprenticing there as brewmaster in the Leuven Brewer's Guild under brewer Jacob de Bruyn in 1708, and then purchased the brewery in 1717. Artois changed the name of the brewery to Brouwerij Artois but retained the hunting horn in the logo.\nStella Artois beer was first brewed in October 1925 under the code name \u2018X' and then launched the following January as \"Stella Artois,\" named after the Christmas star and marketed as a Christmas beer. First sold in the winter season, it eventually became available year-round, with exports into the broad European market commencing in 1930, though it did not reach the entire market until 1964. Production was halted for a period when operations were suspended during World War II. By 1960, about of Stella Artois were being produced annually. Whitbread secured a licence to brew Stella Artois under contract in the United Kingdom in 1976.\nIn 1988, Brouwerij Artois was a founding member in the merger creating Interbrew. That year, Taylorbrands founder David Taylor created a new package design, bottle design, and shape. The original 1926 bottle label inspired the design, which replaced a 1960s design. The design incorporates the horn symbol and the 1366 date of the original Den Hoorn brewery. The label also shows medals for excellence awarded to Brouwerij Artois at a number of trade exhibitions in Belgium in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Stella Artois is held within a cartouche which was influenced by the style of Belgian architecture in Leuven.\nIn 1993, Interbrew moved production of Stella Artois into a new, fully automated brewery in Leuven. In 2004, Interbrew was part of the merger creating InBev, and by 2006, total annual production volume of Stella Artois exceeded one billion litres.\nIn 2008, InBev was part of the merger creating the Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) brewery company. That same year, a lower-alcohol version, Stella Artois 4%, was introduced in the UK market. In 2011, a cider, Stella Artois Cidre, was launched.\nIn 2020, AB InBev reduced the alcohol content of their beers for the UK market, from 4.8% to 4.6%. The original UK strength of Stella Artois was 5.2% and 4.8% from 2008 until 2020. According to Freddy Delvaux, former head of the in-house laboratory, the Belgian version was 33\u00a0IBU when he joined the lab in 1973, compared to just 20\u00a0IBU in 2014.\nProduction.\nStella Artois is brewed in Belgium (in the plants at Leuven and Jupille), at Samlesbury and Magor in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries. Much of the beer exported from Europe is produced at InBev's brewery in Belgium, and packaged in the Beck's Brewery in Bremen, Germany. Stella Artois is also brewed for the Australian market by Lion. In the United States, Stella Artois is brewed and distributed by Anheuser-Busch at its various brewing facilities in the US, beginning in 2021 and before then it was imported. For the Hungarian market, Stella Artois is brewed in B\u0151cs, Hungary, by Borsod Brewery, under licence from InBev. For the Canadian market is brewed by Labatt Brewery in Ontario, Canada.\nStella Artois is available on draught and in several packaged sizes.\nAn alcohol-free variant of Stella Artois was launched in the UK in 2020 and the USA in 2021.\nAn unfiltered version was introduced to the United Kingdom market in 2022.\nAdvertising.\nUnited Kingdom.\nInitially, brewers Whitbread launched Stella in the UK with advertisements featuring the slogan \"Stella's for the fellas who take their lager strong\". The images showed a Stella-monogrammed half-pint glass (due to its strength) \u2013 in one advertisement with a muscular 'glass arm' for a handle, in the other a glass sitting beside a torn-in-half telephone directory. This was the same creative unit which was involved, at the time, in Whitbread's launch of Trophy Bitter \"The pint that thinks it's a quart\".\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Stella Artois advertising slogan in the United Kingdom was \"Reassuringly Expensive\". The UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotiv inspired by Giuseppe Verdi's \"La forza del destino\". The campaigns began with a series of advertisements based on the 1986 French film \"Jean de Florette\", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres, including war films, silent comedy and surrealism. They have used notable film directors such as Jonathan Glazer. Furthermore, the brand makes extensive use of the French language in its advertising campaigns, even though the beer brand originates from the monolingual Dutch-speaking city of Leuven. An example of this can be seen in the advertising campaign for Stella Artois Cidre, in which the tag-line \"C'est cidre, not cider\" is used, although this cider is produced in Zonhoven, which also lies in the Dutch-speaking Flemish Region.\nStella Artois is advertised as containing \"only 4 ingredients: hops, malted barley, maize and water\". Yeast is also an ingredient used in the fermentation process, but almost all of it is removed before packaging. Since 2009, Stella Artois has been suitable for vegans, as isinglass (fish bladder) is no longer used to remove trace amounts of yeast.\nBrand image.\nAt least since the late 20th century, Stella Artois has carried the nickname of the \"wife beater\" in the United Kingdom, due to a perceived connection between binge drinking involving the brand and domestic violence against women. In January 2012, the online activities of AB InBev lobbyists, Portland Communications, were exposed in the United Kingdom when Tom Watson, a member of the Labour opposition party said that the company (then owned by Tim Allan, a former advisor to ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair) was trying to remove references to Stella Artois from Wikipedia's \"wife beater\" disambiguation page and the phrase \"wife beater\" from this article.\nMarketing.\nStella Artois has been associated with film in the UK since 1994, organising events, sponsoring television, and hosting a website. Stella Artois has been or is a primary sponsor of the Cannes, Melbourne, and Sundance film festivals, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Dallas International Film Festival, and the Little Rock Film Festival.\nStella Artois has broadcast several Super Bowl ads, as part of Anheuser\u2013Busch InBev's overall ad buys during the game. The brand made its debut during Super Bowl XLV in 2011, in an ad starring Adrien Brody. The commercial was heavily criticised in the Belgian media for giving the impression that the beer is French.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28487", "revid": "11308236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28487", "title": "Suebi", "text": "Historical ethnic grouping of Germanic tribes\nThe Suebi (also spelled Suevi or Suavi) were a large group of Germanic peoples first reported by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC. In different contexts over several centuries, peoples within this umbrella category were sometimes simply called the Suebi, although all or most Suebian peoples had their own names as well. They originated near the Elbe River in what is now Eastern Germany. From there, Suebian groups spread across Central Europe, and in the 5th and 6th centuries some took over parts of Spain, Portugal and Italy. Archaeologically, the forerunners of the Suebi before contact with Rome are associated with the Jastorf culture. During the Roman imperial period the Suebi are associated with the so-called \"Elbe Germanic peoples\" who brought Elbe material culture into new areas to the south and southwest. Linguistically, although contemporary evidence for Roman-era Suebian language is scarce, they spoke a Germanic language, which is believed to be the main predecessor of medieval Old High German, and the modern German language, with all its related dialects.\nWith the advent of Roman dominance in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, some Suebi moved into Roman controlled regions near the Neckar river, while a powerful Suebian alliance outside their control maintained a tense relationship with the Roman empire. This was led by the Marcomanni, who settled with other Suebi in remote forests and mountains north of the Roman border along the Danube river, and maintained connections with Suebian and non-Suebian peoples to their north. After their crushing defeat to the Romans in the Marcomannic Wars of the late 2nd century, many Suebi moved into the Roman Empire, or regrouped in areas near the Roman frontier. Notably, the diverse group who came to be known as the Alemanni, took control of Roman territory in what later became medieval Swabia - a cultural region in southern Germany that still bears a version of the Suebian name. During the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Romans were often raided by the Alemanni, Juthungi, Quadi and other Suebi, and attempts to subjugate them had limited success.\nAfter the Battle of Adrianople in 378, the Suebi, Romans and other peoples of the Middle Danube were unsettled by the large-scale arrival of Huns, Goths, Alans, and other newcomers from eastern Europe. Around 406, many Middle Danubians, including many Quadi, moved far to the west, entering Roman Gaul, and disrupting it badly. A large group of \"Suebi\", probably including many Quadi and other Middle Danubians, entered Roman Hispania by 409, where a civil war was in progress. There they established the Kingdom of the Suebi in Gallaecia (north-west Iberia), which lasted from 409 to 585. This was eventually absorbed by the Visigoths, but its legacy survives in local place-names. \nMany other Middle Danubians joined the Huns, and became part of the empire of Attila. After his death in 453 several kingdoms formed, and divided up the region. Among these, a short-lived Suebian kingdom was defeated by the Ostrogoths, and some of them travelled west to join the Alemanni, contributing to the ongoing ethnogenesis of the medieval Swabians. After the Ostrogoths left the region to conquer Italy in 493, the Langobards (Lombards), filled the power vacuum in the Middle Danubian area and became dominant from around 500. They were a Suebian people who had moved southwards from the Elbe region, and they were willing to integrate other populations who agreed to follow their laws. In the still-Romanized areas between the Alemanni and Langobards, a new Germanic people called the Baiuvarii took control, who were the forerunners of the later Bavarians. Modern scholars categorize their language and material culture as Suebian, although they were not called Suebian. In 568 the Langobards entered Italy and established the Kingdom of the Lombards there. The Middle Danube was taken over by the Pannonian Avars, while Bavaria and Swabia became stem duchies of the Frankish empire.\nName.\nThe spelling form \"Suebi\" is the dominant one in classical times, while the common variant \"Suevi\" also appears throughout history. Around 300-600 AD spellings such as Suaevi, Suavi, and \u03a3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 started to occur, because of a sound shift which occurred in West Germanic at this time. However, the classical spellings also continued to be used. The Proto-Germanic pronunciation is reconstructed as (plural), (singular).\nThroughout the 19th century, numerous attempts to propose a Germanic etymology for the name were made which are no longer accepted by scholars. The most widely accepted proposal today is that the word is related to a reconstructed Germanic adjective meaning \u201cone\u2019s own\", which is also found in other ethnic names including the Germanic Suiones (Swedes).\nThe similarity between the Suebian name and the reconstructed Germanic word meaning \"clan\", \u201crelated\" or \"family\u201d is generally seen as indicating that the two words are related, and this is seen as relevant for attempts to explain the second part name. Notably, the name of the Semnones, who classical authors described as the most prestigious and original Suebians, may also have a similar etymology. Linguists generally believe that this name was pronounced as \"Sebn\u014d\", and derived from Proto Indo-European -\"-n\" meaning \u201cof one\u2019s own kind\u201d, with an n-suffix that expresses belonging. The Suebi would then be \u201cthose who are of their own kind\u201d, while the Semnones would be \u201cthose who belong to those of their own kind\u201d.\nIn contrast, R\u00fcbekeil argues that the relevant Proto Indo-European suffix to explain the Germanic name of the Suebi is not \"-bho-\", which was a suffix used to create adverbs from adjectives. Instead he proposes it was a suffix \"*-b\u016b-\" based on the verb to be, , with a syllabic lengthening which changed the meaning to \u201cbelonging to\u201d. The Proto Indo-European root noun - would mean roughly \u201cself-being\u201d.\nAlternatively, it has also been argued that it was borrowed from a Celtic word for \"vagabond\".\nOne people, or many peoples.\nIn Caesar's first report about events in 58 BC, the Suebi were described as a single tribe, who lived in a specific place, between the Ubii and Cherusci, somewhere between the Rhine and Elbe. The Suebi tribe were described again in the following generation, when several classical sources describe their crushing defeat by Drusus the elder in 9 BC. Like Caesar, these authors mentioned the Marcomanni as a distinct allied people who were also defeated in the Roman campaigns of both 58 BC and 9 BC.\nAfter the many victories of Rome in Germania, first century authors such as Strabo, Pliny the Elder, and Tacitus began to perceive the Suebi as a group of tribes, rather than a single tribe. Writing in the early third century Dio Cassius claimed that many peoples had simply decided to call themselves Suebi over time. Modern scholars doubt this, and suggest that Romans may not have originally been aware that tribes such as the Marcomanni and Semnones saw themselves as Suebi.\nStrabo, writing in about 23 AD, described the Suebi not only as the largest people () of the region between Rhine and Elbe, stretching from the one river to the other, but also as an umbrella category including large, well-known tribes. The Semnones are described as one of the largest Suebian peoples, and are listed among the peoples now ruled by Maroboduus. Strabo says that this king settled his own people, the Marcomanni, along with some Suebian peoples (, plural) and other peoples, in the Hercynian forest, but not all Suebi are in this forest. Other Suebi have moved to the eastern bank of the Rhine, forcing the original inhabitants to cross the river and enter the empire. The Hermunduri and Langobardi are also described as Suebi, and are described as living east of the Elbe.\nNotably, Pliny did not explicitly describe the Suebi as an umbrella category, but reported instead that the Suebi, the Hermunduri, the Chatti, and the Cherusci were all in the same ancient race () of the \"Germani\" called the Irminones, who all lived inland. In this account there were only five Germanic races.\nTacitus, writing around 100 AD, was very clear that the Suebi \"are not one single people\" (), and that \"they occupy a larger part of Germania, and though still divided into distinct nations and names\" (), they are collectively referred to as Suebi\". He repeated the five names mentioned by Pliny, noting that they are celebrated in \"old songs\" () which describe how they descend from an ancestor Mannus. However, he then adds that some people \"taking the liberty allowed by antiquity\", assert that other names of peoples (), among which he lists the Suebi, \"are also true and ancient names\" ().\nTacitus noted that the Semnones, who lived on the Elbe, were believed to be the head (), and origin of the Suebian people (). Like the Suebi described by Caesar they lived in 100 . Their reputation was reinforced by their sacred grove where \"all the people () of the same name and blood come together\", referring to all Suebi, and not just all Semnones. Nevertheless, the Marcomanni \"stand first in strength and renown\".\nUnlike Strabo Tacitus claimed to be able to describe the situation east of the Elbe. He believed nearly all the eastern Germanic peoples living between the Elbe and Vistula, and north into Scandinavia, were Suebi. In modern scholarship it has sometimes alternatively been proposed that the name \"Suebi\" may have even been the name which the Germanic peoples used to refer to themselves, as opposed to the Latin name \"Germani\". In contrast, others propose that the Romans themselves popularized the use of the term \"Suebi\" as an umbrella category. Like the term \"Germani\", it was a handy term for referring to northern tribes whose real names were not clear to Romans. It has even been claimed by Herwig Wolfram that in the first centuries AD, classical ethnography applied the name \"Suebi\" to so many Germanic tribes that it almost replaced the term \"Germani\" which Caesar had made popular. \nRoman sources subsequently continued to use the term \"Suebi\", but they used it less for several centuries, probably because they were now better informed about the names of individual tribes. In the late fourth century, as the Quadi and Marcomanni disappear from the record, the more generic term Suebi once again became common in Roman records, and several new Suebian polities came into being. The Kingdom of the Suebi in Hispania was founded in the early 5th century, and at least one Suebian polity appeared near the Middle Danube after the death of Attila the Hun in 453.\nLanguage.\nWhile there is uncertainty about the languages of the first tribes identified by Romans as , the Suebi are generally agreed to have spoken one or more Germanic languages within the West Germanic group. Modern languages which have evolved at least partly from Suebian languages include standard German itself, and also Alemannic German, including Swabian, Alsatian and Swiss German, and Bavarian and Austrian German.\nThe divisions of early West Germanic are a subject of scholarly debate. By the early Middle Ages, West Germanic was spoken not only by peoples known to have Suebian roots, such as the Langobards and Alemanni, but also by Franks, Saxons, Frisians, Anglo-Saxons, and Thuringians who were never called Suebi. In late classical times, the southern dialects associated with Suebian histories experienced the High German consonant shift that defines modern High German languages. However, before the advent of this consonant shift, the dialects of all or most West Germanic speakers are believed to have already been in a single West Germanic dialect continuum. High German can't therefore simply be equated to Suebian ancestry or ethnicity. According to Volker Harm, the relative unification of West Germanic before the consonant shift must instead be a result of the population movements of the fourth and fifth centuries, which involved the mixing of peoples into large new groups.\nIn contrast, in the 20th century it was often assumed based on non-linguistic evidence that the Suebian dialects must have already been distinct from Frankish dialects even before the consonant shift. According to this scheme, based on the work of Friedrich Maurer:\nMaurer originally named these as two of his proposed five major Germanic or \"culture-groups\". He was rejecting the proposal based upon linguistic evidence, which is that the ancestors of the Franks and Alemanni were in one West Germanic linguistic group. Maurer's approach of equating medieval language differences, with imperial-era archaeological categories, and legends about pre-imperial categories, was influenced by the controversial but influential methodology of Gustaf Kossinna.\nArchaeology.\nIn terms of archaeological evidence, the precursor of the Suebi in the early Roman-imperial era (roughly 1-166 AD, ) were in the Jastorf culture which existed in the pre-Roman Iron age (roughly before 1 BC, ) in what is now Eastern Germany and Schleswig-Holstein, centred around the Elbe river and its main tributaries. \nIn the archaeology of the Roman imperial era as a whole (1-400 AD, ), the Suebi are associated with the so-called \"Elbe Germanic peoples\". This term () is commonly used in Germany-related archaeological scholarship, referring to populations who brought Jastorf-related material culture to new areas south and southwest of the Elbe, towards the Roman frontiers on the Rhine and Danube. In other regions west of the Elbe, archaeologists contrast the Elbe Germanic peoples with their Roman era contemporaries, the Weser-Rhine Germanic peoples to their north, and North Sea Germanic peoples still further north on the North Sea coast. All three of these archaeological complexes were however influenced by the earlier Jastorf culture. All three expanded westwards at the expense of earlier, pre-imperial material cultures such as the La T\u00e8ne culture which is associated with Celtic languages. \nIn modern archaeological scholarship the 1st-century movement of Suebi into new regions is more specifically associated with the \"Grossromstedt Horizon\", which was influenced not only by the Jastorf culture but also by the Przeworsk culture from further east in present day Poland. It first appeared in central parts of present day Western Germany, for example near the Main river. It then appears in the in what is now the Czech Republic and western Slovakia. Scholars associate this with the Suebian settlements made in the mountains and forests by Maroboduus, as reported in classical sources. The variant of this horizon which associated with the Suebi of Maroboduus, is called the Pla\u0148any-Group.\nThe Alemanni first appear in historical records in the 3rd century, and were not called Suebi by contemporary authors. They only started to be referred to as Swabian in the early Middle Ages, for reasons which are no longer clear. While linguistic evidence is no longer seen as a basis for distinguishing the earliest Alemanni from the non-Suebian Franks to the north, as Maurer sought to do, scholars continue to accept archaeological evidence for their Elbe Germanic origins. However, the incoming population did not arrive as a cohesive \u201ctribe\u201d. The evidence speaks for wide-reaching communication, and ongoing contacts with distant regions, going beyond central Germany and as far away as Mecklenburg and Bohemia.\nClassical descriptions.\nIn his account of the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar first noted the important role of Suebian forces in the invasion of Gaul in 58 BC, which was led by king Ariovistus, whose first wife was Suebian. Caesar however calls him a king of \"Germani\", and uses that as an umbrella term to cover peoples from east of the Rhine, including the Suebi. Caesar was the first author to clearly distinguish \"Germani\" and Gauls, and define the Rhine as the boundary between them. He helped create an important tradition which is still influential today, of emphasizing their dedication to war, contrasting their habits to the soft Mediterranean way of living which he believed had also weakened the Gauls. However, Caesar had political reasons for emphasizing the weakness of the Gauls and strength of the \"Germani\", because this was used to justify his controversial conquest of Gaul back in Rome.\nAmong the \"Germani\", Caesar particularly emphasized the danger posed by the Suebi. This tradition was later followed by Strabo and Tacitus. In a special digression he called them the largest and the most warlike nation () of all the Germanic peoples (). They were constantly engaged in war, animal husbandry, and hunting. They had little agriculture, with no private ownership of land, and a rule against living in one place for more than one year. They were divided into 100 districts (), each of which could supply a thousand men for military campaigns which were sent out every year. They were powerful enough to force the peoples near them to keep a large swathe of lands around them unoccupied.\nStrabo similarly reported that the Suebi were different to more settled and agricultural tribes such as the Chatti and Cherusci, saying that \"they do not till the soil or even store up food, but live in small huts that are merely temporary structures; and they live for the most part off their flocks, as the nomads do, so that, in imitation of the nomads, they load their household belongings on their wagons and with their beasts turn whithersoever they think best\".\nTacitus wrote a more detailed work, his \"Germania\", which continued the theme of showing how the \"Germani\", and especially the Suebi, were constantly preparing for war. He associated the Suebi with the so-called \"Suebian knot\", the fashion of pulling back their hair, and tying it in a high knot. According to Tacitus, this fashion was not restricted to the Suebi, but he believed that young people in other tribes had imitated them, and the fashion helped the Suebi distinguish themselves from both other Germani, and from their slaves. The nobles had taller and more elaborate knots in order to increase their stature and to strike fear. Modern historians do not think that these knots were a reliable indicator of ethnicity. \nTacitus also described how the Suebi attended rituals involving human sacrifice, in a sacred grove in the land of the Semnones. In another passage he notes that some Suebi sacrifice to a goddess he interpreted to be Isis. He believed this was an imported foreign rite, because the image of Isis is fashioned like a light galley. In general he claimed that the \"Germani\" \"do not consider it consistent with the grandeur of celestial beings to confine the gods within walls, or to liken them to the form of any human countenance. They consecrate woods and groves, and they apply the names of deities to the abstraction which they see only in spiritual worship\".\nThe Gaulish campaigns of Julius Caesar.\nIn 58 BC Julius Caesar (100 BC \u2013 15 March 44 BC) confronted a large army from beyond the Rhine led by a king named Ariovistus. He had a Suebian wife and may have been Suebian himself. The population which he ruled had already been settled for some years in Gaul, having arrived at the invitation of a local tribe, the Sequani, who lived between the Sa\u00f4ne and the Jura Mountains which now form the border between France and Switzerland. Ariovistus had helped fight against another local tribe, the Aedui, who lived west of the Sa\u00f4ne. Ariovistus had already been recognized as a king by the Roman senate. Caesar on the other hand entered into the conflict to defend the Aedui. As part of his justification for intervention into Gaul Caesar was the first author to make a distinction between peoples from west of the Rhine in Gaul, and the \"Germani\" (or Germanic peoples) from east of the Rhine, who he argued to be a potential source of continuing invasions that would affect Italy. \nWhen Caesar arrived in the area, ambassadors from the Treviri, Gauls who lived further north near the Moselle, arrived to report that 100 \"pagi\" of Suebi had been led to the Rhine by two brothers, Nasuas and Cimberius. Caesar needed to move quickly in order to stop them joining forces. Other Suebi appear among the peoples Caesar listed in the battle line-up of Ariovistus himself: \"Harudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, and Suevi\". Caesar defeated Ariovistus in battle, forcing him to escape across the Rhine. When news of this spread, the fresh Suebian forces turned back in some panic, and the Ubii who lived on the east bank near modern Cologne took advantage of the situation to attack them.\nIn 55 BC, having escalated his intervention into a conquest of all of Gaul for Rome, Caesar decided to first bridge the Rhine and attack the country of the Sugambri, and move south to the country of the Ubii in order to confront the Suebi in their own country east of the Rhine. The Suebi abandoned their towns closest to the Romans, retreated to the \"Silva Bacenis\" forest and assembled an army. After 18 days Caesar moved back across the bridge and broke it down, stating that he had achieved his objective. In 53 BC Caesar found that the Treviri had received auxiliary forces from the Suebi, and he built a new bridge and this time established a fort. Ubian spies gave him updates about the movements of the Suebi. \nArchaeological evidence implies the replacement of the older La T\u00e8ne culture east of the Rhine, which had been similar to the cultures found in Gaul, began at about this time. This is consistent with the reports of disruption in these areas given by Caesar and Strabo. This may have already begun before Caesar's arrival in the area.\nThe Germanic campaigns of Augustus.\nAfter Caesar's conquest, Rome controlled Gaul west of the Rhine. Shortly before 29 BC, the Suebi crossed the Rhine, and were defeated by the Roman governor in Gaul, Gaius Carrinas. Along with the young Octavian Caesar (the future Augustus), Carrinas celebrated a triumph in 29 BC. Shortly afterwards, captured Suebians fought as gladiators against captured Dacians at Rome.\nIn 9 BC, the Suebi - again referring to a single people - were defeated by Drusus the Elder, who had already defeated several other peoples including the Marcomanni. Florus reported that the Cherusci, Suebi and Sicambri formed an alliance marked by the crucifixion of twenty Roman centurions. Drusus defeated them with great difficulty, and then confiscated their plunder and sold them into slavery so that \"there was such peace in Germany that the inhabitants seemed changed\", \"the very climate milder and softer than it used to be\". Suetonius reported that the Suebi and Sugambri \"were taken into Gaul and settled in lands near the Rhine\" while other Germani were pushed \"to the farther side of the river Albis\" (Elbe). Elsewhere Suetonius mentioned that in Germania the future emperor Tiberius settled 40,000 prisoners of war. Possibly these were settled near the bank of the Rhine.\nOrosius claimed that the Marcomanni were nearly wiped out after their defeat during this campaign. In the \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\" which celebrates the reign of Augustus, it is boasted that among the many kings who took refuge with Augustus as royal suppliants, there was one \"of the Marcomanni of the Suebi\". The name of this king is no longer legible on the \"Monumentum Ancyranum\", but it ended with \"-rus\". \nAfter these major defeats, the Marcomanni and many Suebi came under the leadership of King Maroboduus, a member of the Marcomanni royal family who had grown up in Rome. Tacitus also calls him a king of the Suebi. Strabo described how he led his people and others into the Hercynian forest and established his royal capital at \"Buiaimon\" (somewhere in or near Bohemia, which still carries the name). He noted that Suebi lived both in the forest, and outside of it. Velleius Paterculus described \"Boiohaemum\", where Maroboduus and the Marcomanni lived, as \"plains surrounded by the Hercynian forest\", and he said this was the only part of Germania which the Romans did not control in the period before the Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. \nVelleius said that Maroboduus drilled his Bohemian soldiers to almost Roman standards, and that although his policy was to avoid conflict with Rome, the Romans came to be concerned that he could invade Italy. \"Races and individuals who revolted from us [the Romans] found in him a refuge.\" From a Roman point of view he noted that the closest point of access for an attack upon Bohemia would be via Carnuntum. This was between present-day Vienna and Bratislava, where the Morava river enters the Danube. However, just when legions were being gathered for a two-pronged attack upon the Marcomanni the Great Illyrian revolt broke out, affecting the Roman provinces south of the Marcomanni from 6-9 AD.\nNo sooner had the Illyrian wars been ended in 9 AD when Rome's dominance of the land northwest of the Marcomanni, between Rhine and Elbe, was also severely checked by the rebellion of the Cherusci and their allies. This began with the annihilation of three legions at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. The kingdom of the Marcomanni and their allies stayed out of the conflict, and when Maroboduus was sent the head of the defeated Roman leader Varus, he sent it on to Rome for burial. Augustus assigned Germanicus, the son of Drusus the Elder, to lead the Roman forces on the Rhine, but the emperor died in 14 AD.\nAround 0 AD, archaeological materials consistent with Elbe origins begin to appear in areas near the Rhine river. This includes the southern Main river, and on the Neckar some decades later. Other Elbe-style communities between the Main, Rhine and Danube formed later. The exact nature of their relationship with the incoming Romans is unknown, but within generations these communities were using Roman technologies, and the Neckar Suebi, as they were known, were recognized as a Roman \"civitas\".\nRoman relations after Augustus.\nGermanicus fought for three years against the Cherusci and their allies. He defeated Arminius, but did not capture or kill him. The new emperor Tiberius however didn't seek to install a Roman administration in Germania, and Germanicus was recalled. Instead the Romans acted to sow discord between the Germani themselves. The Langobardi and Semnones, Suebi living on the Elbe not far from the Cherusci, defected from the kingdom of Maroboduus in the name of freedom, both because Maroboduus did not support the revolt, and because they objected to his royal power.\nIn 17 AD war broke out among these two alliances of Germanic peoples, led by Arminius and Maroboduus. Maroboduus requested help from Rome but according to Tacitus the Romans claimed that Maroboduus \"had no right to invoke the aid of Roman arms against the Cherusci, when he had rendered no assistance to the Romans in their conflict with the same enemy\". After an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew into the hilly forests of Bohemia in 18 AD. The Romans urged the Germani \"to complete the destruction of the now broken power of Maroboduus\". This was all in line with the new foreign policy of the emperor Tiberius.\nIn 19 AD, Maroboduus was deposed and exiled by Catualda, who was a prince who had been living in exile among the Gutones to the north, in what is now northern Poland. (Tacitus claims that the Gutones were more accepting of royalty than most \"Germani\". Strabo mentions them as one of the non-Suebian subject peoples of Maroboduus.) Maroboduus went into exile among the Romans and lived another 18 years in Ravenna. Catualda's victory was short-lived. He was in turn deposed by Vibilius of the Hermunduri that same year he came to power, 19 AD. The subjects of Maroboduus and Catualda, presumably mainly Marcomanni, were moved by the Romans to an area near the Danube, between the Morava and \"Cusus\" rivers, and placed under the control of the Quadian king Vannius. The area where Vannius ruled over the Marcomanni exiles is generally considered to have been a state distinct from the old Quadi kingdom itself. Unfortunately the Cusus river has not been identified with certainty. However, Slovak archaeological research locates a core area of the Vannius kingdom was probably in the fertile southwestern Slovakian lowlands around Trnava, east of the Little Carpathians.\nVannius personally benefitted from the new situation and became very wealthy and unpopular. He was himself eventually also deposed by Vibilius and the Hermunduri, working together with the Lugii, who were another non-Suebian subject people from the north, in 50/51 AD. This revolt by Vibilius was coordinated with the nephews of Vannius, Vangio and Sido, who then divided his realm between themselves as loyal Roman client kings. Vannius was defeated and fled with his followers across the Danube, where they were assigned land in Roman Pannonia. This settlement is associated with Germanic finds from the 1st century AD in Burgenland, west of Lake Neusiedl.\nIn 69 AD, the \"Year of the Four Emperors\", two kings named Sido and Italicus, the latter perhaps the son of Vangio, fought on the side of Vespasian in a Roman civil war. Tacitus described them as kings of the Suebi, and emphasized their loyalty to Rome. They were present at the second battle of Bedriacum in 69 AD at Cremona.\nThe relationship between the Suebi and Romans stabilized but was interrupted under emperor Domitian during the years 89-97 AD, after the Quadi and Marcomanni refused to assist in a conflict against the Dacians. In 89 AD Domitian entered Pannonia to make war, killed the peace envoys sent to him, and was then defeated by the Marcomanni. This campaign was referred to as the war against the Suebi, or the Suebi and Sarmatians, or the Marcomanni, Quadi and Sarmatians. The relationship then stabilized again in the time of emperor Nerva (reigned 96-98). Writing in this period, Tacitus noted that both the Marcomanni and their neighbours the Quadi still had \"kings of their own nation, descended from the noble stock of Maroboduus and Tudrus\". However, he noted that they submit to foreigners, and their strength and power depend on Roman influence. Rome supported them by arms, and according to Tacitus, \"more frequently by our money\". To the west of the Marcomanni, Tacitus noted two other powerful Suebian states, the Hermunduri, whose lands were concentrated in Bohemia near the sources of the Elbe, but they were also allowed to settle and trade as far as the Danubian border in Roman Raetia in present day Bavaria. Between the Hermunduri and Marcomanni north of the Danube were also the Naristi (also known as the Varisti).\nMarcomannic wars.\nThe relationship between the Romans and the Suebian alliance was seriously disrupted and permanently changed during the long series of conflicts called the Marcomannic or Germanic wars, which were fought mainly during the rule of emperor Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161-180 AD). It was triggered by a raid across the Danube in the 150s or 160s AD, by Suebian Langobardi, together with Obii whose identity is uncertain. \nA group of the nations living north of the Danube border selected Ballomarius, king of the Marcomanni, and ten other national representatives, to go on a peace mission to the governor of Roman Pannonia. Oaths were sworn and the envoys returned home. The Romans were apparently planning for a Germania campaign, and knew that Italy itself was threatened by these peoples, but were deliberately diplomatic while they were occupied with the Parthian campaign in the Middle East, and badly affected by the Antonine plague.\nAlthough a Roman offensive could not start in 167 AD, two new legions were raised and in 168 AD the two emperors, Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius, set out to cross the alps. Either in 167 AD, \"before\" the Romans setting, or in 169 AD, \"after\" the Romans came to a stop when Verus died, the Marcomanni and Quadi led a crossing of the Danube, and an attack into Italy itself. They destroyed Opitergium (present-day Oderzo) and put the important town of Aquileia under siege. Whatever the exact sequence of events, the \"Historia Augusta\" says that with the Romans in action several kings of the barbarians retreated, and some of the barbarians put anti-Roman leaders to death. In particular, the Quadi, having lost their king, announced they would not confirm an elected successor without approval from the emperors.\nMarcus Aurelius returned to Rome but headed north again in the autumn of 169. He established a Danubian headquarters in Carnuntum between present-day Vienna and Bratislava. From here he could receive embassies from the different peoples north of the Danube. Some were given the possibility to settle in the empire, others were recruited to fight on the Roman side. The Quadi were pacified, and in 171 AD they agreed to leave their coalition, and returned deserters, and 13,000 prisoners of war. They supplied horses and cattle as war contributions, and promised not to allow Marcomanni or Iazyges passage through their territory. By 173 AD the Quadi had rebelled again, and they expelled their Roman-approved king Furtius, replacing him with Ariogaisos. In a major battle between 172 and 174 AD, a Roman force was almost defeated, until a sudden rainstorm allowed them to defeat the Quadi. The incident is well-known because of the account given by Dio Cassius, and on the Column of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. By 175 AD the cavalry of the Marcomanni, Naristae, and Quadi were forced to fight for Rome in the Middle East, and in 176 AD Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus held a triumph as victors over Germania and Sarmatia.\nThe situation remained disturbed in subsequent years. The Romans declared a new war in 177 AD and set off in 178 AD, naming the Marcomanni, Hermunduri, Sarmatians, and Quadi as specific enemies. They executed a successful and decisive battle against these enemies in 179 AD at Laugaricio (present-day Tren\u010d\u00edn in Slovakia) under the command of legate and procurator Marcus Valerius Maximianus. By 180 AD the Quadi and Marcomanni were in a state of occupation, with Roman garrisons of 20,000 men each permanently stationed in both countries. The Romans even blocked the mountain passes so that the Quadi could not migrate north to live with the Suebian Semnones, breaking a link between the Suebian peoples which had apparently remained important for centuries. Marcus Aurelius was considering the creation of a new imperial province called Marcomannia when he died in 180, but this never happened. \nCommodus the son of Marcus Aurelius made peace soon after the death of his father in 180 AD, but he did not go ahead with plans to create a new Roman province. Some Marcomanni were subsequently settled in Italy and other parts of the empire, while others were forced to serve in the military. After these wars the Marcomanni are mentioned much less in written records, and their western neighbours the fate of their previously powerful Suebian neighbours to the west, the Hermunduri and Varisti is unknown.\nThird century Roman crisis and tetrarchy.\nThe long Marcomannic wars in the second century destroyed older power structures on the Danube frontier and created a new situation not only for peoples living on both sides of the border, but also for the larger category of more remote peoples who had been under the influence of the Danubian Suebi and their alliances. Outside the empire, peoples moved, split and merged. New Germanic groups such as the Franks, Saxons, Alemanni, and Goths appeared near the border regions for the first time in the third century, and immediately caused major problems that affected the empire as a whole. Rome lost control of both two large territories north of the Danube, the Agri Decumates between the Upper Danube, Main and Rhine in southern Germany, and Dacia near the Middle and Lower Danube. In the Middle Danubian frontier however, the Marcomanni and Quadi still existed, and were still referred to sometimes as Suebi.\nMiddle Danube, Quadi and Marcomanni.\nAfter the heavy defeat of the Suebian alliance, the Quadi became the most important Suebi on the Middle Danube. The Hermunduri and Naristi, no longer appear in the written record at all, and there are fewer mentions of the Marcomanni. Some of these populations were settled within the empire. The Quadi subsequently became more integrated with their non-Suebian eastern neighbours the Sarmatians. \nRoman treatment of the remaining Danubian Suebi was oppressive. Around 214/215 AD, Dio Cassius reported that because of raids into Pannonia, the emperor Caracalla invited the Quadi king Gaiobomarus to meet him, and then had him executed. According to this report Caracalla \"claimed that he had overcome the recklessness, greed, and treachery of the Germans by deceit, since these qualities could not be conquered by force\", and he was proud of the \"enmity with the Vandili and the Marcomani, who had been friends, and in having executed Ga\u00efobomarus\".\nFurther east the Goths were a new and powerful presence in what is now Ukraine. They began to have a very large impact on the Romans and their neighbours. Although never called \"Germani\" in Roman sources, their leadership may have originated among the Gutones, who had been based near the mouth of the Vistula in the first and centuries, and reported by Strabo as one of the non-Suebian peoples under Maroboduus's leadership. If so, then their transformation into a large Scythian people of the eastern plains may have been influenced by the Marcomanni wars and Roman abandonment of Dacia. The 6th century writer Jordanes believed that in this period the Romans were paying off Goths under the rule of Ostrogotha. The Roman emperor Philip the Arab, who reigned 244-249 AD, attempted to cut these payments off, but major raids ensued. He also reported that the Marcomanni were paying tribute to this same Gothic king, and the princes of the Quadi were effectively slaves of the Goths. \nDuring the reign of Valerian (253-260 AD) the later historian Zosimus reported that the Marcomanni made coordinated excursions at the same time as those of the \"Scythians\", meaning Goths and their allies from the east. These Marcomanni made inroads into all the countries adjacent to the Danube, and laid Thessalonica waste. Valerian's son Gallienus (reigned 253-268 AD) subsequently settled Marcomanni within the Roman province of Pannonia Superior, south of the Danube. He also took Pipa or Pipara, the daughter of the Marcomanni king, Attalus, as a concubine.\nBy the middle of the third century the Quadi seem to have rejected their client relationship with Rome, and they began a series of attacks which they organized together with their eastern neighbours the Sarmatians. Together they repeatedly attacked Illyricum. There was a Roman campaign against the Quadi in 283-284 AD, and the emperors Carinus (co-emperor 283-285) and Numerian (co-emperor 284-285) celebrated two personal triumphs each in 283 and 284. Nevertheless the Quadi were again mentioned among attacking Germanic tribes in 285 AD.\nAlthough the details are not clear, Diocletian also claimed a triumph over the Marcomanni in 299 AD.\nUpper Danube, Alemanni and Juthungi.\nIn 213, the emperor Caracalla defeated a group of \"Germani\" who lived near the Raetian border on the Danube. Later descriptions of this by Dio Cassius report these \"Germani\" to be the people later called the Alamanni. If correct this would be their first appearance in history. They were a large and diverse group containing many smaller groups with their own names and leaders. Although they are never called Suebi in contemporary sources, scholars believe that many of these groups had Suebian origins. Archaeological evidence indicates a steady stream of technological materials arriving from Suebian areas outside the empire, including both the Elbe and Danube regions. During the third century, the Romans gave up control of the \"Agri Decumates\".\nIn 233 \"Germani\" on the Raetian border once again made major inroads across the Danube into the empire, and this led indirectly to the assassination of the emperor Severus Alexander in 235, whose reaction was seen as insufficient. This initiated the 50-year period of Roman weakness and disunity known as the crisis of the third century. The new emperor Maximinus Thrax defeated these \"Germani\" and recovered the borders, with great losses. Throughout the century the Rhine and Danube continued to be crossed by \"Germani\", meaning not only the Alamanni, but also the non-Suebian Franks to their north.\nFurther west, in 260 the Romans recorded a victory over the Juthungi near modern Augsburg, south of the Danube, and a monument created to celebrate this described these Juthungi as Semnones, a Suebian people from the Elbe. In the 4th century, Marcellinus Ammianus described the Juthungi as a one of the peoples making up the Alemanni. In the whole region between the Main, Rhine, and Danuberivers, the Alemanni overran the old borders and were threatening new borders \u2013 sometimes raiding across them. During the reign of Probus (emperor 276-282), the disrupted situation in the east was also pushing Suebi, as well as Burgundians and Vandals, closer to the Rhine and Danube frontiers where they came into conflict with Roman forces.\nFrom 284 until 305, under Diocletian and his co-emperors, the so-called Tetrarchy, the Romans began to recover control of their border regions. Their successes were celebrated in the Latin Panegyrics which are the first contemporary records which certainly refer to Franks and Alamanni using those terms. The Alamanni are mentioned in the \"10th\" panegyric of 289, which was dedicated to emperor Maximian. It mentions that in 287 the Alamanni joined forces with the Burgundians in order to invade Gaul. Maximian defeated them by \"divine foresight rather than by force\": the invaders' \"great numbers were ruinous to them\", and famine ensued, allowing the emperor to capture them with smaller bands of troops. A few years later the 11th panegyric of 291, also dedicated to Maximian, celebrated the way in which non-Romans were now driven to fight each other. One example it gives is that the Burgundians had been defeated by the Goths, presumably near the Vistula, somehow requiring the Alamanni to take up arms, perhaps as allies, or perhaps because the Burgundians were moving west. It also states that the Burgundians took land from the Alamanni, which the Alamanni now wanted to recover.\nIn 297/298, Constantius Chlorus, Maximian's son-in-law and subordinate \"caesar\" in the tetrarchy, devastated the country of \"Alamannia\", which is the first mention of such a country in any surviving contemporary record. Between 298 and 302 he achieved further major victories against the Alamanni, who had been making inroads into Gaul itself. He defeated them in present-day Langres in France, and then Windisch in Switzerland. The Quadi also seem to have been pacified in the time of Maximian's co-emperor to the east, Diocletian (reigned 284-305).\nFourth century until 378.\nAfter the resignation of the co-emperors Diocletian and Maximian in 305 AD, and the death of Maximian's replacement as western emperor Constantius Chlorus in 306 AD, Constantine I, the son of Constantius, was proclaimed emperor by his army while based at York in Britain. Among the forces supporting him there were the Alamanni, led by their king Chrocus. Constantine reigned from 306-337 AD, but the empire was then once again divided between his three sons Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans. In 340 Constans killed Constantine II, leaving him with uncontested control in the west.\nThe Rhine defences were weakened again in 355 when Magnentius became a rebel emperor based there. He killed Constans, and took control of much of the western empire, battling the remaining brother, Constantius II for control of the empire. During his revolt, which lasted until 353, the Rhine borders were undermanned and barbarians were able to enter Gaul while major battles were fought elsewhere. Magnentius finally died in Lyon in 353. Silvanus, one of his main commanders, who had defected to Constantius, was given the task of rebuilding defences in Gaul. However, being accused of plotting to become emperor, he decided to really make an attempt in 355 and was killed soon afterwards. \nA new phase of confrontation against the Alemanni in the west and Quadi in the east now began under Constantius II (reigned 337-361). In 354, in the eastern regions of the Alemanni, he defeated the brothers Gundomadus and Vadomarius near Augst, and took the title \"Germanicus Alama(n)nicus maximus\". His cousin, the future emperor Julian the Apostate was given responsibility for Gaul and the Rhine in 355 AD. Germanic peoples including Alamanni had settled within Gaul, and many parts of Gaul were suffering due to reduced cultivation of lands. \nIn the east in 357 Constantius II also fought the Suebian Quadi. The Quadi and their neighbours the Sarmatians were making raids across the Middle Danube into Roman Pannonia and Moesia on the Lower Danube. The account given by Ammianus Marcellinus shows that in this period the Quadi had become more accustomed to actions on horseback. He reported that the involved Quadi and Sarmatians \"were neighbours and had like customs and armour\", \"better fitted for brigandage than for open warfare, have very long spears and cuirasses made from smooth and polished pieces of horn, fastened like scales to linen shirts\". They had \"swift and obedient horses\" and they generally had more than one, \"to the end that an exchange may keep up the strength of their mounts and that their freshness may be renewed by alternate periods of rest\". \nIn 358 the emperor crossed the Danube and resistance quickly fell apart. The leaders who came to negotiate with the emperor represented different parts of the populations who had participated. An important one was prince Araharius, who ruled \"a part of the Transiugitani and the Quadi\". An inferior of his was Usafer, a prominent noble, who led \"some of the Sarmatians\". In the negotiations the emperor declared that the Sarmatians were Roman dependents and demanded hostages. He then learned that there had been social upheaval among the Sarmatians, and some of the nobility had even fled to other countries. He gave them a new king, Zizais, a young prince who was the first leader to surrender. He then met with Vitrodorus the son of Viduarius the King of the Quadi. They also gave hostages and they drew their swords \"which they venerate as gods\" in order to swear loyalty. As a next step he moved to the mouth of the Tisza and slaughtered or enslaved many of the Sarmatians who lived on the other side and had felt themselves protected by the river from the Romans. King Viduarius was probably king of the western Quadi. Constantius erected a triumphal arch in Carnuntium, today known as the Heidentor, but raids did not stop.\nBy 361, Julian captured a king of the Alamanni named Vadomarius, and claimed that he had been in league with Constantius II, who had been encouraging him to raid the borders of Roman Raetia. Julian defeated his cousin and became sole emperor in the same year. He died only two years later in 363 AD.\nValentinian I (reigned 364-375) appears to have been preparing for campaigns against the Alemanni from an early phase. The Roman usurper Procopius, declared himself emperor in Constantinople with the support of the Alemannic chieftain Agilo. Valentinian's military commander on the Rhine, Charietto, was killed in 366 fighting Alemanni who had penetrated deep into Gaul. Nevertheless the Alemanni were defeated just one month later at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, and Agilo and another chief named Gomoarius handed over the usurper Procopius to Valens, the younger brother and eastern co-emperor of Valentinian. In 368 other Alemannic chiefs, Vithicabius the son of Vadomarius, and Rando, provoked Valentinian with raids. Vithicabius was assassinated. \nValentinian I built fortifications on the Rhine around 369/370. He also fortified the northern and eastern banks of the Middle Danube against the Quadi and their allies, and by 373 AD he ordered construction of a garrisoned fort within Quadi territory itself. In 374, when complaints from the Quadi delayed construction the Roman general charged with getting it done invited their king Gabinius to dinner and then murdered him. As Ammianus wrote \"the Quadi, who had long been quiet, were suddenly aroused to an outbreak\". Neighbouring tribes including the Sarmatians sprung into action and began raids across the Danube, repulsing the Roman military's first poorly coordinated attempts to confront them. Valentinian moved to the Danube border and went first to Carnuntum, which was damaged and deserted, and then Aquincum (now part of Budapest). He sent one force north into the Quadi heartlands, and took another force across the Danube near present-day Budapest, where the enemies had settlements, and they slaughtered everyone they could find. He then made his winter quarters on the Roman side of the Danube in Bregetio (present-day Kom\u00e1rom). Here Quadi envoys came to plead for peace. However, when they maintained that the building of a barrier was begun \"unjustly and without due occasion\", thus arousing rude spirits to anger, Valentinian became enraged, then sick, and died. His death in 375 ended this round of conflict, and the Romans and Quadi were soon preoccupied with bigger problems in the Danubian region.\nIn 378 Valentinian's eldest son the emperor Gratian was occupied with a campaign against the Alemanni. He and his forces were therefore not present when the empire suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Adrianople, which was caused by a sudden movement of peoples including Goths, Alans and Huns coming from present-day Ukraine, which had been building up for some time. According to Ammianus, the region of the Marcomanni and Quadi were among the areas first affected by the \"a savage horde of unknown peoples, driven from their abodes by sudden violence\". Armed groups began to settle in or near the Middle Danube, near the Quadi homeland.\nFrom Adrianople to the Middle Ages.\nThe defeat of the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378 marked a turning point for the remaining Suebi on the Middle Danube frontier, including the Quadi and the Marcomanni. The arrival of large numbers of armed Huns, Goths and Alans disrupted the border region on both sides. At first, the Suebi of the Middle Danube who lived outside the empire are recorded as working with the newcomers from the east to raid Roman lands. After the death of emperor Theodosius I in 395, Saint Jerome listed the Marcomanni and Quadi and their old neighbours the Sarmatians and Vandals, together with several of the eastern peoples causing devastation in the Roman provinces stretching from Constantinople to the Julian Alps, including Dalmatia, and all the provinces of Pannonia: \"Goths and Sarmatians, Quadi and Alans, Huns and Vandals and Marcomanni\". The poet Claudian describes this mass of people crossing the frozen Danube with wagons, and then setting wagons rigged around themselves like a wall at the approach of the Roman commander Stilicho. He says that all the fertile lands between the Black Sea and Adriatic were subsequently like uninhabited deserts, specifically including Dalmatia and Pannonia. \nThe various peoples living upon the Middle Danube frontier did not remain united. There was conflict between the Alans, Huns and Goths, which led to massacres according to Orosius. The Huns under Uldin began to dominate the region, and they helped the Romans suppress a large force which Radagaisus gathered there to invade Italy in 406. There was also famine according to Isidore of Seville. Large numbers of people from the Middle Danube now headed far to the west, where they entered Roman Gaul during a period when the border was poorly defended. The last contemporary mention of the Quadi as an identifiable people is in another letter by Jerome from 409, but it places them far from home. He lists them first among the peoples who were occupying Gaul at that time: \"Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alans, Gepids, Herules, Saxons, Burgundians, Alemanni and\u2014alas for the commonwealth!\u2014even Pannonians\" (in other words Roman citizens from Pannonia). Apart from the Saxons, Burgundians and Alemanni, who were already well-known near the Rhine, the others are from the Middle Danube area. \nThe Kingdom of the Suevi in Hispania.\nMany of the Suebi who came into Gaul around 406, probably including many Quadi, soon moved further west, into Hispania, where a large force of Suebi arrived by 409 AD, about the same time as large groups of Vandals and Alans. Hispania was at this time under the control of the rebel Roman general Gerontius and the newcomers came to agreements with him as military allies in his struggle against Roman forces. The three groups proceeded to divide Hispania between themselves into four kingdoms, with the agreement of Gerontius. After the defeat of Gerontius, the Roman authorities rejected these agreements and the Visigoths began to work against the four kingdoms. After many of the Vandals and Alans moved to Carthage, the Suebi were the last of them to hold an independent kingdom, which endured until 585, when it was absorbed by the Visigothic kingdom. From 456/457 it was however already a vassal of the Visigoths.\nThe Hunnic alternative.\nSome Danubian Suebi remained in the region which increasingly came under the control of the Huns, led at first by Uldin. A powerful Hunnic empire developed, giving the non-Roman peoples of the frontier an alternative way to improve their lives outside the empire. Herwig Wolfram has referred to this as the \"Hunnic alternative\". Although they may have been present, in 451 none of the Suebian groups are listed by contemporary sources as taking part in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, where the Roman allies under Aetius defeated the allies of Attila the Hun.\nAttila died in 453. In the ensuing period, a short-lived Suevian kingdom emerged as one of several new kingdoms with ethnic names in Pannonia and the Middle Danubian region. This kingdom was ruled at first by two kings named Hunimund and Alaric. It existed in or near north-eastern Pannonia. It may have been made up of a mixture of peoples, although the Quadi were likely most prominent. After being defeated by the Ostrogoths, another of the successor kingdoms, Hunimund and some of these Suebi seem to have moved west and joined the Alemanni.\nIn 469/470 Jordanes reported that Suebi from the Middle Danube fled west into the Alps and joined the Alamanni there. However, their merged forces were defeated by their enemies from the Middle Danube, the Ostrogoths. The country where the Alamanni and Suabi lived is described by Jordanes in a way which gives a rough indication of the new peoples were developing: Bavarians to the east, Franks to the west, Burgundians to the south, and Thuringians to the north (). It is believed that this apparent merger of the Danubian Suebi and the Alamanni might explain why the Alamanni subsequently came to be called Swabians themselves in the Middle Ages.\nThe Alemanni and Juthungi.\nIn the period before 409, although they already lived near the Rhine, the Alemanni, like their neighbours the Burgundians, were caught up in the great movements westwards over the Rhine. It appears to be in this period that the Alemanni and Burgundians extended their territories westwards over the Rhine to include the present day Rhineland-Palatinate and Alsace. The exact territory of the Burgundians at this time is unknown, and they lost it in 436. By around 480 the Burgundians were placed to the south of the Alemanni and able to block their path south into present-day western Switzerland.\nTo the west of the Alemanni, in 430 the Juthungi raided Raetia on the Danube, and were repelled by Aetius and his forces. This is the last time the Juthungi were mentioned as a distinct people. The Baiuvarii (early Bavarians) would later rule Raetia.\nIn 470-476, a few years after Jordanes claims that Suebi from the east moved to live with the Alemanni, Saint Severinus, near Passau, negotiated the release of prisoners of war from an Alemannic king named Gibuldus. At almost the same time, Bishop Lupus of Troyes negotiated the release of captives from his diocese of Troyes from an Alemannic king Gebavultus, possibly the same person.\nIn the 490s one or more battles were fought between the Alemanni and the Franks. By 507 many of the Alemanni were under Frankish control, with another part under the protection of the Ostrogothic kings in Italy. In 537 the Ostrogoths ceded control of the rest of the Alemanni and also Raetia where the Bavarians were.\nRoman Pannonia.\nOther Middle Danubian Suebi moved southwards into Roman lands, including many Marcomanni. Ambrose, bishop of Milan (374\u2013397), corresponded with a Christian Marcomannic queen named Fritigil, initiating a peace treaty between the Marcomanni and the western Roman military leader Stilicho. That was the last clear evidence of the Marcomanni having a polity, which was probably now on the Roman side of the Danube, in Pannonia. The \"Notitia Dignitatum\" lists several Marcomanni units among the surviving Roman military forces posted around the empire. After the death of Attila, the stretch of the Danube between Passau and Vienna was ruled by the Rugii, but there were still Roman forts and towns, as described by Eugippius in his writings about the times of Severinus of Noricum. Soon afterwards, in 488, these Rugii were defeated by Odoacer the king of Italy and after some years under the control of the Heruli, the Langobards, a Suebian who had recently migrated from the northern part of the Elbe, took control of the region and began expanding their Pannonian territory to the south.\nThe \"Ravenna Cosmography\", a much later document which used sources that are in many cases now lost, indicates that a \"Marcannori\" people (\"Marcannorum gens\") lived in the mountainous southwest of Pannonia near the Sava river. A Sava or \"Suavia\" province between the Sava and Drava rivers continued to exist during the time when the Ostrogoths ruled Italy, and may have been named after these Suebi (Suavi).\nIt is possible that the Suebi moved into this more southern area after the defeat of Hunimund, or they may have been a separate group. During the Ostrogothic period, these Suebi were legally distinguished from the native populations under the term \"old barbarians\" (\"antiqui barbari\"), which also distinguished them from the new arrivals, the Goths. Unusually, they were legally permitted to marry provincial residents and could therefore become part of the land-owning class. Some scholars believe these were descendants of the Christian Marcomanni of Queen Fritigil. During the time of Theoderic the Great a group of Alemanni crossed the Alps with cattle and wagons to seek refuge with these \"antiqui barbari\". Procopius noted that in 537 the Ostrogoths recruited an army of these Suebi to launch an attack against areas held by the Eastern Roman empire. In 540 Ostrogothic rule in the Sava region came to an end, and the Suebi came under the authority of the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian. Many of the Suebi who remained in the Pannonian region are believed to have taken up a Lombardic identity after the defeat of the Ostrogoths, and many may therefore have subsequently entered Italy with the Suebian Lombards. The region subsequently came under the control of the Pannonian Avars, and it is probably during this period that Slavic languages eventually became dominant in the areas where the Quadi had lived.\nIntegration into the Lombards.\nMany Suebi from the Danubian region were assimilated into the Langobards (Lombards), who had themselves long ago been counted among the Suebian peoples in first and second century Roman ethnography. In the 6th century, the Langobards were no longer referred to as Suebi, but they apparently absorbed Suebi during their time in the Middle Danubian, including some from the southern \"Suavian\" part of Pannonia. When the Lombards entered Italy after 568, Suebi were among the groups who joined them, and formed part of their realm in Italy.\nSuebi who remained in the north.\nDespite all these changes, there are indications that at least one group of Suebi, the so-called \"northern Suebi\", seem to have survived near their Elbe homelands into the Middle Ages. \nThe Bavarians.\nBetween the Alemanni and the Langobards, in what had been Roman Raetia, a new people named the Baiuvarii appeared by the 6th century, and these were the forerunners of the medieval Bavarians. Although they were never referred to as Suebi, modern scholars often mention them among the \"Elbe Germanic peoples\" who supposedly carried a Suebian culture. While their origins are unclear, scholars believe their language and material culture was difficult to distinguish from the Alemanni or Langobards. Jordanes mentioned the Baiuvarii in his account of 5th century events, but the relatively detailed biography of Severinus of Noricum describes the region around Passau being affected by Alemanni, Thuringians, and Rugii, and never mentions the Baiuvarii. They became important soon after the defeat of the Rugii by Odoacer in 488, who was at that time the ruler of Roman Italy. To the east of the early Baiuvarii, the power vacuum created by the subsequent movements of armed peoples to Italy was filled the Suebian Langobards who had moved southwards from the Elbe in this period. Raetia however remained relatively Romanized for some time, and Bavaria continued to have Romance speakers into the Middle Ages.\nTraditionally, discussion about the origins of the Baiuvarii starts with their name, which indicates a connection to one of the regions once inhabited by the Boii. It implies that some of the early Bavarians moved from one or more of the regions to the east of Bavaria. This could include the Roman province of Noricum, which was previously associated with the Marcomanni and their neighbours, and later with Hunnic allies such as the Rugii.\nLike the Swabians in Alamannia, in the Middle Ages Bavaria became a stem duchy in the Holy Roman Empire.\nNorse mythology.\nThe name of the Suebi also appears in Norse mythology and in early Scandinavian sources. The earliest attestation is the Proto-Norse name \"Swabaharjaz\" (\"Suebian warrior\") on the R\u00f6 runestone and in the place name Svogerslev. Sv\u00e1fa, whose name means \"Suebian\", was a Valkyrie who appears in the eddic poem \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar\". The kingdom \"Sv\u00e1faland\" also appears in this poem and in the \"\u00dei\u00f0rekssaga\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins can be affixed to the base of each ski to prevent them from sliding backwards. Originally used as a means of travel over snow, skis have become specialized for recreational and competitive alpine and cross-country skiing.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology and usage.\nThe word \"ski\" comes from the Old Norse word which means \"cleft wood,\" \"stick of wood,\" or \"ski\". In Old Norse common phrases describing skiing were \"fara \u00e1 sk\u00ed\u00f0um\" (to travel, move fast on skis), \"renna\" (to move swiftly) and \"skr\u00ed\u00f0a \u00e1 sk\u00ed\u00f0um\" (to stride on skis). In Norwegian this word is usually pronounced . In Swedish, another language evolved from Old Norse, the word is (plural, ; singular: ). The modern Norwegian word \"ski\" and the Swedish word \"skid\" have largely retained the Old Norse meaning in words for split firewood, wood building materials (such as bargeboards) and roundpole fence.\nEnglish and French use the original Norwegian spelling , and modify the pronunciation. Before 1920, English often called them \"skee\" and \"snow-shoe\". In Italian, it is pronounced similarly to Norwegian, but the spelling is modified accordingly: . Portuguese and Spanish adapt the word to their linguistic rules: and . In German, spellings \"Ski\" and \"Schi\" are in use, both pronounced . In Dutch, the word is and the pronunciation was originally as in Norwegian, but since approximately the 1960s changed to . In Welsh the word is spelled \"sgi\". Many languages make a verb form out of the noun, such as \"to ski\" in English, in French, in Spanish and Portuguese, in Italian, in Dutch, or or (as above also or ) in German. Norwegian and Swedish do not form a verb from the noun.\nFinnish has its own ancient words for skis and skiing: \"ski\" is and \"skiing\" is . The word \"suksi\" goes back to the Proto-Uralic period, with cognates such as Erzya \"soks\", Mansi \"t\u00e5ut\" and Nganasan \"tuta.\" The Sami also have their own words for \"skis\" and \"skiing\": for example, the Lule Sami word for \"ski\" is and skis are called . The Sami use for the verb \"to ski\".\nHistory.\nSkis appeared before the wheel, with the oldest wooden skis found in Russia (c. 6300\u20135000 BCE), Sweden (c. 5200 BCE) and Norway (c. 3200 BCE) respectively.\nThese early skis were not designed for recreation or speed; their sole purpose was to keep the user on top of the snow, as when hunting or at war. Early skis were generally accompanied by a walking stick to help the user maintain balance.\nNordic ski technology was adapted during the early 20th century to enable skiers to turn at higher speeds. New ski and ski binding designs, coupled with the introduction of ski lifts to carry skiers up slopes, enabled the development of alpine skis. Meanwhile, advances in technology in the Nordic camp allowed for the development of special skis for skating and ski jumping.\nAsymmetrical skis.\nThis type of ski was used at least in northern Finland and Sweden until the 1930s. On one leg, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and on the other a shorter ski for kicking. The bottom of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in similar manner to modern ski waxing. Early record of this type of skis survives in works of Olaus Magnus. He associates them to Sami people and gives Sami names of \"savek\" and \"golos\" for the plain and skinned short ski. Finnish names for these are \"lyly\" and \"kalhu\" for the long and short ski.\nSingle long ski.\nThe seal hunters at the Gulf of Bothnia had developed a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals' breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made specially long, 3\u20134 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is called \"\" in Swedish.\nModern skis.\nAround 1850, artisans in Telemark, Norway, invented the cambered ski. This ski arches up in the middle, under the binding, which distributes the skier's weight more evenly across the length of the ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier's weight. This new design made it possible to build a thinner lighter ski, that flexed more easily to absorb the shock of bumps, and that maneuvered and ran faster and more easily. The design also included a sidecut that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily.\nSkis traditionally were hand-carved out of a single piece of hardwood such as hickory, birch or ash. These woods were used because of their density and ability to handle speed and shock-resistance factors associated with ski racing. Because Europe's forests were dwindling, finding quality plank hardwood became difficult, which led to the invention of the laminated ski. Beginning in 1891, skimakers in Norway began laminating two or more layers of wood together to make lighter cross country running skis. These evolved into the multi-laminated high-performance skis of the mid-1930s.\nA laminated ski is made of two types of wood glued together. A top layer of soft wood is glued to a thin layer under a surface of hardwood. This combination created skis which were much lighter and more maneuverable than the heavy hardwood skis made before. Although lighter and stronger, laminated skis did not wear well. The water-soluble glues used at the time failed; they warped and split along the glue edges (delaminating) frequently and rapidly. In 1922, a Norwegian skier, Thorbjorn Nordby, developed strong waterproof glue which stopped the problem of splitting, therefore developing a much tougher laminated ski. Research and design of laminated skis rapidly progressed. In 1933, a new design technology was introduced with an outer hardwood shell completely encasing an inner layer of lighter wood, successfully eliminating spontaneously splitting glue lines. This early design eventually evolved into an advanced laminating technique which is referred to today as single-shell casing technology.\nIn 1950, Howard Head introduced the Head Standard, constructed by sandwiching aluminium alloy around a plywood core. The design included steel edges (invented in 1928 in Austria,) and the exterior surfaces were made of phenol formaldehyde resin which could hold wax. This hugely successful ski was unique at the time, having been designed for the recreational market rather than for racing. \n1962: a fibreglass ski, Kneissl's White Star, was used by Karl Schranz to win two gold medals at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. By the late '60s fibreglass had mostly replaced aluminum.\nIn 1974, Magne Myrmo became the last world champion (Falun, 15\u00a0km cross-country) using wooden skis.\nIn 1975, the torsion box ski construction design is patented. The patent is referenced by K\u00e4stle, Salomon, Rottefella, and Madshus. In 1993 Elan introduced the Elan SCX model, skis with a much wider tip and tail than waist. When tipped onto their edges, they bend into a curved shape and carve a turn. Cross-country techniques use different styles of turns; edging is not as important, and cross-country skis have little sidecut. For many years, alpine skis were shaped similarly to cross-country, simply shorter and wider, but the Elan SCX introduced a radial sidecut design that dramatically improved performance. Other companies quickly followed suit, one Austrian ski designer admitting, \"It turns out that everything we thought we knew for forty years was wrong.\" Line Skis, the first free-ski focused ski company inspired the newschool freeskiing movement with its twin-tip ski boards in 1995. The first company to successfully market and mass-produce a twin-tip ski to ski switch (skiing backwards) was the Salomon Group, with its 1080 ski in 1998.\nGeometry.\nDescribed in the direction of travel, the front of the ski, typically pointed or rounded, is the tip, the middle is the waist and the rear is the tail. Skis have four aspects that define their basic performance: length, width, sidecut and camber. Skis also differ in more minor ways to address certain niche roles. For instance, \"mogul skis\" are softer to absorb shocks, \"powder skis\" are wider to provide more float and \"rocker skis\" bent upwards (\"reverse camber\") at the tip and tail to make it easier to turn in deep and heavy snow.\nConstruction.\nSkis have evolved from being made of solid wood to using a variety of materials including carbon-Kevlar to make skis stronger, stiffer in twisting, lighter, and more durable. Ski manufacturing techniques allow skis to be made in one or a combination of three designs:\nLaminate or sandwich.\nLaminated skis are built in layers. Materials such as fiberglass, steel, aluminum alloy, or plastic are layered and compressed above and below the core. Laminated construction is the most widely used manufacturing process in the ski industry today. The first successful laminate ski, and arguably the first modern ski was the Head Standard, introduced in 1950, which sandwiched aluminum alloy around a plywood core.\nTorsion box.\nThe Dynamic VR7 introduced a new construction method in which a smaller wooden core was wrapped in wet fibreglass, as opposed to pre-dried sheets of fibreglass being glued to the core (essentially replacing metal sheets). The result was a torsion box, which made the ski much stronger. The VR7, and its more famous follow-on VR17, was the first fibreglass ski that could be used for men's racing, and quickly took over that market. Over time, materials for both the core and torsion box have changed, with wood, various plastic foams, fibreglass, kevlar and carbon fiber all being used in different designs. Torsion box designs continue to dominate cross-country ski designs, but is less common for alpine and ski touring.\nMonocoque or cap.\nDuring the 1980s, Bucky Kashiwa developed a new construction technique using a rolled stainless steel sheet forming three sides of a torsion box over a wooden core, with the base of the ski forming the bottom. Introduced in 1989, the Volant skis proved expensive to produce, and in spite of numerous positive reviews, the company never became profitable. In 1990, the Salomon S9000 took the same basic concept but replaced the steel with plastics, producing a design they called \"monocoque\". Now referred to as the \"cap ski\" design, the concept eliminates the need to wrap the core and replaces this with a single-step process that is much less expensive to produce. Cap ski construction dominates alpine ski construction today.\nHistorical.\nThe classical wooden ski consists of a single long piece of suitable wood that is hand-carved to the required shape. Early designs were generally rectangular in cross-section, with the tip bent up through application of steam. Over time the designs changed, and skis were thinned out to the sides, or had prominent ridges down the center.\nTypes.\nIn the history of skiing many types of skis have been developed, designed for different needs, of which the following is a selection.\nAlpine.\nAlpine skis, also called downhill skis, are skis designed specifically for lift-assisted resort runs.\nSki design has evolved enormously since the beginnings of the modern sport in mid-19th-century Norway. Modern skis typically have steel edges, camber, side cut, and possibly reverse camber. During the 1990s side cut became more pronounced to make it easier to carve turns. Alpine skis typically have fixed-heel bindings. Specialised types of alpine skis exist for certain uses, including twin-tip skis for freestyle skiing, slalom skis, GS skis, powder skis, telemark skis and monoskis.\nThe following table shows different kinds of alpine ski types and their uses within a downhill skiing context.\nBackcountry.\nBackcountry skiing, also known as off-piste skiing, is any form of skiing done outside of ski area boundaries. Most of the time this type of skiing is done with alpine touring skis, or telemark gear, where skiers take advantage of climbing skins and a detachable heel, to ski uphill. When the skier reaches the top of the area they want to ski down, they take off the climbing skins and make the necessary preparations to ski back down. Backcountry terrain can also be accessed with standard alpine equipment by riding a lift uphill at a ski resort and then leaving the resort boundary. However, this is more commonly known as sidecountry because of its immediate access from a ski lift.\nNordic.\nIn Nordic skiing the skier is not reliant on ski lifts to get up hills, and so skis and boots tend to be lighter, with a free heel to facilitate walking. Styles of Nordic skiing equipment include:\nPoles.\nSki poles are commonly used in tandem with skis in a variety of types of skiing. They typically give additional maneuverability and support turning, walking, and getting up after falling.\nSki maintenance.\nSki maintenance encompasses four facets: binding adjustments, waxing, edge shaping, and base repair.\n\"Binding adjustment\": Safety-release ski bindings require adjustment to fit the weight and height of the skier. Annual maintenance assures that settings continue to be correct. For rental skis, such an adjustment is required for each change of customers.\n\"Waxing\": Most ski wax minimizes gliding friction on snow. \"Grip wax\" promotes grip on snow for cross-country skis. Wax may be applied in three ways, melting on, rubbing on and as a paste.\n\"Edge shaping\": Edges engage the snow, especially during icy conditions. The angle from the plane of the bottom of the ski is set, depending on the type of skiing anticipated, as follows:\nEdge shaping may be done daily with carborundum or diamond stone to remove imperfections. Tuning the edges requires a series of applications of sharpening tools and stones, working at approximately right angles along the metal edge.\n\"Base repair\": Ski base repair has three levels: cleaning, filling imperfections, and surface preparation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Due to Sweden's large north-to-south expanse, there are regional differences between the cuisine of North and South Sweden.\nHistorically, in the far north, meats such as reindeer, and other game dishes were eaten, some of which have their roots in the Sami culture, while fresh vegetables have played a larger role in the South. Many traditional dishes employ simple, contrasting flavours, such as the traditional dish of meatballs and brown cream sauce with tart, pungent lingonberry jam.\nGeneral features.\nSwedish cuisine could be described as centered around cultured dairy products, crisp and soft breads, berries and stone fruits, beef, chicken, lamb, pork, eggs, and seafood. Potatoes are often served as a side dish, often boiled. Swedish cuisine has a wide variety of breads of different shapes and sizes, made of rye, wheat, oat, white, dark, sourdough, and whole grain, and including flatbreads and crispbreads. There are many sweetened bread types and some use spices. Many meat dishes, especially meatballs, are served with lingonberry jam. Fruit soups with high viscosity, like rose hip soup (\"nyponsoppa\") and bilberry soup (\"bl\u00e5b\u00e4rssoppa\") served hot or cold, are typical of Swedish cuisine. Butter and margarine are the primary fat sources, although olive oil is becoming more popular. Sweden's pastry tradition features a variety of tortes, yeast buns, cookies, biscuits and cakes; many of them are in a very sugary style and often eaten with coffee (\"fika\").\nHistory.\nThe importance of fish has governed Swedish population and trade patterns far back in history. For preservation, fish were salted and cured. Salt became a major trade item at the dawn of the Scandinavian Middle Ages, which began c. 1000 AD. Cabbage preserved as sauerkraut and various kinds of preserved berries, apples, and other fruit were used once as a source of vitamin C during the winter (today sauerkraut is very seldom used in Swedish cuisine). Lingonberry jam, still a favourite, may be the most traditional and typical Swedish way to add freshness to sometimes rather heavy food, such as steaks and stews. Black currant jelly is often served with wild game such as venison, elk or moose.\nBoth before and after this period, some new Germanic dishes were also brought in by immigrants, such as people related to the Hanseatic League, settling in Stockholm, Visby, and Kalmar. Swedish traders and aristocrats naturally also picked up some food traditions in foreign countries; cabbage rolls (\"k\u00e5ldolmar\") being one example. An of \"k\u00e5ldolmar\" was first published in 1765 in the fourth edition of \"Hjelpreda i Hush\u00e5llningen f\u00f6r Unga Fruentimber\" by Cajsa Warg.\nHusmanskost.\nSwedish \"husmanskost\" denotes traditional Swedish dishes with local ingredients, the classical everyday Swedish cuisine. The word \"husmanskost\" stems from \"husman\", meaning 'house owner', and the term was originally used for most kinds of simple countryside food outside of towns. Genuine Swedish \"husmanskost\" used predominantly local ingredients such as pork in all forms, fish, cereals, milk, potato, root vegetables, cabbage, onions, apples, berries etc.; beef and lamb were used more sparingly. Beside berries and pears, apples are the most used traditional fruit, eaten fresh or served as apple pie, apple sauce, or apple cake. Time-consuming cooking methods such as \"redningar\" (roux) and \"l\u00e5ngkok\" (literally 'long boil') are commonly employed and spices are sparingly used. Examples of Swedish husmanskost are pea soup (\"\u00e4rtsoppa\"), boiled and mashed carrots, potato and rutabaga served with pork (\"rotmos med fl\u00e4sk\"), many varieties of salmon (such as \"gravlax\", \"inkokt lax\", fried, pickled), varieties of herring (most commonly pickled, but also fried, \"au gratin\", etc.), fishballs (\"fiskbullar\"), meatballs (\"k\u00f6ttbullar\"), potato dumplings with meat or other ingredients (\"palt\"), potato pancake (\"raggmunk\"), varieties of porridge (\"gr\u00f6t\"), a fried mix of pieces of potato, different kind of meats, sausages, bacon and onion (\"pytt i panna\"), meat stew with onion (\"kalops\"), and potato dumplings with a filling of onions and pork (\"kroppkakor\"). Many of the dishes would be considered comfort food for the nostalgic value.\nDishes akin to Swedish \"husmanskost\" and food traditions are found also in other Scandinavian countries; details may vary.\nSweden is part of the vodka belt and historically distilled beverages, such as \"br\u00e4nnvin\" and snaps, have been a traditional daily complement to food.\nConsumption of wine in Sweden has increased during the last fifty years, partly at the expense of beer and stronger alcoholic beverages.\n\"Husmanskost\" has undergone a renaissance during the last decades as well known (or famous) Swedish chefs, such as Tore Wretman, have presented modernised variants of classical Swedish dishes. In this \"nouvel husman\" the amount of fat (which was needed to sustain hard manual labour in the old days) is reduced and some new ingredients are introduced. The cooking methods are tinkered with as well, in order to speed up the cooking process or enhance the nutritional value or flavour of the dishes. Many Swedish restaurateurs mix traditional \"husmanskost\" with a modern, gourmet approach.\nDishes.\nSwedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, others perhaps a century or less, are still a very important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes.\nInternationally, the most renowned Swedish culinary tradition is the \"sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" and, at Christmas, the \"julbord\", including well-known Swedish dishes such as \"gravlax\" and meatballs.\nIn Sweden, traditionally, Thursday has been \"soup day\" because the maids had half the day off and soup was easy to prepare in advance. One of the most traditional Swedish soups, \"\u00e4rtsoppa\", is still served in many restaurants and households every Thursday, a tradition since the Middle Ages. \"\u00c4rtsoppa\" is a yellow pea soup, commonly served with pancakes as dessert. This is a simple meal, a very thick soup, basically consisting of boiled yellow peas, a little onion, salt and small pieces of pork. It is often served with mustard and followed by a dessert of thin pancakes (\"pannkakor\"). The Swedish Armed Forces also serve their conscripts pea soup and pancakes every Thursday.\nPotatoes are eaten year-round as the main source of carbohydrates, and are a staple in many traditional dishes. Not until the last 50 years have pasta or rice become common on the dinner table.\nThere are several different kinds of potatoes; the most appreciated is the \"new potato\", a potato which ripens in early summer and is enjoyed at the traditional midsummer feast. New potatoes at midsummer are served with pickled herring, chives, and sour cream, and the first strawberries of the year are traditionally served as dessert.\nThe most highly regarded mushroom in Sweden is the chanterelle, which is considered a delicacy. The chanterelle is usually served as a side dish together with steaks, or fried with onions and sauce served on an open sandwich. Second to the chanterelle, and considered almost as delicious, is the porcini mushroom, or \"karljohansvamp\", named after Charles XIV John (Karl XIV Johan) who introduced its use as food.\nIn August, at the traditional feast known as \"kr\u00e4ftskiva\", crayfish party, Swedes eat large amounts of crayfish, boiled and then marinated in a broth with salt, a little bit of sugar, and a large amount of dill umbels (\"krondill\", lit. \"crown dill\").\nMeals.\nMeals consists of breakfast in the morning (\"frukost\"), a light lunch before noon (\"lunch\"), and a heavy dinner (\"middag\") around six or seven in the evening. It is also common to have a snack, often a sandwich or fruit, in between meals (\"mellanm\u00e5l\"). Most Swedes also have a coffee break in the afternoon, often together with a pastry (\"fika\"). In all primary schools, and most, but not all secondary schools, a hot meal is served at lunch as part of Sweden's welfare state. According to Swedish school law, this meal has to be nutrient-dense.\nBreakfast.\nBreakfast usually consists of open sandwiches (\"sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s\"), possibly on crisp bread (\"kn\u00e4ckebr\u00f6d\"). The sandwich is most often buttered, with toppings such as hard cheese, cold cuts, caviar, \"messm\u00f6r\" (a Norwegian sweet spread made from butter and whey), ham (\"skinka\"), and tomatoes or cucumber. \"Filmj\u00f6lk\" (fermented milk/buttermilk), or sometimes yogurt, is also traditional breakfast food, usually served in a bowl with cereals such as cornflakes. Muesli, or porridge (\"gr\u00f6t\") is sometimes eaten at breakfast, made of oatmeal or cream of wheat, eaten with milk and jam or cinnamon with sugar. Common drinks for breakfast are milk, juice, tea, or coffee. Swedes are among the most avid milk and coffee drinkers in the world.\nSwedes sometimes have sweet toppings on their breads, such as jam (like the French and Americans), or chocolate (like the Danes), although many older Swedes choose not to use these sweet toppings. However, orange marmalade on white bread is common, usually with morning coffee or tea.\nMany traditional kinds of Swedish bread, such as \"sirapslimpa\" (less fashionable today, but still very popular) are somewhat sweetened in themselves, baked with small amounts of syrup. Like in many other European countries, there are also many non-sweetened breads, often made with sourdough (\"surdeg\"). Swedish breads may be made from wholegrain, fine grain, or anything in between, and there are white, brown, and very dark (like in Finland) varieties which are all common. \"Barkis\" or \"bergis\" is a localised version of \"challah\" usually made without eggs and at first only available in Stockholm and G\u00f6teborg where Jews first settled but now available elsewhere.\nSeafood.\nFish and other seafood are an important part of Swedish cuisine. Farmed salmon from Norway has become increasingly popular. Pickled, sweetened herring, \"inlagd sill\", is a traditional Swedish appetizer. Shrimp and lobster are specialties of the Skagerrak coast. \"Surstr\u00f6mming\" is a fermented Baltic herring famous for its pungent aroma, both loved and hated. Crayfish, boiled in salted water with dill, are a late summer Swedish delicacy.\nDesserts.\nCommon desserts include:\nPastries and treats.\nKaffebr\u00f6d (coffee bread).\n\"Bakelser\" and other types of \"kaffebr\u00f6d\" (or more colloquially \"fikabr\u00f6d\") are various forms of pastries, cake, cookies, and buns that are usually consumed with coffee (see \"fika\"). Popular kinds of \"kaffebr\u00f6d\" available in a traditional Swedish \"konditori\" (coffee shop / p\u00e2tisserie) include:\nTreats.\nDuring the winter holidays, traditional candy and pastries include:\nOther typical Swedish candy includes:\nDrinks.\nSweden is in second place among the heaviest coffee-drinking countries in the world. Milk consumption in Sweden is also very high, second only to Finland. Milk is bought in milk cartons; Tetra Pak, the world's largest maker of milk cartons, was founded in Sweden. Milk is considered the standard drink to have with meals during weekdays in many families, for both children and adults. Cordial is very common in Sweden. In the early summer elder flower cordial, and less commonly lilac cordial, are made. In the late summer other cordials, such as black currant cordial, are made.\nLiquor.\nThe production of liquor has a tradition dating back to the 18th century and was at a high in the 1840s. Since the 1880s, the state-owned has a monopoly on selling spirits with more than 3.5% ABV, limiting access. \"Hembr\u00e4nt\" (moonshine) used to be made in rural Sweden, but production has lessened in recent years due to more liberal rules for the import of alcohol as well as increased smuggling.\n\"Punsch\" is a traditional liqueur in Sweden that was immensely popular during the 19th century. It was adopted as the drink of choice by university students, and many traditional songs from that time are about the consumption of \"punsch\" or are meant to be sung during the collective festivities that were part of the cultural life in the universities' student associations at the time and still is.\nBeer.\nBeer is also widely consumed in Sweden and the typical Swedish beer is lager of a bright and malty kind. The brands Pripps Bl\u00e5 and Norrlands Guld are common examples. In the last few decades, many small breweries (\"microbreweries\") have emerged all over Sweden offering a wide range of styles and brands. Nils Oscar Brewery, Dugges Ale och Porterbryggeri and N\u00e4rke Kulturbryggeri are examples of these young Swedish microbreweries. Many microbreweries in Sweden are inspired by the US craft beer movement, brewing American styles or styles commonly associated with American craft breweries, e.g. American Pale Ale and American IPA.\nFood and society.\nBr\u00f6dinstitutet ('The Bread Institute') once campaigned with a quotation from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, recommending eating six to eight slices of bread daily. Drinking milk has also been recommended and campaigned for by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare; it is often recommended to drink two to three glasses of milk per day. A survey conducted on behalf of Mj\u00f6lkfr\u00e4mjandet, an organisation promoting consumption of Swedish milk, concluded that 52% of Swedes surveyed drink milk at least once a day, usually one glass with lunch and another glass or two in the evening or morning.\nLow-fat products, wholemeal bread and other alternatives are common; grocery stores usually sell milk in four or five different fat levels, from 3% to 0.1%.\nAccording to various personal accounts, many Swedish families previously considered it inappropriate to feed children from another family. Visiting children could be asked to leave at dinnertime or to wait in another room, or the host family would call the visitor's parents and ask for permission. However, this norm seems to have faded by the 1990s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"submachine gun\" was coined by John T. Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun, to describe its design concept as an automatic firearm with notably less firepower than a machine gun (hence the prefix \"sub-\"). As a machine gun must fire rifle cartridges to be classified as such, submachine guns are not considered machine guns.\nIn the 20th century, the submachine gun was developed during World War I (1914\u20131918) as a close quarter offensive weapon, mainly for trench raiding. At its peak during World War II (1939\u20131945), millions of submachine guns were made for assault troops and auxiliaries whose doctrines emphasized close-quarter suppressive fire. New submachine gun designs appeared frequently during the Cold War, especially among special forces, commandos and mechanized infantrymen. Submachine gun usage for frontline combat decreased in the 1980s and 1990s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName.\nThere are some inconsistencies in the classification of submachine guns. British Commonwealth sources often refer to SMGs as \"machine carbines\". Other sources refer to SMGs as \"machine pistols\" because they fire pistol-caliber ammunition, for example, the MP-40 and MP5, where \"MP\" stands for \"Maschinenpistole\" (\"submachine gun\" in German, but cognate with the English term \"machine pistol\"). However, the term \"machine pistol\" is also used to describe a handgun-style firearm capable of fully automatic or burst fire, such as the Stechkin, Beretta 93R, Glock 18, and the H&amp;K VP70. Furthermore, personal defense weapons such as the FN P90 and H&amp;K MP7 are a subset of submachine guns.\nHistory.\nIn 1895, Hiram Maxim produced the 'miniature Maxim' which was a pistol-calibre Maxim machinegun weighing that was sold in small quantities to various countries and tested by the US military but not adopted. In 1896, a select-fire pistol was patented by the British inventor Hugh Gabbett-Fairfax.\nIn April 1914, Abiel Bethel Revelli, an Italian military officer, patented a twin-barreled, magazine-fed automatic gun in a pistol caliber, lighter than a machine gun and shorter than a rifle. A common myth is that this weapon was originally designed as an aircraft gun. In reality ground use was taken into consideration from the very beginning, particularly for the Bersaglieri's cyclist battalions.\n20th Century.\nWorld Wars.\nWorld War I.\nStocked pistols were common at the beginning of the 20th century, the Germans initially using heavier versions of the P08 pistol equipped with a detachable stock, larger-capacity snail-drum magazine and a longer barrel. \nIn 1915, the Kingdom of Italy adopted Revelli's design as the FIAT Mod. 1915. It fired pistol-caliber 9mm Glisenti ammunition, but was not a true submachine gun, as it was originally designed as a mounted weapon.In late 1915, the first submachine gun with a buttstock was built: the Austro-Hungarian Standsch\u00fctze Hellriegel M1915 although the weapon was never used in combat.\nIn February 1916, the Austro-Hungarian first fielded the M.12/P16 machine pistol. This was the first machine pistol to be adopted by any military, being issued to Tyrolean units fighting in the Alps\nIn 1916, Heinrich Senn of Bern designed a modification of the Swiss Luger pistol to fire in single shots or in full-automatic. Around the same time Georg Luger demonstrated a similar Luger machine pistol which inspired the German Army to develop submachine guns.\nColonel Bethel-Abiel Revelli had already conceived the principles of the submachine gun in September 1915, when he wrote that his gun could be converted to a single-barreled version that \"may be mounted in the manner of a rifle so that it may be fired from the shoulder\". The FIAT Mod. 1915 would be later modified into the OVP 1918 automatic carbine. The OVP 1918 had a traditional wooden stock, a 25-round top-fed box magazine, and had a cyclic rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute.\nBy 1918, Bergmann Waffenfabrik had developed the 9x19mm Parabellum MP 18, the first practical submachine gun. This weapon used the same 32-round snail-drum magazine as the Luger P-08. The MP 18 was used in significant numbers by German stormtroopers employing infiltration tactics, achieving some notable successes in the final year of the war. However, these were not enough to prevent Germany's collapse in November 1918. After World War I, the MP 18 evolved into the MP28/II SMG, which incorporated a simple 32-round box magazine, selective fire, and other minor improvements. Though the MP18 had a rather short service life, it was influential in the design of later submachine guns, such as the Lanchester, Sten and PPD-40.\nThe .45 ACP Thompson submachine gun had been in development at approximately the same time as the Bergmann and the Beretta. However, the war ended before prototypes could be shipped to Europe. Although it had missed its chance to be the first purpose-designed submachine gun to enter service, it became the basis for later weapons, and was much more successful than the submachine guns produced during World War I.\nInterwar period.\nThe Thompson entered production as the M1921. It was available to civilians, but, because of the weapon's high price, initially saw poor sales. The Thompson (with one Type XX 20 round \"stick\" magazine) had been priced at $200 in 1921 (roughly ). The Thompson was used in combat that same year:\nWest Virginia state police bought 37 guns and used them during the Battle of Blair Mountain. Some of the first batches of Thompsons were bought by agents of the Irish Republican Army. They purchased a total of 653 units, though U.S. customs authorities in New York seized 495 of the units in June 1921.\nThe Thompson, nicknamed \"Tommy Gun\" or \"Chicago Typewriter\" became notorious in the U.S. due to its employment by the Mafia: the image of pinstripe-suited James Cagney types wielding drum-magazine Thompsons caused some military planners to shun the weapon. However, the FBI and other U.S. police forces themselves showed no reluctance to use and prominently display these weapons. Eventually, the submachine gun was gradually accepted by many military organizations, especially as World War II loomed, with many countries developing their own designs. The U.S. Marine Corps adopted the Thompson during this period and used them during the Banana Wars in Central America. The gun was also used by the China Marines.\nDuring the 1924 uprising in Estonia, the Soviets supplied four Thompsons to Estonian Communist militants; those were used against Estonian soldiers in a failed attempt to storm the Tallinn barracks. Some of the defenders were armed with the MP18s; and this was possibly the first engagement where submachine guns were used on both sides.\nGermany transferred its MP 18s to the German police forces after World War I. They also saw use in the hands of various paramilitary \"Freikorps\" during the aftermath of the German Revolution. In the 1920s a new, more reliable box magazine was developed for the MP 18 to replace the older snail-drum magazines. In 1928 a new version of the MP 18, the MP 28, saw the light of day, it featured the new box magazine as standard, a bayonet lug and a single shot mode. The MP 28 was manufactured in Belgium and Spain and was widely exported from there, including to China and South America. Another variant based on the MP 18 was the MP 34 that was manufactured by the Germans through the Swiss front company Solothurn. The MP 34 was manufactured from the very best materials available and finished to the highest possible standard. Consequently, its production costs were extremely high. It was adopted by the Austrian police and army in the 1930s, and they were taken over by the Germans after German annexation of Austria in 1938. The MP35 was another interwar German submachine gun, designed by the Bergmann brothers. It was exported to Sweden and Ethiopia and also saw extensive use in the Spanish Civil War. About 40,000 of the type were manufactured until 1944, with many going into the hands of the Waffen-SS. The Erma EMP was yet another submachine gun from this period, based on a design by Heinrich Vollmer, about 10,000 were manufactured. It was exported to Spain, Mexico, China and Yugoslavia, but also used domestically by the SS, as well as being produced under license in Francoist Spain.\nWorld War II.\nChanges in design accelerated during the war, with one major trend being the abandonment of complex and finely made pre-war designs like the Thompson submachine gun to weapons designed for cheap mass production and easy replacement like the M3 Grease Gun.\nWhile the Italians were among the first to develop submachine guns during World War I, they were slow to produce them under Mussolini; the 9mm Parabellum Beretta Model 38 (MAB 38) was not available in large numbers until 1943. The MAB 38 was made in a series of improved and simplified models all sharing the same basic layout. The MAB 38 has two triggers, the front for semi-auto and rear for full-auto. Most models use standard wooden stocks, although some models were fitted with an MP40-style under-folding stock and are commonly mistaken for it. The MAB 38 series was extremely robust and proved very popular with both Axis and Allied troops (who used captured MAB 38s). It is considered the most successful and effective Italian small arm of World War II. During the later years of the war, the TZ-45 submachine gun was manufactured in small numbers in the Italian Social Republic. A cheaper alternative to the MAB 38, it also sported an unusual grip safety.\nIn 1939, the Germans introduced the 9mm Parabellum MP38 which was first used during the invasion of Poland of September that year. The MP38 production was still just starting and only a few thousand were in service at the time. It proved to be far more practical and effective in close-quarters combat than the standard-issue German Karabiner 98k bolt-action rifle. From this experience, the simplified and modernized MP 40 (commonly and erroneously referred to as the Schmeisser) was developed and made in large numbers; about a million were made during World War II. The MP40 was lighter than the MP38. It also used more stamped parts, making it faster and cheaper to produce. The MP38 and MP40 were the first SMGs to use plastic furniture and a practical folding stock, which became standard for all future SMG designs. The Germans used a large number of captured Soviet PPSh-41 submachine guns, some were converted to fire 9mm Parabellum while others were used unmodified (the German 7.63\u00d725mm Mauser cartridge had identical dimensions to the 7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev, albeit slightly less powerful).\nDuring the Winter War, the badly outnumbered Finnish used the Suomi KP/-31 in large numbers against the Russians with devastating effect. Finnish ski troops became known for appearing out of the woods on one side of a road, raking Soviet columns with SMG fire and disappearing back into the woods on the other side. During the Continuation War, the Finnish Sissi patrols often equipped every soldier with KP/-31s. The Suomi fired 9mm Parabellum ammunition from a 71-round drum magazine (although often loaded with 74 rounds). \"This SMG showed the world the importance of the submachine gun in modern warfare\", prompting the development, adoption and mass production of submachine guns by most of the world's armies. The Suomi was used in combat until the end of the Lapland War, was widely exported and remained in service to the late 1970s. Inspired by captured examples of the Soviet PPS submachine gun, a gun that was cheaper and quicker to manufacture than the Suomi, the Finns introduced the KP m/44 submachine gun in 1944.\nIn 1940, the Soviets introduced the 7.62\u00d725mm PPD-40 and later the more easily manufactured PPSh-41 in response to their experience during the Winter War against Finland. The PPSh's 71-round drum magazine is a copy of the Suomi's. Later in the war they developed the even more readily mass-produced PPS submachine gun - all firing the same small-caliber but high-powered Tokarev cartridges. The USSR went on to make over 6 million PPSh-41s and 2 million PPS-43s by the end of World War II. Thus, the Soviet Union could field huge numbers of submachine guns against the Wehrmacht, with whole infantry battalions being armed with little else. Even in the hands of conscripts with minimal training, the volume of fire produced by massed submachine guns could be overwhelming.\nBritain entered the war with no domestic submachine gun design but instead imported the expensive US M1928 Thompson. After evaluating their battlefield experience in the Battle of France and losing many weapons in the Dunkirk evacuation, the Royal Navy adopted the 9mm Parabellum Lanchester submachine gun. With no time for the usual research and development for a new weapon, it was decided to make a direct copy of the German MP 28. Like other early submachine guns it was difficult and expensive to manufacture. Shortly thereafter, the simpler Sten submachine gun was developed for general use by the British armed forces, it was much cheaper and faster to make. Over 4 million Sten guns were made during World War II. The Sten was so cheap and easy to produce that towards the end of the war as their economic base approached crisis, Germany started manufacturing their own copy, the MP 3008. After the war, the British replaced the Sten with the Sterling submachine gun.\nThe United States and its allies used the Thompson submachine gun, especially the simplified M1. The Thompson was still expensive and slow to produce. Therefore, the U.S. developed the M3 submachine gun or \"Grease Gun\" in 1942, followed by the improved M3A1 in 1944. While the M3 was no more effective than the Tommy Gun, it was made primarily of stamped parts and welded together and could be produced much faster and at a fraction of the cost of a Thompson; its much lower rate of fire made it a lot more controllable. It could be configured to fire either .45 ACP or 9mm Luger ammunition. The M3A1 was among the longest-serving submachine gun designs, being produced into the 1960s and serving in US forces into the 1990s.\nFrance produced only about 2,000 of the MAS-38 submachine gun (chambered in 7.65\u00d720mm Longue) before the Fall of France in June 1940. Production was taken over by the occupying Germans, who used them for themselves and also put them into the hands of the Vichy French.\nThe Owen gun is a 9mm Parabellum Australian submachine gun designed by Evelyn Owen in 1939. The Owen is a simple, highly reliable, open bolt, blowback SMG. It was designed to be fired either from the shoulder or the hip. It is easily recognisable, owing to its unconventional appearance, including a quick-release barrel and butt-stock, double pistol grips, top-mounted magazine, and unusual offset right-side-mounted sights. The Owen was the only entirely Australian-designed and constructed service submachine gun of World War II and was used by the Australian Army from 1943 until the mid-1960s, when it was replaced by the F1 submachine gun. Only about 45,000 Owens were produced during the war for a unit cost of about A$30.\nWhile most other countries during World War II developed submachine guns, the Empire of Japan had only produced one, the Type 100 submachine gun, based heavily on the German MP28. Like most other small arms created in Imperial Japan, the Type 100 could be fitted with the Type 30 bayonet. It used the 8\u00d722mm Nambu cartridge, which was about half as powerful as a standard Western 9mm Parabellum round. Production of the gun was even more inadequate: by the war's end, Japan had only manufactured about 7,500 of the Type 100, whereas Germany, America, and other countries in the war had produced well over a million of their own SMG designs.\nThe German military concluded that most firefights took place at ranges of no more than ~. They therefore sought to develop a new class of weapon that would combine the high volume of fire of the submachine gun with an intermediate cartridge that enabled the shooter to place accurate shots at medium ranges (beyond that of the range of the typical submachine gun). After a false start with the FG 42, this led to the development of the select-fire assault rifle (assault rifle or storm rifle is a translation of the German ). In the years following the war, this new format began to replace the submachine gun in military use to a large extent. Based on the StG44, the Soviet Union created the AK-47, which is to date the world's most produced firearm, with over 100 million made.\nPost\u2013World War II.\nAfter World War II, \"new submachine gun designs appeared almost every week to replace the admittedly rough and ready designs which had appeared during the war. Some (the better ones) survived, most rarely got past the glossy brochure stage.\" Most of these survivors were cheaper, easier, and faster to make than their predecessors. As such, they were widely distributed.\nIn 1945, Sweden introduced the 9 mm Parabellum Carl Gustaf m/45 with a design borrowing from and improving on many design elements of earlier submachine-gun designs. It has a tubular stamped steel receiver with a side folding stock. The m/45 was widely exported and especially popular with CIA operatives and U.S. special forces during the Vietnam War. In U.S. service it was known as the \"Swedish-K\". In 1966, the Swedish government blocked the sale of firearms to the United States because it opposed the Vietnam War. As a result, in the following year Smith &amp; Wesson began to manufacture an m/45 clone called the M76. The m/45 was used in combat by Swedish troops as part of the United Nations Operation in the Congo, during the Congo Crisis during the early 1960s. Battlefield reports of the lack of penetrative power of the 9mm Parabellum during this operation led to Sweden developing a more powerful 9 mm round designated \"9mm m/39B\".\nIn 1946, Denmark introduced the Madsen M-46 and, in 1950, an improved model, the Madsen M-50. These 9 mm Parabellum stamped steel SMGs featured a unique clamshell type design, a side-folding stock, and a grip safety on the magazine housing. The Madsen was widely exported and especially popular in Latin America, with variants made by several countries.\nIn 1948, Czechoslovakia introduced the Sa vz. 23 series. This 9 mm Parabellum SMG introduced several innovations: a progressive trigger for selecting between semi-automatic and full auto fire, a telescoping bolt that extends forward wrapping around the barrel, and a vertical handgrip housing the magazine and trigger mechanism. The vz. 23 series was widely exported and especially popular in Africa and the Middle East with variants made by several countries. The vz. 23 inspired the development of the Uzi submachine gun.\nIn 1949, France introduced the MAT-49 to replace the hodgepodge of French, American, British, German, and Italian SMGs in French service after World War II. The 9 mm Parabellum MAT-49 is an inexpensive stamped-steel SMG with a telescoping wire stock, a pronounced folding magazine housing, and a grip safety. This \"wildebeast-like design\" proved to be an extremely reliable and effective SMG and was used by the French well into the 1980s. It was also widely exported to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.\nCold War.\n1950s.\nIn 1954, Israel introduced a 9mm Parabellum open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine gun called the Uzi (after its designer Uziel Gal). The Uzi was one of the first weapons to use a telescoping bolt design with the magazine housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon. The Uzi has become the most popular submachine gun in the world, with over 10 million units sold, more than any other submachine gun.\nIn 1959, Beretta introduced the Model 12. This 9mm Parabellum submachine gun was a complete break with previous Beretta designs. It is a small, compact, very well made SMG and among the first to use a telescoping bolt design. The M12 was designed for mass production and was made largely of stamped steel and welded together. It is identified by its tubular shape receiver, double pistol grips, a side folding stock and the magazine housed in front of the trigger guard. The M12 uses the same magazines as the Model 38 series.\nSubmachine guns in the Korean War.\nSubmachine guns again proved to be an important weapon system in the Korean War (25 June 1950 \u2013 27 July 1953). The Korean People's Army (KPA) and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) fighting in Korea received massive numbers of the PPSh-41, in addition to the North Korean Type 49 and the Chinese Type 50, which were both licensed copies of the PPSh-41 with small mechanical revisions. While lacking the accuracy of the U.S. M1 Garand and M1 carbine, it provided more firepower at short distances and was well-suited to the close-range firefights that typically occurred in that conflict, especially at night. United Nations Command forces in defensive outposts or on patrol often had trouble returning a sufficient volume of fire when attacked by companies of infantry armed with the PPSh. As infantry Captain (later General) Hal Moore stated: \"on full automatic it sprayed a lot of bullets and most of the killing in Korea was done at very close ranges and it was done quickly\u2014a matter of who responded faster. In situations like that it outclassed and outgunned what we had. A close-in patrol fight was over very quickly and usually we lost because of it.\" U.S. servicemen, however, felt that their M2 carbines were superior to the PPSh-41 at the typical engagement range of 100\u2013150 meters.\nOther older designs also saw use in the Korean War. The Thompson had seen much use by the U.S. and South Korean militaries, even though the Thompson had been replaced as standard-issue by the M3/M3A1. With huge numbers of guns available in army ordnance arsenals, the Thompson remained classed as \"limited standard\" or \"substitute standard\" long after the standardization of the M3/M3A1. Many Thompsons were distributed to the US-backed Nationalist Chinese armed forces as military aid before the fall of Chiang Kai-shek's government to Mao Zedong's communist forces at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. (Thompsons had already been widely used throughout China since the 1920s, at a time when several Chinese warlords and their military factions running various parts of the fragmented country made purchases of the weapon and then subsequently produced many local copies.) US troops were surprised to encounter communist Chinese troops armed with Thompsons (among other captured US-made Nationalist Chinese and American firearms), especially during unexpected night assaults, which became a prominent Chinese combat tactic in the conflict. The gun's ability to deliver large quantities of short-range automatic assault fire proved very useful in both defense and assault during the early part of the war when it was constantly mobile and shifting back and forth. Many Chinese Thompsons were captured and placed into service with American soldiers and marines for the remaining period of the war.\n1960s.\nIn the 1960s, Heckler &amp; Koch developed the 9mm Parabellum MP5 submachine gun. The MP5 is based on the G3 rifle and uses the same closed-bolt roller-delayed blowback operation system. This makes the MP5 more accurate than open-bolt SMGs, such as the Uzi. The MP5 is one of the most widely used submachine guns in the world, having been adopted by over 40 nations and numerous military, law enforcement, and security organizations.\nIn 1969, Steyr introduced the MPi 69, which is similar in appearance to the Uzi SMG. The MPi 69's receiver is a squared stamped steel tube that partly nestles inside a large plastic molding (resembling a lower receiver) which contains the forward hand-grip, vertical pistol-grip and the fire control group, making the MPi 69 one of the first firearms to use plastic construction in this way.\n1970s.\nIn the 1970s, extremely compact submachine guns, such as the .45 ACP MAC-10 and .380 ACP MAC-11, were developed to be used with silencers or suppressors. While these SMGs received enormous publicity, and were prominently displayed in films and television, they were not widely adopted by military or law enforcement agencies. \n1980s.\nBy the 1980s, the demand for new submachine guns was very low and could be easily met by existing makers with existing designs. However, following H&amp;K's lead, other manufacturers began designing submachine guns based on their existing assault rifle patterns. These new SMGs offered a high degree of parts commonality with parent weapons, thereby easing logistical concerns.\nIn 1982, Colt introduced the Colt 9mm SMG based on the M16 rifle. The Colt SMG is a closed bolt, blowback operated SMG and the overall aesthetics are identical to most M16 type rifles. The magazine well is modified using a special adapter to allow the use of the smaller 9mm magazines. The magazines themselves are a copy of the Israeli Uzi SMG magazine, modified to fit the Colt and lock the bolt back after the last shot. The Colt was widely used by US law enforcement and the USMC.\n1990s.\nIn 1999, H&amp;K introduced the UMP \"Universal Machine Pistol\". The UMP is a 9mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W, or .45 ACP, closed-bolt blowback-operated SMG, based on the H&amp;K G36 assault rifle. It features a predominantly polymer construction and was designed to be a more cost effective, lighter weight, and less complex design alternative to the MP5. The UMP has a side-folding stock and is available with four different trigger group configurations. It was also designed to use a wide range of Picatinny rail mounted accessories \n21st century.\n2000s.\nIn 2004, Izhmash introduced the Vityaz-SN a 9mm Parabellum, closed bolt straight blowback operated submachine gun. It is based on the AK-74 rifle and offers a high degree of parts commonality with the AK-74. It is the standard submachine gun for all branches of Russian military and police forces.\nIn 2009, KRISS USA introduced the KRISS Vector family of submachine guns. Futuristic in appearance, the KRISS uses an unconventional delayed blowback system combined with in-line design to reduce perceived recoil and muzzle climb. The KRISS comes in 9mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W, .45 ACP, 9\u00d721mm, 10mm Auto, and .357 SIG. It also uses standard Glock pistol magazines.\n2010s.\nBy the early 2010s, compact assault rifles and personal defense weapons had replaced submachine guns in most roles. Factors such as the increasing use of body armor and logistical concerns have combined to limit the appeal of submachine guns. However, SMGs are still used by police (especially SWAT teams) for dealing with heavily armed suspects and by military special forces units for close-quarters combat, due to their reduced size, recoil and muzzle blast, and capability for sound suppression. Submachine gun designs adopted during this period include the Br\u00fcgger &amp; Thomet APC and SIG MPX.\nAdjacent weapon developments.\nLand defense pistol.\nDuring the Apartheid era of South Africa and the Rhodesian Bush War/South African Border War, a semi-automatic only pistol calibre carbine based on submachine guns existed for civilian personal protection as \"Land Defence Pistol\"s (LDP). Known examples were the Bell &amp; White 84, BHS Rhogun, Cobra Mk1, GM-16, Kommando LDP, Northwood R-76, Paramax, Sanna 77 and TS III.\nPersonal defense weapons.\nFirst developed during the 1980s, personal defense weapons (PDWs) were created in response to a NATO request for a replacement for 9\u00d719mm Parabellum submachine guns. PDWs are compact automatic weapons that are sufficiently light to be issued to non-combat arms or support troops, particularly those in vehicles, while being capable of greater range and terminal ballistics than a handgun. As a result of these characteristics, most PDWs can be used as close quarters battle weapons for special forces and counter-terrorist groups. \nIntroduced in 1991, the FN P90 features an unusual appearance, having a 50-round magazine housed horizontally above the barrel, an integrated reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls. A simple blowback automatic weapon, it was designed to fire the proprietary FN 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge which can penetrate soft body armor. The FN P90 was designed to have a length no greater than an average-sized man's shoulder width, to allow it to be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an infantry fighting vehicle. The FN P90 is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28492", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28492", "title": "Squirrel", "text": "Family of rodents\nSquirrels are members of the family Sciuridae (), a family that includes small or medium-sized rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels (including chipmunks and prairie dogs, among others), and flying squirrels. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia. The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain beaver and dormice.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"squirrel\", first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman which is from the Old French , the reflex of a Latin word , which was taken from the Ancient Greek word (; from ('shade') and ('tail')), referring to the long bushy tail which many of its members have. \"Sciurus\" is also the name of one of its genuses.\nThe Old English word for the squirrel, , survived into Middle English as before being replaced. The Old English word is of Common Germanic origin, cognates of which are still used in other Germanic languages, including the German (diminutive of , which is not as frequently used); the Norwegian /; the Dutch ; the Swedish and the Danish .\nA group of squirrels is called a \"dray\" or a \"scurry\".\nCharacteristics.\nSquirrels are generally small animals, ranging in size from the African pygmy squirrel and least pygmy squirrel at in total length and just in weight, to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at up to in total length, and several marmot species, which can weigh or more. Squirrels typically have slender bodies with long, bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is soft and silky, though much thicker in some species than others. The coat color of squirrels is highly variable between\u2014and often even within\u2014species.\nIn most squirrel species, the hind limbs are longer than the forelimbs, while all species have either four or five toes on each foot. The feet, which include an often poorly developed thumb, have soft pads on the undersides and versatile, sturdy claws for grasping and climbing. Tree squirrels, unlike most mammals, can descend a tree headfirst. They do so by rotating their ankles 180 degrees, enabling the hind feet to point backward and thus grip the tree bark from the opposite direction.\nHead.\nAs their large eyes indicate, squirrels have excellent vision, which is especially important for the tree-dwelling species. Many also have a good sense of touch, with vibrissae on their limbs as well as their heads.\nThe teeth of sciurids follow the typical rodent pattern, with large incisors (for gnawing) that grow throughout life, and cheek teeth (for grinding) that are set back behind a wide gap, or diastema. The typical dental formula for sciurids is 1.0.1.31.0.1.3.\nTail.\nThe purposes of squirrels' tails, to benefit the squirrel, include:\nThe hairs from squirrel tails are prized in fly fishing when tying fishing flies. Squirrel hair is very fine, making it better for tying fishing flies.\nWhen the squirrel sits upright, its tail folded up its back may stop predators looking from behind from seeing the characteristic shape of a small mammal.\nLifetime.\nSquirrels live in almost every habitat, from tropical rainforest to semiarid desert, avoiding only the high polar regions and the driest of deserts. They are predominantly herbivorous, subsisting on seeds and nuts, but many will eat insects and even small vertebrates.\nMany juvenile squirrels die in the first year of life. Adult squirrels can have a lifespan of 5 to 10 years in the wild. Some can survive 10 to 20 years in captivity. Premature death may occur when a nest falls from the tree, in which case the mother may abandon her young if their body temperature is not correct. Many such baby squirrels have been rescued and fostered by a professional wildlife rehabilitator until they could be safely returned to the wild, although the density of squirrel populations in many places and the constant care required by premature squirrels means that few rehabilitators are willing to spend their time doing this and such animals are routinely euthanized instead.\nBehavior.\nSquirrels mate either once or twice a year and, following a gestation period of three to six weeks, give birth to a number of offspring that varies by species. The young are altricial, being born naked, toothless, and blind. In most species of squirrel, the female alone looks after the young, which are weaned at six to ten weeks and become sexually mature by the end of their first year. In general, the ground-dwelling squirrel species are social, often living in well-developed colonies, while the tree-dwelling species are more solitary.\nGround squirrels and tree squirrels are usually either diurnal or crepuscular, while the flying squirrels tend to be nocturnal\u2014except for lactating flying squirrels and their young, which have a period of diurnality during the summer.\nDuring hot periods, squirrels have been documented to sploot, or lay their stomachs down on cool surfaces.\nSquirrels, like other rodents, employ species-specific strategies to store food, buffering against periods of scarcity. In temperate regions, squirrels commonly cache nuts beneath leaf litter, inside hollow trees, or underground. However, in subtropical and humid environments, traditional caching can lead to mold growth, decomposition, or premature germination. To counteract these challenges, some squirrels, particularly in subtropical zones, hang nuts or mushrooms on tree branches. This behavior, believed to minimize fungal infections and reduce the risk of food loss, also inadvertently aids certain trees, like Cyclobalanopsis, in expanding their range, with forgotten or dislodged nuts sprouting in new locations, influencing forest ecology. Two species of flying squirrel, the particolored flying squirrel and Hainan flying squirrel aid such cacheing by carving grooves into the nuts to fix the nuts tightly between small intersecting twigs, akin to the mortise-tenon joint in carpentry.\nFeeding.\nBecause squirrels cannot digest cellulose, they must rely on foods rich in protein, carbohydrates, and fats. In temperate regions, early spring is the hardest time of year for squirrels because the nuts they buried are beginning to sprout (and thus are no longer available to eat), while many of the usual food sources are not yet available. During these times, squirrels rely heavily on tree buds. Squirrels, being primarily herbivores, eat a wide variety of plants, as well as nuts, seeds, conifer cones, fruits, fungi, and green vegetation. Some squirrels, however, also consume meat, especially when faced with hunger. Squirrels have been known to eat small birds, young snakes, and smaller rodents, as well as bird eggs and insects. Some tropical squirrel species have shifted almost entirely to a diet of insects.\nSquirrels, like pigeons, feral cats, and other fauna, are synanthropes, in that they benefit and thrive from their interaction in human environments. This gradual process of successful interaction is called synurbanization, wherein squirrels lose their inherent fear of humans in an urban environment. When squirrels were almost completely eradicated during the Industrial Revolution in New York, they were later re-introduced to \"entertain and remind\" humans of nature. The squirrel blended into the urban environment so efficiently that when synanthropic behavior stops (e.g. people do not leave trash outside during particularly cold winters), they can become aggressive in their search for food.\nAggression and predatory behavior has been observed in various species of ground squirrels, in particular the thirteen-lined ground squirrel. For example, Bernard Bailey, a scientist in the 1920s, observed a thirteen-lined ground squirrel preying upon a young chicken. Wistrand reported seeing this same species eating a freshly killed snake. Sometimes squirrels prey on an atypical animal: a pack of black squirrels in 2005 killed and ate a large stray dog in Lazo, Russia. Squirrel attacks on humans are exceedingly rare.\nWhitaker examined the stomachs of 139 thirteen-lined ground squirrels and found bird flesh in four of the specimens and the remains of a short-tailed shrew in one; Bradley, examining the stomachs of white-tailed antelope squirrels, found at least 10% of his 609 specimens' stomachs contained some type of vertebrate, mostly lizards and rodents. Morgart observed a white-tailed antelope squirrel capturing and eating a silky pocket mouse.\nTaxonomy.\nThe living squirrels are divided into five subfamilies, with about 58 genera and some 285 species. The oldest squirrel fossil, \"Hesperopetes\", dates back to the Chadronian (late Eocene, about 40\u201335 million years ago) and is similar to modern flying squirrels.\nA variety of fossil squirrels, from the latest Eocene to the Miocene, have not been assigned with certainty to any living lineage. At least some of these probably were variants of the oldest basal \"protosquirrels\" (in the sense that they lacked the full range of living squirrels' autapomorphies). The distribution and diversity of such ancient and ancestral forms suggest the squirrels as a group may have originated in North America.\nApart from these sometimes little-known fossil forms, the phylogeny of the living squirrels is fairly straightforward. The three main lineages are the Ratufinae (Oriental giant squirrels), Sciurillinae and all other subfamilies. The Ratufinae contain a mere handful of living species in tropical Asia. The neotropical pygmy squirrel of tropical South America is the sole living member of the Sciurillinae. The third lineage, by far the largest, has a near-cosmopolitan distribution. This further supports the hypothesis that the common ancestor of all squirrels, living and fossil, lived in North America, as these three most ancient lineages seem to have radiated from there; if squirrels had originated in Eurasia, for example, one would expect quite ancient lineages in Africa, but African squirrels seem to be of more recent origin.\nThe main group of squirrels can be split into five subfamilies: the Callosciurinae, 60 species mostly found in South East Asia; the Ratufinae, 4 cat-sized species found in south and southeast Asia; the Sciurinae, which contains the flying squirrels (Pteromyini) and the tree squirrels, 83 species found worldwide; Sciurillinae, a single South American species; and Xerinae, which includes three tribes of mostly terrestrial squirrels, including the Marmotini (marmots, chipmunks, prairie dogs, and other Holarctic ground squirrels), Xerini (African and some Eurasian ground squirrels), and Protoxerini (African tree squirrels).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Even the acts of launching flame, artillery, darts, harpoons, grenades, rockets, and guided missiles can be considered acts of shooting. When using a firearm, the act of shooting is often called firing as it involves initiating a combustion (deflagration) of chemical propellants.\nShooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field, in shooting sports, hunting, or in combat. The person involved in the shooting activity is called a shooter. A skilled, accurate shooter is a \"marksman\" or \"sharpshooter\", and a person's level of shooting proficiency is referred to as their \"marksmanship\".\nCompetitive shooting.\nShooting has inspired competition, and in several countries rifle clubs started to form in the 19th century. Soon international shooting events evolved, including shooting at the Summer and Winter Olympics (from 1896) and World Championships (from 1897). The International Shooting Sport Federation still administers Olympic and non-Olympic rifle, pistol, shotgun, and running target shooting competitions, although there is also a large number of national and international shooting sports controlled by unrelated organizations.\nShooting technique differs depending on factors like the type of firearm used (from a handgun to a precision rifle); the distance to and nature of the target; the required precision; and the available time. Breathing and position play an important role when handling a handgun or a rifle. Some shooting sports, such as IPSC shooting and biathlon also include movement. The prone position, kneeling position, and standing position offer different amounts of support for the shooter.\nHunting with guns.\nIn the United Kingdom shooting often refers to the activity of hunting game birds such as grouse or pheasants, or small game such as rabbits, with guns. A shooter is sometimes referred to as a \"gun\". Shooting may also refer to the culling of vermin with guns. Clay pigeon shooting is meant to simulate shooting pigeons released from traps after live birds were banned in the United Kingdom in 1921.\nWeapons.\nShooting most often refers to the use of a gun (firearm or air gun), although it can also be used to describe discharging of any ranged weapons like a bow, crossbow, slingshot, or even blowpipe. The term \"weapon\" does not necessarily mean it is used as a combat tool, but as a piece of equipment to help the user best achieve the hit on their intended targets.\nShooting is also used in warfare, self-defense, crime, and law enforcement. Duels were sometimes held using guns. Shooting without a target has applications such as celebratory gunfire, 21-gun salute, or firing starting pistols, incapable of releasing bullets.\nRestrictions.\nIn many countries, there are restrictions on what kind of firearm can be bought and by whom, leading to debate about how effective such measures are and the extent to which they should be applied. For example, attitudes towards guns and shooting in the United States are very different from those in the United Kingdom and Australia.\nShooting positions.\nThe National Rifle Association of America defines four basic \"competition\" or \"field\" shooting positions. In order of steadiness/stability (the closer you get to the ground, the steadier you are), they are prone, sitting, kneeling, and standing (also called \"offhand\").\nHythe positions (Hythe School of Musketry was formed in 1853 to teach the army how to use the rifle in kneeling and standing positions), American and French positions were known variations of the kneeling and standing positions utilised by their respective armies.\nAnother common, but aided, shooting position is the bench shooting position. There are also numerous shooting aids from monopods to tripods to sandbags and complete gun cradles.\nRice paddy squat in rifle shooting.\nThe rice paddy squat (or rice paddy prone) position is a moderately stable position that supports both elbows, which makes it more stable than kneeling but keeps a high level of mobility. Its higher center of gravity is still be stable than sitting or prone. It was a traditionally-taught marksmanship position but lost popularity after the Korean War.\nBack (or supine).\nThe position was sometimes referred to as the Creedmoor position and has a number of variations. It was known in the latter half of the 18th century and later revived by a small number of shooters in the 1860s with the introduction of competitive long range shooting at the NRA rifle meetings. It continued in use into the 20th century for match riflemen. The position was really developed during the 1870s as a consequence of great interest in long-range shooting associated with the international matches. Back position provided the most stable platform for the rifle in those competitions where no artificial support, including slings, was permitted. It was even superior to shooting prone unsupported.\nLying on one's side.\nLying on one's side is not a normally-chosen position but may be a used when reacting to a threat, when may be used behind a barricade to present a very small target since only the gun hand and a piece of one's face are normally exposed, with the rest covered by the barricade.\nLeaning.\nThis position involves a shooter leaning on something like a wall, a tree or post. The rifle barrel should not be rested against it because it is steadier to lean the body. It's usually combined with standing and kneeling positions.\nSlings.\nThe sling is used to create isometric pressure to increase steadiness. While the use of a sling is of questionable value in shooting from the standing position, it is very much worth using from kneeling, sitting, or prone. It is also used in back position, and the sling is then looped around the foot and takes the recoil. Proper use of the sling locks the rifle into the body and enhances that solid foundation so critical to delivering an accurate shot. \nA type of shooting sling. All positions are strengthened through the use of a \"hasty sling\". The formal \"tight sling\" is detached from the rear sling swivel and tightened above the bicep of the supporting arm. Almost any carrying strap can be used in the \"hasty sling\" mode. There is often a compromise between the most comfortable \"carry\" length for shooter's sling and the ideal tension for a \"hasty sling\". The steadiness achieved is almost as good as a \"tight competition sling\", and it is much faster.\nCompetitions.\nIn ISSF shooting events, 3 out of 7 shooting positions are used. Positions not used are supine, sitting, rice paddy squat, and side position.\nWBSF governs benchrest shooting.\nIPSC shooting events use prone, offhand and supported shooting positions.\nThere are some competitions, such as felthurtigskyting, in which shooting position is freestyle. That means that the shooter decides which one of the four positions they'll use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Shooting is the art of using ranged weapons, mainly firearms and airguns, such as handguns, rifles and shotguns, and also bows/crossbows.\nShooting sports can be categorized by equipment, shooting distance, targets, time limits and the degree of athleticism involved. Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competitions, and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members. Due to the noise and high impact energy of the projectiles, which can be lethal, shooting sports are typically conducted at either designated permanent shooting ranges or temporary shooting fields in areas away from human settlements.\nHistory.\nGreat Britain.\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) was founded in 1859 to raise the funds for an annual national rifle meeting \"for the encouragement of Volunteer Rifle Corps and the promotion of Rifle-shooting throughout Great Britain\".\nUnited States.\nTarget shooting was a favorite sport in colonial America, with the New England Puritans regularly testing their shooting skills for recreation and at militia training days. The Scotch Irish settlers on the frontier favored shooting matches sponsored by Tavern keepers. Turkey shoots were popular after harvest time. Contestants would pay an entry fee, and everyone who killed a tethered turkey at 110 yards for muskets or 165 yards for rifles could keep the bird. German gunsmiths in Pennsylvania began to manufacture Flintlock rifles in the 1720s, which became especially popular among hunters because of its long-range accuracy. It could be accurate to 200 yards. Along about 1820, percussion caps, and the locks that ignited them, became available, and nearly all new firearms began to be constructed using this ignition system. Many flintlock firearms were also subsequently converted to the percussion system, which was a relatively simple procedure that could be accomplished by local gunsmiths. Although percussion ignition did not add to the accuracy of the firearm, the time between when the firearm firing mechanism (or \"lock\") started the sequence that lead to the ignition of the propellant in the barrel, was shortened drastically. This made getting smaller shot groups on the target more attainable as the possibility of the firearm moving off the aiming point after the shooter pressed the trigger was lessened. This shortened ignition time, which is referred to as \"lock time\" was (and still is) a very important factor in target shooting. The closed design of the percussion system materially improved reliability of the firearm, especially in rainy or damp conditions. The faster \"lock time\" also made hitting fast-moving aerial targets with a cloud of tiny lead pellets (\"shot\") fired from a smooth-bore firearm a real possibility. Practicing for game hunting by shooting at artificial aerial targets launched from spring-powered launching devices (\"traps\") became highly popular and led to the development of the modern Trap, Skeet, and Sporting Clays shooting sports.\nIn 1831 a sportsman club in Cincinnati Ohio held a competitive shoot at pigeons and quail released from ground traps. German ethnic communities set up athletic clubs and shooting clubs, especially in the Midwestern states In the 1850\u20131917. period Breach loading shotguns introduced in the 1860s, and the knowledge of rifles by Civil War soldiers, made trap shooting popular. However, there was human humanitarian opposition to killing live birds\u2014and the passenger pigeon was dying out\u2014so glass or clay targets were used instead.\nConcerned over poor marksmanship during the American Civil War, veteran Union officers Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association of America in 1871 for the purpose of promoting and encouraging rifle shooting on a \"scientific\" basis. In 1872, with financial help from New York state, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened in 1872, and became the site of the first National Matches until New York politics forced the NRAoA to move the matches to Sea Girt, New Jersey. The popularity of the National Matches soon forced the event to be moved to its present, much larger location: Camp Perry. In 1903, the U.S. Congress created the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice (NBPRP), an advisory board to the Secretary of the Army, with a nearly identical charter to the NRAoA. The NBPRP (now known as the Civilian Marksmanship Program) also participates in the National Matches at Camp Perry.\nIn 1903, the NRA of America began to establish rifle clubs at all major colleges, universities, and military academies. By 1906, youth programs were in full swing with more than 200 boys competing in the National Matches. Today, more than one million youth participate in shooting sports events and affiliated programs through groups such as 4-H, the Boy Scouts of America, the American Legion, U.S. Jaycees, NCAA, The USA High School Clay Target League, the Scholastic Clay Target Program, National Guard Bureau, ROTC, and JROTC.\nOlympics.\nFrench pistol champion and founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin, participated in many of these early competitions. This fact certainly contributed to the inclusion of five shooting events in the 1896 Olympics. Over the years, the events have been changed a number of times in order to keep up with technology and social standards. The targets that formerly resembled humans or animals in their shape and size have are now a circular shape in order to avoid associating the sport with any form of violence. At the same time, some events have been dropped and new ones have been added. The 2004 Olympics featured three shooting disciplines (rifle, pistol, and shotgun) where athletes competed for 51 medals in 10 men's and 7 women's events\u2014slightly fewer than the previous Olympic schedule.\nIn the Olympic Games, the shooting sport has always enjoyed the distinction of awarding the first medals of the Games. Internationally, the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) has oversight of all Olympic shooting events worldwide, while National Governing Bodies (NGBs) administer the sport within each country.\nCompetition disciplines.\nShooting at the Summer Olympics includes fifteen medal events, covering seven disciplines. Medal events are evenly distributed between rifle, pistol and shotgun with five events each. Three Mixed Pairs events were introduced to ensure gender equity between men's and women's events. They replaced 50m Prone Rifle, 50m Free Pistol and Double Trap which were all men-only events.\nGun shooting sports.\nGun shooting sports are shot with either firearms or air guns, which can be handguns, rifles or shotguns.\nHandguns are handheld small arms designed to be shot off-hand without needing a shoulder stock. The two main subtypes of handguns are pistols and revolvers. They are much more convenient to carry in general, but usually have a shorter effective range and less accuracy compared to long guns such as rifles. In shooting sports, revolvers and semi-automatic pistols are the most commonly used.\nA rifle is a long gun with a rifled barrel, and requires the use of both hands to hold and brace against the shoulder via a stock in order to shoot steadily. They generally have a longer range and greater accuracy than handguns, and are popular for hunting. In shooting sports, bolt-action or semi-automatic rifles are the most commonly used.\nA shotgun is similar to a rifle but often smoothbore and larger in caliber, and typically fires either a shell containing many smaller scattering sub-projectiles called shots, or a single large projectile called a slug. In shooting sports, shotguns are more often over/under-type break action or semi-automatic shotguns, and the majority of shotgun events are included in clay pigeon shooting.\nBullseye shooting.\n\"Bullseye shooting\" is a category of pistol and rifle shooting disciplines where the objective is to achieve as many points as possible by hitting a round shooting target as close to the middle as possible with slow precision fire. These disciplines place a large emphasis on precision and accuracy through sight picture, breath and trigger control. Fixed and relatively long time limits give the competitors time to concentrate for a perfect shot. An example of bullseye shooting is the ISSF pistol and rifle disciplines, but there are also many other national and international disciplines which can be classified as bullseye shooting. The shooting distances are typically given in round numbers, such as 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 meters depending on firearm type and discipline. Competitions are usually shot from permanent shooting ranges and with the same target arrangement and distance from match to match. Usually the competitors each have their own shooting target and shoot beside each other simultaneously. Because of the relatively simple match format, beginners are often recommended bullseye shooting in order to learn the fundamentals of marksmanship. Bullseye shooting is part of the Summer Olympic Games, and a considerable amount of training is needed to become proficient.\nField shooting.\nField-Shooting or Terrain-Shooting refer to a set of pistol and rifle shooting disciplines that usually are shot from temporary shooting ranges in outdoor terrain at varying (and sometimes unknown) distances, rather than at permanent shooting ranges at fixed distances.\nClay target.\nClay pigeon shooting are shotgun disciplines shot at flying clay pigeon targets.\nRunning target.\nRunning target shooting refers to a number of disciplines involving a shooting target\u2014sometimes called a boar, moose, or deer\u2014that is made to move as if it is a running animal. Events of this type include:\nMoving target.\nShooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's moving target small-bore rifle\nDisappearing target.\nShooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's disappearing target small-bore rifle\nPractical shooting.\nPractical shooting, also known as action shooting or dynamic shooting, is a generic term applicable to shooting sports where speed is of equal importance as precision. Many of the disciplines involve movement, and when using handguns they are often drawn from a holster.\nLong range.\nLong range shooting is shooting held at such distances that sight adjustment based from judging atmospherical conditions become critical.\nBenchrest.\nBenchrest shooting is concerned with shooting small groups with the rifleman sitting on a chair (bench) and the rifle supported from a table. Of all shooting disciplines, this is the most demanding equipment-wise. Depending on equipment class, international benchrest competitions are governed by either the World Benchrest Shooting Federation or World Rimfire and Air Rifle Benchrest Federation.\nMetallic silhouette.\nMetallic silhouette competitors shoot at animal-shaped steel silhouettes (chickens, pigs, turkeys and rams) that must be knocked down to score. Banks of 5 targets are placed at up to 500 meters, with distance and size of target determined by firearm class. Classes include Handguns, Small Bore Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), High Power Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), air rifle and black powder rifle. Handguns used in the Unlimited Categories are rifle-like in appearance; Thompson Contender, Remington XP-100, and other pistols are chambered in rifle calibers with the power, aerodynamic efficiency, and external ballistics required for precise shooting at 200 meters. There are silhouette categories appropriate for virtually all types of adjustable sight pistols and rifles, only excluding high-velocity armor-piercing rounds that would damage targets. Targets for open sighted guns are placed between 25 and 200 meters, and are designed to provide a usable size of the hit zone of about 1.5 milliradians (or 5 minutes of arc).\nMuzzleloading.\nMuzzleloading are concerned with shooting replica (or antique) guns.\nPara shooting.\nParalympic shooting, also known as \"shooting Para sport\", is an adaptation of shooting sports for competitors with disabilities. Paralympic shooting first appeared in the Summer Paralympics at the 1976 Toronto Games. Para shooting is internationally governed by the International Paralympic Committee. To help establish fair competition, a shooting classification called Para-shooting classification is in place for the Paralympic Games.\nThe events mirror to some extent the shooting events at the Olympic Games. Air Pistol is typically shot from a seated position with the pistol unsupported. The amount of back-support permitted is determined by the athlete's level of disability. The Air Rifle events include Rifle \"Standing\", which is shot seated like Air Pistol, with variable levels of back support. \"Prone\" Rifle uses the basic prone shooting position utilising a sling for the supporting arm, but is shot rested on a table with the athlete seated either in a chair or wheelchair.\nCompetitions using factory and service firearms.\nShooting competitions for factory and service firearms, usually called Service Rifle, Service Pistol, Production, Factory or Stock, describe a set of disciplines or equipment classes where the types of permitted firearms are subject to type approval and few aftermarket modifications are permitted. Thus the terms refer to permitted equipment and modifications rather than the type of shooting format itself. The names Service Rifle and Service Pistol stem from that the equipment permitted for these types of competitions traditionally were based on standard issue firearms used by one or several armed forces and civilian versions of these, while the terms Production, Factory and Stock often are applied to more modern disciplines with similar restrictions on equipment classes. Factory and service classes are often \"restrictive\" in nature, and the types of firearms permitted are usually rugged, versatile and affordable. In comparison, more expensive custom competition equipment are popular in more \"permissive\" equipment classes. Both types of equipment classes can be found within many disciplines, such as bullseye, field, practical and long range shooting.\nPlinking.\nPlinking refers to informal target shooting done for pleasure or practice typically at non-standard targets such as tin cans, logs, cartons, fruits, or any other homemade or naturally occurring objects like rocks (however, it is unsafe to shoot at rocks) or tree branches. The primary appeals of plinking as a sport are the broad variety of easily available locations, minimal costs, freedom in practice styles, and more relaxing and less restrictive shooting experience.\nThe flexibility of target choice is also why plinking is popular. A small, three-dimensional target in an outdoors setting is much more akin to a real-world hunting and varminting scenario, presenting a better simulated opportunity to practice shooting skills. A plinking target will also often react much more positively to a hit than a paper target used in formal competitions, either audibly with a sharp impact sound (hence the name \"plink\") or visually by bouncing, splattering or falling over. Steel targets used for formal action and long range shooting competitions are also popular for plinking due to the ease of setting up and confirming good hits.\nAthletic shooting sports.\nAthletic shooting sports are hybrid events of normally stationary shooting sport competitions and the sport of athletics or other physically demanding non-shooting sports. Many were borne from military exercises and emphasize physical endurance.\nBow shooting sports.\nArchery.\nModern competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. A person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman, and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite. The most popular competitions worldwide are called target archery. Another form, particularly popular in Europe and America, is field archery, which generally is shot at targets set at various distances in a wooded setting. 3D archery, which differs from field archery in that the targets are animal models, is also quite popular in the same regions. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games. The tournament rules vary from organization to organization. World Archery Federation rules are often considered normative, but large non-WA-affiliated archery organizations do exist with different rules. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors. Run archery is a shooting discipline connecting archery with running.\nCrossbow.\nThe International Crossbow Shooting Union (\"Internationale Armbrustsch\u00fctzen Union\" or IAU) was founded in Landshut, Germany on June 24, 1956, as the world governing body for crossbow target shooting. The IAU supervises World, Continental and International crossbow shooting championships in 3 disciplines; 30 m Match-crossbow, 10 m Match-crossbow and Field-crossbow shooting. IAU World Championships take place every two years with Continental Championships on intervening years. Other International and IAU-Cup events take place annually. World Crossbow Shooting Association (WCSA) organises competitions in 7 disciplines: Target, Target match play, Forest, Forest match play, 3D, Bench &amp; prone target and Indoor target.\nDart shooting sports.\nSport blowgun.\nThere are several competition styles of sport blowgun practised around the world. A standardization of competition style is based upon fukiya, and governed by the International Fukiyado Association. It is a 10-metre target shooting, using a standardized barrel caliber and length, and a standardized dart length and weight as outlined by IFA. \nThere are two more styles, both based upon the Cherokee Annual Gathering Blowgun Competition. The Field Style competition is similar to the winter Biathlon, where the shooter runs from a starting line to a target lane, shoots and retrieves the darts, and continues to the next station. The course length varies from 400 to 800 m with from 9 to 16 targets at various heights and shooting distances. The final style is the Long Distance target shoot. The target is a circle of 24\u00a0cm diameter, and the firing line is 20 m away. Three darts are fired by each shooter, at least one of which must stick in the target. All successful shooters move to the next round, moving back 2 m each time.\nConfrontational shooting sports.\nConfrontational shooting sports is a set of relatively new team sports using non-lethal ranged weapons that are safe enough to shoot at other people. Previously such games were not possible due to safety concerns since bows and guns are generally too lethal and dangerous for human targets, but the development of newer airgun and infrared technologies allowed for the development of safe confrontational disciplines. While initially only for sport and recreations, professional sport competitions are now held. These types of games are also used for tactical gunfight training by military and law enforcement agencies to some extent.\nOlympic dueling.\nOlympic dueling is an archaic individual sport that sought to safely emulate the deadly practice of pistol duelling, akin to fencing emulating sword fighting. It involved the use of specially built primer-fired pistols to propel wax bullets. Two versions of the sport were demonstration events at the 1906 Olympics and 1908 Olympics. It was also a popular sport in France.\nPaintball.\nPaintball is a competitive sport in which players from opposing teams eliminate opponents out of play by hitting them with round, breakable, dye-filled oil and gelatin pellets (\"paintballs\"), shot from HPA/CO2-powered air guns called paintball markers. It can be played on indoor or outdoor fields scattered with natural or artificial terrain, which players use for tactical cover. Paintball game types vary, but can include capture the flag, elimination, ammunition limits, defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from seconds to hours, or even days in scenario play. The game was developed in the 1980s and is now regularly played at a formal sporting level with organized competition involving major tournaments, professional teams and players.\nAirsoft.\nAirsoft is a competitive sport similar in concept to paintball, in which participants from opposing teams eliminate opponents by hitting each other with solid round plastic pellets launched from low-powered smoothbore air guns called airsoft guns. It is different from paintball in that airsoft pellets do not visibly mark the targets like paintballs, and thus the sport relies heavily on an honor system where a hit player has the ethical duty to call himself out of play, regardless of whether anyone else sees it happen. Most airsoft guns are also magazine-fed (unlike the commonly top-mounting pellet loader of paintball markers) with mounting platforms compatible with real firearm accessories, and tend to more closely resemble real guns in appearance, making them more popular for military simulation and historical reenactments. The greater toughness of airsoft pellets also allows the use of better powerplants and apparatus such as hop-up device for improved external ballistics, making the gameplay more accurately resemble real gunfights. They are also much cheaper for casual players to participate than paintball.\nAirsoft gameplay varies in style and composition just like paintball and is played in both indoor and outdoor courses. Situations on the field frequently involve the use of real-life military tactics to achieve objectives, and it is not uncommon for participants to emulate the uniforms and equipment of real military and police organizations for a sense of realism. Games are normally supervised (and sometimes umpired) by trained on-site administrators, and players' airsoft guns are usually checked through a chronograph to enforce power output restrictions.\nThere are currently no formal national or international governing bodies for the airsoft sport. Competitive tournaments are usually organized by private clubs or among enthusiasts and professional/semi-professional teams (often referred to as \"clans\"), with rules and restrictions varying from event to event.\nLaser tag.\nLaser tag (despite the name, laser is actually not used due to safety concerns) is a tag game played with infrared light guns and sensors worn on the body of the players. Since its birth in 1979, laser tag has evolved in both indoor and outdoor games, each with gameplay styles such as annihilation, capture the flag, domination, VIP protection, (usually sci-fi) role playing, etc. When compared to paintball and airsoft, laser tag is painless and very safe because it involves no projectile impacts, and indoor games may be considered less physically demanding because most indoor venues prohibit running or roughhousing.\nMore sophisticated forms of laser tag, such as MILES, are used (in conjunction with blanks) by militaries to allow for non-lethal combat training.\nArchery Tag.\nArchery Tag is a form of combat archery sport where participants shoot one another using a bow with arrows with large foam tips. The game's rules closely resemble dodgeball. The game begins with a number of arrows in the center of the arena. At the whistle, players race to collect them, before firing them at one another across the playing field. A player is eliminated if struck by an arrow, and a player can bring an eliminated teammate back into play by catching an arrow. To avoid injury, participants wear protective facemasks and use bows with less than draw weight. It was invented in 2011 by John Jackson of Ashley, Indiana, and experienced a boost in popularity from the \"Hunger Games\" books and film series, which feature a bow-wielding protagonist Katniss Everdeen. Jackson staged Archery Tag games at local premieres of the films. By 2014, Jackson had licensed the game to 170 locations, mostly in the United States, but also in Russia, Peru and Saudi Arabia.\nBattle gaming variants of Archery Tag also exist, such as Dagorhir, Amtgard, Belegarth and Darkon, where archers are pitted among melee players welding foam weapons to simulate medieval battles. \nEsports.\nEsports is the competitive playing of video games, often referring to play at the professional level. While the term esports includes many types of video games unrelated to shooting sports, a major subset of esports are the shooters, namely first-person shooters and third-person shooters. Matches of these games can take a variety of forms but traditionally take formats similar to paintball, involving teams of players whose objective is to eliminate the opposing team in simulated combat, often while also focusing other key objectives. Major games of these styles currently in professional play include (among others) \"\", \"Overwatch\", \"Team Fortress 2\", \"Valorant\", and \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\". Organized play is done both online or in-person. While there has been serious interest to include esports in the Olympics and similar events, the inclusion of shooters has been less welcomed due to their often violent visual content.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite the name \"Japanese rice wine\", sake, and indeed any East Asian rice wine (such as huangjiu and cheongju), is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars that ferment into alcohol, whereas in wine, alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes. This process is called Multiple Parallel Fermentation.\nAlthough similar, the brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer, in which the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other rice wines, these conversions occur simultaneously when brewing sake. The typical alcohol content also differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3\u20139% ABV and wine generally contains 9\u201316% ABV, undiluted sake contains 18\u201320% ABV (although this is typically lowered somewhat by diluting with water prior to bottling).\nIn Japanese, the character (kanji: \u9152, ) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called sake in English is usually termed . Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labeled with the word , a synonym not commonly used in conversation.\nIn Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special ceremony, where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or porcelain bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a \"sakazuki\". As with wine, the recommended serving temperature of sake varies greatly by type.\nHistory.\nUntil the Kamakura period.\nThe origin of sake is unclear; however, the method of fermenting rice into alcohol spread to Japan from China around 500BCE. The earliest reference to the use of alcohol in Japan is recorded in the \"Book of Wei\" in the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\". This 3rd-century Chinese text speaks of Japanese drinking and dancing.\n are mentioned several times in the , Japan's first written history, which was compiled in 712. Bamforth (2005) places the probable origin of true sake (which is made from rice, water, and ) in the Nara period (710\u2013794). The fermented food fungi traditionally used for making alcoholic beverages in China and Korea for a long time were fungi belonging to \"Rhizopus\" and \"Mucor\", whereas in Japan, except in the early days, the fermented food fungus used for sake brewing was \"Aspergillus oryzae\". Some scholars believe the Japanese domesticated the mutated, detoxified \"Aspergillus flavus\" to give rise to \"Aspergillus oryzae\".\nIn the Heian period (794\u20131185), sake was used for religious ceremonies, court festivals, and drinking games. Sake production was a government monopoly for a long time, but in the 10th century, Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines began to brew sake, and they became the main centers of production for the next 500 years.\nMuromachi period.\nBefore the 1440s in the Muromachi period (1333\u20131573), the Buddhist temple Sh\u014dryaku-ji invented various innovative methods for making sake. Because these production methods are the origin of the basic production methods for sake brewing today, Shoryakuji is often said to be the birthplace of . Until then, most sake had been with a different process from today's, but after that, clear was established. The main production methods established by Sh\u014dryaku-ji are the use of , , , and . This method of producing starter mash is called . These innovations made it possible to produce sake with more stable quality than before, even in temperate regions. These things are described in , the oldest known technical book on sake brewing written in 1355 or 1489, and , a diary written between 1478 and 1618 by monks of K\u014dfuku-ji Temple in the Muromachi period.\nA large tub with a capacity of 10 \"koku\" (1,800 liters) was invented at the end of the Muromachi period, making it possible to mass-produce sake more efficiently than before. Until then, sake had been made in jars with a capacity of 1, 2, or 3 \"koku\" at the most, and some sake brewers used to make sake by arranging 100 jars.\nIn the 16th century, the technique of distillation was introduced into the Kyushu district from Ryukyu. The brewing of sh\u014dch\u016b, called \"Imo\u2013sake\" started and was sold at the central market in Kyoto.\nEdo period.\nBy the Genroku era (1688\u20131704) of the Edo period (1603\u20131867), a brewing method called was developed in which a small amount of distilled alcohol (sh\u014dch\u016b) was added to the mash to make it more aromatic and lighter in taste, while at the same preventing deterioration in quality. This originates from the distilled alcohol addition used in modern sake brewing.\nThe Nada-Gog\u014d area in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, the largest producer of modern sake, was formed during this period. When the population of Edo, modern-day Tokyo, began to grow rapidly in the early 1600s, brewers who made sake in inland areas such as Fushimi, Itami, and Ikeda moved to the Nada-Gog\u014d area on the coast, where the weather and water quality were perfect for brewing sake and convenient for shipping it to Edo. In the Genroku era, when the culture of the \"ch\u014dnin\" class, the common people, prospered, the consumption of sake increased rapidly, and large quantities of were shipped to Edo. 80% of the sake drunk in Edo during this period was from Nada-Gog\u014d. Many of today's major sake producers, including Hakutsuru, \u014czeki, Nihonsakari, Kikumasamune, Kenbishi and Sawanotsuru, are breweries in Nada-Gog\u014d. The method, one of the traditional techniques for preparing the starter mash, was developed in the Nada during the Edo period.\nDuring this period, frequent natural disasters and bad weather caused rice shortages, and the Tokugawa shogunate issued sake brewing restrictions 61 times. In the early Edo period, there was a sake brewing technique called that was optimized for each season. In 1667, the technique of for making sake in winter was improved, and in 1673, when the Tokugawa shogunate banned brewing other than \"kanzukuri\" because of a shortage of rice, the technique of sake brewing in the four seasons ceased, and it became common to make sake only in winter until industrial technology began to develop in the 20th century. During this period, aged for three, five, or nine years, was a luxury, but its deliciousness was known to the common people.\nIn the 18th century, Engelbert Kaempfer and Isaac Titsingh published accounts identifying sake as a popular alcoholic beverage in Japan, but Titsingh was the first to try to explain and describe the process of sake brewing. The work of both writers was widely disseminated throughout Europe at the beginning of the 19th century.\nFrom the Meiji era to the early Sh\u014dwa era.\nStarting around the beginning of the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), the technique for making sake began to develop rapidly. Breeding was actively carried out in various parts of Japan to produce sake rice optimized for sake brewing. \"Ise Nishiki\" developed in 1860, \"Omachi\" developed in 1866 and \"Shinriki\" developed in 1877 are the earliest representative varieties. In 1923, Yamada Nishiki, later called the \"king of sake rice,\" was produced. Among more than 123 varieties of sake rice as of 2019, Yamada Nishiki ranks first in production and \"Omachi\" fourth. The government opened the sake-brewing research institute in 1904, and in 1907 the first government-run sake-tasting competition was held. In 1904, the National Brewing Laboratory developed \"yamahai\", a new method of making starter mash, and in 1910, a further improvement, \"sokuj\u014d\", was developed. Sake yeast strains specifically selected for their brewing properties were isolated, and enamel-coated steel tanks arrived. The government started hailing the use of enamel tanks as easy to clean, lasting forever, and devoid of bacterial problems. (The government considered wooden tubs to be unhygienic because of the potential bacteria living in the wood.) Although these things are true, the government also wanted more tax money from breweries, as using wooden tubs means a significant amount of sake is lost to evaporation (approximately 3%), which could have otherwise been taxed. This was the temporary end of the wooden-tubs age of sake, and the use of wooden tubs in brewing was temporarily eliminated.\nIn Japan, sake has long been taxed by the national government. In 1878, the liquor tax accounted for 12.3% of the national tax revenue, excluding local taxes, and in 1888 it was 26.4%, and in 1899 it was 38.8%, finally surpassing the land tax of 35.6%. In 1899, the government banned home brewing in anticipation of financial pressure from the First Sino-Japanese War and in preparation for the Russo-Japanese War. Since home-brewed sake is tax-free, the logic was that by banning the home-brewing of sake, sales would increase, and more tax revenue would be collected. This was the end of home-brewed sake. The Meiji government adopted a system in which taxes were collected when sake was finished, instead of levying taxes on the amount and price of sake at the time of sale to ensure more revenue from liquor taxes. The liquor tax for the sake produced in a given year had to be paid to the government during that fiscal year, so the breweries tried to make money by selling the sake as soon as possible. This destroyed the market for aged , which had been popular until then, and it was only in 1955 that sake breweries began to make again.\nWhen World War II brought rice shortages, the sake-brewing industry was hampered as the government discouraged the use of rice for brewing. As early as the late 17th century, it had been discovered that small amounts of distilled alcohol could be added to sake before pressing to extract aromas and flavors from the rice solids. During the war, large amounts of distilled alcohol and glucose were added to small quantities of rice mash, increasing the yield by as much as four times. A few breweries were producing \"sake\" that contained no rice. The quality of sake during this time varied considerably. Incidentally, as of 2022, so much distilled alcohol is not allowed to be added, and under the provisions of the Liquor Tax Act, 50% of the weight of rice is the upper limit for the most inexpensive sake classified as \"futs\u016b-shu\".\nSince the mid-Showa era.\nAfter the war, the breweries gradually recovered and the quality of sake steadily improved, and there were various innovations in sake brewing. The term , which means carefully brewed sake, first appeared at the end of the Edo period, and the term , which has the same meaning, first appeared in 1894. However, , which is popular in the world today, was created by the development of various sake production techniques from the 1930s to around 1975. From 1930 to 1931, a new type of rice milling machine was invented, which made it possible to make rice with a polishing ratio of about 50%, removing the miscellaneous taste derived from the surface part of the rice grain to make sake with a more aromatic and refreshing taste than before. In 1936, Yamada Nishiki, the most suitable sake rice for brewing \"ginj\u014d-shu\", became the recommended variety of Hyogo Prefecture. Around 1953, the , was invented, which produced fruit-like aromas like apples and bananas but also excelled in fermentation. From around 1965, more and more manufacturers began to work on the research and development of \"ginj\u014d-shu\", and by about 1968, the Kyokai yeast No. 9 began to be used throughout Japan. In the 1970s, temperature control technology in the mash production process improved dramatically. And by slowly fermenting rice at low temperatures using high-milled rice and a newly developed sake yeast, \"ginj\u014d-shu\" with a fruity flavor was created. At that time, \"ginj\u014d-shu\" was a special sake exhibited at competitive exhibitions and was not on the market. From around 1975, \"ginj\u014d-shu\" began to be marketed and was widely distributed in the 1980s, and in 1990, with the definition of what can be labeled as \"ginj\u014d-shu\", more and more brewers began to sell \"ginj\u014d-shu\". The growing popularity of \"ginj\u014d-shu\" has prompted research into yeast, and many yeasts with various aromas optimized for \"ginj\u014d-shu\" have been developed.\nIn 1973, the National Tax Agency's brewing research institute developed .\nNew players on the scene\u2014beer, wine, and spirits\u2014became popular in Japan, and in the 1960s, beer consumption surpassed sake for the first time. Sake consumption continued to decrease while the quality of sake steadily improved. While the rest of the world may be drinking more sake and the quality of sake has been increasing, sake production in Japan has been declining since the mid-1970s. The number of sake breweries is also declining. While there were 3,229 breweries nationwide in fiscal 1975, the number had fallen to 1,845 in 2007. In recent years, exports have rapidly increased due to the growing popularity of sake worldwide. The value of sake exports in 2022 was more than six times that of 2009. As of 2022, the value of Japan's alcoholic beverage exports was approximately 139.2 billion yen, with Japanese whisky in first place at 56.1 billion yen and sake in second place at 47.5 billion yen. Today, sake has become a world beverage with a few breweries in China, Southeast Asia, South America, North America, and Australia.\nIn addition to \"Aspergillus oryzae\" (yellow \"k\u014dji\"), \"Aspergillus kawachii\" (white \"k\u014dji\") and \"Aspergillus luchuensis\" (black \"k\u014dji\"), which are used to brew \"sh\u014dch\u016b\" and \"awamori\", have been used to brew sake since the 21st century.\nIn 2018, Satake Corporation developed a new type of rice milling machine that allows dramatically faster and more focused milling of the long axis portion of rice, which has a high mineral content and adds a miscellaneous taste to the flavor. This has made it possible to achieve the same flavor in a \"ginj\u014d-shu\" with a 60% polishing ratio as in a conventional \"daiginj\u014d-shu\" with a 40% polishing ratio, and many breweries now sell sake made from flat-milled rice.\nMore breweries are also turning to older methods of production. For example, since the 21st century, the use of wooden tubs has increased again due to the development of sanitary techniques. The use of wooden tubs for fermentation has the advantage of allowing various microorganisms living in the wood to affect sake, allowing more complex fermentation and producing sake with different characteristics. It is also known that the antioxidants contained in wood have a positive effect on sake.\nIn December 2024, sake brewing (not sake itself) was recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage.\nOldest sake brewery.\nThe oldest sake brewing company still in operation, as confirmed by historical documents, is the Sudo Honke in Kasama, Ibaraki, founded in 1141 during the Heian period (794\u20131185). \"Sud\u014d Honke\" was also the first sake brewery to sell both \"namazake\" and \"hiyaoroshi\". \"Hiyaoroshi\" refers to sake that is finished in winter, pasteurized once in early spring, stored and aged for a little while during the summer, and shipped in the fall without being pasteurized a second time.\nIn terms of excavated archaeological evidence, the oldest known sake brewery is from the 15th century near an area that was owned by Tenry\u016b-ji, in Uky\u014d-ku, Kyoto. Unrefined sake was squeezed out at the brewery, and there are about 180 holes (60\u00a0cm wide, 20\u00a0cm deep) for holding storage jars. A hollow (1.8 meter wide, 1 meter deep) for a pot to collect drops of pressed sake and 14th-century Bizen ware jars were also found. It is estimated to be utilized until the \u014cnin War (1467\u20131477). Sake was brewed at Tenry\u016b-ji during the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573).\nProduction.\nRice.\nThe rice used for brewing sake is called , or officially . There are at least 123 types of sake rice in Japan. Among these, Yamada Nishiki, Gohyakumangoku, Miyama Nishiki and Omachi rice are popular. The grain is larger, stronger (if a grain is small or weak, it will break in the process of polishing), and contains less protein and lipid than ordinary table rice. Because of the cost, ordinary table rice, which is cheaper than sake rice, is sometimes used for sake brewing, but because sake rice has been improved and optimized for sake brewing, few people eat it.\nPremium sake is mostly made from sake rice. However, non-premium sake is mostly made from table rice. According to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, premium sake makes up 25% of total sake production, and non-premium sake () makes up 75% of sake production. In 2008, a total of 180,000 tons of polished rice were used in sake brewing, of which sake rice accounted for 44,000 tons (24%), and table rice accounted for 136,000 tons (76%).\nSake rice is usually polished to a much higher degree than ordinary table rice. The reason for polishing is a result of the composition and structure of the rice grain itself. The core of the rice grain is rich in starch, while the outer layers of the grain contain higher concentrations of fats, vitamins, and proteins. Since a higher concentration of fat and protein in the sake would lead to off-flavors and contribute rough elements to the sake, the outer layers of the sake rice grain is milled away in a polishing process, leaving only the starchy part of the grain (some sake brewers remove over 60% of the rice grain in the polishing process). That desirable pocket of starch in the center of the grain is called the . It usually takes two to three days to polish rice down to less than half its original size. The rice powder by-product of polishing is often used for making rice crackers, Japanese sweets (i.e. Dango), and other food stuffs.\nIf the sake is made with rice with a higher percentage of its husk and the outer portion of the core milled off, then more rice will be required to make that particular sake, which will take longer to produce. Thus, sake made with rice that has been highly milled is usually more expensive than sake that has been made with less-polished rice. This does not always mean that sake made with highly milled rice is of better quality than sake made with rice milled less. Sake made with highly milled rice has a strong aroma and a light taste without miscellaneous taste. It maximizes the fruity flavor of \"ginj\u014d\". On the other hand, sake made with less milled rice but with attention to various factors tends to have a rich sweetness and flavor derived from rice.\n\"Rice polishing ratio\", called (see Glossary of sake terms) measures the degree of rice polishing. For example, a rice polishing ratio of 70% means that 70% of the original rice grain remains and 30% has been polished away. As of 2023, the most polished sake has a polishing ratio of 0.85% or less, with at least 99.15% of its rice grains polished away. This sake is , released by , priced at 1,375,000 yen for 720 ml.\nWater.\nWater is involved in almost every major sake brewing process, from washing the rice to diluting the final product before bottling. The mineral content of the water can be important in the final product. Iron will bond with an amino acid produced by the to produce off flavors and a yellowish color. Manganese, when exposed to ultraviolet light, will also contribute to discoloration. Conversely, potassium, magnesium, and phosphoric acid serve as nutrients for sake yeast during fermentation and are considered desirable. The yeast will use those nutrients to work faster and multiply resulting in more sugar being converted into alcohol. While soft water will typically yield sweeter sake, hard water with a higher mineral content is known for producing drier-style sake.\nThe first region known for having great water was the Nada-Gog\u014d in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. A particular water source called was found to produce high-quality sake and attracted many producers to the region.\nTypically breweries obtain water from wells, though surface water can be used. Breweries may use tap water and filter and adjust components.\n\"K\u014dji-kin\".\n\"Aspergillus oryzae\" (yellow \"k\u014dji\").\n\"Aspergillus oryzae\" spores are another important component of sake. \"A. oryzae\" is an enzyme-secreting fungus. In Japan, \"A. oryzae\" is used to make various fermented foods, including \"miso\" (a paste made from soybeans) and (soy sauce). It is also used to make alcoholic beverages, notably sake. During sake brewing, spores of \"A. oryzae\" are scattered over steamed rice to produce (rice in which \"A. oryzae\" spores are cultivated). Under warm and moist conditions, the \"A. oryzae\" spores germinate and release amylases (enzymes that convert the rice starches into maltose and glucose). This conversion of starch into simple sugars (e.g., glucose or maltose) is called saccharification. Yeast then ferment the glucose and other sugar into alcohol. Saccharification also occurs in beer brewing, where mashing is used to convert starches from barley into maltose. However, whereas fermentation occurs \"after\" saccharification in beer brewing, saccharification (via \"A. oryzae\") and fermentation (via yeast) occur \"simultaneously\" in sake brewing (see \"Fermentation\" below).\nAs \"A. oryzae\" is a microorganism used to manufacture food, its safety profile concerning humans and the environment in sake brewing and other food-making processes must be considered. Various health authorities, including Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), consider \"A. oryzae\" generally safe for use in food fermentation, including sake brewing. When assessing its safety, it is important to note that \"A.\" \"oryzae\" lacks the ability to produce toxins, unlike the closely related \"Aspergillus flavus\". To date, there have been several reported cases of animals (e.g. parrots, a horse) being infected with \"A. oryzae\". In these cases the animals infected with \"A. oryzae\" were already weakened due to predisposing conditions such as recent injury, illness or stress, hence were susceptible to infections in general. Aside from these cases, there is no evidence to indicate \"A. oryzae\" is a harmful pathogen to either plants or animals in the scientific literature. Therefore, Health Canada considers \"A. oryzae\" \"unlikely to be a serious hazard to livestock or to other organisms,\" including \"healthy or debilitated humans.\" Given its safety record in the scientific literature and extensive history of safe use (spanning several hundred years) in the Japanese food industry, the FDA and World Health Organization (WHO) also support the safety of \"A. oryzae\" for use in the production of foods like sake. In the US, the FDA classifies \"A.oryzae\" as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) organism.\n\"Aspergillus kawachii\" (white \"k\u014dji\").\nIn addition to \"Aspergillus oryzae\" (yellow \"k\u014dji\"), \"Aspergillus kawachii\" (white \"k\u014dji\") and \"Aspergillus luchuensis\" (black \"k\u014dji\"), which are used to brew \"sh\u014dch\u016b\" and \"awamori\", have been used to brew sake since the 21st century.\nFrom the 1980s, research was conducted to brew sake using \"Aspergillus kawachii\" (white \"k\u014dji\"), which is used to make \"sh\u014dch\u016b\", and sake made with \"Aspergillus kawachii\" became popular when Aramasa Co, Ltd. released \"Amaneko\" using \"Aspergillus kawachii\" in 2009. \"Aspergillus kawachii\" produces about 10 times more citric acid than \"Aspergillus oryzae\", and thus has a strong ability to suppress the growth of bacteria that damage the flavor of sake. It also imparts a sour, citrus-like flavor to sake. Because it produces so much citric acid, older sake-making methods such as \"kimoto\" or \"yamahai\" can produce a starter mash as quickly as modern \"sokuj\u014d\". \"Kimoto\" and \"yamahai\" do not add artificial lactic acid, which allows them to be labeled \"additive-free,\" giving them a marketing advantage when exporting.\n\"Aspergillus luchuensis\" (black \"k\u014dji\").\nAs of 2022, sake made with \"Aspergillus luchuensis\" (black \"k\u014dji\") is not as popular as sake made with \"Aspergillus kawachii\". It produces more citric acid than \"Aspergillus kawachii\". However, it produces less amino acids, which produce complex flavors such as umami, bitterness, and sweetness. \"Aspergillus luchuensis\" also produces more peptides, which results in a bitter taste. This combines with a strong sour taste from the citric acid, which is sometimes compared to strawberry or red wine.\nSake yeast.\nSake yeast is so important in sake brewing that it is said to affect the flavor of sake more than rice. In sake brewing, \"k\u014dji\" breaks down rice starch into glucose, and yeast is responsible for the fermentation process that converts the glucose into alcohol. Yeast has a significant impact on the flavor of sake by producing ethyl caproate, isoamyl acetate, and other flavor compounds and acids as well as alcohol during the fermentation process.\nThe various types of yeast used in sake brewing belong to the species \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", and a large number of yeasts have been developed in Japan. For example, the laboratory of the Hakutsuru Sake Brewery has 400 types of yeast.\nBefore the modernization of Japan, breweries used yeasts that were native to each brewery. The yeasts evolved uniquely in each brewery as they competed for survival by mixing with microorganisms that became airborne and attached to the human body during the sake brewing process. Because some of these yeasts were not suitable for brewing sake, the quality of sake varied from brewery to brewery and from period to period.\nIn 1895, Dr. Kikuji Yabe isolated the first \"Saccharomyces sake\" yeast suitable for brewing sake. In 1904, the government established the National Brewing Laboratory and began detailed studies of yeast.\nIn 1906, the Brewing Society of Japan was founded, and a system was established whereby any superior yeast discovered was registered as \"Kyokai-k\u014dbo\" (\"Kyokai yeast\", \"Association yeast\") and distributed to breweries throughout Japan. Kyokai yeast No. 7 and No. 9 are particularly popular. In response to the popularity of \"ginj\u014d-shu\" since the 1980s, various aromatic yeasts have been developed. Today, the Brewing Society of Japan, research institutes in each prefecture, and breweries continue to develop a variety of yeasts, and an increasing number of breweries are making sake from yeasts found in flowers.\nSome sake yeasts can also color sake. For example, Kyokai yeast \"Akairo k\u014dbo\", isolated in 1984, can produce pink \"nigori\" or \"origarami\" sake by producing a red pigment during fermentation. This yeast is not fertile and temperature control is difficult, but it adds a sweet strawberry flavor to the sake.\nFermentation.\nSake fermentation is a three-step process called . The first step, called , involves steamed rice, water, and being added to the yeast starter called : a mixture of steamed rice, water, k\u014dji, and yeast. This mixture becomes known as the (the main mash during sake fermentation). The high yeast content of the promotes the fermentation of the \".\"\nOn the second day, the mixture stands for a day to let the yeast multiply.\nThe second step (the third day of the process), called , involves the addition of a second batch of , steamed rice, and water to the mixture. On the fourth day of the fermentation, the third step of the process, called , takes place. Here, the third and final batch of k\u014dji, steamed rice, and water is added to the mixture, followed by up to ten days or so of additional fermentation to complete the three-step process.\nThe multiple parallel fermentation process of sake brewing, where starch is converted into glucose followed by immediate conversion into alcohol, is unique to it. This distinguishes sake from other brewed alcoholic beverages like beer because it occurs in a single vat, whereas with beer, for instance, starch-to-glucose conversion and glucose-to-alcohol conversion occur in separate vats. The breakdown of starch into glucose is caused by the fungus, while the conversion of glucose into alcohol is caused by yeast. Due to the yeast being available as soon as the glucose is produced, the conversion of glucose to alcohol is very efficient in sake brewing. This results in sake having a generally higher alcohol content than other types of beer or wine.\nAfter the fermentation process is complete, the fermented is pressed to remove the sake lees and then pasteurized and filtered for color. The sake is then stored in bottles under cold conditions (see \"Maturation\" below).\nThe process of making sake can range from 60 to 90 days (2\u20133 months), while the fermentation alone can take two weeks. On the other hand, \"ginj\u014d-shu\" takes about 30 days for fermentation alone.\nMaturation.\nLike other brewed beverages, sake tends to benefit from a period of storage. Nine to twelve months are required for the sake to mature. Maturation is caused by physical and chemical factors such as oxygen supply, the broad application of external heat, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, and amino acids, among other unknown factors.\n\"T\u014dji\".\n is the job title of the sake brewer. There are various theories about the origin of the word, but the most popular is that it is a corruption of the word , which was used for housewives and elderly women who supervised \"miko\" (shrine maidens). This is because sake brewing was the work of housewives at home and \"miko\" at Shinto shrines. It is a highly respected job in the Japanese society, with being regarded like musicians or painters. The title of was historically passed from father to son. Today new are either veteran brewery workers or are trained at universities. While modern breweries with cooling tanks operate year-round, most old-fashioned sake breweries are seasonal, operating only in the cool winter months. During the summer and fall, most work elsewhere, commonly on farms, only periodically returning to the brewery to supervise storage conditions or bottling operations.\nVarieties.\nSpecial-designation sake.\nThere are two basic types of sake: and . is the equivalent of table wine and accounts for 57% of sake production as of 2020. refers to premium sake distinguished by the degree to which the rice has been polished and the added percentage of brewer's alcohol or the absence of such additives. There are eight varieties of special-designation sake.\n is sake made using a special method called , in which rice is slowly fermented for about 30 days at a low temperature of 5 to 10 degrees Celsius (41 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit). Sake made in \"ginj\u014d-zukuri\" is characterized by fruity flavors like apples, bananas, melons, grapes, peaches, pineapples, citrus, etc. In general, the flavor of sake tends to deteriorate when it is affected by ultraviolet rays or high temperatures, especially for sake made in \"ginj\u014d-zukuri\" and unpasteurized \"namazake\". Therefore, it is recommended that sake with the name \"ginj\u014d\" be transported and stored in cold storage. It is also recommended to drink chilled to maximize its fruity flavor.\n is a term used for the sake that is made of pure rice wine without any additional distilled alcohol. Special-designation sake which is not labeled has an appropriate amount of distilled alcohol added. The maximum amount of distilled alcohol added to is 50% of the rice weight, mainly to increase the volume, while the maximum amount of distilled alcohol added to special-designation sake is 10% of the rice weight, to make the sake more aromatic and light in taste, and to prevent the growth of lactic acid bacteria, which deteriorate the flavor of the sake. It is often misunderstood that the added distilled alcohol is of poor quality, but that is not the case with the addition of distilled alcohol to special-designation sake. Specifically, 78.3% of the sake entered in the , the largest sake contest, had distilled alcohol added, and 91.1% of the winning sake had it added. However, the most important aspect of the contest is the brewing technique, not whether it tastes good or not.\nSake made with highly milled rice has a strong aroma and a light taste without miscellaneous taste. It maximizes the fruity flavor of \"ginj\u014d\". On the other hand, sake made with less milled rice but with attention to various factors tends to have a rich sweetness and flavor derived from rice.\nIn 2018, Satake Corporation developed a new type of rice milling machine that allows dramatically faster and more focused milling of the long axis portion of rice, which has a high mineral content and adds a miscellaneous taste to the flavor. This has made it possible to achieve the same flavor in a \"ginj\u014d-shu\" with a 60% polishing ratio as in a conventional \"daiginj\u014d-shu\" with a 40% polishing ratio.\nThe certification requirements for special-designation sake must meet the conditions listed below, as well as the superior aroma and color specified by the National Tax Agency. The listing below often has the highest price at the top:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDifferent handling after fermentation.\nThe characteristics of sake listed below are generally described on the label attached to the sake bottle. For example, indicates that all the conditions of , , and below are satisfied.\nOthers.\nSome other terms commonly used in connection with sake:\nformula_1\nSpecific gravity is measured on a scale weighing the same volume of water at and sake at . The sweeter the sake, the lower the number (or more negative); the drier the sake, the higher the number. When the SMV was first used, 0 was the point between sweet and dry sake. Now +3 is considered neutral.\nCraft sake.\nIn Japan, is sake that is brewed based on sake production techniques, but produced in a manner that differs from the traditional sake production process as defined by the Liquor Tax Law. It is classified as rather than under the Liquor Tax Law, but is generally recognized as sake.\nThe Liquor Tax Law definition does not allow sake to be made with secondary ingredients, but since craft sake is not bound by the Liquor Tax Law definition, fruits and herbs are often used as secondary ingredients. It can achieve a different flavor from conventional sake by using secondary ingredients, and can use local products from the brewery's area as secondary ingredients. For example, the Ine to Agave Brewery uses agave, hops, apples, grapes, matcha, honey, coffee, etc. as secondary ingredients.\nIn Japan, the Liquor Tax Law prohibits new entrants from obtaining a new sake brewing license to sell sake in Japan. If a new entrant wants to start brewing sake, it must either take over an existing brewery or produce sake for export only. Therefore, young entrepreneurs who want to make sake tend to start making craft sake, which is easier to enter. The Japan Craft Sake Breweries Association was founded in 2022 under the leadership of Shuhei Okazumi of Ine to Agave Brewery. The association hopes to appeal to young people and women who have not been frequent sake drinkers, and due to the high added value, many craft sake are priced at about twice the price of traditional sake.\nTaste and flavor.\nThe label on a bottle of sake gives a rough indication of its taste. Terms found on the label may include , , and .\n or Sake Meter Value (SMV) is calculated from the specific gravity of the sake and indicates the sugar and alcohol content of the sake on an arbitrary scale. Typical values are between \u22123 (sweet) and +10 (dry), equivalent to specific gravities ranging between 1.007 and 0.998, though the maximum range of can go much beyond that. The must be considered together with to determine the overall perception of dryness-sweetness, richness-lightness characteristics of a sake (for example, a higher level of acidity can make a sweet sake taste drier than it actually is).\n indicates the concentration of acid, which is determined by titration with sodium hydroxide solution. This number equals the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the acid in of sake.\n indicates a taste of umami or savoriness. As the proportion of amino acids rises, the sake tastes more savory. This number is determined by titration of the sake with a mixture of sodium hydroxide solution and formaldehyde and is equal to the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the amino acids in 10 mL of sake.\nSake can have many flavor notes, such as fruits, flowers, herbs, and spices. Many types of sake have notes of apple from ethyl caproate and banana from isoamyl acetate, particularly . In addition to apples and bananas, other fruits mentioned as flavor notes for fruity sake, especially \"ginj\u014d-shu\", include melons, grapes, peaches, pineapples, citrus, etc.\nServing sake.\nIn Japan, sake is served , at , or , depending on the preference of the drinker, the characteristics of the sake, and the season. Typically, hot sake is a winter drink, and high-grade sake is not usually drunk hot because the flavors and aromas may be lost. Most lower-quality sake is served hot because that is the traditional way, and it often tastes better that way, not so that flaws are covered up. There are gradations of temperature both for chilling and heating, about every , with hot sake generally served around , and chilled sake around , like white wine. may be reheated.\nSake is traditionally drunk from small cups called or and poured into the from ceramic flasks called . This is very common for hot sake, where the flask is heated in hot water, and the small cups ensure that the sake does not get cold in the cup, but it may also be used for chilled sake. Traditionally one does not pour one's own drink, which is known as , but instead members of a party pour for each other, which is known as . This has relaxed in recent years but is generally observed on more formal occasions, such as business meals, and is still often observed for the first drink.\nAnother traditional cup is the \"masu\", a box usually made of \"hinoki\" or \"sugi\", which was originally used for measuring rice. The holds exactly one \"g\u014d\", , so the sake is served by filling the to the brim; this is done for chilled or room temperature sake. In some Japanese restaurants, as a show of generosity, the server may put a glass inside the or put the on a saucer and pour until sake overflows and fills both containers.\nSake is traditionally served in units of , and this is still common, but other sizes are sometimes also available.\nSaucer-like cups called are also used, most commonly at weddings and other ceremonial occasions, such as the start of the year or the beginning of a kaiseki meal. In cheap bars, sake is often served at room temperature in glass tumblers and called . In more modern restaurants, wine glasses are also used, and recently footed glasses made specifically for premium sake have also come into use.\nTraditionally sake is heated immediately before serving, but today restaurants may buy sake in boxes that can be heated in a specialized hot sake dispenser, thus allowing hot sake to be served immediately. However, this is detrimental to the flavor. There are also a variety of devices for heating sake and keeping it warm beyond the traditional .\nAside from being served straight, sake can be used as a mixer for cocktails, such as tamagozake, saketinis, or nogasake. Outside of Japan, the sake bomb, the origins of which are unclear, has become a popular drink in bars and Asia-themed karaoke clubs.\nThe Japanese Sake Association encourages people to drink chaser water for their health, and the water is called Yawaragi-mizu.\nSeasonality.\nBecause the cooler temperatures make it more difficult for bacteria to grow, sake brewing traditionally took place mainly in winter, and this was especially true from 1673 during the Edo period until the early 20th century during the Showa era. While it can now be brewed year-round, seasonality is still associated with sake, particularly artisanal ones. The most visible symbol of this is the , a globe of cedar leaves traditionally hung outside a brewery when the new sake is brewed. The leaves start green but turn brown over time, reflecting the maturation of the sake. These are now hung outside many restaurants serving sake. The new year's sake is called , and when initially released in late winter or early spring, many brewers have a celebration known as . Traditionally sake was best transported in the cool spring to avoid spoilage in the summer heat, with a secondary transport in autumn, once the weather had cooled, known as \u2014this autumn sake has matured over the summer.\nStorage.\nSake is sold in volume units divisible by (one \"g\u014d\"), the traditional Japanese unit for cup size. Sake is traditionally sold by the -sized cup, or in a (one \"sh\u014d\" or ten )-sized flask (called an , or 'one sh\u014d-measure bottle'). Today sake is also often sold in bottles, which are divisible into four . Note that this is almost the same as the standard for wine bottles, which is divisible into four quarter bottles (187ml). Particularly in convenience stores, sake (generally of cheap quality) may be sold in a small bottle or a single serving (one g\u014d) .\nGenerally, it is best to keep sake refrigerated in a cool or dark room, as prolonged exposure to heat or direct light will lead to spoilage. Sake stored at a relatively high temperature can lead to the formation of diketopiperazine, a cyclo (Pro-Leu) that makes it bitter as it ages. Sake has high microbiological stability due to its high content of ethanol, but instances of spoilage have occurred. One of the microorganisms implicated in this spoilage is lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that has grown tolerant to ethanol and is referred to as -bacteria. Sake stored at room temperature is best consumed within a few months after purchase.\nSake can be stored for a long time due to its high alcohol content and has no use-by dates written on the bottle or label. However, there is a best before date for good drinking, and it depends on the type of sake, with the typical twice-pasteurized sake having a relatively long best before date. According to major sake brewer Gekkeikan, the best before date when unopened and stored in a dark place at about 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) is one year after production for \"futs\u016b-shu\" and \"honj\u014dz\u014d-shu\", 10 months for \"ginj\u014d-shu\", \"junmai-shu\", and sake pasteurized only once, and up to eight months for special \"namazake\" that can be distributed at room temperature. According to Sawanotsuru, once pasteurized sake and unpasteurized \"namazake\" have a best before date of nine months after production. Some sources also state that the best before date for unpasteurized \"namazake\" is three to six months after production. \"Namazake\" generally requires refrigeration at all times. However, there are exceptions to these storage conditions, in which case the conditions are stated on the label. For example, sake under the brand name must be kept refrigerated at all times, even if it is \"junmai-shu\", which has been pasteurized.\nOnce the sake is opened, it should be kept refrigerated, as the flavor deteriorates more quickly than before opening. Best before date after opening the bottle varies depending on the source. According to sake media outlet Sake no shizuku, which interviewed several major sake production companies, the responses from all companies were nearly identical. According to the responses, \"junmai\" type sake without added distilled alcohol has a best before date of 10 days after opening, while other types of sake with added distilled alcohol has a best before date of one month after opening. According to the international sommelier of sake certified by SSI International, \"ginj\u014d\" type sake, which is fermented at low temperature for a long time, has little flavor degradation for two to three days after opening and has a best before date of one week after opening. Other special designation sake and \"futs\u016b-shu\" have little flavor degradation for 10 to 14 days after opening the bottle and have a best before date of one month after opening. Unpasteurized \"namazake\" deteriorates the fastest and should be drunk as soon as possible.\nThese best before dates are shortened when stored at high temperatures or in bright places, especially under sunlight or fluorescent lights that emit ultraviolet rays. On the other hand, the optimal temperature to minimize flavor degradation is minus 5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit). It is also recommended that sake bottles be stored vertically. This is because if the bottle is placed horizontally, the sake is exposed to more air inside the bottle, which speeds up oxidation and may change the flavor when it comes in contact with the cap.\nIf these types of sake, which were clear or white at first, turn yellow or brown, it is a sign that the flavor has deteriorated. The exception is aged \"koshu\", which is amber in color from the time of shipment because it has been aged for several years to optimize its flavor.\nCeremonial use.\nSake is often consumed as part of Shinto purification rituals. Sake served to gods as offerings before drinking are called or .\nIn a ceremony called \"kagami biraki\", wooden sake casks are opened with mallets during Shinto festivals, weddings, store openings, sports and election victories, and other celebrations. This sake, called ('celebration sake'), is served freely to all to spread good fortune.\nAt the New Year, many Japanese people drink a special sake called \"toso\". is a sort of made by soaking , a \"kampo\" (traditional Japanese medicine), overnight in sake. Even children sip a portion. In some regions, the first sips of are taken in order of age, from the youngest to the eldest.\nOn Children's Day, May 5, there is a custom of drinking , which is made by cutting iris roots and leaves into thin slices and soaking them in sake, a tradition inherited from . It is believed that iris has the power to ward off evil spirits and has medicinal properties.\nGlobal growth.\nSake has seen a significant rise in global popularity. Sake exports have increased by 70% since 2021, reaching 41.1 billion yen ($270.4 million) in 2023. The United States is the largest market for exported sake, importing 6,500 kiloliters.\nDespite this growth, sake remains a niche product in the United States, accounting for only 0.2% of the total alcohol market as of 2020. This suggests there is potential for further expansion, mainly as American consumers develop a taste for Japanese culture and cuisine.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28502", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28502", "title": "Scuba set", "text": "Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus\nA scuba set, originally just scuba, is any breathing apparatus that is entirely carried by an underwater diver and provides the diver with breathing gas at the ambient pressure. \"Scuba\" is an anacronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus. Although strictly speaking the scuba set is only the diving equipment that is required for providing breathing gas to the diver, general usage includes the harness or rigging by which it is carried and those accessories which are integral parts of the harness and breathing apparatus assembly, such as a jacket or wing style buoyancy compensator and instruments mounted in a combined housing with the pressure gauge. In the looser sense, scuba set has been used to refer to all the diving equipment used by the scuba diver, though this would more commonly and accurately be termed scuba equipment or scuba gear. Scuba is overwhelmingly the most common underwater breathing system used by recreational divers and is also used in professional diving when it provides advantages, usually of mobility and range, over surface-supplied diving systems and is allowed by the relevant legislation and code of practice.\nTwo basic functional variations of scuba are in general use: open-circuit-demand, and rebreather. In open-circuit demand scuba, the diver expels exhaled breathing gas to the environment, and each breath is delivered at ambient pressure, on demand, by a diving regulator which reduces the pressure from the storage cylinder. The breathing gas is supplied through a demand valve; when the diver inhales, they reduce the pressure in the demand valve housing, thus drawing in fresh gas.\nIn rebreather scuba, the system recycles the exhaled gas, removes carbon dioxide, and compensates for the used oxygen before the diver is supplied with gas from the breathing circuit. The amount of gas lost from the circuit during each breathing cycle depends on the design of the rebreather and depth change during the breathing cycle. Gas in the breathing circuit is at ambient pressure, and stored gas is provided through regulators or injectors, depending on the design.\nWithin these systems, various mounting configurations may be used to carry the scuba set, depending on application and preference. These include: back mount, which is generally used for recreational scuba and for bailout sets for surface supplied diving; side-mount, which is popular for tight cave penetrations; sling mount, used for stage-drop sets; decompression gas and bailout sets where the main gas supply is back-mounted; and various non-standard carry systems for special circumstances.\nThe most immediate risk associated with scuba diving is drowning due to a failure of the breathing gas supply. This may be managed by diligent monitoring of remaining gas, adequate planning and provision of an emergency gas supply carried by the diver in a bailout cylinder or supplied by the diver's buddy, and the skills required to manage the gas sources during the emergency.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"SCUBA\" was coined in 1952 by Major Christian Lambertsen who served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1944 to 1946 as a physician. Lambertsen first called the closed-circuit rebreather apparatus he had invented \"Laru\", an (acronym for Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit) but, in 1952, rejected the term \"Laru\" for \"SCUBA\" (\"Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus\"). Lambertsen's invention, for which he held several patents registered from 1940 to 1989, was a rebreather and is different from the open-circuit diving regulator and diving cylinder assemblies also commonly referred to as scuba.\nOpen-circuit-demand scuba is a 1943 invention by the Frenchmen \u00c9mile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau, but in the English language Lambertsen's acronym has become common usage and the name \"Aqua-Lung\" (often spelled \"aqualung\"), coined by Cousteau for use in English-speaking countries, has fallen into secondary use. As with radar, the acronym \"scuba\" has become so familiar that it is generally not capitalized and is treated as an ordinary noun. For example, it has been translated into the Welsh language as \"sgwba\".\nAlthough the term was originally an acronym, \"scuba\" is currently used to refer to the apparatus or the practice of diving using the apparatus, either alone as a common noun, or as an adjective in \"scuba set\" and \"scuba diving\" respectively. It is also used as an adjective referring to equipment or activity relating to diving using self-contained breathing apparatus.\nApplication.\nA diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) to breathe underwater. Scuba provides the diver with the advantages of mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE).\nUnlike other modes of diving, which rely either on breath-hold or on breathing gas supplied under pressure from the surface, scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually filtered compressed air, allowing them greater freedom of movement than with an air line or diver's umbilical and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold. Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment for the main gas supply when this is practicable. Surface supplied divers may be required to carry scuba as an emergency breathing gas supply to get them to safety in the event of a failure of surface gas supply.\nThere are divers who work, full or part-time, in the recreational diving community as instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters and dive guides. In some jurisdictions the professional nature, with particular reference to responsibility for health and safety of the clients, of recreational diver instruction, dive leadership for reward and dive guiding is recognised and regulated by national legislation.\nOther specialist areas of scuba diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. Their roles include direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines or using a manned torpedo, bomb disposal or engineering operations. In civilian operations, many police forces operate police diving teams to perform \"search and recovery\" or \"search and rescue\" operations and to assist with the detection of crime which may involve bodies of water. In some cases search and rescue diving teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, and may be classed as public safety diving.\nThere are also professional divers involved with the underwater environment, such as underwater photographers or underwater videographers, who document the underwater world, or scientific diving, including marine biology, geology, hydrology, oceanography and underwater archaeology.\nThe choice between scuba and surface supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly in commercial diving, may be restricted to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.\nAlternatives to scuba for diving.\nThere are alternative methods that a person can use to survive and function while underwater, currently including:\nOperation.\nBreathing from scuba is mostly a straightforward matter. Under most circumstances it differs very little from normal surface breathing. In the case of a full-face mask, the diver may usually breathe through the nose or mouth as preferred, and in the case of a mouth held demand valve, the diver will have to hold the mouthpiece between the teeth and maintain a seal around it with the lips. Over a long dive this can induce jaw fatigue, and for some people, a gag reflex. Various styles of mouthpiece are available off the shelf or as customised items, and one of them may work better if either of these problems occur.\nThe frequently quoted warning against holding one's breath on scuba is a gross oversimplification of the actual hazard. The purpose of the admonition is to ensure that inexperienced divers do not accidentally hold their breath while surfacing, as the expansion of gas in the lungs could over-expand the lung air spaces and rupture the alveoli and their capillaries, allowing lung gases to get into the pulmonary return circulation, the pleura, or the interstitial areas near the injury, where it could cause dangerous medical conditions. Holding the breath at constant depth for short periods with a normal lung volume is generally harmless, providing there is sufficient ventilation on average to prevent carbon dioxide buildup, and is done as a standard practice by underwater photographers to avoid startling their subjects. Holding the breath during descent can eventually cause lung squeeze, and may allow the diver to miss warning signs of a gas supply malfunction until it is too late to remedy.\nSkilled open circuit divers can and will make small adjustments to buoyancy by adjusting their average lung volume during the breathing cycle. This adjustment is generally in the order of a kilogram (corresponding to a litre of gas), and can be maintained for a moderate period, but it is more comfortable to adjust the volume of the buoyancy compensator over the longer term.\nThe practice of shallow breathing or skip breathing in an attempt to conserve breathing gas should be avoided as it tends to cause a carbon dioxide buildup, which can result in headaches and a reduced capacity to recover from a breathing gas supply emergency. The breathing apparatus will generally increase dead space by a small but significant amount, and cracking pressure and flow resistance in the demand valve will cause a net work of breathing increase, which will reduce the diver's capacity for other work. Work of breathing and the effect of dead space can be minimised by breathing relatively deeply and slowly. These effects increase with depth, as density and friction increase in proportion to the increase in pressure, with the limiting case where all the diver's available energy may be expended on simply breathing, with none left for other purposes. This would be followed by a buildup in carbon dioxide, causing an urgent feeling of a need to breathe, and if this cycle is not broken, panic and drowning are likely to follow. The use of a low density inert gas, typically helium, in the breathing mixture can reduce this problem, as well as diluting the narcotic effects of the other gases.\nBreathing from a rebreather is much the same, except that the work of breathing is affected mainly by flow resistance in the breathing loop. This is partly due to the carbon dioxide absorbent in the scrubber, and is related to the distance the gas passes through the absorbent material, and the size of the gaps between the grains, as well as the gas composition and ambient pressure. Water in the loop can greatly increase the resistance to gas flow through the scrubber. There is even less point in shallow or skip breathing on a rebreather as this does not even conserve gas, and the effect on buoyancy is negligible when the sum of loop volume and lung volume remains constant.\nBreathing gases for scuba.\nUntil Nitrox, which contains more oxygen than air, was widely accepted in the late 1990s, almost all recreational scuba used simple compressed and filtered air. Other gas mixtures, typically used for deeper dives by technical divers, may substitute helium for some or all of the nitrogen (called Trimix, or Heliox if there is no nitrogen), or use lower proportions of oxygen than air. In these situations divers often carry additional scuba sets, called stages, with gas mixtures with higher levels of oxygen that are primarily used to reduce decompression time in staged decompression diving. These gas mixes allow longer dives, better management of the risks of decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity or lack of oxygen (hypoxia), and the severity of nitrogen narcosis. Closed circuit scuba sets (rebreathers) provide a gas mix that is controlled to optimise the mix for the actual depth at the time.\nTypes.\nScuba sets are of two types:\nBoth types of scuba set include a means of supplying air or other breathing gas, nearly always from a high pressure diving cylinder, and a harness to attach it to the diver. Most open-circuit scuba sets have a demand regulator to control the supply of breathing gas, and most rebreathers have a constant-flow injector, or an electronically controlled injector to supply fresh gas, but also usually have an automatic diluent valve (ADV), which functions in the same way as a demand valve, to maintain the loop volume during descent.\nOpen-circuit.\nOpen-circuit-demand scuba exhausts exhaled air to the environment, and requires each breath to be delivered to the diver on demand by a diving regulator, which reduces the pressure from the storage cylinder and supplies it through the demand valve when the diver reduces the pressure in the demand valve slightly during inhalation.\nThe essential subsystems of an open-circuit scuba set are;\nAdditional components which when present are considered part of the scuba set are;\nThe buoyancy compensator is generally assembled as an integrated part of the set, but is not technically part of the breathing apparatus.\nThe cylinder is usually worn on the back. \"Twin sets\" with two low capacity back-mounted cylinders connected by a high pressure manifold were more common in the 1960s than now for recreational diving, although larger capacity twin cylinders (\"doubles\") are commonly used by technical divers for increased dive duration and redundancy. At one time a firm called Submarine Products sold a sport air scuba set with three manifolded back-mounted cylinders. Cave and wreck penetration divers sometimes carry cylinders attached at their sides instead, allowing them to swim through more confined spaces.\nConstant flow scuba.\nConstant flow scuba sets do not have a demand regulator; the breathing gas flows at a constant rate, unless the diver switches it on and off by hand. They use more air than demand regulated scuba. There were attempts at designing and using these for diving and for industrial use before the Cousteau-type aqualung became commonly available circa 1950. Examples were Charles Condert's dress in the US (as of 1831), and Yves le Prieur's hand-controlled supply valve in France (as of 1926); see Timeline of diving technology. These systems are obsolete as they waste most of the gas or require manual control of each breath, and more efficient demand regulators are available. \"Ohgushi's Peerless Respirator\" from Japan as of 1918 had a bite-controlled breathing gas supply valve, which could be considered a form of demand valve, and was successfully used for several years.\nOpen-circuit demand scuba.\nThis system consists of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure, typically , connected to a diving regulator. The demand regulator automatically supplies the diver with as much gas as is needed at the ambient pressure.\nThis type of breathing set is sometimes called an \"aqualung\". The word \"Aqua-Lung\", which first appeared in the Cousteau-Gagnan patent, is a trademark, currently owned by Aqua Lung/La Spirotechnique.\nTwin-hose demand regulator.\nThis is the first type of diving demand valve to come into general use, and the one that can be seen in classic 1960s television scuba adventures, such as Sea Hunt. They were often use with manifolded twin cylinders.\nAll the stages of this type of regulator are in a large valve assembly mounted directly to the cylinder valve or manifold, behind the diver's neck. Two large bore corrugated rubber breathing hoses connect the regulator with the mouthpiece, one for supply and one for exhaust. The exhaust hose is used to return the exhaled air to the regulator, to avoid pressure differences due to depth variation between the exhaust valve and final stage diaphragm, which would cause a free-flow of gas, or extra resistance to breathing, depending on the diver's orientation in the water. In modern single-hose sets this problem is avoided by moving the second-stage regulator to the diver's mouthpiece. The twin-hose regulators came with a mouthpiece as standard, but a full-face diving mask was an option.\nSingle-hose regulator.\nMost modern open-circuit scuba sets have a diving regulator consisting of a first-stage pressure-reducing valve connected to the diving cylinder's output valve or manifold. This regulator reduces the pressure from the cylinder, which may be up to , to a lower pressure, generally between about 9 and 11\u00a0bar above the ambient pressure. A low-pressure hose links this with the second-stage regulator, or \"demand valve\", which is mounted on the mouthpiece. Exhalation occurs through a rubber one-way mushroom valve in the chamber of the demand valve, directly into the water quite close to the diver's mouth. Some early single hose scuba sets used full-face masks instead of a mouthpiece, such as those made by Desco and Scott Aviation (who continue to make breathing units of this configuration for use by firefighters).\nModern regulators typically feature high-pressure ports for pressure sensors of dive-computers and submersible pressure gauges, and additional low-pressure ports for hoses for inflation of dry suits and BC devices.\nPrimary demand valve.\nThe primary demand valve is the one the diver usually breathes from. There may be a secondary demand valve on the same regulator, or on a different first stage connected to the same scuba set. Additional scuba sets used for bailout, stages, decompression, or sidemount diving usually only have one second stage, which for that set is the primary by default.\nSecondary demand valve.\nMost recreational scuba sets have a backup second-stage demand valve on a separate hose, a configuration called a \"secondary\", or \"octopus\" demand valve, \"alternate air source\", \"safe secondary\" or \"safe-second\". This arrangement was intended to reduce the problems of buddy breathing from a single demand valve and has become the standard in recreational diving. By providing a second demand valve the need to alternately breathe off the same mouthpiece when sharing air is eliminated. This reduces the stress on divers who are already in a stressful situation, and this in turn reduces air consumption during the rescue and frees the donor's hand.\nSome diver training agencies recommend that a diver routinely offer their primary demand valve to a diver requesting to share air, and then switch to their own secondary demand valve. The idea behind this technique is that the primary demand valve is known to be working, and the diver donating the gas is less likely to be stressed or have a high carbon dioxide level, so has more time to sort out their own equipment after temporarily suspending the ability to breathe. In many instances, panicked divers have grabbed the primary regulators out of the mouths of other divers, so changing to the backup as a routine reduces stress when it is necessary in an emergency.\nIn technical diving donation of the primary demand valve is commonly the standard procedure, and the primary is connected to the first stage by a long hose, typically around 2\u00a0m, to allow gas sharing while swimming in single file in a narrow space as might be required in a cave or wreck. In this configuration the secondary is generally held under the chin by a loose bungee loop around the neck, supplied by a shorter hose, and is intended for backup use by the diver donating gas. The backup regulator is usually carried in the diver's chest area where it can be easily seen and accessed for emergency use. It may be worn secured by a breakaway clip on the buoyancy compensator, plugged into a soft friction socket attached to the harness, secured by sliding a loop of the hose into the shoulder strap cover of a jacket style BC, or suspended under the chin on a break-away bungee loop known as a necklace. These methods also keep the secondary from dangling below the diver and being contaminated by debris or snagging on the surroundings. Some divers store it in a BC pocket, but this reduces availability in an emergency.\nOccasionally, the secondary second-stage is combined with the inflation and exhaust valve assembly of the buoyancy compensator device. This combination eliminates the need for a separate low pressure hose for the BC, though the low pressure hose connector for combined use must have a larger bore than for standard BC inflation hoses, because it will need to deliver a higher flow rate if it is used for breathing. This combination unit is carried in the position where the inflator unit would normally hang on the left side of the chest. With integrated DV/BC inflator designs, the secondary demand valve is at the end of the shorter BC inflation hose, and the donor must retain access to it for buoyancy control, so donation of the primary regulator to help another diver is essential with this configuration.\nThe secondary demand valve is often partially yellow in color, and may use a yellow hose, for high visibility, and as an indication that it is an emergency or backup device.\nWhen a side-mount configuration is used, the usefulness of a secondary demand valve is greatly reduced, as each cylinder will have a regulator and the one not in use is available as a backup. This configuration also allows the entire cylinder to be handed off to the receiver, so a long hose is also less likely to be needed.\nSome diving instructors continue to teach buddy-breathing from a single demand valve as an obsolescent but still occasionally useful technique, learned in addition to the use of the backup DV, since availability of two second stages per diver is now assumed as standard in recreational scuba.\nCryogenic.\nThere have been designs for a cryogenic open-circuit scuba which has liquid-air tanks instead of cylinders. Underwater cinematographer Jordan Klein, Sr. of Florida co-designed such a scuba in 1967, called \"Mako\", and made at least five prototypes.\nThe Russian \"Kriolang\" (from Greek \"cryo-\" (= \"frost\" taken to mean \"cold\") + English \"lung\") was copied from Jordan Klein's \"Mako\" cryogenic open-circuit scuba. and were made until at least 1974. It would have to be filled a short time before use.\nRebreathers.\nA rebreather recirculates the breathing gas already used by the diver after replacing oxygen used by the diver and removing the carbon dioxide metabolic product. Rebreather diving is used by recreational, military and scientific divers where it can have advantages over open-circuit scuba. Since 80% or more of the oxygen remains in normal exhaled gas, and is thus wasted, rebreathers use gas very economically, making longer dives possible and special mixes cheaper to use at the cost of more complicated technology and more possible failure points. More stringent and specific training and greater experience is required to compensate for the higher risk involved. The rebreather's economic use of gas, typically of oxygen per minute, allows dives of much longer duration for an equivalent gas supply than is possible with open-circuit equipment where gas consumption may be ten times higher.\nThere are two main variants of rebreather\u00a0\u2013 semi-closed circuit rebreathers, and fully closed circuit rebreathers, which include the subvariant of oxygen rebreathers. Oxygen rebreathers have a maximum safe operating depth of around , but several types of fully closed circuit rebreathers, when using a helium-based diluent, can be used deeper than . The main limiting factors on rebreathers are the duration of the carbon dioxide scrubber, which is generally at least 3 hours, increased work of breathing at depth, reliability of gas mixture control, and the requirement to be able to safely bail out at any point of the dive.\nRebreathers are generally used for scuba applications, but are also occasionally used for bailout systems or gas extenders for surface supplied diving.\nThe possible endurance of a rebreather dive is longer than an open-circuit dive, for similar weight and bulk of the set, if the set is bigger than the practical lower limit for rebreather size, and a rebreather can be more economical when used with expensive gas mixes such as heliox and trimix, but this may require a lot of diving before the break-even point is reached, due to the high initial and running costs of most rebreathers, and this point will be reached sooner for deep dives where the gas saving is more pronounced.\nDiving cylinders.\nGas cylinders used for scuba diving come in various sizes and materials and are typically designated by material\u00a0\u2013 usually aluminium or steel, and size. In the U.S. the size is designated by their nominal capacity, the volume of the gas they contain when expanded to normal atmospheric pressure. Common sizes include 80, 100, 120 cubic feet, etc., with the most common being the \"Aluminum 80\". In most of the rest of the world the size is given as the actual internal volume of the cylinder, sometimes referred to as water capacity, as that is how it is measured and marked (WC) on the cylinder (10 liter, 12 liter, etc.).\nCylinder working pressure will vary according to the standard of manufacture, generally ranging from up to .\nAn aluminium cylinder is thicker and bulkier than a steel cylinder of the same capacity and working pressure, as suitable aluminium alloys have lower tensile strength than steel, and is more buoyant although actually heavier out of the water, which means the diver would need to carry more ballast weight. Steel is also more often used for high pressure cylinders, which carry more air for the same internal volume.\nThe common method of blending nitrox by partial pressure requires that the cylinder is in \"oxygen service\", which means that the cylinder and cylinder valve have had any non-oxygen-compatible components replaced and any contamination by combustible materials removed by cleaning.\nDiving cylinders are sometimes colloquially called \"tanks\" \"scuba tanks\", \"bottles\" or \"flasks\", and some of these may be equivalent to the correct term in other languages although the proper technical term for them is \"cylinder\" or \"scuba cylinder\".\nRebreather divers and some open-circuit scuba divers carry extra diving cylinders for bailout in case the main breathing gas supply is used up or malfunctions. If the bailout cylinder is small, they may be called \"pony cylinders\". They have their own demand regulators and mouthpieces, and are technically distinct extra scuba sets. In technical diving, the diver may carry different equipment for different phases of the dive. Some breathing gas mixes, such as trimix, may only be used at depth, and others, such as pure oxygen, may only be used during decompression stops in shallow water. The heaviest cylinders are generally carried on the back supported by a backplate while others are side slung from strong points on the harness.\nHarness configuration.\nThe scuba set can be carried by the diver in several ways. The two most common basic mounting configurations are back-mount and side-mount, and back-mount may be expanded to include auxiliary side-mounting, including bungee-constrained low profile side-mount, and the less compact sling-mount or stage-mount arrangement. A few diving rebreathers are chest mounted.\nBack mount.\nBack mounted scuba is straightforward, popular and for a single cylinder well balanced and easy to learn to use. There are several variations on the configuration which have been developed to improve convenience, safety, or suitability for use with multiple cylinders.\nStabilizer jacket.\nThe most common configuration for recreational diving is the stabilizer jacket harness, in which a single cylinder, or occasionally twins, is strapped to the jacket style buoyancy compensator which is used as the harness. Some jacket style harnesses allow a bailout or decompression cylinder to be sling mounted from D-rings on the harness. A small bailout cylinder (pony cylinder) can also be strapped to the side of the main back-mounted cylinder.\nBackplate and wing.\nAnother popular configuration is the backplate and wing arrangement, which uses a back inflation buoyancy compensator bladder sandwiched between a rigid backplate and the main gas cylinder or cylinders. This arrangement is particularly popular with twin or double cylinder sets, and can be used to carry larger sets of three or four cylinders and most rebreathers. Additional cylinders for decompression can be sling mounted at the diver's sides.\nPlain backpack.\nIt is also possible to use a plain backpack harness to support the set, either with a horse-collar buoyancy compensator, or without any buoyancy compensator. This was the standard arrangement before the introduction of the buoyancy compensator, and is still used by some recreational and professional divers when it suits the diving operation.\nBailout and safety harness.\nSurface-supplied divers are generally required to carry an emergency gas supply, also known as a bailout set, which is usually back-mounted open circuit scuba connected into the breathing gas supply system by connecting an interstage hose to the gas switching block, (or bailout block), mounted on the side of the helmet or full-face mask, or on the diver's harness where it can easily be reached, but is unlikely to be accidentally opened. Other mounting arrangements may be used for special circumstances.\nIntegrated harness and storage/transport container.\nThe Mini B scuba system is an open circuit scuba set with an integral harness and soft transport/storage bag. These units consist of a rucksack with a one size fits all harness, inside which is an air cell for buoyancy control, a horizontally mounted cylinder, and a regulator with primary and octopus demand valves, and a console with submersible pressure gauge and depth gauge, which protrude from the top of the unit when in use. Some military rebreathers such as the Interspiro DCSC and the Russian IDA71 also store the breathing hoses inside the housing when not in use.\nStage mounting.\nTechnical divers may need to carry several different gas mixtures, or several extra cylinders with additional gas needed for the dive. These are intended to be used for different stages of the planned dive profile, and for safety reasons it is necessary for the diver to be able to check which gas is in use at any given depth and time, and to open and close the supply valves when required, so the gases are generally carried in fully self-contained independent scuba sets, which are suspended from the harness at the diver's sides. This arrangement is known as stage mounting, or sling mounting, the scuba sets known as stage sets or stage cylinders, and usually applies to cylinders additional to the main back mounted set or sets.\nDrop tanks.\nStage sets may be cached along a penetration guideline to be retrieved during exit for convenience. These are also called drop tanks. A drop tank is usually rigged to be carried in a sling mount, and has a regulator with a pressure gauge fitted and is deposited at a suitable place along the guideline, usually clipped to the line to ensure that it can be found again. The amount of gas in a drop tank can vary depending on how it is intended to be used. The gas mix must be suitable for the stage in which it will be used, and will be marked on a label, usually with the user's name, to avoid confusion. The cylinder valve is closed until the time of use.\nStage-only mounting.\nSimilar in basic concept to side mount and may be confused with it, but does not use bungees to control the top of the cylinder. No back mounted cylinder is carried, and all cylinders are slung at the sides like regular stage cylinders, so they do not tuck in under the arms for streamlining and low profile.\nSidemount.\nSide-mount harnesses support the cylinders by clipping them to D-rings or butt rails at the hip on either or both sides, and the cylinders hang roughly parallel to the diver's torso when underwater. The top of the cylinder is held under the diver's shoulder by a bungee, keeping it roughly parallel to the torso, and may also be clipped onto the harness in the shoulder area by a bolt snap for security. The harness usually includes a buoyancy compensator bladder. It is possible for a skilled diver to carry up to 3 cylinders on each side with this system.\nMonkey diving.\nRecreational diving configuration with only a single side-mounted cylinder.\nNo-mount diving.\nFor some cave diving applications where there is little or no swimming involved and tight restrictions, the diver may carry one or more cylinders simply clipped to the harness or weightbelt, which can be unclipped when necessary to pass through a restriction. This has been called no-mount diving.\nHarness construction.\nEvery scuba harness requires a system for supporting the cylinders on the harness, and a system for attaching the harness to the diver.\nBack mount.\nThe most common system has the scuba set carried on the back of the diver. This uses well developed and familiar load carrying harness systems developed for terrestrial activities, and keeps the bulky and heavy components clear of the chest area. Back mounting also tends to restrict access to the control valves for the gas supply, and puts most of the set where the diver cannot see it.\nBasic harness.\nThe most basic arrangement for a back-mounted set consists of a metal or webbing strap around the cylinder just below the shoulder, and another lower down the cylinder, to which webbing shoulder and waist straps are attached. Shoulder straps can be of fixed length to suit a particular diver, but are more often adjustable. Sometimes a quick release buckle is added to one or both of the shoulder straps. The waist belt has a buckle for closing and release, and the waist belt is usually adjustable for security and comfort. Various attachments have been used to attach the harness straps to the cylinder bands. A crotch strap is optional, and usually runs from the lower cylinder band to the front of the waistband. This strap prevents the set from riding upwards on the diver when in use. This arrangement is still occasionally seen in use.\nBackplate or backpack harness.\nThe characteristic difference between this and the basic harness, is that a rigid or flexible backplate is added between the cylinder and the harness straps. The cylinder is attached to the backplate by metal or webbing straps, and the harness straps are attached to the backplate. In other respects the system is similar to the basic harness. Methods of fixing the cylinder include metal clamping bands, secured by bolts or lever operated clamps, or webbing straps, usually secured by cam buckles.\nThis style of harness was originally used in this simple form, but is currently more usually used with a back inflation wing type buoyancy compensator sandwiched between the cylinder and the backplate.\nCam bands.\nThe combination of webbing strap and cam action buckle that is used to secure the cylinder to a buoyancy compensator or backplate is known as a cam band or cam strap. They are a type of tank band, which includes the stainless steel straps used to hold twin cylinder sets together. They generally rely on an over-centre lever action to provide tensioning and locking, which may be modified by length adjustment slots and secondary security fastening such as velcro to hold the free end in place. Most cam buckles for scuba are injection moulded plastic, but some are stainless steel. Many recreational scuba harnesses rely on a single cam band to hold the cylinder to the backplate. Other models provide two cam bands for security. A cam band can also be used on a sling or sidemount scuba set to attach the lower clip to the cylinder.\nTank bands.\nStainless steel tank bands are the standard method for supporting manifolded twin cylinders, as they provide good support for the cylinders, minimise loads on the manifolds and provide simple and reliable attachment points for connection to a backplate\nFront mount.\nAlmost exclusively used for military rebreathers and escape sets.\nIntegrated harness and storage bag.\nA few examples of integrating a storage and carrying bag into the harness have been made, without notable success for open circuit scuba. The most successful examples have been for military rebreathers, where there has been space in a rigid housing to fit the breathing hoses, mask or DSV, and simple harness straps inside the casing when the counterlungs are empty.\nSidemount harness.\nThe most basic sidemount harness is little more than cylinders fitted with belt loops and slid onto the standard caver's belay or battery belt along with any extra weights needed to achieve neutral buoyancy, and a caver's belt mounted battery pack. This simple configuration is particularly low profile and suited to small cylinders.\nA more complex but still minimalist system is a webbing harness with shoulder straps, waist belt and crotch strap, supporting a variety of sliders and D-rings for attachment of cylinders and accessories, with or without integrated weighting or separate weight belts, and with or without a back mounted buoyancy compensator, which may be attached to the harness, or directly to the diver. Cylinders are usually attached to a shoulder or chest D-ring and waist belt D-ring on each side.\nSling and sidemount rigging.\nThe rigging of sling and sidemount cylinders is similar, but not identical. Sling rigging includes a bolt snap at the shoulder and one near the base of the cylinder, which are clipped to the main scuba harness, which may be either back or sidemount arrangement with D-rings or rails as attachment points. The sidemount cylinder rigging may omit the shoulder clip, and has a bungee loop on the harness to secure and confine the top end of the set.\nAccessories.\nBuoyancy compensator.\nIn most scuba sets, a buoyancy compensator (BC) or buoyancy control device (BCD), such as a back-mounted wing or stabilizer jacket (also known as a \"stab jacket\"), is built into the harness. Although strictly speaking this is not a part of the breathing apparatus, it is usually connected to the diver's air supply, to provide easy inflation of the device. This can usually also be done manually via a mouthpiece, in order to save air while on the surface, or in case of a malfunction of the pressurized inflation system. The BCD inflates with air from the low pressure inflator hose to increase the volume of the scuba equipment and cause the diver gain buoyancy. Another button opens a valve to deflate the BCD and decrease the volume of the equipment and causes the diver to lose buoyancy. Some BCDs allow for integrated weight, meaning that the BCD has special pockets for the weights that can be dumped easily in case of an emergency. The function of the BCD, while underwater, is to keep the diver neutrally buoyant, \"i.e.\", neither floating up nor sinking. The BCD is used to compensate for the compression of a wet suit, and to compensate for the decrease of the diver's mass as the gas from the cylinders is used up.\nBallast.\nBallast is used to increase the average density of the scuba diver and equipment to compensate for the buoyancy of diving equipment, particularly the diving suit, allowing the diver to fully submerge with ease by obtaining neutral or slightly negative buoyancy. Weighting systems originally consisted of solid lead blocks attached to a belt around the diver's waist, but some diving weighting systems are incorporated into the BCD or harness. These systems may use small nylon bags of lead shot or small weights which are distributed around the BCD, allowing a diver to gain a better overall weight distribution leading to a more horizontal trim in the water. Tank weights can be attached to the cylinder or threaded on the cambands holding the cylinder into the BCD.\nMonitoring instruments.\nThe basic instrument for monitoring available gas is the submersible pressure gauge, which indicates the remaining pressure in a scuba cylinder, by directly measuring pressure at a high-pressure port of the regulator first stage. Recreational divers commonly mount the SPG in a rubber or plastic &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;console along with other instruments like a compass, depth gauge and/or dive computer. An alternative to the SPG is a pressure transmitter fitted to a high pressure port that wirelessly transmits the cylinder pressure to the dive computer for display, a system known as air integration.\nMany closed circuit rebreathers use advanced electronics to monitor and regulate the composition of the breathing gas.\nLabelling of contents.\nThe composition of the gas in the scuba cylinder is analysed before use and recorded on a label on the cylinder. This is usually done directly after filling, when handing the cylinder over to the intended user, and when assembling the scuba set for use. The filler is responsible for ensuring that the mixture is within tolerance of the customer's specification, and the user, or in some cases the instructor, is responsible for ensuring that the mixture is suitable for the planned dive. Each person who analyses the gas is responsible for ensuring that the analysis matches the label on the cylinder. The default value is air, which does not always require a specific label. If the gas is air and the cylinder is identified for air only by colour code or labeling it man not be obligatory to analyse the contents.\nMouthpiece retaining straps.\nA mouthpiece retaining strap (MRS) is an item of safety equipment which is a mandatory design feature for rebreathers sold in the EU and UK, following European rebreather standard EN14143:2013. Mouthpiece retaining straps have been shown in navy experience over several years to be effective at protecting the airway in an unconscious rebreather diver as an alternative to a full-face mask. The arrangement is required to be adjustable or self adjusting, to hold the mouthpiece firmly and comfortably in the user's mouth, and to maintain a seal. The MRS also reduces stress on the jaw during the dive.\nMouthpiece retaining straps have also been used with open circuit scuba, both on single hose and twin hose units. They were quite common as original manufacturer's equipment in the 1960s, when they were usually called neck straps, but at some stage lost popularity. The technical diving community later developed a similar functioning accessory generally referred to as a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;reguator necklace or bungee necklace, an aftermarket or home made elastic loop, generally used to hold the secondary demand valve in a position under the chin where it can be accessed hands-free by tilting the head. It can also be used to hold a primary demand valve in the same way, which will keep it in close proximity to the face if accidentally dropped or dislodged, making it often possible to recover hands-free. This type of retainer does not necessarily keep the mouthpiece in place in the diver's mouth or maintain a seal if the diver loses consciousness, as the fit is not always adjustable. The bungee necklace can be pulled away from the neck with a moderate force, causing the rubber mouthpiece to pop out of the retaining loop.\nHose swivels.\nSwivel fittings between the low pressure hose and the second stage inlet connection are available which allow either a fixed angle or a variable angle between hose and demand valve housing. These allow a wider range of comfortable hose routings, particularly useful for stage and side-mount cylinders, but add another potential point of failure at the swivel joint. Swivels are also occasionally used between first stage and hose to provide better hose routing, but these usually have a fixed angle. The two types are not interchangeable, and can be recognised by the thread and O-ring arrangement.\nSecond stage isolation valve.\nA manually operated shut-off valve may be fitted between the low-pressure hose and the second stage, which can be used to isolate the second stage in a free-flow, or at any time when it is necessary. When this is fitted, an over-pressure relief valve us necessary on the first stage. Low profile valves operated by sliding an axial sleeve are available for this purpose and are less likely to snag than a quarter-turn ball valve, and are faster to operate than a screw-down valve, such as is standard on diving helmets for bailout.\nAdaptor for full-face mask.\nAdaptors for some second stages are available to connect them to some models of full-face diving mask. The Dr\u00e4ger P-port system with a bayonet connector is used on Dr\u00e4ger Panorama masks, The Ocean Reef mask has a screw in connection, and the Kirby-Morgan 48 SuperMask uses a clip-on \"pod\" system\nDiffuser.\nA diffuser is a component fitted over the exhaust outlet to break up the exhaled gas into bubbles small enough not to be seen above the surface the water, and make less noise (see acoustic signature). They are used in combat diving, to avoid detection by surface observers or by underwater hydrophones, Underwater mine disposal operations conducted by clearance divers, to make less noise, to reduce the risk of detonating acoustic mines, and in marine biology, to avoid disruption of fish behavior.\nDesigning an adequate diffuser for a rebreather is much easier than for open-circuit scuba, as the gas flow rate is generally much lower. An open-circuit diffuser system called the \"scuba muffler\" was prototyped by Eddie Paul in the early 1990s for underwater photographers John McKenney and Marty Snyderman; the prototype had two large filter stones mounted on the back of the cylinder with a hose connected to the exhaust ports of the second-stage regulator. The filter stones were mounted on a hinged arm to float above the diver, to set up a depth-pressure-differential suction effect to counteract the extra exhalation pressure needed to breathe out through the diffuser. The scuba muffler was claimed to cut the exhalation noise by 90%. Closed circuit rebreathers proved more useful in letting divers get near sharks.\nGas endurance of a scuba set.\nGas endurance of a scuba set is the time that the gas supply will last during a dive. This is influenced by the type of scuba set and the circumstances in which it is used.\nOpen circuit.\nThe gas endurance of open-circuit-demand scuba depends on factors such as the capacity (volume of gas) in the diving cylinder, the depth of the dive and the breathing rate of the diver, which is dependent on exertion, fitness, physical size of the diver, state of mind, and experience, among other factors. New divers frequently consume all the air in a standard \"aluminum 80\" cylinder in 30 minutes or less on a typical dive, while experienced divers frequently dive for 60 to 70 minutes at the same average depth, using the same capacity cylinder, as they have learned more efficient diving techniques.\nAn open-circuit diver whose breathing rate at the surface (atmospheric pressure) is 15 litres per minute will consume 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 litres of gas per minute at 20 metres. [(20 m/10 m per bar) + 1 bar atmospheric pressure] \u00d7 15 L/min = 45 L/min). If an 11-litre cylinder filled to 200 bar is to be used until there is a reserve of 17% there is (83% \u00d7 200 \u00d7 11) = 1826 litres available. At 45 L/min the dive at depth will be a maximum of 40.5 minutes (1826/45). These depths and times are typical of experienced recreational divers leisurely exploring a coral reef using standard 200 bar \"aluminum 80\" cylinders as may be rented from a commercial recreational diving operation in most tropical island or coastal resorts.\nSemi-closed rebreather.\nA semi-closed circuit rebreather may have an endurance of about 3 to 10 times that of the equivalent open-circuit dive, and is less affected by depth; gas is recycled but fresh gas must be constantly injected to replace at least the oxygen used, and any excess gas from this must be vented. Although it uses gas more economically, the weight of the rebreather encourages the diver to carry smaller cylinders. Still, most semi-closed systems allow at least twice the duration of average sized open-circuit systems (around two hours) and are often limited by scrubber endurance.\nClosed circuit rebreathers.\nAn oxygen rebreather diver or a fully closed circuit rebreather diver consumes about 1 litre of oxygen corrected to atmospheric pressure per minute. Except during ascent or descent, the fully closed circuit rebreather that is operating correctly uses very little or no diluent. A diver with a 3-litre oxygen cylinder filled to 200 bar who leaves 25% in reserve will be able to do a 450-minute = 7.5 hour dive (75% \u00d7 3 litres \u00d7 200 bar \u00d7 1 litre per minute = 450 minutes). This endurance is independent of depth. The life of the soda lime scrubber is likely to be less than this and so will be the limiting factor of the dive.\nIn practice, dive times for rebreathers are more often influenced by other factors, such as water temperature and the need for safe ascent (see Decompression (diving)), and this is generally also true for large-capacity open-circuit sets.\nHazards and safety.\nScuba sets contain breathing gas at high pressure. The stored energy of the gas can do considerable damage if released in an uncontrolled manner. The highest risk is during charging of cylinders, but injuries have also occurred when cylinders have been stored in excessively hot environment, which can increase the gas pressure and may occasionally result in explosive rupture of damaged cylinders, by the use of incompatible cylinder valves, which can blow out under load, or by rupture of regulator hoses in contact with the user, as a pressure of more than can rupture the skin, and inject gas into the tissues, along with possible contaminants.\nScuba is safety-critical equipment, as some modes of failure can put the user at immediate risk of death by drowning, and a catastrophic failure of a scuba cylinder can instantly kill or severely injure persons in the vicinity. Open circuit scuba is considered highly reliable if correctly assembled, tested, filled, maintained and used, and the risk of failure is fairly low, but high enough that it should be considered in dive planning, and where appropriate, precautions should be taken to allow appropriate response in case of a failure. Mitigation options depend on the circumstances and mode of failure.\nErgonomics.\nWhen the diver carries several diving cylinders, especially those made of steel, lack of buoyancy can be a problem, particularly at the start of a dive when they are all full, and the variation of buoyancy during the dive as the gas is used can require high-capacity buoyancy compensators to allow the diver to effectively maintain neutral buoyancy throughout the dive.\nA large number of cylinders, hoses and fittings passing through the water tends to increase hydrodynamic drag, reducing swimming efficiency.\nHistory.\nBy the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets. The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50\u201360% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. This apparatus had no way of measuring the gas composition during use. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dr\u00e4ger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA, (an acronym for \"self-contained underwater breathing apparatus\"), which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity.\nAlthough a working demand regulator system had been invented in 1864 by Auguste Denayrouze and Beno\u00eet Rouquayrol, the first open-circuit scuba system developed in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France was a manually adjusted free-flow system with a low endurance, which limited the practical usefulness of the system. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and \u00c9mile Gagnan designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. This was patented in 1945. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company, and in 1948 to Siebe Gorman of England, Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. The patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first Porpoise Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.\nEarly scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back. Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid. In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit an oral inflation valve and a dump valve lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.\nA backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a \"wing\" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit. Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic scuba sets, each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave as, sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves, and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made wreck diving penetrations. Sidemount diving has grown in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and has become a popular specialty for recreational diving.\nTechnical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the generally accepted recreational limits, and may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risks of serious injury or death. These risks may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations. Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving.\nThe challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles and ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth. In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium. Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These overtones are then modulated to alter the source sound. This modulation can happen in a wide variety of ways, such as voltage-controlled or low-pass filters.\nThe technology developed in experimental electronic studios which were primarily focused on telecommunications and military applications. Early examples include Bell Labs' Voder (1937\u20138). Composers began applying the concept of subtractive synthesis beyond the recording studio in concert music. Henri Pousseur's \"Scambi\" (1957) subjects white noise to filters and uses the resulting sounds to create montages. \"Mikrophonie I\" (1964) by Karlheinz Stockhausen uses a tam-tam and a microphone as the primary sound source which is then filtered extensively by two sound projectionists.\nUntil the advent of digital synthesizers, subtractive synthesis was the nearly universal electronic method of sound production. Its popularity was due largely to its relative simplicity. Subtractive synthesis was so prevalent in analog synthesizers that it is sometimes called \"analog synthesis\". It was the method of sound production in instruments like the Trautonium (1930), Novachord (1939), Buchla 100 (1960s), EMS VCS 3 (1969), Minimoog (1970), ARP 2600 (1971), Oberheim OB-1 (1978), and Korg MS-20 (1978). Programmable sound generators (PSG) relied heavily on subtractive synthesis. PSGs were used in many personal computers, arcade games, and home consoles such as the Commodore 64, Atari ST, Mattel's Intellivision, Sega's Master System, and the ZX Spectrum.\nNomenclature.\nSubtractive synthesis has become a catchall for a method where source sounds are modulated, and it is sometimes applied inappropriately.\nMethod.\nThe following is an example of subtractive synthesis as it might occur in an electronic instrument to emulate the sound of a plucked string. It was created with a personal computer program designed to emulate an analogue subtractive synthesizer.\nSource Sound.\nFirst, an electronic oscillator produces a relatively complex waveform with audible overtones. Only one oscillator is necessary, and the number can vary widely. In this case, two oscillators are used:\nPulse-width modulation is applied to both waveforms to create a more complex tone with vibrato:\nThe pulse-width modulated sounds are now combined at equal volume. Combining them at different volumes would create different timbres. The result is a 2-second source sound, which is ready for subtractive synthesis.\nSubtractive Synthesis.\nThe combined wave is passed through a voltage-controlled amplifier connected to an envelope generator. The parameters of the sound's envelope (attack, decay, sustain and release) are manipulated to change its sound. In this case, the decay is vastly increased, sustain is reduced, and the release shortened. The resulting sound is audible for half as long as the source sound:\nWith its new envelope, the sound is run through a low-pass filter, which reduces the volume of higher overtones:\nTo better emulate the sound of a plucked string, the filter's cutoff frequency is raised.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28504", "revid": "48227547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28504", "title": "San Diego", "text": "San Diego ( ; ) is a city on the Pacific coast of Southern California, adjacent to the Mexico\u2013United States border. It is the eighth-most populous city in the U.S. and second-most populous city in California with a population of over 1.4 million, while the San Diego metropolitan area with over 3.3 million residents is the 18th-largest metropolitan area in the country. San Diego is the county seat of San Diego County. It is known for its mild Mediterranean climate, extensive beaches and parks, long association with the United States Navy, and recent emergence as a wireless, electronics, healthcare, and biotechnology development center.\nHistorically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego has been referred to as the \"Birthplace of California\", as it was the first site visited and settled by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States. In 1542, Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California, 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire. California was ceded to the U.S. in 1848 following the Mexican\u2013American War and was admitted as the 31st state in 1850.\nThe largest sectors of the economy of San Diego include military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, research, and manufacturing. The city is home to several universities, including UC San Diego, San Diego State University, and the University of San Diego. San Diego is the economic center of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana region, the second-most populous transborder metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere, home to an estimated five million people as of 2022. The primary border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, the San Ysidro Port of Entry, is the busiest international land border crossing in the world outside of Asia (fourth-busiest overall). San Diego International Airport (SAN) is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States.\nName.\nSan Diego's name can be traced back to the 17th century when Spanish explorer Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno bestowed it upon the area in 1602. He named the bay and the surrounding area \"San Diego de Alcal\u00e1\" in honor of Saint Didacus of Alcal\u00e1.\nPrior to the Spanish establishment of San Diego, the Kumeyaay town was called Kosa'aay, meaning \"drying out place\" in the Kumeyaay language. After the establishment of San Diego, the Kumeyaay called town and city \"Tepacul Watai\", meaning \"Stacked Big\". Luise\u00f1o speakers in the North County region called it \"Pushuyi\".\nHistory.\nPre-colonial period.\nWhat has been referred to as the San Dieguito complex was established in the area at least 9,000 years ago. The Kumeyaay may have culturally evolved from this complex or migrated into the area around 1000 C.E. Archaeologist Malcolm Rogers hypothesized that the early cultures of San Diego were separate from the Kumeyaay, but this claim is disputed. Rogers later reevaluated his claims, yet they were influential in shaping historical tellings of early San Diego history.\nThe Kumeyaay established villages scattered across the region, including the village of Kosa'aay which was the Kumeyaay village that the future settlement of San Diego would stem from in today's Old Town. The village of Kosa'aay was made up of thirty to forty families living in pyramid-shaped housing structures and was supported by a freshwater spring from the hillsides.\nSpanish period.\nThe first European to visit the region was explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo. Sailing his flagship \"San Salvador\" from Navidad, New Spain, Cabrillo claimed the bay for the Spanish Empire in 1542, and named the site \"San Miguel\". In November 1602, Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for the Catholic Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as \"San Diego de Alcal\u00e1\".\nThe permanent European colonization of both California and San Diego began in 1769 with the arrival of four contingents of Spaniards from New Spain and the Baja California peninsula. Two seaborne parties reached San Diego Bay: the \"San Carlos\", under Vicente Vila and including as notable members the engineer and cartographer Miguel Costans\u00f3 and the soldier and future governor Pedro Fages, and the \"San Antonio\", under Juan P\u00e9rez. An initial overland expedition to San Diego from the south was led by the soldier Fernando Rivera and included the Franciscan missionary, explorer, and chronicler Juan Cresp\u00ed, followed by a second party led by the designated governor Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 and including the mission president Jun\u00edpero Serra.\nIn May 1769, Portol\u00e0 established the Presidio of San Diego on a hill near the San Diego River above the Kumeyaay village of Cosoy, which would later become incorporated into the Spanish settlement, making it the first settlement by Europeans in what is now the state of California. In July of the same year, Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 was founded by Franciscan friars under Serra. The mission became a site for a Kumeyaay revolt in 1775, which forced the mission to relocate up the San Diego River. By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper. Mission San Diego was the southern anchor in Alta California of the historic mission trail El Camino Real. Both the Presidio and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.\nMexican period.\nIn 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, and San Diego became part of the Mexican territory of Alta California. In 1822, Mexico began its attempt to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1834, and most of the Mission lands were granted to former soldiers. The 432 residents of the town petitioned the governor to form a pueblo, and Juan Mar\u00eda Osuna was elected the first \"alcalde\" (\"municipal magistrate\"). Beyond the town, Mexican land grants expanded the number of California ranchos that modestly added to the local economy.\nHowever, San Diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s, this was due to increasing tension between the settlers and the indigenous Kumeyaay and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents. The ranchos in the San Diego region faced Kumeyaay raids in the late 1830s and the town itself faced raids in the 1840s.\nAmericans gained an increased awareness of California, and its commercial possibilities, from the writings of two countrymen involved in the often officially forbidden, to foreigners, but economically significant hide and tallow trade, where San Diego was a major port and the only one with an adequate harbor: William Shaler's \"Journal of a Voyage Between China and the North-Western Coast of America, Made in 1804\" and Richard Henry Dana's more substantial and convincing account, of his 1834\u201336 voyage, \"Two Years Before the Mast\".\nIn 1846, the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California. At first, they had an easy time of it, capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1, the American garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andr\u00e9s Pico. \nIn the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's command. Stockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the \"Treaty of Cahuenga\" on January 13, 1847. As a result of the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u201348, the territory of Alta California, including San Diego, was ceded to the United States by Mexico, under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was \"for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco\", and the Mexican\u2013American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of San Diego Bay.\nAmerican period.\nThe state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850. That same year San Diego was designated the seat of the newly established County of San Diego and was incorporated as a city. Joshua H. Bean, the last alcalde of San Diego, was elected the first mayor. Two years later the city was bankrupt; the California legislature revoked the city's charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees, where it remained until 1889. A city charter was reestablished in 1889, and today's city charter was adopted in 1931.\nThe original town of San Diego was located at the foot of Presidio Hill, in the area which is now Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. The location was not ideal, being several miles away from navigable water at its port at La Playa. In 1850, William Heath Davis promoted a new development by the bay shore called \"New San Diego\", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier, a few houses and an Army depot for the support of Fort Yuma. After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by steamboats on the Colorado River and the depot fell into disuse. From 1857 to 1860, San Diego became the western terminus of the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line, the earliest overland stagecoach and mail operation from the Eastern United States to California, coming from Texas through New Mexico Territory in less than 30 days.\nIn the late 1860s, Alonzo Horton promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called \"New Town\" and which became downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because its location on San Diego Bay was convenient to shipping. New Town soon eclipsed the original settlement, known to this day as Old Town, and became the economic and governmental heart of the city. Still, San Diego remained a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878.\nIn 1912, San Diego was the site of a free speech fight between the Industrial Workers of the World and the city government who passed an ordinance forbidding the freedom of speech along an area of \"Soapbox Row\" that led to civil disobedience, vigilantism, police violence, the abduction of Emma Goldman's husband Ben Reitman and multiple riots. San Diego's proximity to Tijuana during the Mexican Revolution made this one of the most significant free speech fights during the Wobbly era.\nIn 1916, the neighborhood of Stingaree, the original home of San Diego's first Chinatown and \"Soapbox Row\", was demolished by anti-vice campaigners to make way for the Gaslamp Quarter.\nIn the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted the World's Fair twice: the Panama\u2013California Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past.\nThe southern portion of the Point Loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852. Over the next several decades the Army set up a series of coastal artillery batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans. Significant U.S. Navy presence began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma, and expanded greatly during the 1920s. By 1930, the city was host to Naval Base San Diego, Naval Training Center San Diego, San Diego Naval Hospital, Camp Matthews, and Camp Kearny (now Marine Corps Air Station Miramar). The city was also an early center for aviation: as early as World War I, San Diego was proclaiming itself \"The Air Capital of the West\". The city was home to important airplane developers and manufacturers like Ryan Airlines (later Ryan Aeronautical), founded in 1925, and Consolidated Aircraft (later Convair), founded in 1923. Charles A. Lindbergh's plane, the \"Spirit of St. Louis\", was built in San Diego in 1927 by Ryan Airlines.\nDuring World War II, San Diego became a major hub of military and defense activity, due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers. The city's population grew rapidly during and after World War II, more than doubling between 1930 (147,995) and 1950 (333,865). During the final months of the war, the Japanese had a plan to target multiple U.S. cities for biological attack, starting with San Diego. The plan was called \"Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night\" and called for kamikaze planes filled with fleas infected with plague (\"Yersinia pestis\") to crash into civilian population centers in the city, hoping to spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians. The plan was scheduled to launch on September 22, 1945, but the plan was not carried out because Japan surrendered five weeks earlier.\nAfter World War II, the military continued to play a major role in the local economy, but post\u2013Cold War cutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders to seek to diversify the city's economy by focusing on research and science, as well as tourism.\nIn the early 1960s, Tom Hom would become the first Asian American member of the San Diego City Council. He would be succeeded by Leon Williams, the first Black member of the city council.\nFrom the start of the 20th century through the 1970s, the American tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based in San Diego, \"the tuna capital of the world\". San Diego's first tuna cannery was founded in 1911, and by the mid-1930s the canneries employed more than 1,000 people. A large fishing fleet supported the canneries, mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from Japan, and later from the Azores and Italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like Little Italy and Point Loma. Due to rising costs and foreign competition, the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s.\nDowntown San Diego was in decline in the 1960s and 1970s, but experienced some urban renewal since the early 1980s, including the opening of Horton Plaza, the revival of the Gaslamp Quarter, and the construction of the San Diego Convention Center; Petco Park opened in 2004. Outside of downtown, San Diego annexed large swaths of land and for suburban expansion to the north and control of the San Ysidro Port of Entry.\nAs the Cold War ended, the military shrank and so did defense spending. San Diego has since become a center of the emerging biotech industry and is home to telecommunications giant Qualcomm. San Diego had also grown in the tourism industry with the popularity of attractions such as the San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld San Diego, and Legoland California in Carlsbad.\nGeography.\nAccording to SDSU professor emeritus Monte Marshall, San Diego Bay is \"the surface expression of a north-south-trending, nested graben\". The Rose Canyon and Point Loma fault zones are part of the San Andreas Fault system. About east of the bay are the Laguna Mountains in the Peninsular Ranges, which are part of the American Cordillera.\nThe city lies on approximately 200 deep canyons and hills separating its mesas, creating small pockets of natural open space scattered throughout the city and giving it a hilly geography. Traditionally, San Diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas, while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild. Thus, the canyons give parts of the city a segmented feel, creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density, car-centered environment. The San Diego River runs through the middle of San Diego from east to west, creating a river valley that serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments. Several reservoirs and Mission Trails Regional Park also lie between and separate developed areas of the city.\nNotable peaks within the city limits include Cowles Mountain, the highest point in the city at ; Black Mountain at ; and Mount Soledad at . The Cuyamaca Mountains and Laguna Mountains rise to the east of the city, and beyond the mountains are desert areas. Cleveland National Forest is a half-hour drive from downtown San Diego. Numerous farms are found in the valleys northeast and southeast of the city.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate classification system, the San Diego area has been variously categorized as having either a hot semi-arid climate (\"BSh\" in the original classification and \"BSkn\" in modified K\u00f6ppen classification with the n denoting summer fog) or a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\"). San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters, with most of the annual precipitation falling between December and March. The city has a mild climate year-round, with an average of 201 days above and low rainfall ( annually).\nThe climate in San Diego, like most of Southern California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances, resulting in microclimates. In San Diego, this is mostly because of the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the \"May gray/June gloom\" period, a thick \"marine layer\" cloud cover keeps the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but yields to bright cloudless sunshine approximately inland. Sometimes the June gloom lasts into July, causing cloudy skies over most of San Diego for the entire day. Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. Thus, for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of and August highs of . The city of El Cajon, just inland from downtown San Diego, averages January lows of and August highs of .\nThe average surface temperature of the water at Scripps Pier in the California Current has increased by almost since 1950, according to scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Additionally, the mean minimum is now above , putting San Diego in hardiness zone 11, with the last freeze having occurred many decades ago.\nAnnual rainfall along the coast averages and the median is . The months of December through March supply most of the rain, with February the only month averaging or more. The months of May through September tend to be almost completely dry. Although there are few wet days per month during the rainy period, rainfall can be heavy when it does fall. Rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of San Diego; some of the higher areas can receive per year. Variability from year to year can be dramatic: in the wettest years of 1883/1884 and 1940/1941, more than fell, whilst in the driest years there was as little as . The wettest month on record is December 1921 with .\nSnow in the city is rare, having been observed only six times in the century and a half that records have been kept. On February 21, 2019, snow fell and accumulated in residential areas of the city, but none fell in the downtown area.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEcology.\nLike much of Southern California, the majority of San Diego's current area was originally occupied on the west by coastal sage scrub and on the east by chaparral, plant communities made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.\nSan Diego's broad city limits encompass a number of large nature preserves, including Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, Los Pe\u00f1asquitos Canyon Preserve, and Mission Trails Regional Park. Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and a coastal strip continuing to the north constitute one of only two locations where the rare species of Torrey Pine, \"Pinus torreyana\", is found. \nDue to the steep topography that prevents or discourages building, along with some efforts for preservation, there are also a large number of canyons within the city limits that serve as nature preserves, including Switzer Canyon, Tecolote Canyon Natural Park, and Marian Bear Memorial Park in San Clemente Canyon, as well as a number of small parks and preserves.\nSan Diego County has one of the highest counts of animal and plant species that appear on the endangered list of counties in the United States. Because of its diversity of habitat and its position on the Pacific Flyway, San Diego County has recorded 492 different bird species, more than any other region in the country. San Diego always scores high in the number of bird species observed in the annual Christmas Bird Count, sponsored by the Audubon Society, and it is known as one of the \"birdiest\" areas in the United States.\nSan Diego and its backcountry suffer from periodic wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego was the site of the Cedar Fire, at that time the largest wildfire in California over the past century. The fire burned , killed 15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes. In addition to damage caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week. The October 2007 California wildfires destroyed some areas, particularly within Rancho Bernardo, as well as the nearby communities of Rancho Santa Fe and Ramona.\nNeighborhoods.\nThe City of San Diego recognizes 52 individual areas as Community Planning Areas. Within a given planning area there may be several distinct neighborhoods. Altogether the city contains more than 100 identified neighborhoods.\nDowntown San Diego is located on San Diego Bay. Balboa Park encompasses several mesas and canyons to the northeast, surrounded by older, dense urban communities including Hillcrest and North Park. To the east and southeast lie City Heights, the College Area, and Southeast San Diego. To the north lies Mission Valley and Interstate 8. The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos, and Rancho Bernardo. The far northeast portion of the city encompasses Lake Hodges and the San Pasqual Valley, which holds an agricultural preserve. Carmel Valley and Del Mar Heights occupy the northwest corner of the city. To their south are Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and the business center of the Golden Triangle. Further south are the beach and coastal communities of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Ocean Beach. Point Loma occupies the peninsula across San Diego Bay from downtown. The communities of South San Diego (an Exclave), such as San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, are located next to the Mexico\u2013United States border, and are physically separated from the rest of the city by the cities of National City and Chula Vista. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.\nFor the most part, San Diego neighborhood boundaries tend to be understood by its residents based on geographical boundaries like canyons and street patterns. The city recognized the importance of its neighborhoods when it organized its 2008 General Plan around the concept of a \"City of Villages\".\nCityscape.\nSan Diego was originally centered on the Old Town district, but by the late 1860s the focus had shifted to the bayfront, in the belief that this new location would increase trade. As the \"New Town\" \u2013 present-day Downtown \u2013 waterfront location quickly developed, it eclipsed Old Town as the center of San Diego.\nThe first skyscraper over in San Diego was the El Cortez Hotel, built in 1927; it was the tallest building in the city until 1963. As time went on, multiple buildings claimed the title of San Diego's tallest skyscraper, including the 530 B Street and Symphony Towers. Currently the tallest building in San Diego is One America Plaza, standing tall, which was completed in 1991. The downtown skyline contains no supertall buildings due to a regulation put in place by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the 1970s, which set a limit on the height of buildings within a radius of San Diego International Airport. An iconic description of the skyline includes its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox.\nThere are several new high-rises under construction, including two that exceed 400 feet (122 m) in height.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n2010.\nThe city had a population of 1,307,402 according to the 2010 census, distributed over a land area of . The urban area of San Diego had a total population of 2,956,746, making it the third-largest in the state, after those of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nThe 2010 population represented an increase of just under 7% from the 1,223,400 people reported in 2000. The population density was . The racial makeup of San Diego was 58.9% White, 6.7% Foundational Black American, 0.6% Native American, 15.9% Asian (5.9% Filipino, 2.7% Chinese, 2.5% Vietnamese, 1.3% Indian, 1.0% Korean, 0.7% Japanese, 0.4% Laotian, 0.3% Cambodian, 0.1% Thai). 0.5% Pacific Islander (0.2% Guamanian, 0.1% Samoan, 0.1% Native Hawaiian), 12.3% from other races, and 5.1% from two or more races. 28.8% of the population was Hispanic or Latino (of any race); 24.9% of the total population was of Mexican heritage, 1.4% Spanish and 0.6% Puerto Rican. The median age of Hispanic residents was 27.5 years, compared to 35.1 years overall and 41.6 years among non-Hispanic whites; Hispanic San Diegans were the largest group under the age of 18, while non-Hispanic whites constituted 63.1% of population 55 and older.\nAs of \u00a02019[ [update]], the San Diego City and County had the fifth-largest homeless population among major cities in the United States, with 8,102 people experiencing homelessness. In the city of San Diego, 4,887 individuals were experiencing homelessness according to the 2020 count. A December 11, 2023, article in \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" by Blake Nelson reports a notable decline in the homeless population in downtown San Diego, specifically in the urban core. According to data from the Downtown San Diego Partnership, the number of individuals living outside or in vehicles has reached a two-year low, standing at approximately 1,200 as of last month. The decrease is attributed to the implementation of the city's camping ban and the concerted efforts to establish new shelters. While enforcement has led to relatively few individuals being punished, the threat of legal consequences appears to have played a role in the reduction.In 2000 there were 451,126 households, out of which 30.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.6% were married couples living together, 11.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.8% were non-families. Households made up of individuals account for 28.0%, and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61, and the average family size was 3.30.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2000, 24.0% of San Diego residents were under 18, and 10.5% were 65 and over. As of 2011[ [update]] the median age was 35.6; more than a quarter of residents were under age 20 and 11% were over age 65. Millennials (ages 26 through 42) constitute 27.1% of San Diego's population, the second-highest percentage in a major U.S. city. The San Diego County regional planning agency, SANDAG, provides tables and graphs breaking down the city population into five-year age groups.\nIn 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $45,733, and the median income for a family was $53,060. Males had a median income of $36,984 versus $31,076 for females. The per capita income for the city was $35,199. According to \"Forbes\" in 2005, San Diego was the fifth wealthiest U.S. city, but about 10.6% of families and 14.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.0% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over. As of January 1, 2008, estimates by the San Diego Association of Governments revealed that the household median income for San Diego rose to $66,715, up from $45,733 in 2000.\nSan Diego was named the ninth-most LGBT-friendly city in the U.S. in 2013. The city also has the seventh-highest population of gay residents in the U.S. Additionally in 2013, San Diego State University (SDSU), one of the city's prominent universities, was named one of the top LGBT-friendly campuses in the nation.\nReligion.\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 32% professing adherence to various Protestant churches and 32% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. while 27% claim no religious affiliation. The same study found that followers of other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively made up about 5% of the population.\nForeign-born population.\nThe majority of San Diego's foreign-born population were born in Mexico, the Philippines, China and Vietnam.\nEconomy.\nThe largest sectors of San Diego's economy are defense/military, tourism, international trade, and research/manufacturing. \nSan Diego recorded a median household income of $79,646 in 2018, an increase of 3.89% from $76,662 in 2017. The median property value in San Diego in 2018 was $654,700, and the average home has two cars per household.\nTop employers.\nAccording to the city's 2024 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nDefense and military.\nThe economy of San Diego is influenced by its deepwater port, which includes the only major submarine and shipbuilding yards on the West Coast. Several major national defense contractors were started and are headquartered in San Diego, including General Atomics, Cubic, and NASSCO.\nSan Diego hosts the largest naval fleet in the world: In 2008 it was home to 53 ships, over 120 tenant commands, and more than 35,000 sailors, marines, Department of Defense civilian employees and contractors. About 5 percent of all civilian jobs in the county are military-related, and 15,000 businesses in San Diego County rely on Department of Defense contracts.\nMilitary bases in San Diego include US Navy facilities, Marine Corps bases, and Coast Guard stations.\nThe city is \"home to the majority of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's surface combatants, all of the Navy's West Coast amphibious ships and a variety of Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels\".\nThe military infrastructure in San Diego is still growing and developing, with numerous military personnel stationed there, numbers of which are expected to rise. This plays a significant role in the city's economy, as of 2020[ [update]], it provides roughly 25% of the GDP and provides 23% of the total jobs in San Diego.\nTourism.\nTourism is a major industry owing to the city's climate, beaches, and tourist attractions such as Balboa Park, Belmont Park, San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, and SeaWorld San Diego. San Diego's Spanish and Mexican heritage is reflected in many historic sites across the city, such as Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 and Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. Also, the local craft brewing industry attracts an increasing number of visitors for \"beer tours\" and the annual San Diego Beer Week in November; San Diego has been called \"America's Craft Beer Capital\".\nSan Diego County hosted more than 32\u00a0million visitors in 2012; collectively they spent an estimated $8\u00a0billion. The visitor industry provides employment for more than 160,000 people.\nSan Diego's cruise ship industry used to be the second-largest in California. Numerous cruise lines operate out of San Diego. However, cruise ship business has been in decline since 2008, when the Port hosted over 250 ship calls and more than 900,000 passengers. By 2016\u20132017, the number of ship calls had fallen to 90.\nLocal sightseeing cruises are offered in San Diego Bay and Mission Bay, as well as whale-watching cruises to observe the migration of gray whales, peaking in mid-January. Sport fishing is another popular tourist attraction; San Diego is home to southern California's biggest sport fishing fleet.\nInternational trade.\nSan Diego's commercial port and its location on the United States\u2013Mexico border make international trade an important factor in the city's economy. The city is authorized by the United States government to operate as a foreign-trade zone.\nThe city shares a border with Mexico that includes two border crossings. San Diego hosts the busiest international border crossing in the world, in the San Ysidro neighborhood at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. A second, primarily commercial border crossing operates in the Otay Mesa area; it is the largest commercial crossing on the California\u2013Baja California border and handles the third-highest volume of trucks and dollar value of trade among all United States-Mexico land crossings.\nThe Port of San Diego is the third-busiest port in California and one of the busiest on the West Coast. One of the Port of San Diego's two cargo facilities is located in downtown San Diego at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal. This terminal has facilities for containers, bulk cargo, and refrigerated and frozen storage, so that it can handle the import and export of many commodities. In 2009 the Port of San Diego handled 1,137,054 short tons of total trade; foreign trade accounted for 956,637 short tons while domestic trade amounted to 180,417 short tons.\nHistorically tuna fishing and canning was one of San Diego's major industries, although the American tuna fishing fleet is no longer based in San Diego. Seafood company Bumble Bee Foods is headquartered in San Diego, as was Chicken of the Sea until 2018.\nCompanies.\nSan Diego hosts several major producers of wireless cellular technology. Qualcomm was founded and is headquartered in San Diego, and is one of the largest private-sector employers in San Diego. Other wireless industry manufacturers headquartered here include Nokia, LG Electronics, Kyocera International, Cricket Communications and Novatel Wireless. San Diego also has the U.S. headquarters for the Slovakian security company ESET. San Diego has been designated as an iHub Innovation Center for potential collaboration between wireless and the life sciences.\nThe University of California, San Diego and other research institutions have helped to fuel the growth of biotechnology. In 2013, San Diego had the second-largest biotech cluster in the United States, below Greater Boston and above the San Francisco Bay Area. There are more than 400 biotechnology companies in the area. In particular, the La Jolla and nearby Sorrento Valley areas are home to offices and research facilities for numerous biotechnology companies. Major biotechnology companies like Illumina and Neurocrine Biosciences are headquartered in San Diego, while many other biotech and pharmaceutical companies have offices or research facilities in San Diego. San Diego is also home to more than 140 contract research organizations (CROs) that provide contract services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.\nReal estate.\nSan Diego has high real estate prices. San Diego home prices peaked in 2005, and then declined along with the national trend. As of December 2010, prices were down 36 percent from the peak, median price of homes having declined by more than $200,000 between 2005 and 2010. As of May 2015, the median price of a house was $520,000. In November 2018 the median home price was $558,000. The San Diego metropolitan area had one of the worst housing affordability rankings of all metropolitan areas in the United States in 2009. The San Diego Housing Market experienced a decline in the median sold price of existing single-family homes between December 2022 and January 2023, with a 2.9% decrease from $850,000 to $824,950. As of 2023, the majority of homes (nearly 60%) in San Diego are listed above $1 million, with the city's median home price at $910,000, ranking it fourth highest among the 30 largest U.S. cities.\nConsequently, San Diego has experienced negative net migration since 2004. A significant number of people have moved to adjacent Riverside County, commuting daily to jobs in San Diego, while others are leaving the area altogether and moving to more affordable regions.\nGovernment.\nLocal government.\nThe city is governed by a mayor and a nine-member city council. In 2006, its government changed from a council\u2013manager government to a strong mayor government, as decided by a citywide vote in 2004. The mayor is in effect the chief executive officer of the city, while the council is the legislative body. The City of San Diego is responsible for police, public safety, streets, water and sewer service, planning and zoning, and similar services within its borders. San Diego is a sanctuary city, however, San Diego County is a participant of the Secure Communities program. As of 2011[ [update]], the city had one employee for every 137 residents, with a payroll greater than $733\u00a0million.\nThe members of the city council are each elected from single-member districts within the city. The mayor and city attorney are elected directly by the voters of the entire city. The mayor, city attorney, and council members are elected to four-year terms, with a two-term limit. Elections are held on a non-partisan basis per California state law; nevertheless, most officeholders do identify themselves as either Democrats or Republicans. In 2007, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about 7 to 6 in the city, and Democrats currently (as of 2025[ [update]]) hold all nine seats on the city council. The current mayor, Todd Gloria, is a member of the Democratic Party.\nSan Diego is part of San Diego County, and includes all or part of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th supervisorial districts of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, Other county officers elected in part by city residents include the Sheriff, District Attorney, Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk, and Treasurer/Tax Collector.\nAreas of the city immediately adjacent to San Diego Bay (\"tidelands\") are administered by the Port of San Diego, a quasi-governmental agency which owns all the property in the tidelands and is responsible for its land use planning, policing, and similar functions. San Diego is a member of the regional planning agency San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). Public schools within the city are managed and funded by independent school districts (see below).\nAfter narrowly supporting Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, San Diego provided majorities to all six Republican presidential candidates from 1968 to 1988. However, in more recent decades, San Diego has trended in favor of Democratic presidential candidates for president. George H. W. Bush in 1988 is the last Republican candidate to carry San Diego in a presidential election.\nState and federal representation.\nIn the California State Senate, San Diego County encompasses the 38th, 39th and 40th districts, represented by Catherine Blakespear (D), Akilah Weber (D), and Brian Jones (R), respectively.\nIn the California State Assembly, lying partially within the city of San Diego are the 77th, 78th, 79th, and 80th districts, represented by Tasha Boerner (D), Chris Ward (D), LaShae Sharp-Collins (D), and David Alvarez (D), respectively.\nIn the United States House of Representatives, San Diego County includes parts or all of California's 48th, 49th, 50th, 51st, and 52nd congressional districts, represented by Darrell Issa (R), Mike Levin (D), Scott Peters (D), Sara Jacobs (D), and Juan Vargas (D) respectively.\nScandals.\nSan Diego was the site of the 1912 San Diego free speech fight, in which the city restricted speech, vigilantes brutalized and tortured anarchists, and the San Diego Police Department killed a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\nIn 1916, rainmaker Charles Hatfield was blamed for $4\u00a0million in damages and accused of causing San Diego's worst , during which about 20 Japanese American farmers died.\nThen-mayor Roger Hedgecock was forced to resign his post in 1985, after he was found guilty of one count of conspiracy and 12 counts of perjury, related to the alleged failure to report all campaign contributions. After a series of appeals, the 12 perjury counts were dismissed in 1990 based on claims of juror misconduct; the remaining conspiracy count was reduced to a misdemeanor and then dismissed.\nA 2002 scheme to underfund pensions for city employees led to the San Diego pension scandal. This resulted in the resignation of newly re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy and the criminal indictment of six pension board members. Those charges were finally dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.\nOn November 28, 2005, U.S. Congressman Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham resigned after being convicted on federal bribery charges. He had represented California's 50th congressional district, which includes much of the northern portion of the city of San Diego. In 2006, Cunningham was sentenced to a 100-month prison sentence.\nIn 2005 two city council members, Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet, were convicted of extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates, allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city's \"no touch\" laws at strip clubs. Both subsequently resigned. Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison. In 2009, a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him, and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges; the remaining charges were eventually dropped.\nIn July 2013, three former supporters of Mayor Bob Filner asked him to resign because of allegations of repeated sexual harassment. Over the ensuing six weeks, 18 women came forward to publicly claim that Filner had sexually harassed them, and multiple individuals and groups called for him to resign. Filner agreed to resign effective August 30, 2013, subsequently pleading guilty to one felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges.\nCrime.\nLike most major cities, San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000. 1991 would mark the city's deadliest year, registering 179 homicides within city limits (while the region as a whole peaked at 278 homicides), capping off an unabated, eight-year climb in murders, rapes, robberies, and assault dating back to 1983. At the time, the city was ranked last among the 10 most populous U.S. cities in homicides per 1,000 population, and ninth in crimes per 1,000. From 1980 to 1994, San Diego surpassed 100 murders ten times before tapering off to 91 homicides in 1995. That number would not exceed 79 for the next 15 years. Crime in San Diego increased in the early 2000s. In 2004, San Diego had the sixth lowest crime rate of any U.S. city with over half a million residents. From 2002 to 2006, the crime rate overall dropped 0.8%, though not evenly by category. While violent crime decreased 12.4% during this period, property crime increased 1.1%. Total property crimes per 100,000 people were lower than the national average in 2008.\nAccording to Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2010, there were 5,616\u00a0violent crimes and 30,753\u00a0property crimes. Of these, the violent crimes consisted of forcible rapes, 73 robberies and 170 aggravated assaults, while 6,387\u00a0burglaries, 17,977\u00a0larceny-thefts, 6,389 motor vehicle thefts and 155 acts of arson defined the property offenses. In 2013, San Diego had the lowest murder rate of the ten largest cities in the United States.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nPublic schools in San Diego are operated by independent school districts. The majority of the public schools in the city are served by San Diego Unified School District, the second-largest school district in California, which includes 11 K\u20138 schools, 107 elementary schools, 24 middle schools, 13 atypical and alternative schools, 28 high schools, and 45 charter schools.\nSeveral adjacent school districts which are headquartered outside the city limits serve some schools within the city; these include Poway Unified School District, Del Mar Union School District, San Dieguito Union High School District, and Sweetwater Union High School District. In addition, there are a number of private schools in the city.\nColleges and universities.\nAccording to education rankings released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017, 44.4% of San Diegans (city, not county) ages 25 and older hold bachelor's degrees, compared to 30.9% in the United States as a whole. Wallethub ranks San Diego as the 23rd-most educated city in the United States, based on these figures.\nThe largest university in the area is the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego). The university is the southernmost campus of the University of California system and is the second largest employer in the city. It has the seventh largest research expenditure in the country.\nOther public colleges and universities in the city include San Diego State University (SDSU) and the San Diego Community College District, which includes San Diego City College, San Diego Mesa College, and San Diego Miramar College.\nPrivate non-profit colleges and universities in the city include the University of San Diego (USD), Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU), National University's San Diego campus, University of Redlands' School of Business San Diego campus, and Brandman University's San Diego campus. For-profit institutions include Alliant International University (AIU), Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising's San Diego campus, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, Southern States University (SSU), UEI College, and Woodbury University School of Architecture's satellite campus.\nThere is one medical school in the city, the UC San Diego School of Medicine. There are three ABA accredited law schools in the city, which include California Western School of Law, Thomas Jefferson School of Law, and University of San Diego School of Law. There is also one law school, Western Sierra Law School, not accredited by the ABA.\nLibraries.\nThe city-run San Diego Public Library system is headquartered downtown and has 36 branches throughout the city. The newest location is in Skyline Hills, which broke ground in 2015. The libraries have had reduced operating hours since 2003 due to the city's financial problems. In 2006 the city increased spending on libraries by $2.1\u00a0million. A new nine-story Central Library on Park Boulevard at J Street opened on September 30, 2013.\nIn addition to the municipal public library system, there are nearly two dozen libraries open to the public run by other governmental agencies, and by schools, colleges, and universities. Noteworthy are Malcolm A. Love Library at San Diego State University, and Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego.\nCulture.\nThe culture of San Diego is influenced heavily by the mixing of American and Mexican cultures, due to the city's position on the Mexico\u2013United States border, its large Chicano population, and its history as part of Hispanic America and Mexico. San Diego's longtime association with the U.S. military also contributes to its culture.\nMany popular museums, such as the San Diego Museum of Art, the San Diego Natural History Museum, the Museum of Us, the Museum of Photographic Arts, and the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum, are located in Balboa Park, which is also the location of the San Diego Zoo. The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD) is located in La Jolla and has a branch located at Santa Fe Depot downtown.\nThe Columbia district downtown is home to historic ship exhibits belonging to the Maritime Museum of San Diego, headlined by \"Star of India\", as well as the unrelated USS \"Midway\" Museum featuring the aircraft carrier.\nThe San Diego Symphony at Symphony Towers performs on a regular basis; from 2004 to 2017, its director was Jahja Ling. The San Diego Opera at Civic Center Plaza, directed by David Bennett. Old Globe Theatre at Balboa Park produces about 15 plays and musicals annually. La Jolla Playhouse at UC San Diego is directed by Christopher Ashley. Both the Old Globe Theatre and La Jolla Playhouse have produced the world premieres of plays and musicals that have gone on to win Tony Awards or nominations on Broadway. The Joan B. Kroc Theatre at Kroc Center's Performing Arts Center is a 600-seat state-of-the-art theater that hosts music, dance, and theater performances. Hundreds of movies and a dozen TV shows have been filmed in San Diego, a tradition going back as far as 1898.\nSports.\nSports in San Diego includes major professional league teams, other highest-level professional league teams, minor league teams, and college athletics. San Diego hosts three teams of major professional leagues, the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB), San Diego FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), and San Diego Wave FC of National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). The city is home to several universities whose teams compete in various NCAA Division I sports, most notably the San Diego State Aztecs. The Farmers Insurance Open, a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, is played annually at Torrey Pines Golf Course.\nSan Diego hosted the National Football League (NFL)'s San Diego Chargers from 1961 to 2017, when the team relocated to the Greater Los Angeles area (now the Los Angeles Chargers). The city also hosted the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s San Diego Rockets from 1967 to 1971 (now the Houston Rockets) and from 1978 to 1984 (now the Los Angeles Clippers). San Diego has never hosted a National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, though it hosted the San Diego Mariners of the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1974 to 1977.\nCurrently, there is no NBA, NFL, or NHL team in the city. San Diego is the largest American city not to have won a championship in a \"Big Four\" major professional league. The city does have one major league title to its name: the 1963 American Football League (AFL) Championship won by the San Diego Chargers, when the AFL was an independent entity prior to the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970. Some San Diego sports fans believe there is a curse on professional sports in the city.\nThe San Diego Clippers of the NBA G League have played at Frontwave Arena since 2024. Pechanga Arena hosts The San Diego Gulls of the American Hockey League, and The San Diego Seals of the National Lacrosse League.\nMedia.\nPublished within the city are the daily newspaper, \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" and its online portal of the same name, and the alternative newsweeklies, \"San Diego CityBeat\" and the \"San Diego Reader\". The \"Times of San Diego\" is a free online newspaper covering news in the metropolitan area. \"Voice of San Diego\" is a non-profit online news outlet covering government, politics, education, neighborhoods, and the arts. The \"San Diego Daily Transcript\" is a business-oriented online newspaper. San Diego is also the headquarters of the national far-right cable TV channel One America News Network (OANN).\nSan Diego led U.S. local markets with 69.6 percent broadband penetration in 2004 according to Nielsen//NetRatings.\nSan Diego's first television station was KFMB, which began broadcasting on May 16, 1949. Since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed seven television stations in Los Angeles, two VHF channels were available for San Diego because of its relative proximity to the larger city. In 1952, however, the FCC began licensing UHF channels, making it possible for cities such as San Diego to acquire more stations. Stations based in Mexico (with ITU prefixes of XE and XH) also serve the San Diego market. Television stations today include XHJK-TDT 1 (Azteca Uno), XETV-TDT 6 (Canal 5/Nueve), KFMB 8 (CBS, with The CW/MNTV on DT2), KGTV 10 (ABC), XHCPDE 11 (Once), XEWT 12 (Televisa Regional), KPBS 15 (PBS), KBNT-CD 17 (Univision), XHTIT-TDT 21 (Azteca 7), XHAS-TDT 33 (Canal 66), KDTF-LD 36 (Unim\u00e1s), KNSD 39 (NBC), KSKT-CD 43 (Estrella TV), XHBJ-TDT 45 (Canal 45 PSN), KUAN-LD 48 (Telemundo), XHDTV-TDT 49 (Milenio Televisi\u00f3n), KUSI 51 (Independent), XHUAA-TDT 57 (El Canal de las Estrellas), and KSWB-TV 69 (Fox). San Diego has an 80.6 percent cable penetration rate.\nDue to the ratio of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a television station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require that there would be eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market). As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XETV-TV, XHUAA-TV and XEWT-TV. \nSan Diego's television market is limited to only San Diego County. As a result, San Diego is the largest single-county media market in the United States.\nThe radio stations in San Diego include nationwide broadcaster iHeartMedia, Audacy, Inc., Local Media San Diego, and many other smaller stations and networks. Stations include: KOGO AM 600, KGB AM 760, KCEO AM 1000, KCBQ AM 1170, K-Praise, KLSD AM 1360, KFSD 1450 AM, KPBS-FM 89.5, Channel 933, Star 94.1, FM 94/9, FM News and Talk 95.7, Q96 96.1, KyXy 96.5, Free Radio San Diego (AKA Pirate Radio San Diego) 96.9FM FRSD, KWFN 97.3, KXSN 98.1, Frontera FM 100.7, 101.5 KGB-FM, KLVJ 102.1, KSON 103.7, Rock 105.3, and another \"Pirate Radio\" station at 106.9FM, as well as a number of local Spanish-language radio stations.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nWith the automobile being the primary means of transportation for over 80 percent of residents, San Diego is served by a network of freeways and highways. This includes Interstate\u00a05, which runs south to Tijuana and north to Los Angeles; Interstate 8, which runs east to Imperial County and the Arizona Sun Corridor; Interstate\u00a015, which runs northeast through the Inland Empire to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City; and Interstate 805, which splits from I-5 near the Mexican border and rejoins I-5 at Sorrento Valley.\nMajor state highways include SR\u00a094, which connects downtown with I-805, I-15 and East County; SR\u00a0163, which connects downtown with the northeast part of the city, intersects I-805 and merges with I-15 at Miramar; SR\u00a052, which connects La Jolla with East County through Santee and SR\u00a0125; SR\u00a056, which connects I-5 with I-15 through Carmel Valley and Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos; SR 75, which spans San Diego Bay as the San Diego\u2013Coronado Bridge, and also passes through South San Diego as Palm Avenue; and SR\u00a0905, which connects I-5 and I-805 to the Otay Mesa Port of Entry.\nThe stretch of SR\u00a0163 that passes through Balboa Park is San Diego's oldest freeway, dating back to 1948 when it was part of US\u00a080 and US\u00a0395. It has been called one of America's most beautiful parkways.\nSan Diego's roadway system provides an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to utility cycling. This is partly because the grid street patterns are now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban-style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, the majority of cycling is recreational.\nSan Diego is served by the San Diego Trolley light rail system, by the MTS bus system, the bus rapid transit system Rapid, private jitneys in some neighborhoods, and by Coaster and \"Pacific Surfliner\" commuter rail; northern San Diego County is also served by the Sprinter hybrid rail service. The trolley primarily serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, Mission Valley, east county, and coastal south bay. A mid-coast extension of the trolley operates from Old Town to University City and the University of California, San Diego along Interstate 5 since November 2021. The Amtrak and Coaster trains currently run along the coastline and connect San Diego with Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura via Metrolink and the Pacific Surfliner. There are two Amtrak stations in San Diego, in Old Town and Santa Fe Depot downtown. San Diego transit information about public transportation and commuting is available on the Web and by dialing \"511\" from any phone in the area.\nThe city has two major commercial airports within or near its city limits. San Diego International Airport (SAN) is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States. It served over 24 million passengers in 2018 and is dealing with larger numbers every year. Tijuana International Airport has a terminal within the city limits in the Otay Mesa district connected to the rest of the airport in Tijuana, Mexico, via the Cross Border Xpress cross-border footbridge. In addition, the city has two general-aviation airports, Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport (MYF) and Brown Field Municipal Airport (SDM).\nRecent regional transportation projects have sought to mitigate congestion, including improvements to local freeways, expansion of San Diego Airport, and doubling the capacity of the cruise ship terminal. Freeway projects included expansion of Interstates 5 and 805 around \"The Merge\" where these two freeways meet, as well as expansion of Interstate 15 through North County, which includes new HOV \"managed lanes\". A tollway (the southern portion of SR 125, known as the South Bay Expressway) connects SR 54 and Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border. According to an assessment in 2007, 37 percent of city streets were in acceptable condition. However, the proposed budget fell $84.6\u00a0million short of bringing streets up to an acceptable level. Expansion at the port has included a second cruise terminal on Broadway Pier, opened in 2010. Airport projects include the expansion of Terminal Two.\nUtilities.\nWater is supplied to residents by the Water Department of the City of San Diego. The city receives most of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which brings water to the region from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, via the state project and the Colorado River, via the Colorado Aqueduct. 80-90% of the water supply is imported.\nGas and electric utilities are provided by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a division of Sempra Energy. The company provides energy service to 3.7 million people through 1.5 million electric meters and 900,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties.\nStreet lights.\nIn the mid-20th century the city had mercury vapor street lamps. In 1978, the city decided to replace them with more efficient sodium vapor lamps. This triggered an outcry from astronomers at Palomar Observatory north of the city, concerned that the new lamps would increase light pollution and hinder astronomical observation. The city altered its lighting regulations to limit light pollution within of Palomar.\nIn 2011, the city announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient lights that use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp producing a broader spectrum than sodium vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2\u00a0million per year in energy and maintenance. In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting.\nSister cities.\nSan Diego's sister cities are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
