{"id": "29801", "revid": "50717193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29801", "title": "The Doors", "text": "American rock band\nThe Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, comprising vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, primarily due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona and legal issues. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era's counterculture.\nThe band took its name from the title of the English writer Aldous Huxley's book \"The Doors of Perception\", itself a reference to a quote by the English poet William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors with Morrison recorded and released six studio albums in five years, some of which are generally considered among the greatest of all time, including their debut \"The Doors\" (1967), \"Strange Days\" (1967), \"Morrison Hotel\" (1970)\",\" and \"L.A. Woman\" (1971). Dubbed the \"Kings of Acid Rock\" by \"Life\", they were one of the most successful bands of their time and by 1972, the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8\u00a0million singles.\nMorrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio, releasing two more albums until disbanding in 1973. In 1978, they reformed for the album \"An American Prayer\", which combined new music with Morrison's recitings of his poetry recorded in 1969 and 1970. They reunited again briefly in 1993 when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and for several one-off projects in the 21st century. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as \"The Doors of the 21st Century\". Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek\u2013Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.\nThe Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified Gold and Platinum LPs. According to the RIAA, they have sold 36 million albums in the United States and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including \"Rolling Stone\", which ranked them 41st on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".\nHistory.\nOrigins (July 1965 \u2013 August 1966).\nThe Doors began with a chance meeting between acquaintances Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek on Venice Beach in July 1965. They recognized each other as they had both attended the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. Morrison confided in Manzarek that he had been writing songs. As Morrison would later relate to Jerry Hopkins in \"Rolling Stone\", \"Those first five or six songs I wrote, I was just taking notes at a fantastic rock concert that was going on inside my head. And once I'd written the songs, I had to sing them.\" With Manzarek's encouragement, Morrison sang the opening words of \"Moonlight Drive\": \"Let's swim to the moon, let's climb through the tide, penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide.\" Manzarek was inspired, thinking of the music he could play to accompany these \"cool and spooky\" lyrics.\nManzarek was then in an unsuccessful band called Rick &amp; the Ravens with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer John Densmore was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes. Densmore joined the group later in August 1965. Together, they combined varied musical backgrounds, from jazz, rock, blues, and folk music idioms. The five, along with bass player Patty Sullivan, and now christened the Doors, recorded a six-song demo on September 2, 1965, at World Pacific Studios in Los Angeles. The band took their name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book \"The Doors of Perception\", itself derived from a line in William Blake's \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\": \"If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite\". In late 1965, after Manzarek's two brothers left, guitarist Robby Krieger joined.\nFrom February to May 1966, the group had a residency at the \"rundown\" and \"sleazy\" Los Angeles club London Fog, appearing on the bill with \"Rhonda Lane Exotic Dancer\". The experience gave Morrison confidence to perform in front of a live audience, and the band as a whole to develop and, in some cases, lengthen their songs and work \"The End\" and \"Light My Fire\" into the pieces that would appear on their debut album. Manzarek later said that at the London Fog the band \"became this collective entity, this unit of oneness\u00a0... that is where the magic began to happen.\" The group soon graduated to the more esteemed Whisky a Go Go after being booked by Ronnie Haran, where they were the house band (starting from May 1966), supporting acts, including Van Morrison's group Them. On their last night together the two bands joined up for \"In the Midnight Hour\" and a twenty-minute jam session of \"Gloria\".\nOn August 10, 1966, they were spotted by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman, who was present at the recommendation of Love singer Arthur Lee, whose group was with Elektra Records. After Holzman and producer Paul A. Rothchild saw two sets of the band playing at the Whisky a Go Go, they signed them to the Elektra Records label on August 18\u00a0\u2014 the start of a long and successful partnership with Rothchild and sound engineer Bruce Botnick. The Doors were fired from the Whisky on August 21, 1966, when Morrison added an explicit retelling and profanity-laden version of the Greek myth of Oedipus during \"The End\".\n\"The Doors\" and \"Strange Days\" (August 1966 \u2013 December 1967).\nThe Doors recorded their self-titled debut album around August 1966, at Sunset Sound Studios. The record was officially released in the first week of January 1967. It included the nearly 12-minute musical drama \"The End\". In November 1966, Mark Abramson directed a promotional film for the lead single \"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\". The group also made several television appearances, such as on \"Shebang\", a Los Angeles television show, miming to a playback of \"Break On Through\". In early 1967, the group appeared on \"The Clay Cole Show\" (which aired on Saturday evenings at 6\u00a0p.m. on WPIX Channel 11 out of New York City) where they performed their single \"Break On Through\". Since the single acquired only minor recognition, the band turned to \"Light My Fire\"; it became the first single from Elektra Records to reach number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, selling over one million copies.\nFrom March 7 to 11, 1967, the Doors performed at the Matrix Club in San Francisco. The March 7 and 10 shows were recorded by Peter Abram, co-owner of the Matrix. These recordings are notable as they are among the earliest live recordings of the band to circulate. On November 18, 2008, the Doors published a compilation of these recordings, \"Live at the Matrix 1967\", on the band's boutique Bright Midnight Archives label.\nOn August 25, 1967, they appeared on American television, guest-starring on the variety TV series \"Malibu U\", performing \"Light My Fire\", though they did not appear live. The band is seen on a beach and Morrison is lip-synching the song in playback. The music video did not gain any commercial success and the performance fell into relative obscurity. It was not until they appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" that they gained attention on television.\nThe Doors made their international television debut on October 16, 1967, performing a live version of \"The End\" for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) at their Parliament Street Colour Studio in Toronto. It was recorded in September when they were in Toronto and transmitted on the show \"O'Keefe Centre Presents\". The misconception that it was at the O'Keefe Centre stems mostly from the title, as the venue shown in the video has a dance floor, which the Centre did not have. But after its initial broadcasts, the performance remained unreleased except in bootleg form until the release of \"The Doors Soundstage Performances\" DVD in 2002.\nOn September 17, 1967, the Doors gave a memorable performance of \"Light My Fire\" on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". According to Manzarek, network executives asked that the word \"higher\" be removed, due to a possible reference to drug use. The group appeared to acquiesce, but performed the song in its original form, because either they had never intended to comply with the request or Jim Morrison was nervous and forgot to make the change (the group has given conflicting accounts). Either way, \"higher\" was sung out on national television, and the show's host, Ed Sullivan, canceled another six shows that had been planned. After the program's producer told the band they would never perform on the show again, Morrison reportedly replied: \"Hey man. We just \"did\" the Sullivan Show.\"\nOn December 24, the Doors performed \"Light My Fire\" and \"Moonlight Drive\" live for \"The Jonathan Winters Show\". Their performance was taped for later broadcast. From December 26 to 28, the group played at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco; during one set, in the middle of \"Back Door Man\", the band stopped performing to watch themselves on \"The Jonathan Winters Show\" on a television set wheeled onto the stage.\nThe Doors spent several weeks in Sunset Studios in Los Angeles recording their second album, \"Strange Days\", experimenting with the new technology, notably the Moog synthesizer they now had available. The commercial success of \"Strange Days\" was middling, peaking at number three on the \"Billboard\" album chart but quickly dropping, along with a series of underperforming singles. The chorus from the album's single \"People Are Strange\" inspired the name of the 2009 documentary of the Doors, \"When You're Strange\".\nAlthough session musician Larry Knechtel had occasionally contributed bass on the band's debut album, \"Strange Days\" was the first Doors album recorded with a studio musician, playing bass on the majority of the record, and this continued on all subsequent studio albums. Manzarek explained that his keyboard bass was well-suited for live situations but that it lacked the \"articulation\" needed for studio recording. Douglas Lubahn played on \"Strange Days\" and the next two albums; but the band used several other musicians for this role, often using more than one bassist on the same album. Kerry Magness, Leroy Vinnegar, Harvey Brooks, Ray Neopolitan, Lonnie Mack, Jerry Scheff, Jack Conrad (who played a major role in the post Morrison years touring with the group in 1971 and 1972), Chris Ethridge, Charles Larkey and Leland Sklar are credited as bassists who worked with the band.\nNew Haven incident (December 1967).\nOn December 9, 1967, the Doors performed a now-infamous concert at New Haven Arena in New Haven, Connecticut, which ended abruptly when Morrison was arrested by local police. Morrison became the first rock artist to be arrested onstage during a live performance. Prior to the start of the concert, Morrison was either having a private conversation with or kissing a female fan backstage in a bathroom shower stall when a police officer happened upon them. Unaware that he was the lead singer of the band, the officer told Morrison and the fan to leave, to which Morrison said, \"Eat it.\" The policeman took out a can of mace and warned Morrison, \"Last chance\", to which Morrison replied, \"Last chance to eat it.\" There is some discrepancy as to what happened next: according to \"No One Here Gets Out Alive\", the fan ran away and Morrison was maced; but Manzarek recounts in his book that both Morrison and the fan were sprayed.\nThe Doors' main act was delayed for an hour while Morrison recovered, after which the band took the stage very late. According to music journalist Gillian G. Gaar, the police still did not consider the issue resolved and wanted to charge him. Halfway through the first set, Morrison proceeded to create an improvised song about his experience with the \"little man in blue\". It was an obscenity-laced account to the audience, describing what had happened backstage and taunting the police, who were surrounding the stage. Later, the police lieutenant approached Morrison, during which Morrison thrust the microphone against his mouth and remarked, \"Say your thing, man.\" The concert came to an abrupt end when Morrison was dragged from the stage by the police. The audience, already restless from waiting so long for the band to perform, became unruly. Morrison was taken to a local police station, photographed and booked on charges of inciting a riot, indecency and public obscenity. Charges against Morrison, as well as those against three journalists also arrested in the incident (Mike Zwerin, Yvonne Chabrier and Tim Page), were dropped several weeks later for lack of evidence.\n\"Waiting for the Sun\" (April\u2013December 1968).\nRecording of the group's third album in April 1968 was marred by tension as a result of Morrison's increasing dependence on alcohol and the rejection of the 17-minute \"Celebration of the Lizard\" by band producer Paul Rothchild, who considered the work not commercial enough. Approaching the height of their popularity, the Doors played a series of outdoor shows that led to frenzied scenes between fans and police, particularly at Chicago Coliseum on May 10.\nThe band began to branch out from their initial form for this third LP, and began writing new material. \"Waiting for the Sun\" became their first and only album to reach number 1 on the US charts, and the single \"Hello, I Love You\" (one of the six songs performed by the band on their 1965 Aura Records demo) was their second US No. 1 single. Following the 1968 release of \"Hello, I Love You\", the publisher of the Kinks' 1964 hit \"All Day and All of the Night\" announced they were planning legal action against the Doors for copyright infringement; however, songwriter Ray Davies ultimately chose not to sue. Kinks guitarist Dave Davies was particularly irritated by the similarity. In concert, Morrison was occasionally dismissive of the song, leaving the vocals to Manzarek, as can be seen in the documentary \"The Doors Are Open\".\nA month after a riotous concert at the Singer Bowl in New York City, the group flew to Great Britain for their first performance outside North America. They held a press conference at the ICA Gallery in London and played shows at the Roundhouse. The results of the trip were broadcast on Granada TV's \"The Doors Are Open\", later released on video. They played dates in Europe, along with Jefferson Airplane, including a show in Amsterdam where Morrison collapsed on stage after a drug binge (including marijuana, hashish and unspecified pills).\nThe group flew back to the United States and played nine more dates before returning to work in November on their fourth LP. They ended the year with a successful new single, \"Touch Me\" (released in December 1968), which reached No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 1 in the \"Cashbox\" Top 100 in early 1969; this was the group's third and last American number-one single.\nMiami incident (March 1969).\nOn March 1, 1969, at the Dinner Key Auditorium in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida, the Doors gave the most controversial and consequential performance of their career, one that nearly \"derailed the band\". The auditorium was a converted seaplane hangar that had no air conditioning on that hot night, and the seats had been removed by the promoter to boost ticket sales.\nMorrison had been drinking all day and had missed connecting flights to Miami. By the time he arrived, drunk, the concert was over an hour late. The restless crowd of , packed into a facility designed to hold , was subjected to undue silences in Morrison's singing, which strained the music from the beginning of the performance. Morrison had recently attended a play by an experimental acting company the Living Theatre and was inspired by their \"antagonistic\" style of performance art. Morrison taunted the crowd with messages of both love and hate, saying, \"Love me. I can't take it no more without no good love. I want some lovin'. Ain't nobody gonna love my ass?\" and alternately, \"You're all a bunch of fuckin' idiots!\" and \"You\u2019re all a bunch of slaves!\" while screaming \"What are you gonna do about it?\" over and over again.\nAs the band began their second song, \"Touch Me\", Morrison started shouting in protest, forcing the band to a halt. At one point, Morrison removed the hat of an onstage police officer and threw it into the crowd; the officer reacted by taking Morrison's hat and throwing it in the same direction. Manager Bill Siddons recalled, \"The gig was a bizarre, circus-like thing, there was this guy carrying a sheep and the wildest people that I'd ever seen.\" Equipment chief Vince Treanor said, \"Somebody jumped up and poured champagne on Jim so he took his shirt off, he was soaking wet. 'Let's see a little skin, let's get naked,' he said, and the audience started taking their clothes off.\" Having removed his shirt, Morrison held it in front of his groin area and started to make hand movements behind it. Manzarek described the incident as a mass \"religious hallucination\".\nOn March 5, the Dade County Sheriff's office issued a warrant for Morrison's arrest, claiming Morrison had exposed his penis while on stage, shouted obscenities to the crowd, simulated oral sex on Krieger, and was drunk at the time of his performance. Morrison turned down a plea bargain that required the Doors to perform a free Miami concert. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail with hard labor, and ordered to pay a $500 fine. Morrison remained free, pending an appeal of his conviction, and died before the matter was legally resolved. In 2007, Florida Governor Charlie Crist suggested the possibility of a posthumous pardon for Morrison, which was announced as successful on December 9, 2010. Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek have denied the allegation that Morrison exposed himself on stage that night.\n\"The Soft Parade\" (May\u2013July 1969).\nMorrison, who was increasingly distancing himself from the music, announced to the other Doors members his intention to quit the group; Manzarek convinced him to stay for six more months, ahead of completing \"The Soft Parade\", the Doors' forthcoming album.\nReleased in July 1969, \"The Soft Parade\" was their first-and-only to feature brass and string arrangements. The concept was suggested by Rothchild to the band, after listening to many examples by various groups who also explored the same radical departure. Both jazz-influenced Densmore and Manzarek agreed with the recommendation, but Morrison declined to incorporate orchestral accompaniment on his compositions. The lead single, \"Touch Me\", featured saxophonist Curtis Amy.\nWhile the band was trying faintly to maintain their previous momentum, efforts to expand their sound with instrumental changes, including string, brass, and wind parts, caused critics to attack their musical integrity. According to Densmore in his biography \"Riders on the Storm\", individual writing credits were noted for the first time because of Morrison's reluctance to sing the lyrics of Krieger's song \"Tell All the People\". Morrison's drinking made him difficult and unreliable, and the recording sessions dragged on for months. Studio costs piled up, and the Doors came close to disintegrating. Despite all this, the album was immensely successful, becoming the band's fourth hit album.\n\"Morrison Hotel\" and \"Absolutely Live\" (November 1969 \u2013 December 1970).\nDuring the recording of their next album, \"Morrison Hotel\", in November 1969, Morrison again found himself in trouble with the law after harassing airline staff during a flight to Phoenix, Arizona to see the Rolling Stones in concert. Both Morrison and his friend and traveling companion Tom Baker were charged with \"interfering with the flight of an intercontinental aircraft and public drunkenness\". If convicted of the most serious charge, Morrison could have faced a ten-year federal prison sentence for the incident. The charges were dropped in April 1970 after an airline stewardess reversed her testimony to say she mistakenly identified Morrison as Baker.\nThe Doors staged a return to a more conventional direction after the experimental \"The Soft Parade\", with their fifth LP \"Morrison Hotel\" in 1970. Featuring a consistent blues rock sound, the album's opener was \"Roadhouse Blues\". The record reached No. 4 in the United States and revived their status among their core fanbase and the rock press. Dave Marsh, the editor of \"Creem\" magazine, said of the album: \"the most horrifying rock and roll I have ever heard. When they're good, they're simply unbeatable. I know this is the best record I've listened to\u00a0 ... so far\". \"Rock Magazine\" called it \"without any doubt their ballsiest (and best) album to date\". \"Circus\" magazine praised it as \"possibly the best album yet from the Doors\" and \"good hard, evil rock, and one of the best albums released this decade\". The album also saw Morrison returning as main songwriter, writing or co-writing all of the album's tracks. The 40th anniversary CD reissue of \"Morrison Hotel\" contains outtakes and alternative takes, including different versions of \"The Spy\" and \"Roadhouse Blues\" (with Lonnie Mack on bass guitar and the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian on harmonica).\nJuly 1970 saw the release of the group's first live album, \"Absolutely Live\", which peaked at the No. 8 position on the charts. The record was completed by producer Rothchild, who confirmed that the album's final mixing consisted of many bits and pieces from various and different band concerts. \"There must be 2000 edits on that album\", he told an interviewer years later. \"Absolutely Live\" also includes the first release of the lengthy piece \"Celebration of the Lizard\".\nAlthough the Doors continued to face de facto bans in more conservative American markets and earned new bans at Salt Lake City's Salt Palace and Detroit's Cobo Hall following tumultuous concerts, the band managed to play 18 concerts in the United States, Mexico and Canada following the Miami incident in 1969, and 23 dates in the United States and Canada throughout the first half of 1970. The group later made it to the Isle of Wight Festival on August 29; performing on the same day as John Sebastian, Shawn Phillips, Lighthouse, Joni Mitchell, Tiny Tim, Miles Davis, Ten Years After, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, the Who, Sly and the Family Stone and Melanie; the performance was the last captured on the band's Roadhouse Blues Tour.\nOn December 8, 1970, his 27th birthday, Morrison recorded another poetry session. Part of this would end up on \"An American Prayer\" in 1978 with music, and is currently in the possession of the Courson family. Shortly thereafter, a new tour to promote their upcoming album would comprise only three dates. Two concerts were held in Dallas on December 11. During the Doors' last public performance with Morrison, at The Warehouse in New Orleans, on December 12, 1970, Morrison apparently had a breakdown on stage. Midway through the set he slammed the microphone numerous times into the stage floor until the platform beneath was destroyed, then sat down and refused to perform for the remainder of the show. After the concert, Densmore, Manzarek and Krieger came to a mutual agreement that they should end their live act, claiming Morrison was ready to retire from performing.\n\"L.A. Woman\" and Morrison's leave of absence and death (December 1970 \u2013 July 1971).\nDespite Morrison's conviction and the fallout from their appearance in New Orleans, the Doors set out to reclaim their status as a premier act with the album \"L.A. Woman\", recorded in Los Angeles in 1971. The album included rhythm guitarist Marc Benno on several tracks and prominently featured bassist Jerry Scheff, best known for his work in Elvis Presley's TCB Band. Despite a comparatively low \"Billboard\" chart peak at No. 9, \"L.A. Woman\" contained two Top 20 hits and went on to be their second bestselling studio album, surpassed in sales only by their debut. The album explored their R&amp;B roots, although during rehearsals they had a falling-out with Paul Rothchild, who was dissatisfied with the band's effort. Denouncing \"Love Her Madly\" as \"cocktail lounge music\", he quit and handed the production to Bruce Botnick and the Doors.\nThe title track and two singles (\"Love Her Madly\" and \"Riders on the Storm\") remain mainstays of rock radio programming, with the latter being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its special significance to recorded music. In the song \"L.A. Woman\", Morrison makes an anagram of his name to chant \"Mr. Mojo Risin\". During the sessions, a short clip of the band performing \"Crawling King Snake\" was filmed. As far as is known, this is the last clip of the Doors performing with Morrison.\nOn March 11, 1971, near the end of the mixing of \"L.A. Woman\", Morrison took a leave of absence from the Doors and moved to Paris with Pamela Courson; he had visited the city the previous summer. On July 3, 1971, following months of residency, Morrison was found dead in the bath by Courson. Despite the absence of an official autopsy, the cause of death was listed as heart failure. He was buried in the \"Poets' Corner\" of P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery on July 7.\nMorrison died at age 27, the same age as several other famous rock stars in the 27 Club. In 1974, Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson also died at the age of 27.\nAfter Morrison.\n\"Other Voices\" and \"Full Circle\" (July 1971 \u2013 January 1973).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Morrison's passing stamped the Doors with a seal of legend and immortality. There was no opportunity for the band to go into the seventies intact. Perhaps that's a good thing. I can't imagine the Doors in the era of disco.\u2014\u200a\n\"L.A. Woman\"'s follow up album, \"Other Voices\", was being planned while Morrison was in Paris. The band assumed he would return to help them finish the album. After Morrison died, the surviving members considered replacing him with several new people, such as Iggy Pop on vocals. But after neither of these worked out, Krieger and Manzarek took over lead vocal duties themselves. \"Other Voices\" was finally completed in August 1971, and released in October 1971. The record featured the single \"Tightrope Ride\", which received some radio airplay. The trio began performing again with additional supporting members on November 12, 1971, at Pershing Municipal Auditorium in Lincoln, Nebraska, followed by shows at Carnegie Hall on November 23, and the Hollywood Palladium on November 26.\nThe recordings for \"Full Circle\" took place a year after \"Other Voices\" during the spring of 1972, and the album was released in August 1972. For the tours during this period, the Doors enlisted Jack Conrad on bass (who had played on several tracks on both \"Other Voices\" and \"Full Circle\") as well as Bobby Ray Henson on rhythm guitar. They began a European tour covering France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, including an appearance on the German show \"Beat-Club\". Like \"Other Voices\", \"Full Circle\" did not perform as well commercially as their previous albums. While \"Full Circle\" was notable for adding elements of funk and jazz to the usual Doors sound, the band struggled with Manzarek and Krieger leading (neither of the post-Morrison albums had reached the Top 10 while all six of their albums with Morrison had). Once their contract with Elektra had lapsed, the Doors disbanded in 1973.\nReunions.\nThe third post-Morrison album, \"An American Prayer\", was released in 1978. It consisted of the band adding musical backing tracks to previously recorded spoken word performances of Morrison reciting his poetry. The record was a commercial success, acquiring a platinum certificate. Two years later, it was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Spoken Word Album\" category, but it ultimately lost to John Gielgud's \"The Ages of Man\". \"An American Prayer\" was re-mastered and re-released with bonus tracks in 1995.\nIn 1993, the Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the ceremony, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore reunited to perform \"Roadhouse Blues\", \"Break On Through\" and \"Light My Fire\". Eddie Vedder filled in on lead vocals, while Don Was played bass. For the , the surviving members of the Doors reconvened to complete \"Orange County Suite\". The track was based on one that Morrison had written and recorded in early 1969, providing both vocals and piano.\nThe Doors reunited at the turn of the century to record music for the \"\" tribute album. Following the sessions, band members reunited in 2000 to perform on \"VH1 Storytellers\". For the live performance, the band was joined by Angelo Barbera and numerous guest vocalists, including Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction, Pat Monahan, Ian Astbury of the Cult, Travis Meeks, Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots, and Scott Stapp of Creed. On May 29, 2007, Perry Farrell's group the Satellite Party released its first album \"Ultra Payloaded\" on Columbia Records. It featured \"Woman in the Window\", a new song with a pre-recorded vocal performance by Morrison.\nManzarek along with Krieger, Densmore and DJ/producer Skrillex (Sonny Moore) recorded a new song in 2012, of which Manzarek said, \"I like to say this is the first new Doors track of the 21st century\". The recording session and song are part of a documentary film, \"Re:Generation\", which recruited five popular DJs/producers to work with artists from five separate genres and had them record new music. Manzarek and Skrillex had an immediate musical connection: \"Sonny plays his beat, all he had to do was play the one thing. I listened to it and I said, 'Holy shit, that's strong'.\" Manzarek formulates, \"Basically, it's a variation on 'Milestones', by Miles Davis, and if I do say so myself, sounds fucking great, hot as hell.\" The track, called \"Breakn' a Sweat\", was recorded for Skrillex's EP \"Bangarang\".\nIn 2013, the remaining members of the Doors recorded with rapper Tech N9ne for the song \"Strange 2013\", appearing on his album \"Something Else\", which features new instrumentation by the band and samples of Morrison's vocals from the song \"Strange Days\". In their final collaboration before Manzarek's death, the three surviving Doors provided backing for poet Michael C. Ford's album \"Look Each Other in the Ears\".\nOn February 12, 2016, at The Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, Densmore and Krieger reunited for the first time in 15 years to perform in tribute to Manzarek and benefit Stand Up to Cancer. That day would have been Manzarek's 77th birthday. The night featured Exene Cervenka and John Doe of the band X, Rami Jaffee of the Foo Fighters, Stone Temple Pilots' Robert Deleo, Jane's Addiction's Stephen Perkins, Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara, Andrew Watt, among others.\nAfter the Doors.\nAfter Morrison died in 1971, Densmore and Krieger went to London looking for a new lead singer. They formed the Butts Band in 1973 there, signing with Blue Thumb Records. They released an album titled \"Butts Band\" the same year, then disbanded in 1975 after a second album with Phil Chen on bass.\nManzarek made three solo albums from 1974 to 1983 and formed a band called Nite City in 1975, which released two albums in 1977\u20131978. Krieger released six solo albums from 1977 to 2010. In 2002, the two together formed a new version of the Doors which they called the Doors of the 21st Century. Due to legal battles with Densmore and the Morrison estate over use of the Doors name, they changed their name several times and ultimately toured under the name \"Manzarek\u2013Krieger\" or \"Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of the Doors\". The group toured extensively throughout their career. In July 2007, Densmore announced he would not reunite with the Doors unless Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam was the lead singer.\nOn May 20, 2013, Manzarek died at a hospital in Rosenheim, Germany, at the age of 74 due to complications related to bile duct cancer. Krieger and Densmore came together on February 12, 2016, at a benefit concert memorial for Manzarek. All proceeds went to \"Stand Up to Cancer\".\nLegacy.\nThe band presaged gothic rock due to the violence and the darkness present in their early work. As soon as 1967, critic John Stickney announced in the title of his article: \"Four Doors to the Future: Gothic Rock Is Their Thing\". Journalist Dave Marsh would also qualify a few years later the \"first couple of Doors albums\" as a prime example of \"gothic rock\". Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell argued that the Doors were precursors of prog and reflected important developments in progressive music. \nBeginning in the late 1970s, there was a sustained revival of interest in the Doors which created a new generation of fans. The origin of the revival is traced to the release of the album \"An American Prayer\" in late 1978 which contained a live version of \"Roadhouse Blues\" that received considerable airplay on album-oriented rock radio stations. In 1979, the song \"The End\" was featured in dramatic fashion in the film \"Apocalypse Now\", and the next year, the bestselling biography of Morrison \"No One Here Gets Out Alive\" was published. The Doors' first album, \"The Doors\", re-entered the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart in September 1980 and Elektra Records reported the Doors' albums were selling better than in any year since their original release. In response a new compilation album, \"Greatest Hits\", was released in October 1980. The album peaked at No. 17 in \"Billboard\" and remained on the chart for nearly two years.\nThe revival continued in 1983 with \"Alive, She Cried\", an album of previously unreleased live recordings. The track \"Gloria\" reached No. 18 on the \"Billboard\" Top Tracks chart and the video was in heavy rotation on MTV. Another compilation album, \"The Best of the Doors\" was released in 1985 and went on to be certified Diamond in 2007 by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 10 million certified units.\nA second revival, attracting another generation of fans, occurred in 1991 following the release of the film \"The Doors\", directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer as Morrison. Stone created the script from over a hundred interviews of people who were in Morrison's life. He designed the movie by picking the songs and then adding the appropriate storylines to them. The remaining band members did not like the film's portrayal of the events. In the book \"The Doors\", Manzarek states, \"That Oliver Stone thing did real damage to the guy I knew: Jim Morrison, the poet.\" In addition, Manzarek claims that he wanted the movie to be about all four members of the band, not only Morrison. Densmore asserts, \"A third of it's fiction.\" In the same volume, Krieger agrees with the other two, but also says, \"It could have been a lot worse.\" The film's soundtrack album reached No. 8 on the \"Billboard\" album chart and \"Greatest Hits\" and \"The Best of the Doors\" re-entered the chart, with the latter reaching a new peak position of No. 32.\nVideography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It borders Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest. Texas has a coastline on the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Covering and with over 31 million residents as of 2024, it is the second-largest U.S. state by both area and population. Texas is nicknamed the \"Lone Star State\" for the single star on its flag, symbolic of its former status as an independent country, the Republic of Texas.\nSpain was the first European country to claim and control Texas. Following a short-lived colony controlled by France, Mexico controlled the land until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming the Republic of Texas. In 1845, Texas joined the United States of America as the 28th state. The state's annexation set off a chain of events that led to the Mexican\u2013American War in 1846. Following victory by the United States, Texas remained a slave state until the American Civil War, when it declared its secession from the Union in early 1861 before officially joining the Confederate States on March2. After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.\nHistorically, five major industries shaped the economy of Texas prior to World War II: bison, cattle, cotton, oil, and timber. Before and after the Civil War, the cattle industry\u2014which Texas came to dominate\u2014was a major economic driver and created the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century, cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. Ultimately, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) initiated an economic boom that became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry during the mid-20th century. As of 2024[ [update]], it has the second-highest number (52) of \"Fortune\" 500 companies headquartered in the United States. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including tourism, agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the U.S. in state export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product. Texas consistently ranks at the top of tables for business growth, job creation, and economic opportunity with low taxes and a regulatory environment that encourages innovation.\nThe Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex and Greater Houston areas are the nation's fourth and fifth-most populous urban regions respectively. Its capital city is Austin. Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and the Southwestern regions. Most population centers are in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, terrain ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, to the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Texas\", based on the Caddo word () 'friend', was applied, in the spelling or , by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves, specifically the Hasinai Confederacy.\nDuring Spanish colonial rule, in the 18th century, the area was known as ('New Philippines') and ('New Kingdom of the Philippines'), or as ('province of the '), later also (or ), ('province of Texas'). It was incorporated as into the Mexican Empire in 1821, and declared a republic in 1836. The Royal Spanish Academy recognizes both spellings, and , as Spanish-language forms of the name.\nThe English pronunciation with is unetymological, contrary to the historical value of the letter x () in Spanish orthography. Alternative etymologies of the name advanced in the late 19th century connected the name \"Texas\" with the Spanish word , meaning 'roof tile', the plural being used to designate Indigenous Pueblo settlements. A 1760s map by Jacques-Nicolas Bellin shows a village named \"Teijas\" on the Trinity River, close to the site of modern Crockett.\nHistory.\nPrecontact era.\nTexas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the Southwestern and the Plains areas. Archaeologists have found that three major Indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were: the Ancestral Puebloans from the upper Rio Grande region, centered west of Texas; the Mississippian culture, also known as Mound Builders, which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas; and the civilizations of Mesoamerica, which were centered south of Texas. Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined between the 8th and 10th centuries.\nWhen Europeans first arrived in the Texas region, the languages present in the state were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan, in addition to several language isolates such as Tonkawa. Uto-Aztecan Puebloan and Jumano peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state and the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior. The agricultural, mound-building Caddo controlled much of the northeastern part of the state, along the Red, Sabine, and Neches River basins. Atakapan peoples such as the Akokisa and Bidai lived along the northeastern Gulf Coast; the Karankawa lived along the central coast. At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the Aranama, lived in southern Texas. This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct.\nNo one culture was dominant across the territory of present-day Texas, with many peoples inhabiting the area. Native American tribes who have lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa, and Wichita. Many of these peoples migrated from the north or east during the colonial period, such as the Choctaw, Alabama-Coushatta, and Delaware.\nThe region was primarily controlled by the Spanish until the Texas Revolution. They were most interested in relationships with the Caddo, who were - like the Spanish - a settled, agricultural people. Several Spanish missions were opened in Caddo territory, but a lack of interest in Christianity among the Caddo meant that few were converted. Positioned between French Louisiana and Spanish Texas, the Caddo maintained relations with both, but were closer with the French. After Spain took control of Louisiana, most of the missions in eastern Texas were closed and abandoned. The United States obtained Louisiana following the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and began convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by moving west; facing an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas, they were able to negotiate with the Caddo to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. These included the Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Seneca, among others, who came to view the Caddoans as saviors.\nThe different temperaments of Native American tribes directly affected the fates of the European explorers and settlers coming to the area. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow local crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game, while warlike tribes resisted the settlers. Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. Several outbreaks of violence between Native Americans and Texans started to spread in the prelude to the Texas Revolution. Texans accused tribes of stealing livestock. While no proof was found, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted to publicly blame and punish the Caddo, with speculation that the U.S. government was trying to keep them in check this way. The Caddo never turned to violence because of the situation, except in cases of self-defense.\nBy the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears. Fearing retribution, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. tried to convince all Indigenous peoples to uproot and move west. This included the Caddo of Louisiana and Arkansas. The first president of Texas, Sam Houston, aimed to cooperate and make peace with Native tribes, but his successor, Mirabeau B. Lamar, took a much more hostile stance. Hostility towards Natives by white Texans prompted the movement of most Native populations north into what would become Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma). Only the Alabama-Coushatta would remain in the parts of Texas subject to white settlement, though the Comanche would continue to control most of the western half of the state until their defeat in the 1870s and 1880s.\nColonization.\nThe first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda. Nine years later, shipwrecked Spanish explorer \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas. Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528, when the Spanish landed in the area, \"half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us.\" Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas. Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado described another encounter with native people in 1541.\nThe expedition of Hernando de Soto entered into Texas from the east, seeking a route to Mexico. They passed through the Caddo lands but turned back after reaching the River of Daycao (possibly the Brazos or Colorado), beyond which point the Native peoples were nomadic and did not have the agricultural stores to feed the expedition.\nEuropean powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685. Miscalculations by Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River. The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives. A small band of survivors traveled eastward into the lands of the Caddo, but La Salle was killed by disgruntled expedition members.\nIn 1690 Spanish authorities, concerned that France posed a competitive threat, constructed several missions in East Texas among the Caddo. After Caddo resistance, the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico. When France began settling Louisiana, in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas. Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area.\nHostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area. It was one of New Spain's least populated provinces. In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes, including the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai. The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes. With numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes. By the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted.\nWhen the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, American authorities insisted the agreement also included Texas. The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set in 1819 at the Sabine River, the modern border between Texas and Louisiana. Eager for new land, many U.S. settlers refused to recognize the agreement. Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River. Marked by the War of 1812, some men who had escaped from the Spanish, held (Old) Philippines had immigrated to and also passed through Texas (New Philippines) and reached Louisiana where Philippine exiles aided the United States in the defense of New Orleans against a British invasion, with Filipinos in the Saint Malo settlement assisting Jean Lafitte in the Battle of New Orleans.\nIn 1821, the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory, which became part of Mexico. Due to its low population, the territory was assigned to other states and territories of Mexico; the core territory was part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas, but other parts of today's Texas were part of Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, or the Mexican Territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico.\nHoping more settlers would reduce the near-constant Comanche raids, Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain. As a result of this, large swathes of land were allotted to \"empresarios\", who recruited settlers from the United States, Europe, and the Mexican interior, primarily the U.S. Austin's settlers, the Old Three Hundred, made places along the Brazos River in 1822. The population of Texas grew rapidly. By 1834, the population had grown to about 37,800 people, with only 7,800 of Mexican descent.\nMany immigrants openly flouted Mexican law, especially the prohibition against slavery. Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States. However, illegal immigration from the United States into Mexico continued to increase the population of Texas. New laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering native Mexican citizens (\"Tejanos\") and recent immigrants alike.\nThe Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against Mexican rule, coinciding with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president. Texians sided with the federalists against the government and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas. They took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues. The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833.\nRepublic.\nWithin Mexico, tensions continued between federalists and centralists. In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety. The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales. This launched the Texas Revolution. Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a provisional government. The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836.\nMexican President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna personally led an army to end the revolt. General Jos\u00e9 de Urrea defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast culminating in the Goliad massacre. L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna's forces, after a thirteen-day siege, overwhelmed Texian defenders at the Battle of the Alamo. News of the defeats sparked panic among Texas settlers.\nThe newly elected Texian delegates to the Convention of 1836 quickly signed a declaration of independence on March 2, forming the Republic of Texas. After electing interim officers, the Convention disbanded. The new government joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape, fleeing from the approaching Mexican army.\nAfter several weeks of retreat, the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto. L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco, ending the war. The Constitution of the Republic of Texas prohibited the government from restricting slavery or freeing slaves, and required free people of African descent to leave the country.\nPolitical battles raged between two factions of the new Republic. The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War. With wide popular support, Texas first applied for annexation to the United States in 1836, but its status as a slaveholding country caused its admission to be controversial and it was initially rebuffed. This status, and Mexican diplomacy in support of its claims to the territory, also complicated Texas's ability to form foreign alliances and trade relationships.\nThe Comanche Indians furnished the main Native American opposition to the Texas Republic, manifested in multiple raids on settlements. Mexico launched two small expeditions into Texas in 1842. The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in battle in the Dawson massacre. Despite these successes, Mexico did not keep an occupying force in Texas, and the republic survived. The cotton price crash of the 1840s depressed the country's economy.\nStatehood.\nTexas was finally officially annexed when the expansionist James K. Polk won the election of 1844. On December 29, 1845, the U.S. Congress admitted Texas to the U.S.\nAfter Texas's annexation, Mexico broke off diplomatic relations with the United States. While the United States claimed Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River leaving the Rio Grande Valley under contested Texan sovereignty. While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so. President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican\u2013American War. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas.\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two-year war. In return for US$18,250,000, (), Mexico gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, ceded the Mexican Cession in 1848, most of which today is called the American Southwest, and Texas's borders were established at the Rio Grande.\nThe Compromise of 1850 set Texas's boundaries at their present position: Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day New Mexico, a third of Colorado, and small portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming to the federal government, in return for the assumption of $10 million of the old republic's debt (). Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.\nCivil War to late 19th century.\nTexas re-entered war following the election of 1860. During this time, Black people comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved. When Abraham Lincoln was elected, South Carolina seceded from the Union; five other Deep South states quickly followed. A state convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28, 1861. On February 1, by a vote of 166\u20138, the convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession. Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861. Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4, 1861, ratifying the permanent C.S. Constitution on March 23.\nNot all Texans favored secession initially, although many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state governor, Sam Houston. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office. After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed.\nWhile far from the major battlefields of the American Civil War, Texas contributed large numbers of soldiers and equipment. Union troops briefly occupied the state's primary port, Galveston. Texas's border with Mexico was known as the \"backdoor of the Confederacy\" because trade occurred at the border, bypassing the Union blockade. The Confederacy repulsed all Union attempts to shut down this route, but Texas's role as a supply state was marginalized in mid-1863 after the Union capture of the Mississippi River. The final battle of the Civil War was fought at Palmito Ranch, near Brownsville, Texas, and saw a Confederate victory.\nTexas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger. Violence marked the early months of Reconstruction. Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston by General Gordon Granger, almost two and a half years after the original announcement. President Johnson, in 1866, declared the civilian government restored in Texas. Despite not meeting Reconstruction requirements, Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in 1870. Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues.\nLike most of the South, the Texas economy was devastated by the War. However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly. The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory. The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, war tensions, or other problems. \"Gone to Texas\" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests.\nThe cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce expanded. The lumber industry quickly expanded and was Texas's largest industry prior to the 20th century.\nEarly to mid-20th century.\nIn 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history in the form of the Galveston hurricane. The fortunes of the state would turn around in 1901, with discovery of the first major oil well in Texas, on January 10th 1901. Spindletop, was found south of Beaumont. Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas, West Texas, and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting \"oil boom\" transformed Texas. Oil production averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972.\nIn 1901, the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most Black and many poor White and Latino people. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring minorities were excluded from the formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second-largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the federal government for their opposition to U.S. involvement in World War I.\nThe Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt a double blow to the state's economy, which had significantly improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst-hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, Black people left Texas in the Great Migration to seek work in the Northern United States or California and to escape segregation. In 1940, Texas was 74% White, 14.4% Black, and 11.5% Hispanic.\nWorld War II had a dramatic impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 Texans left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for service or much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture. Texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eleventh among the 48 states.\nTexas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the 1960s. The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education, funded in large part by oil revenues, and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently. These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds.\nMid-20th to early 21st century.\nFrom around the mid-20th century, Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As a part of the Sun Belt, Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics and Latino Americans overtook Blacks to become the largest minority group. Texas has the largest Black population with over 3.9 million.\nDuring the late 20th century, the Republican Party replaced the Democratic Party as the dominant party in the state. Beginning in the early 21st century, metropolitan areas including Dallas\u2013Fort Worth and Greater Austin became centers for the Texas Democratic Party in statewide and national elections as liberal policies became more accepted in urban areas.\nFrom the mid-2000s to 2019, Texas gained an influx of business relocations and regional headquarters from companies in California. Texas became a major destination for migration during the early 21st century and was named the most popular state to move for three consecutive years. Another study in 2019 determined Texas's growth rate at 1,000 people per day. During the During the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, Texas was one of the states to resist the imposition of repeated lockdowns.\nDuring February 13\u201317, 2021, the state faced a major weather emergency as Winter Storm Uri hit the state, as well as most of the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. Historically high power usage across the state caused the state's power grid to become overworked and ERCOT (the main operator of the Texas Interconnection grid) declared an emergency and began to implement rolling blackouts across Texas, causing a power crisis. Over 3 million Texans were without power and over 4 million were under boil-water notices.\nGeography.\nTexas is the second-largest U.S. state by area, after Alaska, and the largest state within the contiguous United States, at . If it were an independent country, Texas would be the 39th-largest. It ranks 26th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size.\nTexas is in the south central part of the United States. The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Tamaulipas to the south. The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north. The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east. The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100\u00b0 W, a northern border with Oklahoma at 36\u00b030' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103\u00b0 W. El Paso lies on the state's western tip at 32\u00b0 N and the Rio Grande.\nTexas has 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions. One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province.\nThe Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state. Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods. The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest. The Cross Timbers region and Caprock Escarpment are part of the Interior Lowlands.\nThe Great Plains region in Central Texas spans through the state's panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state's hill country near Lago Vista and Austin. This region is dominated by prairie and steppe. \"Far West Texas\" or the \"Trans-Pecos\" region is the state's Basin and Range Province. The most varied of the regions, this area includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands.\nTexas has 3,700 named streams and 15 major rivers, with the Rio Grande as the largest. Other major rivers include the Pecos, the Brazos, Colorado, and Red River. While Texas has few natural lakes, Texans have built more than a hundred artificial reservoirs.\nThe size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States. Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of the Deep South, to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest.\nGeology.\nTexas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600\u00a0million years old.\nThe margin created by the continental crust existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea. Pangea began to break up in the Triassic, but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and late Jurassic. The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form. Today of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are here. The incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age. These salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs, and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast.\nEast Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite. The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north; Permian sediments in the west; and Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf contain oil. Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area. A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer. Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes.\nWildlife.\nTexas is home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the American green tree frog, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States\u2014590 native species in all. At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas.\nTexas plays host to several species of wasps, including an abundance of \"Polistes exclamans\", and is an important ground for the study of \"Polistes annularis\".\nDuring the spring Texas wildflowers such as the state flower, the bluebonnet, line highways throughout Texas. During the Johnson Administration the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, worked to draw attention to Texas wildflowers.\nClimate.\nThe large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather. The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters. Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns. El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages of annual rainfall, while parts of southeast Texas average as much as per year. Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate per year.\nSnow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas, once or twice a year in North Texas, and once every few years in Central and East Texas. Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances. Of note is the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm, when of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average high temperature in December is 65\u00a0\u00b0F.\nNight-time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s \u00b0F (14\u00a0\u00b0C) in the West Texas mountains to in Galveston.\nThe table below consists of averages for August (generally the warmest month) and January (generally the coldest) in selected cities in various regions of the state.\nStorms.\nThunderstorms strike Texas often, especially the eastern and northern portions of the state. Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas. The state experiences the most tornadoes in the United States, an average of 139 a year. These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle. Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April, May, and June.\nSome of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have seriously impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town. These events meant that Galveston took over as the chief port city. The 1900 Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city, killing a number estimated at from 8,000 to 12,000 in the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused a landfall in Rockport as a Category\u00a04 Hurricane, causing significant damage, with its unprecedented amounts of rain over the Greater Houston area resulting in widespread and catastrophic flooding, affecting hundreds of thousands of homes. Harvey ultimately became the costliest hurricane worldwide, causing an estimated $198.6\u00a0billion in damage, surpassing the cost of Hurricane Katrina.\nOther devastating Texas hurricanes include the 1915 Galveston hurricane, Hurricane Audrey in 1957, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005, and Hurricane Ike in 2008. Tropical storms have also caused their share of damage: Allison in 1989 and again during 2001, Claudette in 1979, and Tropical Storm Imelda in 2019.\nThere is no substantial physical barrier between Texas and the polar region, and although rare, it is possible for arctic or polar air masses to penetrate Texas, as occurred during the February 13\u201317, 2021 North American winter storm. Usually, prevailing winds in North America push polar air masses to the southeast before they reach Texas. Because such incidents are rare, and, generally unexpected, they may result in crises such as the 2021 Texas power crisis.\nGreenhouse gases.\nAs of 2017[ [update]], Texas emitted the most greenhouse gases in the U.S. As of 2017[ [update]] the state emits about of carbon dioxide annually. As an independent state, Texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases. Causes of the state's vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state's large number of coal power plants and the state's refining and manufacturing industries. In 2010, there were 2,553 \"emission events\" which poured of contaminants into the Texas sky.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe state has three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas. These three rank among the 10 most populous cities of the United States. As of 2020, six Texas cities had populations greater than 600,000. Austin, Fort Worth, and El Paso are among the 20 largest U.S. cities. Texas has four metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million: Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington, Houston\u2013Sugar Land\u2013The Woodlands, San Antonio\u2013New Braunfels, and Austin\u2013Round Rock\u2013San Marcos. The Dallas\u2013Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas number about 7.5 million and 7 million residents as of 2019, respectively.\nThree interstate highways\u2014I-35 to the west (Dallas\u2013Fort Worth to San Antonio, with Austin in between), I-45 to the east (Dallas to Houston), and I-10 to the south (San Antonio to Houston) define the Texas Urban Triangle region. The region of contains most of the state's largest cities and metropolitan areas as well as 17 million people, nearly 75 percent of Texas's total population. Houston and Dallas have been recognized as world cities. These cities are spread out amongst the state.\nIn contrast to the cities, unincorporated rural settlements known as colonias often lack basic infrastructure and are marked by poverty. The office of the Texas Attorney General stated, in 2011, that Texas had about 2,294 colonias, and estimates about 500,000 lived in the colonias. Hidalgo County, as of 2011, has the largest number of colonias. Texas has the largest number of people living in colonias of all states.\nTexas has 254 counties, more than any other state. Each county runs on Commissioners' Court system consisting of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts in the county, roughly divided according to population) and a county judge elected at large from the entire county. County government runs similar to a \"weak\" mayor-council system; the county judge has no veto authority, but votes along with the other commissioners.\nAlthough Texas permits cities and counties to enter \"interlocal agreements\" to share services, the state does not allow consolidated city-county governments, nor does it have metropolitan governments. Counties are not granted home rule status; their powers are strictly defined by state law. The state does not have townships\u2014areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated. Incorporated areas are part of a municipality. The county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas. Municipalities are classified either \"general law\" cities or \"home rule\". A municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds 5,000 population with voter approval.\nTexas also permits the creation of \"special districts\", which provide limited services. The most common is the school district, but can also include hospital districts, community college districts, and utility districts. Municipal, school district, and special district elections are nonpartisan, though the party affiliation of a candidate may be well-known. County and state elections are partisan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe resident population of Texas was 29,145,505 in the 2020 census, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 census. At the 2020 census, the apportioned population of Texas stood at 29,183,290. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population was 31,290,831 as of July 1, 2024, an increase of 7.4% since the 2020 census. Texas is the second-most populous state in the United States after California and the only other U.S. state to surpass a total estimated population of 30 million people as of July 2, 2022.\nIn 2015, Texas had 4.7 million foreign-born residents, about 17% of the population and 21.6% of the state workforce. The major countries of origin for Texan immigrants were Mexico (55.1% of immigrants), India (5%), El Salvador (4.3%), Vietnam (3.7%), and China (2.3%). Of immigrant residents, 35.8 percent were naturalized U.S. citizens. As of 2018, the population increased to 4.9 million foreign-born residents or 17.2% of the state population, up from 2,899,642 in 2000.\nIn 2014, there were an estimated 1.7 million undocumented immigrants in Texas, making up 35% of the total Texas immigrant population and 6.1% of the total state population. In addition to the state's foreign-born population, 4.1 million Texans (15% of the state's population) were born in the United States yet had at least one immigrant parent. According to the American Community Survey's 2019 estimates, 1,739,000 residents were undocumented immigrants, a decrease of 103,000 since 2014 but an increase of 142,000 since 2016. Of the undocumented immigrant population, 951,000 had resided in Texas no more than 14 years; an estimated 788,000 had lived in Texas for 15 or more years.\nTexas's Rio Grande Valley has seen significant migration from across the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. During the 2014 crisis, many Central Americans, including unaccompanied minors traveling alone from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, reached the state, overwhelming Border Patrol resources for a time. Many sought asylum in the United States.\nTexas's population density as of 2010 is which is slightly higher than the average population density of the U.S. as a whole, at . In contrast, while Texas and France are similarly sized geographically, the European country has a population density of . Two-thirds of all Texans live in major metropolitan areas such as Houston.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 24,432 homeless people in Texas.\nRace and ethnicity.\nIn 2019, non-Hispanic Whites represented 41.2% of Texas's population, reflecting a national demographic shift. Black people made up 12.9%, American Indians and Alaska Natives 1.0%, Asian Americans 5.2%, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 0.1%, some other race 0.2%, and two or more races 1.8%. Hispanics or Latino Americans of any race made up 39.7% of the estimated population.\nAt the 2020 census, the racial and ethnic composition of the state was 42.5% White (39.8% non-Hispanic White), 11.8% Black, 5.4% Asian, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 13.6% some other race, 17.6% two or more races, and 40.2% Hispanic and Latino American of any race. Minority Americans make up 60.2% of the Texas population.\nIn 2010, 49% of all births were Hispanics; 35% were non-Hispanic White; 11.5% were non-Hispanic Black, and 4.3% were Asians/Pacific Islanders. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data released in February 2011, for the first time in recent history, Texas's White population is below 50% (45%) and Hispanics grew to 38%. Between 2000 and 2010, the total population grew by 20.6%, but Hispanics and Latino Americans grew by 65%, whereas non-Hispanic Whites grew by only 4.2%. Texas has the fifth highest rate of teenage births in the nation and a plurality of these are to Hispanics or Latinos. As of 2022, Hispanics and Latinos of any race replaced the non-Hispanic White population as the largest share of the state's population.\nTexas has the second-largest share of Mexican Americans in the US, making up 32.2% of the total population and 80% of the state's Hispanic population. Other than Mexican, the largest self-reported ancestries in the state as of 2022 were German (8.1%), English (7.9%), Irish (5.8%), those identifying as American (4.6%), Italian (1.9%), Indian (1.9%), Salvadoran (1.4%), Scottish (1.3%), Vietnamese (1.1%), Chinese (1%), Puerto Rican (0.9%), Polish (0.9%), Honduran (0.8%), Filipino (0.8%), and Scotch-Irish (0.7%).\nLanguages.\nThe most common accent or dialect spoken by natives throughout Texas is sometimes referred to as Texan English, itself a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English. Creole language is spoken in some parts of East Texas. In some areas of the state\u2014particularly in the large cities\u2014Western American English and General American English, is increasingly common. Chicano English\u2014due to a growing Hispanic population\u2014is widespread in South Texas, while African-American English is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas.\nAt the 2020 American Community Survey's estimates, 64.9% of the population of Texas spoke only English, while 35.1% spoke a language other than English. Roughly 30% of the total population spoke Spanish. By 2021, approximately 50,546 Texans spoke French or a French-based creole language. German and other West Germanic languages were spoken by 49,565 residents; Russian, Polish, and other Slavic languages by 37,444; Korean by 31,673; Chinese 86,370; Vietnamese 92,410; Tagalog 40,124; and Arabic by 47,170 Texans.\nAt the census of 2010, 65.8% (14,740,304) of Texas residents age5 and older spoke only English at home, while 29.2% (6,543,702) spoke Spanish, 0.8 percent (168,886) Vietnamese, and Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin) was spoken by 0.6% (122,921) of the population over five. Other languages spoken include German (including Texas German) by 0.3% (73,137), Tagalog with 0.3% (64,272) speakers, and French (including Cajun French) was spoken by 0.3% (55,773) of Texans. Reportedly, Cherokee is the most widely spoken Native American language in Texas. In total, 34.2% (7,660,406) of Texas's population aged five and older spoke a language at home other than English as of 2006.\nReligion.\nWith the coming of Spanish Catholic and American Protestant missionary societies, American Indian religions and spiritual traditions dwindled. Since then, colonial and present-day Texas has become a predominantly Christian state, with 75.5% of the population identifying as such according to the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020.\nAmong its majority Christian populace, the largest Christian denomination as of 2014 has been the Catholic Church, per the Pew Research Center at 23% of the population, although Protestants collectively constituted 50% of the Christian population in 2014; in the 2020 study by the Public Religion Research Institute, the Catholic Church's membership increased to encompassing 28% of the population identifying with a religious or spiritual belief. At the 2020 Association of Religion Data Archives study, there were 5,905,142 Catholics in the state. The largest Catholic jurisdictions in Texas are the Archdiocese of Galveston\u2013Houston\u2014the first and oldest Latin Church diocese in Texas\u2014the dioceses of Dallas and Fort Worth, and the Archdiocese of San Antonio.\nBeing part of the strongly, socially conservative Bible Belt, Protestants as a whole declined to 47% of the population in the 2020 study by the Public Religion Research Institute. Predominantly-white Evangelical Protestantism declined to 14% of the Protestant Christian population. Mainline Protestants in contrast made up 15% of Protestant Texas. Hispanic or Latino American-dominated Protestant churches and historically Black or African American Protestantism grew to a collective 13% of the Protestant population.\nEvangelical Protestants were 31% of the population in 2014, and Baptists were the largest Evangelical tradition (14%); according to the 2014 study, they made up the second-largest Mainline Protestant group behind Methodists (4%). Nondenominational and interdenominational Protestant Christians were the second largest Evangelical group (7%) followed by Pentecostals (4%). The largest Evangelical Baptists in the state were the Southern Baptist Convention (9%) and independent Baptists (3%). The Assemblies of God USA was the largest Evangelical Pentecostal denomination in 2014. Among Mainline Protestants, the United Methodist Church was the largest denomination (4%) and the American Baptist Churches USA comprised the second-largest Mainline Protestant group (2%).\nAccording to the Pew Research Center in 2014, the state's largest historically African American Christian denominations were the National Baptist Convention (USA) and the Church of God in Christ. Black Methodists and other Christians made up less than 1 percent each of the Christian demographic. Other Christians made up 1 percent of the total Christian population, and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox formed less than 1 percent of the statewide Christian populace. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the largest nontrinitarian Christian group in Texas alongside the Jehovah's Witnesses.\nAmong its Protestant population, the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020 determined Southern Baptists numbered 3,319,962; non-denominational Protestants 2,405,786 (including Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ altogether numbering 2,758,353); and United Methodists 938,399 as the most numerous Protestant groups in the state. Baptists altogether (Southern Baptists, American Baptist Associates, American Baptists, Full Gospel Baptists, General Baptists, Free Will Baptists, National Baptists, National Baptists of America, National Missionary Baptists, National Primitive Baptists, and Progressive National Baptists) numbered 3,837,306; Methodists within United Methodism, the AME, AME Zion, CME, and the Free Methodist Church numbered 1,026,453 Texans.\nThe same study tabulated 425,038 Pentecostals spread among the Assemblies of God, Church of God (Cleveland), and Church of God in Christ. Nontrinitarian or Oneness Pentecostals numbered 7,042 between Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, COOLJC, and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. Other Christians, including the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, numbered 55,329 altogether, and Episcopalians numbered 134,318, although the Anglican Catholic Church, Anglican Church in America, Anglican Church in North America, Anglican Province of America, and Holy Catholic Church Anglican Rite had a collective presence in 114 churches.\nNon-Christian faiths accounted for 4% of the religious population in 2014, and 5% in 2020 per the Pew Research Center and Public Religion Research Institute. Adherents of many other religions reside predominantly in the urban centers of Texas. Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism were tied as the second largest religion as of 2014 and 2020. In 2014, 18% of the state's population were religiously unaffiliated. Of the unaffiliated in 2014, an estimated 2% were atheists and 3% agnostic; in 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute noted the largest non-Christian groups were the irreligious (20%), Judaism (1%), Islam (1%), Buddhism (1%) and Hinduism, and other religions at less than 1 percent each.\nIn 1990, the Islamic population was about 140,000 with more recent figures putting the current number of Muslims between 350,000 and 400,000 as of 2012. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were 313,209 Muslims as of 2020. Texas is the fifth-largest Muslim-populated state as of 2014. The Jewish population was around 128,000 in 2008. In 2020, the Jewish population grew to over 176,000. According to ARDA's 2020 study, there were 43 Chabad synagogues; 17,513 Conservative Jews; 8,110 Orthodox Jews; and 31,378 Reform Jews. Around 146,000 adherents of religions such as Hinduism and Sikhism lived in Texas as of 2004. By 2020, there were 112,153 Hindus and 20 Sikh gurdwaras; 60,882 Texans adhered to Buddhism.\nEconomy.\nAs of 2024, Texas had a gross state product (GSP) of $2.664 trillion, the second highest of any U.S. state. Its GSP is greater than the GDP of Brazil, the world's 8th-largest economy. The state ranks 22nd among U.S. states with a median household income of $64,034, while the poverty rate is 14.2%, making Texas the state with 14th highest poverty rate (compared to 13.15% nationally). Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California.\nTexas's large population, an abundance of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers of higher education have contributed to a large and diverse economy. Since oil was discovered, the state's economy has reflected the state of the petroleum industry. In recent times, urban centers of the state have increased in size, containing two-thirds of the population in 2005. The state's economic growth has led to urban sprawl and its associated symptoms.\nIn May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the state's unemployment rate was 13 percent.\nIn 2010, \"Site Selection Magazine\" ranked Texas as the most business-friendly state, in part because of the state's three-billion-dollar Texas Enterprise Fund. As of 2024, it has the second-highest number (52) of \"Fortune\" 500 companies headquartered in the United States. In 2010, there were 346,000 millionaires in Texas, the second-largest population of millionaires in the nation. In 2018, the number of millionaire households increased to 566,578.\nTaxation.\nTexas has a reputation for a low tax. According to the Tax Foundation, Texans' state and local tax burdens are seventh-lowest nationally; state and local taxes cost $3,580 per capita, or 8.4 percent of resident incomes. Texas is one of seven states that lack a state income tax.\nInstead, the state collects revenue from property taxes (though these are collected at the county, city, and school district level; Texas has a state constitutional prohibition against a state property tax) and sales taxes. The state sales tax rate is 6.25 percent, but local taxing jurisdictions (cities, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities) may also impose sales and use tax up to 2percent for a total maximum combined rate of 8.25 percent.\nTexas receives more federal spending than it pays in federal taxes, receiving $1.21 for each dollar paid to the federal government. To attract business, Texas has incentive programs worth $19 billion per year (2012); more than any other U.S. state.\nAgriculture and mining.\nTexas has the most farms and the highest acreage in the United States. The state is ranked No.\u202f1 for revenue generated from total livestock and livestock products. It is ranked No.\u202f2 for total agricultural revenue, behind California. At $7.4 billion or 56.7 percent of Texas's annual agricultural cash receipts, beef cattle production represents the largest single segment of Texas agriculture. This is followed by cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broiler chickens at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent).\nTexas leads the nation in the production of cattle, horses, sheep, goats, wool, mohair and hay. The state also leads the nation in production of cotton which is the number one crop grown in the state in terms of value. The state grows significant amounts of cereal crops and produce. Texas' fishing industry, along the Texas Gulf Coast, is vital to Texas' economy. In 2015, there were 80.4 million pounds of seafood landed, valued at more than $173.4 million. With mineral resources, Texas leads in creating cement, crushed stone, lime, salt, sand and gravel. Texas throughout the 21st century has been hammered by drought, costing the state billions of dollars in livestock and crops.\nEnergy.\nEver since the discovery of oil at Spindletop, energy has been a dominant force politically and economically within the state. If Texas were its own country it would be the sixth-largest oil producer in the world according to a 2014 study.\nThe Railroad Commission of Texas regulates the state's oil and gas industry, gas utilities, pipeline safety, safety in the liquefied petroleum gas industry, and surface coal and uranium mining. Until the 1970s, the commission controlled the price of petroleum because of its ability to regulate Texas's oil reserves. The founders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) used the Texas agency as one of their models for petroleum price control.\nAs of January 1, 2021, Texas has proved recoverable petroleum reserves of about of crude oil (44% of the known U.S. reserves) and of natural gas liquids. The state's refineries can process of oil a day. The Port Arthur Refinery in Southeast Texas is the largest refinery in the U.S. Texas is also a leader in natural gas production at per day, some 32% of the nation's production. Texas has of gas reserves which is 23% of the nation's gas reserves. Many petroleum companies are based in Texas such as: ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, ExxonMobil, Halliburton, Hilcorp, Marathon Oil, Occidental Petroleum, Valero Energy, and Western Refining.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, Texans consume, on average, the fifth most energy (of all types) in the nation per capita and as a whole, following behind Wyoming, Alaska, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Iowa.\nUnlike the rest of the nation, most of Texas is on its own alternating current power grid, the Texas Interconnection. Texas has a deregulated electric service. Texas leads the nation in total net electricity production, generating 437,236 MWh in 2014, 89% more MWh than Florida, which ranked second.\nThe state is a leader in renewable energy commercialization; it produces the most wind power in the nation. In 2014, 10.6% of the electricity consumed in Texas came from wind turbines. The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, is one of the world's largest wind farms with a 781.5 megawatt (MW) capacity. The Energy Information Administration states the state's large agriculture and forestry industries could give Texas an enormous amount of biomass for use in biofuels. The state also has the highest solar power potential for development in the U.S.\nTechnology.\nWith large universities systems coupled with initiatives like the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund, a wide array of different high tech industries have developed in Texas. The Austin area is nicknamed the \"Silicon Hills\" and the north Dallas area the \"Silicon Prairie\". Many high-tech companies are located in or have their headquarters in Texas (and Austin in particular), including Dell, Inc., Borland, Forcepoint, Indeed.com, Texas Instruments, Perot Systems, Rackspace and AT&amp;T.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (NASA JSC) is located in Southeast Houston. Both SpaceX and Blue Origin have their test facilities in Texas. Fort Worth hosts both Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division and Bell Helicopter Textron. Lockheed builds the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the largest Western fighter program, and its successor, the F-35 Lightning II in Fort Worth.\nCommerce.\nTexas has strong commercial sector consisting of retail, wholesale, banking and insurance, and construction sectors. Texas further has a diverse economy, with multiple \"Fortune\" 500 companies not based on Texas traditional industries such as AT&amp;T, Kimberly-Clark, J. C. Penney, Whole Foods Market, and Tenet Healthcare. Nationally, the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area, home to the second shopping mall in the United States, has the most shopping malls per capita of any American metropolitan statistical area.\nMexico, the state's largest trading partner, imports a third of the state's exports because of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA has encouraged the formation of maquiladoras on the Texas\u2013Mexico border.\nTransportation.\nAlthough the state's large size and rough terrain have historically complicated transportation, Texas has compensated by building the nation's largest highway and railway systems. The regulatory authority, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), maintains the state's highway system, and regulates aviation and public transportation systems.\nTexas is an important transportation hub in America - from the Dallas/Fort Worth area, trucks can reach 93 percent of the nation's population within 48 hours, and 37 percent within 24 hours. Texas has 33 foreign trade zones (FTZ), the most in the nation. In 2004, a combined total of $298\u00a0billion of goods passed through Texas FTZs.\nHighways.\nThe first Texas freeway was the Gulf Freeway opened in 1948 in Houston. As of 2005, of public highway crisscrossed Texas (up from in 1984). To fund recent growth in the state highways, Texas has 17 toll roads with several additional tollways proposed. In Central Texas, the southern section of the State Highway 130 toll road has a speed limit of , the highest in the nation. All federal and state highways in Texas are paved.\nAirports.\nTexas has 730 airports, second-most of any state in the nation. Largest in Texas by size and passengers served, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is the second-largest by area in the United States, and fourth in the world with . In traffic, DFW airport is the busiest in the state, the fourth busiest in the United States, and sixth worldwide. Southwest Airlines, headquartered in Dallas, has its operations at Dallas Love Field. American Airlines Group's American / American Eagle, the world's largest airline in total passengers-miles transported and passenger fleet size, uses DFW as its largest and main hub.\nTexas's second-largest air facility is Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). It serves as the largest hub for United Airlines, the world's third-largest airline, by passenger-miles flown. IAH offers service to the most Mexican destinations of any U.S. airport. The next five largest airports in the state all serve more than three million passengers annually; they include Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, William P. Hobby Airport, San Antonio International Airport, Dallas Love Field and El Paso International Airport. The smallest airport in the state to be designated an international airport is Del Rio International Airport.\nPorts.\nAround 1,150 seaports dot Texas's coast with over of channels. Ports employ nearly one-million people and handle an average of 317\u00a0million metric tons. Texas ports connect with the rest of the U.S. Atlantic seaboard with the Gulf section of the Intracoastal Waterway. The Port of Houston today is the busiest port in the United States in foreign tonnage, second in overall tonnage, and tenth worldwide in tonnage. The Houston Ship Channel spans wide by deep by long.\nRailroads.\nPart of the state's tradition of cowboys is derived from the massive cattle drives which its ranchers organized in the nineteenth century to drive livestock to railroads and markets.\nThe first railroad to operate in Texas was the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway, opening in August 1853. The first railroad to enter Texas from the north, completed in 1872, was the Missouri\u2013Kansas\u2013Texas Railroad. With increasing railroad access, the ranchers did not have to take their livestock up to the Midwest and shipped beef out from Texas. This caused a decline in the economies of the cow towns.\nSince 1911, Texas has led the nation in length of railroad miles within the state. Texas railway length peaked in 1932 at , but declined to by 2000. While the Railroad Commission of Texas originally regulated state railroads, in 2005 the state reassigned these duties to TxDOT.\nIn the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area, three public transit agencies provide rail service: Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA), and Trinity Metro. DART began operating the first light rail system in the Southwest United States in 1996. The Trinity Railway Express (TRE) commuter rail service, which connects Fort Worth and Dallas, is provided by Trinity Metro and DART. Trinity Metro also operates the TEXRail commuter rail line, connecting downtown Fort Worth and Northeast Tarrant County to DFW Airport. The A-train commuter rail line, operated by DCTA, acts as an extension of the DART Green line into Denton County. In the Austin area, Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates a commuter rail service known as Capital MetroRail to the northwestern suburbs. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas (METRO) operates light rail lines called METRORail in the Houston area.\nAmtrak provides Texas with limited intercity passenger rail service. Three scheduled routes serve the state: the daily \"Texas Eagle\" (Chicago\u2013San Antonio); the tri-weekly \"Sunset Limited\" (New Orleans\u2013Los Angeles), with stops in Texas; and the daily \"Heartland Flyer\" (Fort Worth\u2013Oklahoma City). Texas may get one of the nation's first high-speed rail line. Plans for a privately funded high-speed rail line between Dallas and Houston have been planned by the Texas Central Railway company.\nCulture.\nHistorically, Texas culture comes from a blend of mostly Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.\nTexas has made a strong mark on national and international pop culture. The entire state is strongly associated with the image of the cowboy shown in westerns and in country western music. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series \"Dallas\".\nThe internationally known slogan \"Don't Mess with Texas\" began as an anti-littering advertisement. Since the campaign's inception in 1986, the phrase has become \"an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger\".\nTexas self-perception.\n\"Texas-sized\" describes something that is about the size of Texas, or something (usually but not always originating from Texas) that is large compared to other objects of its type. Texas was the largest U.S. state until Alaska became a state in 1959. The phrase \"everything is bigger in Texas\" has been in regular use since at least 1950.\nArts.\nHouston is one of only five American cities with permanent professional resident companies in all the major performing arts disciplines: the Houston Grand Opera, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Ballet, and The Alley Theatre. Known for the vibrancy of its visual and performing arts, the Houston Theater District ranks second in the country in the number of theater seats in a concentrated downtown area, with 12,948 seats for live performances and 1,480 movie seats.\nFounded in 1892, Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, also called \"The Modern\", is Texas's oldest art museum. Fort Worth also has the Kimbell Art Museum, the Amon Carter Museum, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, the Will Rogers Memorial Center, and the Bass Performance Hall downtown. The Arts District of Downtown Dallas has arts venues such as the Dallas Museum of Art, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House, the Trammell &amp; Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art, and the Nasher Sculpture Center.\nThe Deep Ellum district within Dallas became popular during the 1920s and 1930s as the prime jazz and blues hotspot in the Southern United States. The name Deep Ellum comes from local people pronouncing \"Deep Elm\" as \"Deep Ellum\". Artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson, Robert Johnson, Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter, and Bessie Smith played in early Deep Ellum clubs.\nAustin, \"The Live Music Capital of the World\", boasts \"more live music venues per capita than such music hotbeds as Nashville, Memphis, Los Angeles, Las Vegas or New York City\". The city's music revolves around the nightclubs on 6th Street; events like the film, music, and multimedia festival South by Southwest; the longest-running concert music program on American television, \"Austin City Limits\"; and the Austin City Limits Music Festival held in Zilker Park.\nSince 1980, San Antonio has evolved into \"The Tejano Music Capital Of The World\". The Tejano Music Awards have provided a forum to create greater awareness and appreciation for Tejano music and culture.\nSports.\nWithin the \"Big Four\" professional leagues, Texas has two NFL teams (the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans), two MLB teams (the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers), three NBA teams (the San Antonio Spurs, the Houston Rockets, and the Dallas Mavericks), and one NHL team (the Dallas Stars). The Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex is one of only twelve American metropolitan areas that host sports teams from all the \"Big Four\" professional leagues. Outside of the \"Big Four\", Texas also has a WNBA team (the Dallas Wings), three Major League Soccer teams (Austin FC, Houston Dynamo FC and FC Dallas), and one NWSL team (the Houston Dash).\nCollegiate athletics have deep significance in Texas culture, especially football. The state has twelve Division I-FBS schools, the most in the nation. Four of the state's schools claim at least one national championship in football: the Texas Longhorns, the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, the TCU Horned Frogs, and the SMU Mustangs. According to a survey of Division I-A coaches, the rivalry between the University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas at Austin, the Red River Shootout, ranks the third-best in the nation. The TCU Horned Frogs and SMU Mustangs also share a rivalry and compete annually in the Battle for the Iron Skillet. A fierce rivalry, the Lone Star Showdown, also exists between the state's two largest universities, Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The athletics portion of the Lone Star Showdown rivalry was paused between 2012, when Texas A&amp;M left the Big 12 and joined the SEC, and 2024, when Texas joined them.\nThe University Interscholastic League (UIL) organizes most primary and secondary school competitions. Events organized by UIL include contests in athletics (the most popular being high school football) as well as artistic and academic subjects.\nTexans also enjoy rodeo. The world's first rodeo was hosted in Pecos, Texas. The annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest rodeo in the world. The Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth is the oldest continuously running rodeo incorporating many of the state's most historic traditions into its annual events. Dallas hosts the State Fair of Texas each year at Fair Park.\nTexas Motor Speedway hosts annual NASCAR Cup Series and IndyCar Series auto races since 1997. Since 2012, Austin's Circuit of the Americas plays host to a round of the Formula 1 World Championship.\nThe Panther City Lacrosse Club is a professional lacrosse team in the National Lacrosse League. They have played local matches at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas since their inaugural 2021\u20132022 season.\nEducation.\nThe second president of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar, is known as the \"Father of Texas Education\". During his term, the state set aside three leagues in each county for public schools. An additional 50 leagues of land set aside for the support of two universities would later become the basis of the state's Permanent University Fund. Lamar's actions set the foundation for a Texas-wide public school system.\nTexas has over 1,000 school districts, all administered by the Texas Education Agency, and all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing, the state has a tax redistribution system called the \"Robin Hood plan\" which transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or homeschooling activities.\nStudents in Texas take the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in primary and secondary school. STAAR assess students' attainment of reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies skills required under Texas education standards and the No Child Left Behind Act. The test replaced the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test in the 2011\u20132012 school year.\nGenerally prohibited in the Western world, school corporal punishment is not unusual in the more conservative, rural areas of the state, with 28,569 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011\u20132012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Texas is surpassed only by Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.\nHigher education.\nThe state's two most widely recognized flagship universities are The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M University, ranked as the 21st and 41st best universities in the nation according to 2020's latest Center for World University Rankings report, respectively. Some observers also include the University of Houston and Texas Tech University as tier one flagships alongside UT Austin and A&amp;M. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board ranks the state's public universities into three distinct tiers:\nThe Carnegie Foundation classifies six of Texas's universities as Tier One research institutions:\nTexas's alternative affirmative action plan, Texas House Bill 588, guarantees Texas students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class automatic admission to state-funded universities. This does not apply to The University of Texas at Austin, which automatically admits Texas students who graduated in the top 6 percent of their high school class. The bill encourages demographic diversity while attempting to avoid problems stemming from the \"Hopwood v. Texas\" (1996) case.\nThirty-six public universities exist in Texas, of which 32 belong to one of the six state university systems. Discovery of minerals on Permanent University Fund land, particularly oil, has helped fund the rapid growth of the state's two largest university systems: the University of Texas System and the Texas A&amp;M System. The four other university systems: the University of Houston System, the University of North Texas System, the Texas State System, and the Texas Tech System are not funded by the Permanent University Fund.\nThe University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M University are the flagship universities of the University of Texas System and Texas A&amp;M University System, respectively. Both were established by the Texas Constitution and hold stakes in the Permanent University Fund.\nThe state has sought to expand the number of flagship universities by elevating some of its seven institutions designated as \"emerging research universities\". The two expected to emerge first are the University of Houston and Texas Tech University, likely in that order according to discussions on the House floor of the 82nd Texas Legislature.\nThe state is home to various private institutions of higher learning\u2014ranging from liberal arts colleges to a nationally recognized top-tier research university. Rice University in Houston is one of the leading teaching and research universities of the United States and is ranked the nation's 17th-best overall university by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\".\nTrinity University, a private, primarily undergraduate liberal arts university in San Antonio, has ranked first among universities granting primarily bachelor's and select master's degrees in the Western United States for 20 consecutive years by \"U.S. News\". Private universities include Abilene Christian University, Austin College, Baylor University, University of Mary Hardin\u2013Baylor, and Southwestern University.\nUniversities in Texas host three presidential libraries: George Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&amp;M University, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum at The University of Texas at Austin, and the George W. Bush Presidential Library at Southern Methodist University.\nHealthcare.\nNotwithstanding the concentration of elite medical centers in the state, The Commonwealth Fund ranks the Texas healthcare system the third worst in the nation. Texas ranks close to last in access to healthcare, quality of care, avoidable hospital spending, and equity. In May 2006, Texas initiated the program \"code red\" in response to the report the state had 25.1 percent of the population without health insurance, the largest proportion in the nation.\nThe Trust for America's Health ranked Texas 15th highest in adult obesity: 27.2 percent of the state's population is obese. The 2008 Men's Health obesity survey ranked four Texas cities among the top 25 fattest cities in America: Houston ranked 6th, Dallas 7th, El Paso 8th, and Arlington 14th. Texas had only one city (Austin, ranked 21st) in the top 25 \"fittest cities\" in America. The state is ranked forty-second in the percentage of residents who engage in regular exercise according to a 2007 study.\nTexas has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, and the rate by which Texas women died from pregnancy-related complications doubled from 2010 to 2014, to 23.8 per 100,000\u2014a rate unmatched in any other U.S. state or economically developed country. In May 2021, the state legislature passed the Texas Heartbeat Act, which banned abortion from as early as six weeks of pregnancy, except to save the life of the mother. The Act allows private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone else who assists in an abortion, except for the woman on whom the abortion is performed. On August 25, 2022, another law took effect that made committing abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony punishable by life in prison.\nAccess to allergy and immunology specialists in Texas is unevenly distributed. While the state is served by approximately 462 allergists and immunologists, these specialists are primarily concentrated in major urban centers such as Dallas, Houston, and Austin. In rural areas of Texas, the average availability is significantly lower, with approximately one specialist for every 50,000 residents.\nMedical research.\nTexas has many elite research medical centers. The state has 15 medical schools, four dental schools, and two optometry schools. Texas has two Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories: one at The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, and the other at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio\u2014the first privately owned BSL-4 lab in the United States.\nThe Texas Medical Center in Houston holds the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions, with over 50 member institutions. Texas Medical Center performs the most heart transplants in the world. The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston is a highly regarded academic institution that centers around cancer patient care, research, education and prevention.\nSan Antonio's South Texas Medical Center facilities rank sixth in clinical medicine research impact in the United States. The University of Texas Health Science Center is another highly ranked research and educational institution in San Antonio.\nBoth the American Heart Association and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center call Dallas home. The institution's medical school employs the most medical school Nobel laureates in the world.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe current Texas Constitution was adopted in 1876. Like many states, it explicitly provides for a separation of powers. The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart, and has provisions unique to Texas.\nState government.\nTexas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the secretary of state, voters elect executive officers independently; candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When Republican president George W. Bush served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller of public accounts, land commissioner, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the secretary of state.\nThe bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives, with 150 members, and a Senate, with 31 members. The Speaker of the House leads the House, and the lieutenant governor, the Senate. The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over a hundred days, but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably, the Legislature cannot call itself into session). The state's fiscal year begins September1.\nThe judiciary of Texas is among the most complex in the United States, with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the Texas Supreme Court, for civil cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment. Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment, having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the \"Gregg v. Georgia\" case.\nThe Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety is a law enforcement agency with statewide jurisdiction. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as riot police and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history and some of the best-known criminal cases in the history of the Old West.\nThe Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. Commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm. Most cities in the state, those over 5,000 in population, have home-rule governments. The vast majority of these have charters for council-manager forms of government, by which voters elect council members, who hire a professional city manager as an operating officer.\nPolitics.\nThe Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the 20th century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.\nThe state's conservative White voters began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for local and state offices as well, and most Whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed to the fact the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the Republicans, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the growing Sun Belt cities' conservatism unlike the liberal tradition of their northeastern counterparts as well as the popularity of Republican party in the suburbs.\nThe 2003 Texas redistricting of Congressional districts led by Republican Tom DeLay, was called by \"The New York Times\" \"an extreme case of partisan gerrymandering\". A group of Democratic legislators, the \"Texas Eleven\", fled the state in a quorum-busting effort to prevent the legislature from acting, but was unsuccessful. The state had already redistricted following the 2000 census. Despite these efforts, the legislature passed a map heavily in favor of Republicans, based on 2000 data and ignoring the estimated nearly one million new residents in the state since then. Career attorneys and analysts at the Department of Justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of African American and Hispanic voters, but political appointees overrode them and approved it. Legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national Supreme Court in the case \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" (2006), but the court ruled in favor of the state (and Republicans).\nIn the 2014 Texas elections, the Tea Party movement made large gains, with numerous Tea Party favorites being elected into office, including Dan Patrick as lieutenant governor, Ken Paxton as attorney general, in addition to numerous other candidates including conservative Republican Greg Abbott as governor.\nTexas voters lean toward fiscal conservatism, while enjoying the benefits of significant federal investment in the state in military and other facilities achieved by the power of the Solid South in the 20th century. They also tend to have socially conservative values.\nSince 1980, most Texas voters have supported Republican presidential candidates. Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and El Paso consistently lean Democratic in both local and statewide elections. Residents of counties along the Rio Grande closer to the Mexico\u2013United States border, where there are many Latino residents, generally vote for Democratic Party candidates, while most other rural and suburban areas of Texas have shifted to voting for Republican Party candidates.\nAs of the midterm elections of 2022, a large majority of the members of Texas's U.S. House delegation are Republican, along with both U.S. Senators. In the 119th United States Congress, of the 38 Congressional districts in Texas, 25 are held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats. Texas's Senators are John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Since 1994, Texans have not elected a Democrat to a statewide office. The state's Democratic voters are made up primarily by liberal and minority groups in Austin, Beaumont, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio as well as minority voters in East and South Texas.\nAccording to a study by the Cato Institute, Texas ranks last in personal freedom among the states, by factors including incarceration rates, cannabis laws, civil asset forfeiture policies, educational freedom, gambling laws, marriage freedom, and travel freedom.\nLesser parties that have ballot access are the Green Party and the Libertarian Party.\nCriminal law.\nTexas has a reputation of very harsh criminal punishment for criminal offenses. It is one of the 32 states that practice capital punishment, and since the US Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976, 40% of all U.S. executions have taken place in Texas. In 2018, Texas had the 8th highest incarceration rate in the U.S. Texas also has strong right of self-defense and self defense laws, allowing citizens to use lethal force to defend themselves, their families, or their property. Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All languages in the family are tonal, including Thai and Lao, the national languages of Thailand and Laos, respectively. Around 93 million people speak Kra\u2013Dai languages; 60% of those speak Thai. \"Ethnologue\" lists 95 languages in the family, with 62 of these being in the Tai branch.\nNames.\nThe name \"Kra\u2013Dai\" was proposed by Weera Ostapirat (2000), as Kra and Dai are the reconstructed autonyms of the Kra and Tai branches, respectively. \"Kra\u2013Dai\" has since been used by the majority of specialists working on Southeast Asian linguistics, including Norquest (2007), Pittayaporn (2009), Baxter &amp; Sagart (2014), and Enfield &amp; Comrie (2015).\nThe name \"Tai\u2013Kadai\" is used in many references, as well as \"Ethnologue\" and \"Glottolog\", but Ostapirat (2000) and others suggest that it is problematic and confusing, preferring the name \"Kra\u2013Dai\" instead. \"Tai\u2013Kadai\" comes from an obsolete bifurcation of the family into two branches, Tai and Kadai, which had first been proposed by Paul K. Benedict (1942). In 1942, Benedict placed three Kra languages (Gelao, Laqua (Qabiao), and Lachi) together with Hlai in a group that he called \"Kadai\", from \"ka\", meaning \"person\" in Gelao and Laqua and \"dai\", a form of a Hlai autonym. Benedict's (1942) \"Kadai\" group was based on his observation that Kra and Hlai languages have Austronesian-like numerals. However, this classification is now universally rejected as obsolete after Ostapirat (2000) demonstrated the coherence of the Kra branch, which does not subgroup with the Hlai branch as Benedict (1942) had proposed. \"Kadai\" is sometimes used to refer to the entire Kra\u2013Dai family, including by Solnit (1988). Adding to the confusion, some other references restrict the usage of \"Kadai\" to only the Kra branch of the family.\nThe name \"Daic\" is used by Roger Blench (2008).\nOrigin.\nJames R. Chamberlain (2016) proposes that the Tai\u2013Kadai (Kra\u2013Dai) language family was formed as early as the 12th century BCE in the middle of the Yangtze basin, coinciding roughly with the establishment of the Chu fiefdom and the beginning of the Zhou dynasty. The high diversity of Kra\u2013Dai languages in southern China, especially in Guizhou and Hainan, points to that being an origin of the Kra\u2013Dai language family, founding the nations that later became Thailand and Laos in what had been Austroasiatic territory. Genetic and linguistic analyses show great homogeneity among Kra\u2013Dai-speaking people in Thailand.\nAlthough the position of Kra\u2013Dai in relation to Austronesian is still contested, some propose that Kra\u2013Dai and Austronesian are genetically connected. Weera Ostapirat (2005) sets out a series of regular sound correspondences between them, assuming a model of a primary split between the two; they would then be co-ordinate branches. Ostapirat (2013) continues to maintain that Kra\u2013Dai and Austronesian are sister language families, based on certain phonological correspondences. On the other hand, Laurent Sagart (2008) proposes that Kra\u2013Dai is a later form of what he calls \"FATK\" (Formosan Ancestor of Tai\u2013Kadai) a branch of Austronesian belonging to the subgroup \"Puluqic\", developed in Taiwan, whose speakers migrated back to the mainland, to Guangdong, Hainan, and north Vietnam, around the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE. Upon their arrival in this region, they underwent linguistic contact with an unknown population, resulting in a partial relexification of FATK vocabulary. Erica Brindley (2015) supports Sagart's hypothesis, arguing that the radically different Kra-Dai history of migration to the mainland (as opposed to the Philippines for Proto-Austronesian) and extended contact with Austro-Asiatic and Sinitic speakers would make the relationship appear more distant. She also suggests that the presence of only the most basic Austronesian vocabulary in Kra-Dai makes this scenario of relexification more plausible.\nBesides various concrete pieces of evidence for a Kra\u2013Dai existence in present-day Guangdong, remnants of Kra\u2013Dai languages spoken further north can be found in unearthed inscriptional materials and non-Han substrata in Min and Wu Chinese.\nWolfgang Behr (2002, 2006, 2009, 2017) points out that most non-Sinitic words found in Chu inscriptional materials are of Kra\u2013Dai origin. For example, the Chu graph for 'one, once' written as (? &lt; OC *nn\u0259\u014b) in the \"E jun qijie\" \u9102\u541b\u555f\u7b6f bronze tally and in Warring States bamboo inscriptions, which represents a Kra\u2013Dai areal word; compare Proto-Tai *hn\u00ef\u014b \"=\" *hn\u026f\u014b (Siamese 22n\u026f\u014b, Dai 33n\u026f\u014b, Longzhou n\u0259\u0259\u014bA etc.) 'one, once'.\nIn the early 1980s, Wei Qingwen (\u97e6\u5e86\u7a33), a Zhuang linguist, proposed that the Old Yue language recorded in the Song of the Yue Boatman is in fact a language ancestral to Zhuang. Wei used reconstructed Old Chinese for the characters and discovered that the resulting vocabulary showed strong resemblance to modern Zhuang. Later, Zhengzhang Shangfang (1991) followed Wei's proposal but used Thai script for comparison, since this orthography dates from the 13th century and preserves archaisms not found in modern pronunciation. Zhengzhang notes that 'evening, night, dark' bears the C tone in Wuming Zhuang \"xamC2\" and \"\u0263amC2\" 'night'. The item \"raa\" normally means 'we (inclusive)' but in some places, e.g., Tai Lue and White Tai, it means 'I'. However, Laurent Sagart criticizes Zhengzhang's interpretation as anachronistic, because however archaic the Thai script is, the Thai language was only written 2,000 years after the song had been recorded; even if Proto-Kam\u2013Tai had emerged by the 6th century BCE, its pronunciation would have been substantially different from Thai.\nInternal classification.\nKra\u2013Dai consists of at least five well-established branches, namely Kra, Kam\u2013Sui, Tai, Be, and Hlai (Ostapirat 2005:109).\nChinese linguists have also proposed a Kam\u2013Tai group that includes Kam\u2013Sui, Tai, and Be.\nKra\u2013Dai languages that are not securely classified and may constitute independent Kra\u2013Dai branches include the following:\nKra\u2013Dai languages of mixed origins are:\nEdmondson and Solnit (1988).\nAn early but influential classification, with the traditional Kam\u2013Tai clade, was Edmondson and Solnit's classification from 1988:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis classification is also used by Liang and Zhang (1996), Chamberlain (2016: 38), and \"Ethnologue\", though by 2009 Lakkia was made a third branch of Kam\u2013Tai and Biao was moved into Kam\u2013Sui.\nOstapirat (2005); Norquest (2007).\nWeera Ostapirat (2005:128) suggests the possibility of Kra and Kam\u2013Sui being grouped together as Northern Kra\u2013Dai and Hlai with Tai as Southern Kra\u2013Dai. Norquest (2007) has further updated this classification to include Lakkia and Be. Norquest notes that Lakkia shares some similarities with Kam\u2013Sui, while Be shares some similarities with Tai. Norquest (2007:15) notes that Be shares various similarities with Northern Tai languages in particular. Following Ostapirat, Norquest adopts the name Kra\u2013Dai for the family as a whole. The following tree of Kra\u2013Dai is from Norquest (2007:16):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditionally, Norquest (2007) also proposes a reconstruction for Proto-Southern Kra\u2013Dai.\nNorquest (2015, 2020).\nA classification of Kra\u2013Dai by Norquest (2015, 2020) is provided as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNorquest (2021).\nBased on shared lexical innovations, Norquest (2021) significantly revised his classification of Kra\u2013Dai. Together, Biao and Lakkja form the most divergent subgroup of Kra\u2013Dai. Be\u2013Tai and Hlai are placed together as part of a \"Hlai\u2013Tai\" group.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHypotheses regarding external relationships.\nAustro-Tai.\nSeveral scholars have presented evidence that Kra\u2013Dai may be related to, or even a branch of, the Austronesian language family. There are a number of possible cognates in the core vocabulary, displaying regular sound correspondences. Among proponents, there is yet no agreement as to whether they are a sister group to Austronesian in a family called Austro-Tai, a back-migration from Taiwan to the mainland or a later migration from the Philippines to Hainan during the Austronesian expansion.\nThe inclusion of Japanese in the Austro-Tai family, as proposed by Paul K. Benedict in the late 20th century, is not supported by the current proponents of the Austro-Tai hypothesis.\nSino-Tai.\nThe Kra\u2013Dai languages were formerly considered to be part of the Sino-Tibetan family, partly because they contain large numbers of words that are similar to Sino-Tibetan languages. However, Western scholars generally consider them to be Sinitic loanwords and note that basic vocabulary words in Kra\u2013Dai languages often have cognates with Austronesian instead. Outside China, the Kra\u2013Dai languages are now classified as an independent family. In China, they are called \"Dong\u2013Tai\" (\u4f97\u53f0) or \"Zhuang\u2013Dong\" (\u58ee\u4f97) languages and are generally included, along with the Hmong\u2013Mien languages, in the Sino-Tibetan family.\nHmong\u2013Mien.\nKosaka (2002) has argued specifically for a Miao\u2013Dai family. Based on proposed lexical cognates, he proposes a genetic relation between Hmong\u2013Mien and Kra\u2013Dai languages. He further suggests that similarities between Kra\u2013Dai and Austronesian are due to later areal contact in the coastal areas of eastern and southeastern China or an older ancestral relation (Proto-East Asian).\nJaponic.\nVovin (2014) has proposed that the location of the Japonic Urheimat (linguistic homeland) is in southern China. He argues for typological evidence that Proto-Japanese may have been a monosyllabic, SVO syntax and isolating language, which is also characteristic of Kra\u2013Dai languages. According to him, these common features are however not due to a genetic relationship but rather the result of intense contact.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The core lineup of the band comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are widely regarded as the most influential band in popular music and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, starting in 1960. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market. They soon made their film debut with \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964). \nA growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced albums of greater sophistication, including \"Rubber Soul\" (1965), \"Revolver\" (1966) and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967). They enjoyed further commercial success with \"The Beatles\" (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and \"Abbey Road\" (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists. While some partial reunions occurred over the next decade, the four members never reunited. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001; McCartney and Starr remain musically active. \nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600\u00a0million units worldwide. They are the most successful act in the history of the US \"Billboard\" charts, with the most number 1 hits on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart (20), and they hold the record for most number 1 albums on the UK Albums Chart (15) and most singles sold in the UK (21.9\u00a0million). The band received many accolades, including eight Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film \"Let It Be\") and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility, 1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped \"Rolling Stone\"'s lists of the greatest artists in history. \"Time\" magazine named them among the .\nHistory.\n1956\u20131963: Formation.\nThe Quarrymen and name changes.\nIn November 1956, sixteen-year-old John Lennon formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They were called \"the Quarrymen\", a reference to their school song \"Quarry men old before our birth\". Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney met Lennon on 6 July 1957 and joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison, then aged fifteen, to watch the band. Harrison auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young. After a month's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), Harrison performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \"Raunchy\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as lead guitarist.\nBy January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. They also performed as \"the Rainbows\". Paul McCartney later told \"New Musical Express\" that they called themselves that \"because we all had different coloured shirts and we couldn't afford any others!\"\nLennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the band's name to \"Beatals\", as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became \"the Silver Beetles\", before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as \"the Silver Beatles\" and by the middle of August simply \"the Beatles\".\nEarly residencies and UK popularity.\nAllan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg. They auditioned and hired drummer Pete Best in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, departed Liverpool for Hamburg four days later, contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for what would be a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442-month residency. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life\u00a0... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\"\nKoschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the red light Reeperbahn district of St. Pauli into music venues and initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave them one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fianc\u00e9e Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.\nDuring the next two\u00a0years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \"exi\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany. McCartney took over bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records. As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one\u00a0year. Credited to \"Tony Sheridan &amp; the Beat Brothers\", the single \"My Bonnie\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the \"Musikmarkt\" chart.\nAfter the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing Merseybeat movement. However, they were growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night. In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at the Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist. He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence\u00a0... [a] star quality.\"\nFirst EMI recordings.\nEpstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month early release in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg. On their return to Germany in April, a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from a brain haemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band, saying, \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein\". However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.\nMartin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI Recording Studios (later Abbey Road Studios) in London on 6 June 1962. He immediately complained to Epstein about Best's drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \"Love Me Do\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \"Love Me Do\", \"Please Please Me\" and \"P.S. I Love You\".\nMartin initially selected the Starr version of \"Love Me Do\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \"Love Me Do\" peaked at number 17 on the \"Record Retailer\" chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme \"People and Places\". After Martin suggested rerecording \"Please Please Me\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \"You've just made your first No.\u00a01\".\nIn December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency at the Star-Club. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums \u2013 including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change\u00a0\u2013 stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking\u00a0...\".\n1963\u20131966: Beatlemania and touring years.\n\"Please Please Me\" and \"With the Beatles\".\nOn 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut LP, \"Please Please Me\". It was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles. Martin considered recording the LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a \"live\" album with minimal production in \"a single marathon session at Abbey Road\". After the moderate success of \"Love Me Do\", the single \"Please Please Me\" was released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album. It reached number 1 on every UK chart except \"Record Retailer\", where it peaked at number 2.\nRecalling how the Beatles \"rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out \"Please Please Me\" in a day\", AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: \"Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins.\" Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time; he and McCartney were \"just writing songs \"\u00e0 la\" Everly Brothers, \"\u00e0 la\" Buddy Holly, pop songs with no more thought of them than that\u00a0\u2013 to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant.\"\nReleased in March 1963, \"Please Please Me\" was the first of eleven consecutive Beatles albums released in the United Kingdom to reach number 1. The band's third single, \"From Me to You\", came out in April and began an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number 1 singles, including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six\u00a0years. Issued in August, their fourth single, \"She Loves You\", achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time, selling three-quarters of a million copies in under four weeks. It became their first single to sell a million copies and remained the biggest-selling record in the UK until 1978.\nThe success brought increased media exposure, to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time, inspiring even more interest. The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year: a four-week tour that began in February, the Beatles' first nationwide, preceded three-week tours in March and May\u2013June. As their popularity spread, a frenzied adulation of the group took hold. On 13 October, the Beatles starred on \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\", the UK's top variety show. Their performance was televised live and watched by 15\u00a0million viewers. One national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans who greeted the band \u2013 and it stuck. Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \"by audience demand\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US. A similar situation arose during their May\u2013June tour with Roy Orbison.\nIn late October, the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962. On their return to the UK on 31 October, several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers, as well as representatives from the BBC, also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events. The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks. In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth. On 4 November, they played in front of The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret during the Royal Variety Performance at the Prince of Wales Theatre.\n\"Please Please Me\" maintained the top position on the \"Record Retailer\" chart for 30 weeks, only to be displaced by its follow-up, \"With the Beatles\", which EMI released on 22 November to record advance orders of 270,000 copies. The LP topped a half-million albums sold in one week. Recorded between July and October, \"With the Beatles\" made better use of studio production techniques than its predecessor. It held the top spot for 21 weeks with a chart life of 40 weeks. Erlewine described the LP as \"a sequel of the highest order \u2013 one that betters the original\".\nIn a reversal of then standard practice, EMI released the album ahead of the impending single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", with the song excluded to maximise the single's sales. The album caught the attention of music critic William Mann of \"The Times\", who suggested that Lennon and McCartney were \"the outstanding English composers of 1963\". The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music, lending it respectability. \"With the Beatles\" became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies, a figure previously reached only by the 1958 \"South Pacific\" soundtrack. When writing the sleeve notes for the album, the band's press officer, Tony Barrow, used the superlative the \"fabulous foursome\", which the media widely adopted as \"the Fab Four\".\nFirst visit to the United States and the British Invasion.\nEMI's American subsidiary, Capitol Records, hindered the Beatles' releases in the United States for more than a year by initially declining to issue their music, including their first three singles. Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some, but not all, of the songs in 1963. Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album \"Introducing... The Beatles\", comprising most of the songs of Parlophone's \"Please Please Me\", but a management shake-up led to the album not being released. After it emerged that the label did not report royalties on their sales, the licence that Vee-Jay had signed with EMI was voided. A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single \"She Loves You\". The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia from Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the \"Rate-a-Record\" segment of \"American Bandstand\", but it failed to catch on nationally.\nEpstein brought a demo copy of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" to Capitol's Brown Meggs, who signed the band and arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC, in Washington, DC, obtained a copy of the British single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in mid-December 1963 and began playing it on-air. Taped copies of the song soon circulated among other radio stations throughout the US. This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to bring forward the release of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" by three weeks. Issued on 26 December, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" sold a million copies, becoming a number 1 hit in the US by mid-January. In its wake Vee-Jay released \"Introducing... The Beatles\" along with Capitol's debut album, \"Meet the Beatles!\", while Swan reactivated production of \"She Loves You\". The Odeon label, an EMI subsidiary, pressed Beatles LPs to be shipped out and distributed abroad. After the Beatles' US trip, MGM Records released the single \"My Bonnie\" backed with \"The Saints\" in the US on 27 January 1964 as a Beatles single, and Atco followed in issuing the recordings the Beatles had made in Germany with Tony Sheridan in 1961 and 1962.\nOn 7 February 1964, the Beatles departed from Heathrow with an estimated 4,000 fans waving and screaming as the aircraft took off. Upon landing at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, an uproarious crowd estimated at 3,000 greeted them. They gave their first live US television performance two days later on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", watched by approximately 73\u00a0million viewers in over 23\u00a0million households, or 34 per cent of the American population. Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was \"the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television \". The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a largely negative critical consensus in the US, but a day later at their first US concert, Beatlemania erupted at the Washington Coliseum. Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall. The band flew to Florida, where they appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" a second time, again before 70\u00a0million viewers, before returning to the UK on 22 February.\nThe Beatles' first visit to the US took place when the nation was still mourning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous November.&lt;ref name=\"Gimore (RS Beatles/Dylan/60s)\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators often suggest that for many, particularly the young, the Beatles' performances reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that had momentarily faded in the wake of the assassination and helped pave the way for the revolutionary social changes to come later in the decade. Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture.\nThe group's popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, and many other UK acts subsequently made their American debuts, successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion. The Beatles' success in the US opened the door for a successive string of British beat groups and pop acts such as the Dave Clark Five, the Animals, Herman's Hermits, Petula Clark, the Kinks and the Rolling Stones to achieve success in America. During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five.\n\"A Hard Day's Night\".\nCapitol Records' lack of interest throughout 1963 did not go unnoticed, and a competitor, United Artists Records, encouraged its film division to offer the Beatles a three-motion-picture deal, primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks in the US. Directed by Richard Lester, \"A Hard Day's Night\" involved the band for six weeks in March\u2013April 1964 as they played themselves in a musical comedy. The film premiered in London and New York in July and August, respectively, and was an international success, with some critics drawing a comparison with the Marx Brothers.\nUnited Artists released a full soundtrack album for the North American market, combining Beatles songs and Martin's orchestral score; elsewhere, the group's third studio LP, \"A Hard Day's Night\", contained songs from the film on side one and other new recordings on side two. According to Erlewine, the album saw them \"truly coming into their own as a band. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound, filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies.\" That \"ringing guitar\" sound was primarily the product of Harrison's 12-string electric Rickenbacker, a prototype given to him by the manufacturer, which made its debut on the record.\n1964 world tour, meeting Bob Dylan and stand on civil rights.\nTouring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September, they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 people to each 30-minute performance in cities from New York to San Francisco.\nIn August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fan bases were \"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\": Dylan's audience of \"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\" contrasted with their fans, \"veritable 'teenyboppers' \u2013 kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\"\nWithin six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \"nearly evaporated\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.\nDuring the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with racial segregation in the country at the time. When informed that the venue for their 11 September concert, the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida, was segregated, the Beatles said they would refuse to perform unless the audience was integrated. Lennon stated: \"We never play to segregated audiences and we aren't going to start now\u00a0... I'd sooner lose our appearance money.\" City officials relented and agreed to allow an integrated show. The group also cancelled their reservations at the whites-only Hotel George Washington in Jacksonville. For their subsequent US tours in 1965 and 1966, the Beatles included clauses in contracts stipulating that shows be integrated.\n\"Beatles for Sale\", \"Help!\" and \"Rubber Soul\".\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles' fourth studio LP, \"Beatles for Sale\", evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions. They had intended the album, recorded between August and October 1964, to continue the format established by \"A Hard Day's Night\" which, unlike their first two LPs, contained only original songs. They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album, however, and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts, Lennon admitted, \"Material's becoming a hell of a problem\". As a result, six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album. Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership.\nIn early 1965, following a dinner with Lennon, Harrison and their wives, Harrison's dentist, John Riley, secretly added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: \"It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned for a month or two.\" He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realised a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time \u2013 these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\" McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that \"it opened my eyes\" and \"made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society\".\nControversy erupted in June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II appointed all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated them for the award. In protest \u2013 the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders \u2013 some conservative MBE recipients returned their insignia.\nIn July, the Beatles' second film, \"Help!\", was released, again directed by Lester. Described as \"mainly a relentless spoof of Bond\", it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band. McCartney said: \"\"Help!\" was great but it wasn't our film\u00a0\u2013 we were sort of guest stars. It was fun, but basically, as an idea for a film, it was a bit wrong.\" The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: \"Help!\" and \"Ticket to Ride\".\nThe \"Help!\" album, the group's fifth studio LP, mirrored \"A Hard Day's Night\" by featuring soundtrack songs on side one and additional songs from the same sessions on side two. The LP contained all original material save for two covers, \"Act Naturally\" and \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\"; they were the last covers the band would include on an album until \"Let It Be\"'s brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song \"Maggie Mae\". The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on \"Help!\" and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements, including a string quartet on the pop ballad \"Yesterday\". Composed and sung by McCartney \u2013 none of the other Beatles perform on the recording \u2013 \"Yesterday\" has inspired the most cover versions of any song ever written. With \"Help!\", the Beatles became the first rock group to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\nThe group's third US tour opened with a performance before a world-record crowd of 55,600 at New York's Shea Stadium on 15 August \u2013 \"perhaps the most famous of all Beatles' concerts\", in Lewisohn's description. A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities. At a show in Atlanta, the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers. Towards the end of the tour, they met with Elvis Presley, a foundational musical influence on the band, who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills. Presley later said the band was an example of a trend of anti-Americanism and drug abuse.\nSeptember 1965 saw the launch of an American Saturday-morning cartoon series, \"The Beatles\", that echoed \"A Hard Day's Night\"'s slapstick antics over its two-year original run. The series was the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real, living people.\nIn mid-October, the Beatles entered the recording studio; for the first time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, \"we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own.\" Released in December, \"Rubber Soul\" was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy, a development that NEMS executive Peter Brown attributed to the band members' \"now habitual use of marijuana\". Lennon referred to \"Rubber Soul\" as \"the pot album\" and Starr said: \"Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently.\" After \"Help!\"'s foray into classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As the lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning.\nWhile some of \"Rubber Soul\"'s songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, the album also included distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit. \"In My Life\", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue. Harrison called \"Rubber Soul\" his \"favourite album\", and Starr referred to it as \"the departure record\". McCartney has said, \"We'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.\" However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group\u00a0\u2013 \"the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious\", he wrote, and \"as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right\".\nControversies, \"Revolver\" and final tour.\nCapitol Records, from December 1963 when it began issuing Beatles recordings for the US market, exercised complete control over format, compiling distinct US albums from the band's recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles. In June 1966, the Capitol LP \"Yesterday and Today\" caused an uproar with its cover, which portrayed the grinning Beatles dressed in butcher's overalls, accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls. According to Beatles biographer Bill Harry, it has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way Capitol had \"butchered\" the US versions of the band's albums. Thousands of copies of the LP had a new cover pasted over the original; an unpeeled \"first-state\" copy fetched $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. In England, meanwhile, Harrison met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, who agreed to train him on the instrument.\nDuring a tour of the Philippines the month after the \"Yesterday and Today\" furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first \u2013 rock 'n' roll or Christianity.\n\u2013 John Lennon, 1966\nAlmost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \"Christianity will go\", Lennon had said. \"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right\u00a0... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\" His comments went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine \"Datebook\" printed them five months later, it sparked a controversy with Christians in America's conservative Bible Belt region. The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused \"Datebook\" of having taken Lennon's words out of context. At a press conference, Lennon pointed out, \"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\" He claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\"\nReleased in August 1966, a week before the Beatles' final tour, \"Revolver\" marked another artistic step forward for the group. The album featured sophisticated songwriting, studio experimentation and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles, ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelia. Abandoning the customary group photograph, its Aubrey Beardsley-inspired cover \u2013 designed by Klaus Voormann, a friend of the band since their Hamburg days \u2013 was a monochrome collage and line drawing caricature of the group. The album was preceded by the single \"Paperback Writer\", backed by \"Rain\". Short promotional films were made for both songs; described by cultural historian Saul Austerlitz as \"among the first true music videos\", they aired on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"Top of the Pops\" in June.\nAmong the experimental songs on \"Revolver\" was \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's \"\". Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data. McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\" made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as \"a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song\". Harrison's emergence as a songwriter was reflected in three of his compositions appearing on the record. Among these, \"Taxman\", which opened the album, marked the first example of the Beatles making a political statement through their music.\nAs preparations were made for a tour of the US, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed for them by Vox, as they moved into larger venues in 1964; however, these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, and shaken up from the recent incident in the Philippines, they decided to make the August tour their last.\nThe band performed none of their new songs on the tour. In Chris Ingham's description, they were very much \"studio creations\u00a0... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts.\" The band's concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of four\u00a0years dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.\n1966\u20131970: Studio years.\n\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\nFreed from the burden of touring, the Beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", beginning in late November 1966. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, the album's recording took over 700 hours. He recalled the band's insistence \"that everything on \"Sgt. Pepper\" had to be different. We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins. We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around.\" Parts of \"A Day in the Life\" featured a 40-piece orchestra. The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" in February 1967; the \"Sgt. Pepper\" LP followed with a rush-release in May. The musical complexity of the records, created using relatively primitive four-track recording technology, astounded contemporary artists. Among music critics, acclaim for the album was virtually universal. Gould writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The overwhelming consensus is that the Beatles had created a popular masterpiece: a rich, sustained, and overflowing work of collaborative genius whose bold ambition and startling originality dramatically enlarged the possibilities and raised the expectations of what the experience of listening to popular music on record could be. On the basis of this perception, \"Sgt. Pepper\" became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album-formatted rock that would revolutionise both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963.\nIn the wake of \"Sgt. Pepper\", the underground and mainstream press widely publicised the Beatles as leaders of youth culture, as well as \"lifestyle revolutionaries\". The album was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were \"listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy\". The elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of the hippie movement, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their \"brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms\" as a knowingly \"anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment\" display.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" topped the UK charts for 23 consecutive weeks, with a further four weeks at number 1 in the period through to February 1968. With 2.5\u00a0million copies sold within three months of its release, \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. It was the first rock album to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It sustained its immense popularity into the 21st century while breaking numerous sales records.\n\"Magical Mystery Tour\" and \"Yellow Submarine\".\nTwo Beatles film projects were conceived within weeks of completing \"Sgt. Pepper\": \"Magical Mystery Tour\", a one-hour television film, and \"Yellow Submarine\", an animated feature-length film produced by United Artists. The group began recording music for the former in late April 1967, but the project then lay dormant as they focused on recording songs for the latter. On 25 June, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single \"All You Need Is Love\" to an estimated 350\u00a0million viewers on \"Our World\", the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. The Beatles' use of psychedelic drugs was at its height during that summer. In July and August, the group pursued interests related to similar utopian-based ideology, including a week-long investigation into the possibility of starting an island-based commune off the coast of Greece.\nOn 24 August, the group were introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London. The next day, they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. On 27 August, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: \"We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've fuckin' had it now.'\" Harrison's then-wife Pattie Boyd remembered that \"Paul and George were in complete shock. I don't think it could have been worse if they had heard that their own fathers had dropped dead.\" During a band meeting in September, McCartney recommended that the band proceed with \"Magical Mystery Tour\".\nThe \"Magical Mystery Tour\" soundtrack was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play (EP) in early December 1967. It was the first example of a double EP in the UK. The record carried on the psychedelic vein of \"Sgt. Pepper\", though in line with the band's wishes, the packaging reinforced the idea that the release was a film soundtrack rather than a follow-up to \"Sgt. Pepper\". In the US, the soundtrack appeared as an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles. In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP and is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums.\n\"Magical Mystery Tour\" first aired on Boxing Day to an audience of approximately 15\u00a0million. Largely directed by McCartney, the film was the band's first critical failure in the UK. It was dismissed as \"blatant rubbish\" by the \"Daily Express\", the \"Daily Mail\" called it \"a colossal conceit\" and \"The Guardian\" labelled the film \"a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience\". Gould describes it as \"a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus\". Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film.\nThe group were less involved with \"Yellow Submarine\", which featured the band appearing as themselves for only a short live-action segment. Premiering in July 1968, the film featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs, including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film. Critics praised the film for its music, humour and innovative visual style. A soundtrack LP was issued seven months later; it contained those four new songs, the title track (already issued on \"Revolver\"), \"All You Need Is Love\" (already issued as a single and on the US \"Magical Mystery Tour\" LP) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin.\nIndia retreat, Apple Corps and the White Album.\nIn February 1968, the Beatles travelled to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, India, to take part in a three-month meditation \"Guide Course\". Their time in India marked one of the band's most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs, including a majority of those on their next album. However, Starr left after only ten days, unable to stomach the food, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to question when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \"Maharishi\", renamed \"Sexy Sadie\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\"\nIn May, Lennon and McCartney travelled to New York for the public unveiling of the Beatles' new business venture, Apple Corps. It was initially formed several months earlier as part of a plan to create a tax-effective business structure, but the band then desired to extend the corporation to other pursuits, including record distribution, peace activism and education. McCartney described Apple as \"rather like a Western communism\". The enterprise drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects handled largely by members of the Beatles' entourage, who were given their jobs regardless of talent and experience. Among its numerous subsidiaries were Apple Electronics, established to foster technological innovations with Magic Alex at the head, and Apple Retailing, which opened the short-lived Apple Boutique in London. Harrison later said, \"Basically, it was chaos\u00a0... John and Paul got carried away with the idea and blew millions, and Ringo and I just had to go along with it.\"\nFrom late May to mid-October 1968, the group recorded what became \"The Beatles\", a double LP commonly known as \"the White Album\" for its virtually featureless cover. During this time, relations between the members grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, leaving his bandmates to record \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" and \"Dear Prudence\" as a trio, with McCartney filling in on drums. Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" he scorned as \"granny music shit\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio. McCartney has recalled that the album \"wasn't a pleasant one to make\". He and Lennon identified the sessions as the start of the band's break-up.\nWith the record, the band executed a wider range of musical styles and broke with their recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre. During the sessions, the group upgraded to an eight-track tape console, which made it easier for them to layer tracks piecemeal, while the members often recorded independently of each other, affording the album a reputation as a collection of solo recordings rather than a unified group effort. Describing the double album, Lennon later said: \"Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it. [It's] John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band.\" The sessions also produced the Beatles' longest song yet, \"Hey Jude\", released in August as a non-album single with \"Revolution\".\nIssued in November, the White Album was the band's first Apple Records album release, although EMI continued to own their recordings. The record attracted more than 2\u00a0million advance orders, selling nearly 4\u00a0million copies in the US in little over a month, and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations. Its lyrical content was the focus of much analysis by the counterculture. Despite its popularity, reviewers were largely confused by the album's content and it failed to inspire the level of critical writing that \"Sgt. Pepper\" had.\n\"Abbey Road\", \"Let It Be\" and separation.\nAlthough \"Let It Be\" was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before \"Abbey Road\". The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time \u2013 on record and on film\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called \"Beatles at Work\", in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin said that the project was \"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \"hell\u00a0... the most miserable\u00a0... on Earth\", and Harrison, \"the low of all-time\". Irritated by McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled \"Get Back\", using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. His bandmates agreed and it was decided to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film.\nTo alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \"Get Back\" single \u2013 the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release. After the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Libyan desert and the Colosseum. Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row, London, on 30 January 1969. Five weeks later, engineer Glyn Johns, whom Lewisohn describes as \"Get Back\"'s \"uncredited producer\", began work assembling an album, given \"free rein\" as the band \"all but washed their hands of the entire project\".\nNew strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs. Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke; McCartney wanted Lee and John Eastman \u2013 father and brother, respectively, of Linda Eastman, whom McCartney married on 12 March. Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers. Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost. On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band, the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' lawyers. McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles.\nMartin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album, as the \"Get Back\" sessions had been \"a miserable experience\" and he had \"thought it was the end of the road for all of us\". The primary recording sessions for \"Abbey Road\" began on 2 July. Lennon, who rejected Martin's proposed format of a \"continuously moving piece of music\", wanted his and McCartney's songs to occupy separate sides of the album. The eventual format, with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley, was McCartney's suggested compromise. Emerick noted that the replacement of the studio's valve-based mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound, leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its \"kinder, gentler\" feel relative to their previous albums.\nOn 4 July, the first solo single by a Beatle was released: Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\", credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The completion and mixing of \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" on 20 August was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio. On 8 September, while Starr was in hospital, the other band members met to discuss recording a new album. They considered a different approach to songwriting by ending the Lennon\u2013McCartney pretence and having four compositions apiece from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, with two from Starr and a lead single around Christmas. On 20 September, Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album.\nReleased on 26 September, \"Abbey Road\" sold four\u00a0million copies within three months and topped the UK charts for a total of seventeen weeks. Its second track, the ballad \"Something\", was issued as a single \u2013 the only Harrison composition that appeared as a Beatles A-side. \"Abbey Road\" received mixed reviews, although the medley met with general acclaim. Unterberger considers it \"a fitting swan song for the group\", containing \"some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record\". Musicologist and author Ian MacDonald calls the album \"erratic and often hollow\", despite the \"semblance of unity and coherence\" offered by the medley. Martin singled it out as his favourite Beatles album; Lennon said it was \"competent\" but had \"no life in it\".\nFor the still unfinished \"Get Back\" album, one last song, Harrison's \"I Me Mine\", was recorded on 3 January 1970. Lennon, in Denmark at the time, did not participate. In March, rejecting the work Johns had done on the project, now retitled \"Let It Be\", Klein gave the session tapes to American producer Phil Spector, who had recently produced Lennon's solo single \"Instant Karma!\" In addition to remixing the material, Spector edited, spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as \"live\". McCartney was unhappy with the producer's approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on \"The Long and Winding Road\", which involved a fourteen-voice choir and 36-piece instrumental ensemble. McCartney's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored, and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April, a week before the release of his first self-titled solo album.\nOn 8 May 1970, \"Let It Be\" was released. Its accompanying single, \"The Long and Winding Road\", was expected to be the Beatles' last; it was released in the US, but not in the UK. The \"Let It Be\" documentary film followed later that month and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. \"Sunday Telegraph\" critic Penelope Gilliatt called it \"a very bad film and a touching one\u00a0... about the breaking apart of this reassuring, geometrically perfect, once apparently ageless family of siblings\". Several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks. Describing \"Let It Be\" as the \"only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews\", Unterberger calls it \"on the whole underrated\"; he singles out \"some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I've Got a Feeling' and 'Dig a Pony'\" and praises \"Let It Be\", \"Get Back\" and \"the folky 'Two of Us', with John and Paul harmonising together\".\nMcCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles' contractual partnership on 31 December 1970. Legal disputes continued long after their break-up and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 December 1974, when Lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.\nPost-breakup activities.\n1970s.\nLennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970. Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the other members; Starr's \"Ringo\" (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs. With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971. Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as \"A Toot and a Snore in '74\", Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.\nTwo double-LP sets of the Beatles' greatest hits, compiled by Klein, \"1962\u20131966\" and \"1967\u20131970\", were released in 1973, at first under the Apple Records imprint. Commonly known as the \"Red Album\" and \"Blue Album\", respectively, each has earned a Multi-Platinum certification in the US and a Platinum certification in the UK. Between 1976 and 1982, EMI/Capitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the ex-Beatles, starting with the double-disc compilation \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\". The only one to feature previously unreleased material was \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl\" (1977); the first officially issued concert recordings by the group, it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours.\nThe music and enduring fame of the Beatles were commercially exploited in various other ways, again often outside their creative control. In April 1974, the musical \"John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert\", written by Willy Russell and featuring singer Barbara Dickson, opened in London. It included, with permission from Northern Songs, eleven Lennon\u2013McCartney compositions and one by Harrison, \"Here Comes the Sun\". Displeased with the production's use of his song, Harrison withdrew his permission to use it. Later that year, the off-Broadway musical \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road\" opened. \"All This and World War II\" (1976) was an unorthodox nonfiction film that combined newsreel footage with covers of Beatles songs by performers ranging from Elton John and Keith Moon to the London Symphony Orchestra. The Broadway musical \"Beatlemania\", an unauthorised nostalgia revue, opened in early 1977 and proved popular, spinning off five separate touring productions. In 1979, the band sued the producers, settling for several million dollars in damages. \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1978), a musical film starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, was a commercial failure and an \"artistic fiasco\", according to Ingham.\nAccompanying the wave of Beatles nostalgia and persistent reunion rumours in the US during the 1970s, several entrepreneurs made public offers to the Beatles for a reunion concert. Promoter Bill Sargent first offered the Beatles $10\u00a0million for a reunion concert in 1974. He raised his offer to $30\u00a0million in January 1976 and then to $50\u00a0million the following month. On 24 April 1976, during a broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live\", producer Lorne Michaels jokingly offered the Beatles $3,000 to reunite on the show. Lennon and McCartney were watching the live broadcast at Lennon's apartment at the Dakota in New York, which was within driving distance of the NBC studio where the show was being broadcast. The former bandmates briefly entertained the idea of going to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but decided not to.\n1980s.\nIn December 1980, Lennon was shot and killed outside his New York City apartment by Mark David Chapman, an American Beatles fan. Harrison rewrote the lyrics of his song \"All Those Years Ago\" in Lennon's honour. With Starr on drums and McCartney and his wife, Linda, contributing backing vocals, the song was released as a single in May 1981. McCartney's own tribute, \"Here Today\", appeared on his \"Tug of War\" album in April 1982. In 1984, Starr co-starred in McCartney's film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\", and played with McCartney on several of the songs on the soundtrack. In 1987, Harrison's \"Cloud Nine\" album included \"When We Was Fab\", a song about the Beatlemania era.\nWhen the Beatles' studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987, their catalogue was standardised throughout the world, establishing a canon of the twelve original studio LPs as issued in the UK plus the US LP version of \"Magical Mystery Tour\". All the remaining material from the singles and EPs that had not appeared on these thirteen studio albums was gathered on the two-volume compilation \"Past Masters\" (1988). Except for the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" albums, EMI deleted all its other Beatles compilations \u2013 including the \"Hollywood Bowl\" record \u2013 from its catalogue.\nIn 1988, the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. Harrison and Starr attended the ceremony with Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and his two sons, Julian and Sean. McCartney declined to attend, citing unresolved \"business differences\" that would make him \"feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion\". The following year, EMI/Capitol settled a decade-long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties, clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material.\n1990s.\n\"Live at the BBC\", the first official release of unissued Beatles performances in 17\u00a0years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the \"Anthology\" project. \"Anthology\" was the culmination of work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title \"The Long and Winding Road\".\nDuring 1995\u201396, the project yielded a television miniseries, an eight-volume video set and three two-CD/three-LP box sets featuring artwork by Klaus Voormann. Documenting their history in the band's own words, the \"Anthology\" project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. Alongside producer Jeff Lynne, McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s, resulting in the release of two \"new\" Beatles singles, \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\". A third Lennon demo, \"Now and Then\", was also attempted, but abandoned due to the low quality of the recording. The \"Anthology\" releases were commercially successful and the television series was viewed by an estimated 400\u00a0million people. A book, \"The Beatles Anthology\", followed in October 2000. In 1999, to coincide with the re-release of the 1968 film \"Yellow Submarine\", an expanded soundtrack album, \"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\", was issued.\n2000s.\nThe Beatles' \"1\", a compilation album of the band's British and American number 1 hits, was released on 13 November 2000. It became the fastest-selling album of all time, with 3.6\u00a0million sold in its first week and 13\u00a0million within a month. It topped albums charts in at least 28 countries. The compilation had sold 31\u00a0million copies globally by April 2009.\nHarrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison's death.\nIn 2003, \"Let It Be... Naked\", a reconceived version of the \"Let It Be\" album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main differences from the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top-ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006; \"The Capitol Albums, Volume 1\" and \"Volume 2\" included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music's original American release.\nAs a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue, \"Love\", George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band's recordings to create what Martin called \"a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period\". The show premiered in June 2006 and the \"Love\" album was released that November. In April 2009, Starr performed three songs with McCartney at a benefit concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall and organised by McCartney.\nOn 9 September 2009, the Beatles' entire back catalogue was reissued following an extensive digital remastering process that lasted four\u00a0years. Stereo editions of all twelve original UK studio albums, along with \"Magical Mystery Tour\" and the \"Past Masters\" compilation, were released on compact disc both individually and as a box set. A second collection, \"The Beatles in Mono\", included remastered versions of every Beatles album released in true mono along with the original 1965 stereo mixes of \"Help!\" and \"Rubber Soul\" (both of which Martin had remixed for the 1987 editions). \"\", a music video game in the \"Rock Band\" series, was issued on the same day. In December 2009, the band's catalogue was officially released in FLAC and MP3 format in a limited edition of 30,000 USB flash drives.\n2010s.\nOwing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services. Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name \"Apple\" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI \"want[s] something we're not prepared to give them\". In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, \"Past Masters\" and the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes.\nIn 2012, EMI's recorded music operations were sold to Universal Music Group. In order for Universal Music to acquire EMI, the European Union, for antitrust reasons, forced EMI to spin off assets including Parlophone. Universal was allowed to keep the Beatles' recorded music catalogue, managed by Capitol Records under its Capitol Music Group division. The entire original Beatles album catalogue was also reissued on vinyl in 2012; available either individually or as a box set.\nIn 2013, a second volume of BBC recordings, \"On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2\", was released. That December saw the release of another 59 Beatles recordings on iTunes. The set, titled \"The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963\", had the opportunity to gain a 70-year copyright extension conditional on the songs being published at least once before the end of 2013. Apple Records released the recordings on 17 December to prevent them from going into the public domain and had them taken down from iTunes later that same day. Fan reactions to the release were mixed, with one blogger saying \"the hardcore Beatles collectors who are trying to obtain everything will already have these.\"\nOn 26 January 2014, McCartney and Starr performed together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The following day, \"\" television special was taped in the Los Angeles Convention Center's West Hall. It aired on 9 February, the exact date of\u00a0\u2013 and at the same time and on the same network as\u00a0\u2013 the original broadcast of the Beatles' first US television appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", 50\u00a0years earlier. The special included performances of Beatles songs by current artists as well as by McCartney and Starr, archival footage and interviews with the two surviving ex-Beatles carried out by David Letterman at the Ed Sullivan Theater. In December 2015, the Beatles released their catalogue for streaming on various streaming music services including Spotify and Apple Music.\nIn September 2016, the documentary film \"\" was released. Directed by Ron Howard, it chronicled the Beatles' career during their touring years from 1961 to 1966, from their performances in Liverpool's the Cavern Club in 1961 to their final concert in San Francisco in 1966. The film was released theatrically on 15 September in the UK and the US, and started streaming on Hulu on 17 September. It received several awards and nominations, including for Best Documentary at the 70th British Academy Film Awards and the Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special at the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. An expanded, remixed and remastered version of \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl\" was released on 9 September, to coincide with the release of the film.\nOn 18 May 2017, Sirius XM Radio launched a 24/7 radio channel, The Beatles Channel. A week later, ' was reissued with new stereo mixes and unreleased material for the album's 50th anniversary. Similar box sets were released for ' in November 2018, and \"\" in September 2019. In October 2019, \"Abbey Road\" returned to number 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The Beatles broke their own record for the album with the longest gap between topping the charts as \"Abbey Road\" hit the top spot 50\u00a0years after its original release.\n2020s.\nIn November 2021, \"\", a documentary directed by Peter Jackson using footage captured for the \"Let It Be\" film, was released on Disney+ as a three-part miniseries. A book by the same title was released on 12 October. A of the \"Let It Be\" album was released on 15 October. In January 2022, the album \"Get Back (Rooftop Performance)\", consisting of newly mixed audio of the Beatles' rooftop performance, was released on streaming services.\nIn 2022, McCartney and Starr collaborated on a new recording of \"Let It Be\" with Dolly Parton, Peter Frampton and Mick Fleetwood, which was released on Parton's album \"Rockstar\" in November 2023. In October, a of \"Revolver\" was released, featuring unreleased demos, studio outtakes, the original mono mix and a new stereo remix using AI de-mixing technology developed by Peter Jackson's WingNut Films, which had previously been used to restore audio for the documentary \"Get Back\". New music videos were produced for \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"I'm Only Sleeping\", the latter of which won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.\nIn June 2023, McCartney announced plans to release \"the final Beatles record\" later in the year, using Jackson's de-mixing technology to extract Lennon's voice from an old demo of a song that he had written as a solo artist. In October 2023, the song was revealed to be \"Now and Then\", with a physical and digital release date of 2 November 2023. The official music video for \"Now and Then\" was released the following day, garnering upwards of 8\u00a0million views in its first 12 hours, as the song arrived on Spotify's rankings as one of the most-streamed current songs. \"Now and Then\" debuted simultaneously across music, alternative, news/talk and sports stations. The song's premiere achieved the record for the most radio stations to simulcast a music track. The song became their first UK number 1 single since 1969. It won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, and was also nominated for Record of the Year. The nominations were also historically significant for making \"Now and Then\" the first artificial intelligence-assisted track to be nominated for a Grammy award, and first to win.\nOn 8 May 2024, the 1970 film \"Let It Be\" was released on Disney+, following a digital restoration by Jackson's Park Road Post; it was the first time it was publicly screened since its original theatrical release.\nArtistry.\nDevelopment.\nIn \"Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever\", Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In their initial incarnation as cheerful, wisecracking moptops, the Fab Four revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts. Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&amp;B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.\nIn \"The Beatles as Musicians\", Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed \u2013 as a means to entertain \u2013 a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist\u00a0\u2013 a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, consonant intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\" MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".\nInfluences.\nThe Beatles' earliest influences include Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Gene Vincent. During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs. Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\" Chuck Berry was particularly influential in terms of songwriting and lyrics. Lennon noted, \"He was well advanced of his time lyric-wise. We all owe a lot to him.\" Other early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison, the Everly Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis.\nThe Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including Bob Dylan, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Who, Frank Zappa, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Byrds and the Beach Boys, whose 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" amazed and inspired McCartney. Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\" Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.\nGenres.\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music. Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of \"Beatles for Sale\", \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\", while Gould credits \"Rubber Soul\" as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".\nAlthough the 1965 song \"Yesterday\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes, \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\" They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s \"She's Leaving Home\", for instance, is \"cast in the of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clich\u00e9s of musical melodrama\".\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by Martin Strong as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\". Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"I Am the Walrus\". The influence of Indian classical music was evident in Harrison's \"The Inner Light\", \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\" \u2013 Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the raga form in miniature\".\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: 'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song \u2013 more sophisticated than pop\u00a0... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song \u2013 classical or vernacular \u2013 that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively. Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"The Beatles\u00a0... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained \"in parallel\" their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy. As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"Revolution 9\" (whose musique concr\u00e8te approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's country song \"Don't Pass Me By\", Harrison's rock ballad \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and the \" roar\" of McCartney's \"Helter Skelter\".\nContribution of George Martin.\nGeorge Martin's close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"fifth Beatle\". He applied his classical musical training in various ways and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould. Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description. Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something baroque\" to a particular recording. In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and brass.\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements\". Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality\u00a0... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work\u00a0\u2013 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ...\u00a0I always saw him as an aural Salvador Dal\u00ed, rather than some drug-ridden record artist. On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time\u00a0... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve\u00a0... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, \"Pepper\" would never have been the album it was. Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked, who knows?\nHarrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness\u00a0\u2013 we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.\nIn the studio.\nMaking innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards \u2013 any of these might be incorporated into their music. Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from \"Rubber Soul\" and, especially, \"Revolver\" onwards.\nAlong with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects, unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, double tracking and vari-speed recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the swarmandal in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro, and the clavioline, an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\".\nLegacy.\nFormer \"Rolling Stone\" magazine associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original\u00a0... [I]n the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive\u00a0...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\" and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\".\nIn 1964, the Beatles' arrival in the US is credited with initiating the album era; the music historian Joel Whitburn says that LP sales soon \"exploded and eventually outpaced the sales and releases of singles\" in the music industry. They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, and later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people whom they most associated with UK culture.\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough\u00a0... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\nOther commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their sociocultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness.&lt;ref name=\"Leopold (Beatlemania/CNN)\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to their appearance on \"the Ed Sullivan Show\" Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution\u00a0... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\" According to Gilmore:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEstablished in 2009, Global Beatles Day is an annual holiday on 25 June each year that honours and celebrates the ideals of the Beatles. The date was chosen to commemorate the date the group participated in the BBC programme \"Our World\" in 1967, performing \"All You Need Is Love\" broadcast to an international audience.\nAwards and achievements.\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film \"Let It Be\" (1970). The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\nThe best-selling music act in history, the Beatles have sold more than 600\u00a0million units as of 2012[ [update]]. From 1991 to 2009 the Beatles sold 57\u00a0million albums in United States, according to Nielsen Soundscan. They have had more number 1 albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9\u00a0million, than any other act. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50\u00a0years. They ranked number 1 on \"Billboard\" magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. As of 2017[ [update]], they hold the record for most number 1 hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 183\u00a0million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation of the . In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004 and 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" named them the greatest artist of all time.\nIn 2007, the Beatles became the first band to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. Earlier in 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp dedicated to the Beatles and \"Yellow Submarine\".\nBand members.\nPrincipal members\nEarly members\nTemporary members\nDiscography.\nThe Beatles' core catalogue consists of the original 12 UK studio albums, Magical Mystery Tour (which was brought into the core catalog in the 80s), and one compilation album which collects all the UK non-album singles and EP tracks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSong catalogue.\nUntil 1969, the Beatles' catalogue was published almost exclusively by Northern Songs, formed in February 1963 by music publisher Dick James specifically for Lennon and McCartney, though it later acquired songs by other artists. The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion\u00a0\u2013 19 or 20%\u00a0\u2013 and Brian Epstein's\u00a0\u2013 9 or 10%\u00a0\u2013 which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee. In 1965, the company went public. 5\u00a0million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75\u00a0million. James and Silver each received 937,500\u00a0shares (18.75% of 5\u00a0million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000\u00a0shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000\u00a0shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25\u00a0million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000. At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.\nHarrison created Harrisongs to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work until March 1968, which included \"Taxman\" and \"Within You Without You\". The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"What Goes On\" and \"Flying\", were also Northern Songs copyrights. Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with Apple Publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owned the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created Startling Music, which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\".\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television (ATV), founded by impresario Lew Grade, without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding. The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City\". By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973. In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, Associated Communications Corporation (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30\u00a0million. According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for \u00a320\u00a0million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a \u00a35\u00a0million bid that was rejected. According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of \u00a321\u201325\u00a0million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a takeover by Australian business magnate Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court for \u00a360\u00a0million.\nIn 1985, Michael Jackson purchased ATV for a reported $47.5\u00a0million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights. In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110\u00a0million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony, creating a new company, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world. In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750\u00a0million.\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%. Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs\u00a0\u2013 \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\"\u00a0\u2013 were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore &amp; Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in 1978, and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications. On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in the United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon\u2013McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56\u00a0years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.\nSelected filmography.\nFictionalised\nDocumentaries and filmed performances\nConcert tours.\nHeadlining\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCo-headlining\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tort law can be contrasted with criminal law, which deals with criminal wrongs that are punishable by the state. While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to compensate individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others. Some wrongful acts, such as assault and battery, can result in both a civil lawsuit and a criminal prosecution in countries where the civil and criminal legal systems are separate. Tort law may also be contrasted with contract law, which provides civil remedies after breach of a duty that arises from a contract. Obligations in both tort and criminal law are more fundamental and are imposed regardless of whether the parties have a contract.\nWhile tort law in civil law jurisdictions largely derives from Roman law, common law jurisdictions derive their tort law from customary English tort law. In civil law jurisdictions based on civil codes, both contractual and tortious or delictual liability is typically outlined in a civil code based on Roman Law principles. Tort law is referred to as the law of delict in Scots and Roman Dutch law, and resembles tort law in common law jurisdictions in that rules regarding civil liability are established primarily by precedent and theory rather than an exhaustive code. However, like other civil law jurisdictions, the underlying principles are drawn from Roman law. A handful of jurisdictions have codified a mixture of common and civil law jurisprudence either due to their colonial past (e.g. Qu\u00e9bec, St Lucia, Mauritius) or due to influence from multiple legal traditions when their civil codes were drafted (e.g. Mainland China, the Philippines, and Thailand). Furthermore, Israel essentially codifies common law provisions on tort.\nOverview.\nIn common, civil, and mixed law jurisdictions alike, the main remedy available to plaintiffs under tort law is compensation in damages, or money. Further, in the case of a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction, such as in the English case of \"Miller v Jackson\". Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some jurisdictions, such as those in Australia, can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out certain legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters. At the same time, each legal system provides for a variety of defences for defendants in tort claims which, partially or fully, shield defendants from liability. In a limited range of cases varying between jurisdictions, tort law will tolerate self-help as an appropriate remedy for certain torts. One example of this is the toleration of the use of reasonable force to expel a trespasser, which is typically also a defence against the tort of battery.\nIn some, but not all, civil and mixed law jurisdictions, the term delict is used to refer to this category of civil wrong, though it can also refer to criminal offences. Other jurisdictions may use terms such as extracontractual responsibility (France) or civil responsibility (Qu\u00e9bec). In comparative law, the term tort is generally used. The word 'tort' was first used in a legal context in the 1580s, although different words were used for similar concepts prior to this time. A person who commits a tortious act is called a tortfeasor. Although crimes may be torts, the cause of legal action in civil torts is not necessarily the result of criminal action. A victim of harm, commonly called the injured party or plaintiff, can recover their losses as damages in a lawsuit. To prevail, the plaintiff in the lawsuit must generally show that the tortfeasor's actions or lack of action was the proximate cause of the harm, though the specific requirements vary between jurisdictions.\nCommon law.\nHistory.\nTorts and crimes in common law originate in the Germanic system of compensatory fines for wrongs, with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs. In Anglo-Saxon law, most wrongs required payment in money paid to the wronged person or their clan. Fines in the form of \"w\u012bte\" (lit.\u2009'blame' or 'fault') were paid to the king or holder of a court for disturbances of public order, while the fine of \"weregild\" was imposed on those who committed murder with the intention of preventing blood feuds. Some wrongs in later law codes were \"botleas\" 'without remedy' (e.g. theft, open murder, arson, treason against one's lord), that is, unable to be compensated, and those convicted of a \"botleas\" crime were at the king's mercy. Items or creatures which caused death were also destroyed as deodands. Alfred the Great's Doom Book distinguished unintentional injuries from intentional ones, and defined culpability based on status, age, and gender. After the Norman Conquest, fines were paid only to courts or the king, and quickly became a revenue source. A wrong became known as a \"tort\" or \"trespass\", and there arose a division between civil pleas and pleas of the crown. The petty assizes (i.e. of novel disseisin, of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The trespass action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. It arose in local courts for slander, breach of contract, or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts so that in the 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made \"de cursu\" (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the \"appeal of felony\", or assize of novel disseisin, or replevin. Later, after the Statute of Westminster 1285, in the 1360s, the \"trespass on the case\" action arose for when the defendant did not direct force. As its scope increased, it became simply \"action on the case\". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case.\nIn 1401, the English case \"Beaulieu v Finglam\" imposed strict liability for the escape of fire; additionally, strict liability was imposed for the release of cattle. Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also emphasised in the medieval period. Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records. In general, scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against champerty and maintenance and vexatious litigation existed. The right of victims to receive redress was regarded by later English scholars as one of the rights of Englishmen. Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", which was published in the late 18th century, contained a volume on \"private wrongs\" as torts and even used the word \"tort\" in a few places.\nIn contemporary common law jurisdictions, successful claimants in both tort and contract law must show that they have suffered foreseeable loss or harm as a direct result of the breach of duty. Legal injuries addressable under tort law in common law jurisdictions are not limited to physical injuries and may include emotional, economic, or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy, property, or constitutional rights. Torts comprise such varied topics as automobile accidents, false imprisonment, defamation, product liability, copyright infringement, and environmental pollution (toxic torts). Modern torts are heavily affected by insurance and insurance law, as many cases are settled through claims adjustment rather than by trial, and are defended by insurance lawyers, with the insurance policy setting a ceiling on the possible payment.\nLiability.\nWhile individuals and corporations are typically only liable for their own actions, indirect liability for the tortious acts of others may arise by operation of law, notably through joint and several liability doctrines as well as forms of secondary liability. Liability may arise through enterprise liability or, in product liability cases in the United States, market share liability. In certain cases, a person might hold vicarious liability for their employee or child under the law of agency through the doctrine of respondeat superior. For example, if a shop employee spilled cleaning liquid on the supermarket floor and a victim fell and suffered injuries, the plaintiff might be able to sue either the employee or the employer. There is considerable academic debate about whether vicarious liability is justified on no better basis than the search for a solvent defendant, or whether it is well founded on the theory of efficient risk allocation.\nAbsolute liability, under the rule in M. C. Mehta v. Union of India, in Indian tort law is a unique outgrowth of the doctrine of strict liability for ultrahazardous activities. Under the precedent established in the English case of Rylands v Fletcher, upon which the Indian doctrine of absolute liability is based, anyone who in the course of \"non-natural\" use of his land \"accumulates\" thereon for his own purposes anything likely to cause mischief if it escapes is answerable for all direct damage thereby caused. While, in England and many other common law jurisdictions, this precedent is used to impose strict liability on certain areas of nuisance law and is strictly \"a remedy for damage to land or interests in land\" under which \"damages for personal injuries are not recoverable\", Indian courts have developed this rule into a distinct principle of absolute liability, where an enterprise is absolutely liable, without exceptions, to compensate everyone affected by any accident resulting from the operation of hazardous activity. This differs greatly from the English approach as it includes all kinds of resulting liability, rather than being limited to damage to land.\nIn New Zealand, the tort system for the majority of personal injuries was scrapped with the establishment of the Accident Compensation Corporation, a universal system of no-fault insurance. The rationale underlying New Zealand's elimination of personal injury torts was securing equality of treatment for victims regardless of whether or the extent to which they or any other party was at fault. This was the basis for much of Professor Patrick Atiyah's scholarship as articulated in \"Accidents, Compensation and the Law\" (1970). Originally his proposal was the gradual abolition of tort actions, and its replacement with schemes like those for industrial injuries to cover for all illness, disability and disease, whether caused by people or nature. In addition to the development of the Accident Compensation Corporation to eliminate personal injury lawsuits, the tort system for medical malpractice was scrapped in New Zealand, both following recommendations from the Royal Commission in 1967 for 'no fault' compensation scheme (see The Woodhouse Report).\nIn the case of the United States, a survey of trial lawyers identified several modern innovations that developed after the divergence of English and American tort law, including strict liability for products based on \"Greenman v. Yuba Power Products\", the limitation of various immunities (e.g. sovereign immunity, charitable immunity), comparative negligence, broader rules for admitting evidence, increased damages for emotional distress, and toxic torts and class action lawsuits. However, there has also been a reaction in terms of tort reform, which in some cases have been struck down as violating state constitutions, and federal preemption of state laws.\nCategories of torts in common law jurisdictions.\nTorts may be categorised in several ways, with a particularly common division between negligent and intentional torts. Quasi-torts are unusual tort actions. Particularly in the United States, \"collateral tort\" is used to refer to torts in labour law such as intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"outrage\"); or wrongful dismissal; these evolving causes of action are debated and overlap with contract law or other legal areas to some degree. In some cases, the development of tort law has spurred lawmakers to create alternative solutions to disputes. For example, in some areas, workers' compensation laws arose as a legislative response to court rulings restricting the extent to which employees could sue their employers in respect of injuries sustained during employment. In other cases, legal commentary has led to the development of new causes of action outside the traditional common law torts. These are loosely grouped into quasi-torts or liability torts.\nNegligence.\nThe tort of negligence is a cause of action leading to relief designed to protect legal rights from actions which, although unintentional, nevertheless cause some form of legal harm to the plaintiff. In order to win an action for negligence, a plaintiff must prove: duty, breach of duty, causation, scope of liability, and damages. Further, a defendant may assert various defences to a plaintiff's case, including comparative fault and assumption of risk. Negligence is a tort which arises from the breach of the duty of care owed by one person to another from the perspective of a reasonable person. Although credited as appearing in the United States in \"Brown v. Kendall\", the later Scottish case of \"Donoghue v Stevenson\" [1932] AC 562, followed in England, brought England into line with the United States and established the 'tort of negligence' as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions. In \"Donoghue\", Mrs. Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill. She could not sue Mr. Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence. The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence.\nIn most common law jurisdictions, there are four elements to a negligence action:\nSome jurisdictions narrow the definition down to three elements: duty, breach and proximately caused harm. Some jurisdictions recognize five elements, duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages. However, at their heart, the various definitions of what constitutes negligent conduct are very similar. Depending on jurisdiction, product liability cases such as those involving warranties may be considered negligence actions or fall under a separate category of strict liability torts. Similarly, cases involving environmental or consumer health torts which other countries treat as negligence or strict liability torts are treated in India as absolute liability torts.\nIn establishing whether a duty of care exists, different common law jurisdictions have developed a variety of distinct but related approaches, with many jurisdictions building on the test established in \"Anns v Merton LBC\". In Singapore, the current leading case is \"Spandeck Engineering v Defence Science and Technology Agency\", which builds on \"Anns\" by establishing a two step test comprising an analysis of proximate cause and public policy as a universal test, independent from the individual circumstances of a given case, for determining the existence of a duty of care. The Supreme Court of Canada established a similar test in the context of assessing damages for pure economic loss owing to negligence derived from \"Anns\" which consists of a two step examination of the existence of a sufficiently proximate relationship between the parties and public policy considerations; however, the Canadian test is more sensitive to the individual circumstances of a given case and the first step is generally deemed to be met where a case falls into one of three sets of circumstances recognised by precedent while the Singaporean test is independent of precedent. In English tort law, \"Caparo Industries plc v Dickman\" established a tripartite test for the existence of a duty of care per which harm must be reasonably foreseeable as a potential result of the defendant's conduct; the parties must be in a relationship of proximity; and it must be fair, just, and reasonable to impose such a duty.\nIntentional torts.\nIntentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories:\nAn intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement. Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm.\nNuisance.\n\"Nuisance\" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was \"for the benefit of the commonwealth\", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet. The case \"Jones v Powell\" (1629) provides an early example, in which a person's professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery. Although the outcome of this case is unclear, Whitelocke of the Court of the King's Bench is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated, the nuisance was not actionable as it is \"better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor\".\nIn English law, a related category of tort liability was created in the case of \"Rylands v Fletcher\" (1868): strict liability was established for a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals as long as the cause was not remote. In \"Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc\" (1994), chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs. The \"Rylands\" rule remains in use in England and Wales. In Australian law, it has been merged into negligence.\nEconomic torts.\nEconomic torts typically involve commercial transactions, and include tortious interference with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no privity of contract; these torts are likely to involve pure economic loss which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the \"foreseeability\" doctrine. The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied and began in 1965 from a California case involving strict liability for product defects; in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the doctrine in \"East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Deleval, Inc\". In 2010, the supreme court of the U.S. state of Washington replaced the economic loss doctrine with an \"independent duty doctrine\".\nEconomic antitrust torts have been somewhat submerged by modern competition law. However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law tortious interference, which may be based upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7766.\nNegligent misrepresentation as tort where no contractual privity exists was disallowed in England by \"Derry v Peek\" [1889]; however, this position was overturned in \"Hedley Byrne v Heller\" in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a \"special relationship\" existed between the plaintiff and defendant. United States courts and scholars \"paid lip-service\" to \"Derry\"; however, scholars such as William Prosser argued that it was misinterpreted by English courts. The case of \"Ultramares Corporation v. Touche\" (1932) limited the liability of an auditor to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s. The Restatement (Second) of Torts expanded liability to \"foreseeable\" users rather than specifically identified \"foreseen\" users of the information, dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as accountants, architects, attorneys, and surveyors. As of 1989, most U.S. jurisdictions follow either the \"Ultramares\" approach or the Restatement approach.\nThe tort of deceit for inducement into a contract is a tort in English law, but in practice has been replaced by actions under Misrepresentation Act 1967. In the United States, similar torts existed but have become superseded to some degree by contract law and the pure economic loss rule. Historically (and to some degree today), fraudulent (but not negligent) misrepresentation involving damages for economic loss may be awarded under the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" rule (damages identical to expectation damages in contracts) which awards the plaintiff the difference between the value represented and the actual value. Beginning with \"Stiles v. White\" (1846) in Massachusetts, this rule spread across the country as a majority rule with the \"out-of-pocket damages\" rule as a minority rule. Although the damages under the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" are described as compensatory, the plaintiff is left better off than before the transaction. Since the economic loss rule would eliminate these benefits if applied strictly, there is an exception to allow the misrepresentation tort if not related to a contract.\nRemedies and defences in common law jurisdictions.\nThe remedies and defences available in common law jurisdictions are typically similar, deriving from judicial precedent with occasional legislative intervention. Compensation by way of damages is typically the default remedy available to plaintiffs, with injunctions and specific performance being relatively rare in tort law cases. Relatively uniquely for a common law jurisdiction, Singapore's Community Disputes Resolution Act 2015 (CDRA) alters the common law by codifying a statutory tort of \"interference with enjoyment or use of place of residence\" and provides for a variety of remedies beyond damages, ranging from injunctions and specific performance to court-ordered apologies. Where a court order providing for a remedy other than damages is awarded under the CDRA is violated, sections 5-8 of the act require that the plaintiff apply for a 'special direction' to be issued in order to enforce the original remedy and section 9 provides that failure to comply with a special direction is grounds for the court to issue an order excluding the tortfeasor from their residence. Aside from legislatively created remedies such as the CDRA, courts in common law jurisdictions will typically provide for damages (which, depending on jurisdiction, may include punitive damages), but judges will issue injunctions and specific performance where they deem damages not to be a sufficient remedy. Legislatures in various common law jurisdictions have curtailed the ability of judges to award punitive or other non-economic damages through the use of non-economic damages caps and other tort reform measures.\nApart from proof that there was no breach of duty (in other words, that a tortious act was not committed in the first place), there are three principal defences to tortious liability in common law jurisdictions:\nDiscovery in tort litigation.\nDiscovery (or disclosure), a concept unique to common law jurisdictions, is a pre-trial procedure in a lawsuit in which each party, through the law of civil procedure, can open-endedly demand evidence from the other party or parties by means of discovery devices such as interrogatories, requests for production of documents, requests for admissions and depositions. Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using subpoenas. When a discovery request is objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a motion to compel discovery. In tort litigation, the availability of discovery enables plaintiffs to essentially carry out a private investigation, subpoenaing records and documents from the defendant. Consequently, commentators in civil law jurisdictions regard discovery destructive of the rule of law and as \"a private inquisition.\" Civil law countries see the underlying objectives of discovery as properly monopolised by the state in order to maintain the rule of law: the investigative objective of discovery is the prerogative of the executive branch, and insofar as discovery may be able to facilitate the creation of new rights, that is the prerogative of the legislative branch. The availability of discovery in common law jurisdictions means that plaintiffs who, in other jurisdictions, would not have sufficient evidence upon which to file a tort claim are able to do so in the hope that they will be able to obtain sufficient evidence through discovery. The primary drawbacks of this are that, on one hand, it creates the possibility that a plaintiff filing suit in good faith may not find enough evidence to succeed and incur legal expenses driven upward due to the cost of discovery; and, on the other hand, that it enables plaintiffs arguing in bad faith to initiate frivolous tort lawsuits and coerce defendants into agreeing to legal settlements in otherwise unmeritorious actions.\nVariation between common law jurisdictions.\nAmong common law countries today, there are significant differences in tort law. Common law systems include United States tort law, Australian tort law, Canadian tort law, Indian tort law, and the tort law of a variety of jurisdictions in Asia and Africa. There is a more apparent split in tort law between the Commonwealth countries and the United States. Despite diverging from English common law in 1776, earlier than the other common law jurisdictions, United States tort law was influenced by English law and Blackstone's \"Commentaries\", with several state constitutions specifically providing for redress for torts in addition to reception statutes which adopted English law. However, tort law globally was viewed as relatively undeveloped by the mid-19th century; the first American treatise on torts was published in the 1860s but the subject became particularly established when Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr wrote on the subject in the 1880s. Holmes' writings have been described as the \"first serious attempt in the common law world to give torts both a coherent structure and a distinctive substantive domain\", although Holmes' summary of the history of torts has been critically reviewed. The 1928 US case of Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co. heavily influenced the British judges in the 1932 House of Lords case of Donoghue v Stevenson. The United States has since been perceived as particularly prone to filing tort lawsuits even relative to other common law countries, although this perception has been criticised and debated. 20th century academics have identified that class actions were relatively uncommon outside of the United States, noting that the English law was less generous to the plaintiff in the following ways: contingent fee arrangements were restricted, English judges tried more decisions and set damages rather than juries, wrongful death lawsuits were relatively restricted, punitive damages were relatively unavailable, the collateral source rule was restricted, and strict liability, such as for product liability, was relatively unavailable. The English welfare state, which provides free healthcare to victims of injury, may explain the lower tendency towards personal injury lawsuits in England. A similar observation has also been made with regard to Australia.\nWhile Indian tort law is generally derived from English law, there are certain differences between the two systems. Indian tort law uniquely includes remedies for constitutional torts, which are actions by the government that infringe upon rights enshrined in the Constitution, as well as a system of absolute liability for businesses engaged in hazardous activity as outlined in the rule in M. C. Mehta v. Union of India. Similar to other common law jurisdictions, conduct which gives rise to a cause of action under tort law is additionally criminalised by the Indian Penal Code, which was originally enacted in 1860. As a result of the influence of its relatively early codification of criminal law, the torts of assault, battery, and false imprisonment are interpreted by Indian courts and the courts of jurisdictions that were formerly part of the British Indian Empire (e.g. Pakistan, Bangladesh) and British colonies in South East Asia which adopted the Indian Penal Code (i.e. Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei) with reference to analogous crimes outlined in the code. For instance, assault is interpreted in the context of s.351 per which the following criteria constitute assault:\nSimilarly, battery is interpreted in the context of criminal force as outlined in s.350.\nAn area of tort unique to India is the constitutional tort, a public law remedy for violations of rights, generally by agents of the state, and is implicitly premised on the strict liability principle. In practice, constitutional torts in India serve the role served by administrative courts in many civil law jurisdictions and much of the function of constitutional review in other jurisdictions, thereby functioning as a branch of administrative law rather than private law. Rather than developing principles of administrative fairness as a distinct branch of law as other common law jurisdictions have, Indian courts have thus extended tort law as it applies between private parties to address unlawful administrative and legislative action.\nWithin Canada's common law provinces, there is currently no consistent approach to the tort of invasion of privacy. Four provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Saskatchewan) have created a statutory tort. Ontario has recognised the existence of the tort of \"intrusion upon seclusion\", which has also been held to exist under tort law in the United States. British Columbia, on the other hand, has held that the tort does not exist in that province under the common law. Like the United Kingdom and British Columbia, but unlike Ontario and most jurisdictions in the United States, Indian tort law does not traditionally recognise a common law tort of invasion of privacy or intrusion on seclusion. Nevertheless, there is a shift in jurisprudence toward recognising breech of confidentiality as an actionable civil wrong. Proponents of protection for privacy under Indian tort law argue that \"the right to privacy is implicit\" in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees protections for personal liberties. Despite the lack of a tort addressing violations of privacy by private individuals, the Supreme Court recognised privacy as a constitutional right in 2017. Similarly, neither intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) nor negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) is recognised as a tort in Indian jurisprudence. While claims seeking damages for infliction of emotional distress were historically an accessory claim in a tort action alleging another distinct tort, the doctrine has evolved in North America into a stand-alone tort while English jurisprudence has evolved to typically recognise only recognised psychiatric injuries as grounds for compensation. Indian courts, while recognising the infliction of emotional distress regardless of intention as an actionable wrong in matrimonial disputes, typically follow the English approach, although case law from both the United Kingdom and North America is frequently employed by judges ruling on cases in which damages for mental distress are sought.\nScots and Roman-Dutch law.\nBoth Scots and Roman-Dutch law are uncodified, scholarship-driven, and judge-made legal systems based on Roman law as historically applied in the Netherlands and Scotland during the Enlightenment. In both legal systems, when applied in English speaking countries, the term delict is used to refer to tortious liability (unlike, for instance, in Spain where the cognate of the term delict refers to a criminal offence). Unlike in systems based on civil codes or on the English common law, Scots and Roman-Dutch law operate on broad principles of liability for wrongdoing; there is no exhaustive list of named delicts in either system; if the conduct complained of appears to be wrongful, the law will afford a remedy even in the absence of precedent pertaining to similar conduct. In South Africa and neighbouring countries, the Roman-Dutch law of delict is in force, having been preserved after the United Kingdom annexed Dutch settlements in South Africa and spread as neighbouring British colonies adopted South African law via reception statutes. Roman-Dutch law also forms the basis for the legal system of Sri Lanka.\nElements of delict.\nThe elements of a delict as follows:\nThe elements of harm and conduct are fact-based inquiries, while causation is part-factual and part-normative, and wrongfulness and fault are entirely normative: that is, value-based, in that they articulate a wider societal policy perspective. Delict is \"inherently a flexible set of principles that embody social policy.\"\nRemedies.\nUnder the Scots and Roman-Dutch law of delict, there are two main remedies available to plaintiffs:\nProtected interests which can give rise to delictual liability can be broadly divided into two categories: patrimonial and non-patrimonial interests. Patrimonial interests are those which pertain to damages to an individual's body or property, which both Scots and Roman-Dutch law approach in the context of the Roman Lex Aquilia. Non-patrimonial interests include dignitary and personality related interests (e.g. defamation, disfigurement, unjust imprisonment) which cannot be exhaustively listed which are addressed in the context of the Roman Actio iniuriarum, as well as pain and suffering which are addressed under jurisprudence that has developed in modern times. In general; where an individual violates a patrimonial interest, they will incur Aquilian liability; and, where an individual violates a non-patrimonial interest, they will incur liability stemming from the actio iniuriarum. While broadly similar due to their common origin, the nature of the remedies available under contemporary Scots and Roman-Dutch law vary slightly, although the aquilian action and actio iniuriarum are the primary remedies available under both systems. The primary difference between the two remedies is that the aquilian action serves a compensatory function (i.e. providing economic damages to restore the plaintiff to their previous state) while the actio iniuriarum provides for non-economic damages aimed at providing solace to the plaintiff. In Roman-Dutch law (but not in Scots law), there is also a distinct action for pain and suffering relating to pain and suffering and psychiatric injury, which provides for non-economic damages similar to those under the actio iniuriarum. The various delictual actions are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for a person to suffer various forms of harm at the same time, which means that a person may simultaneously claim remedies under more than one action.\nThe elements of liability under the \"actio iniuriarum\" are as follows:\nThere are five essential elements for liability in terms of the \"actio legis Aquiliae\":\nIn Scots law, the aquilian action has developed more expansively and may be invoked as a remedy for both patrimonial and certain types of non-patrimonial loss, particularly with regard to personal injury. By way of a legal fiction, 'personal injury' is treated as (physical) 'damage done', with the net effect that 'the \"actio injuriarum\" root of Scots law infuses the [nominate] delict assault as much as any development of the \"lex Aquilia\"' and wrongdoing that results in physical harm to a person may give rise to both an aquilian action and an actio iniuriarum. Additionally, the modern Scots law pertaining to reparation for negligent wrongdoing is based on the \"lex Aquilia\" and so affords reparation in instances of \"damnum injuria datum\" - literally loss wrongfully caused - with the wrongdoing in such instances generated by the defender's \"culpa\" (i.e., fault). In any instance in which a pursuer (A) has suffered loss at the hands of the wrongful conduct of the defender (B), B is under a legal obligation to make reparation. If B's wrongdoing were intentional in the circumstances, or so reckless that an 'intention' may be constructively inferred (on the basis that \"culpa lata dolo aequiparatur\" - 'gross fault is the same as intentional wrongdoing'), then it follows axiomatically that B will be liable to repair any damage done to A's property, person or economic interest: 'wherever a defender intentionally harms the pursuer - provided the interest harmed is regarded as reparable - the defender incurs delictual liability'. If the pursuer has suffered loss as the result of the defender's conduct, yet the defender did not intend to harm the pursuer, nor behave so recklessly that intent might be constructively inferred, the pursuer must demonstrate that the defender's conduct was negligent in order to win their case. Negligence can be established, by the pursuer, by demonstrating that the defender owed to them a 'duty of care' which they ultimately breached by failing to live up to the expected standard of care. If this can be shown, then the pursuer must also establish that the defender's failure to live up to the expected standard of care ultimately caused the loss (damnum) complained of.\nDefences.\nThere is a distinction between defences aimed at the wrongfulness element and defences which serve to exclude fault. Grounds of justification may be described as circumstances which occur typically or regularly in practice, and which indicate conclusively that interference with a person's legally protected interests is reasonable and therefore lawful. They are practical examples of circumstances justifying a \"prima facie\" infringement of a recognised right or interest, according to the fundamental criterion of reasonableness. They are another expression of the legal convictions of the society.\nConsent to injury, or \"Volenti non fit injuria\", is a full defence; if successful, there is no delict. As a general defence, it can take two forms:\nThere are five requirements for the defence of consent:\nNecessity is conduct directed at an innocent person as a result of duress or compulsion, or a threat by a third party or an outside force. Private defence (or self-defence) is conduct directed at the person responsible for the duress or compulsion or threat. There is, therefore, an important distinction between the two. In cases of necessity and private defence, the question is this: Under which circumstances would the legal convictions of the community consider it reasonable to inflict harm to prevent it? The test is objective. It requires a balancing of the parties' and of society's interests. The role of the person against whom the defensive conduct is directed is an important factor in determining whether defence or necessity is being pled. An act of necessity is calculated to avert harm by inflicting it on an innocent person, whereas an act of defence is always directed at a wrongdoer. A person acts in \"private defence\", and therefore lawfully, when he uses force to ward off an unlawful attack against his or someone else's property or person. A person acts in \"self-defence\" when he defends his own body against unlawful attack by someone else. One therefore cannot invoke the justification of self-defence when acting in the interests of another person, but it is possible to invoke the justification of private defence when acting in one's own interests. Conduct will be justified as an act in private defence or self-defence if it is\nThe violence used in defence must not exceed what is reasonably necessary to avert the threatened danger:\nAn act of necessity may be described as lawful conduct directed against an innocent person for the purpose of protecting an interest of the actor or of a third party (including the innocent person) against a dangerous situation, which may have arisen owing to the wrongful conduct of another or the behaviour of an animal, or through natural forces. Two types of emergency situations may be found:\nOther jurisdictions.\nChina.\nHistory.\nCivil and criminal law were not clearly delineated in Ancient Chinese law as they are in modern legal systems. Therefore, while Tort Law was not a distinct area of law, concepts familiar to tort law were present in the criminal laws. However, by the late feudalism period, personal injury and property damage torts were mostly focused on compensation.\nThe earliest \"tort case\" known from Ancient China is from the Zhou dynasty. During a famine one person robbed another's barn by sending his slave to steal the grain. He was sued and the court ordered double the original grain restored to the victim to compensate the damages. The Qin Code made some changes to tort liabilities introducing the concept of subjective fault (fault liability). In a case where one person borrows farm equipment, compensation would be required for damage to the equipment if the damage is caused by the condition of the equipment when it was borrowed. In addition to fault liability, some defences were developed. A person would not be liable if public property were damaged by fire or other natural forces outside the person's control. There was no liability for killing livestock, if the livestock was about to hurt someone.\nIn contemporary China, however, there are four distinct legal systems in force, none of which are derived from classical Chinese law: Portuguese civil law in Macau, common law in Hong Kong, a German-style civil law system adopted by the Republic of China following Japan's model, and a primarily civil law system in the mainland.\nRepublic of China.\nIn areas administered by the Republic of China, the legislative basis of tort law is the Civil Code of the Republic of China whose legal system was modelled after the Japanese Six Codes system, which itself was primarily based on the German pandectist approach to law. In general, article 184 provides that a person who \"intentionally or negligently\" damages another person's rights is required to compensate them for any resulting injury, and provides for strict liability where such harm is caused by the violation of a statutory provision aimed at protecting members of the community from harm. Additionally, tort liability exists for the owner of a defective building or structure where such building or structure causes damage, for the driver of an automobile that causes injury, and for individual's responsible for business activities that posed a risk of harm to the plaintiff. Tort liability in the Republic of China also extends to the violation of certain non-pecuniary interests under article 195 which provides for reasonable compensation in the case of damage to the body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy, or chastity of another, or to another's personality in a severe way.\nMainland China.\nIn 2021, the mainland adopted the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China (CCPRC), Book Seven of which is titled \"Tort Liability\" and codifies a variety of torts, providing that an individual \"who through his fault infringes upon another person's civil-law rights and interests shall bear tort liability\". Book Seven outlines seven distinct categories of torts:\nWhile Book Seven (titled \"Tort Liability\") of the CCPRC, which is influenced by a variety of common law and civil law jurisdictions, codifies the torts which exist under the law of Mainland China, Book One of the CCPRC provides a comprehensive list of remedies for torts in Article 179:\n\u3000\u3000(1) cessation of the infringement;\n\u3000\u3000(2) removal of the nuisance;\n\u3000\u3000(3) elimination of the danger;\n\u3000\u3000(4) restitution;\n\u3000\u3000(5) restoration;\n\u3000\u3000(6) repair, redoing or replacement;\n\u3000\u3000(7) continuance of performance;\n\u3000\u3000(8) compensation for losses;\n\u3000\u3000(9) payment of liquidated damages;\n\u3000\u3000(10) elimination of adverse effects and rehabilitation of reputation; and\n\u3000\u3000(11) extension of apologies.\nThese remedies apply to all categories of torts outlined in Book Seven or by any other provision of law. To this end, Book Seven specifically provides that \"where a tortious act endangers another person's personal or property safety, the infringed person has the right to request the tortfeasor to bear tort liability such as cessation of the infringement, removal of the nuisance, or elimination of the danger\". Book One additionally provides that force majeure constitutes a valid defence for tort liability while Article 184 in that book is a Good Samaritan law eliminating liability under tort law for individuals acting to save or rescue a potential plaintiff. Article 1176 in Book Seven provides a partial defence where an injury is caused in the course of a sport in which the plaintiff was consensually participating.\nFrance.\nTort liability in France (\"responsabilit\u00e9 extracontractuelle\") is a distinct system which has developed over the course of history stemming from the Napoleonic Code which, together with the German B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, forms the basis for private law in the majority of civil law countries with civil codes. French tort law is based on the principle that all injuries and other wrongs give rise to a remedy, typically in the form of damages, regardless of any other moral or equitable considerations; nevertheless, there are limits on the types of injuries which give rise to a remedy as well as the extent to which damages may be claimed. French jurisprudence has established that, in order to attract a remedy, an injury should generally be certain and direct (prohibiting speculative damages or compensation for pure economic loss) and affect a legitimate interest; however, judges do not recognise a hard and fast rule, meaning that great weight is given to the specific circumstances in each case with precedent serving to guide rather than control jurisprudence. The main principle in French tort law is that of fault, the principle that the individual who causes damage ought generally to be liable for it; however, following the Industrial Revolution, vicarious liability and strict liability have developed through both precedent and legislative action in response to the need to address damage caused by products, machines, and the actions of agents or employees.\nFrench tort law is primarily governed by articles : missing or invalid base value ('CC'), or missing number to : missing or invalid base value ('CC'), or missing number of the civil code, which establish a number of distinct regimes for tort liability. Liability for one's own actions is governed by articles 1240 and 1241, while other provisions of the code provide for vicarious and other \"sui generis\" forms of liability. In addition, liability in specific cases (e.g. product liability and defamation) have been provided for in separate statutes outside the code and in European Union directives.\nGermany.\nOutline.\nGerman tort law is codified in Book 2 of the B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), which provides for damages in circumstances in which there is no contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. German tort law protects plaintiffs against violations of:\nThere are three distinct categories of liability recognised under the BGB: liability for \"culpable injustice\", \"injustice in rebuttable presumed liability\", and strict liability arising from \"endangerment\". Liability for culpable injustice, the default position in German tort law, is where an individual directly violates another person's legal interest or absolute right either intentionally or negligently. Rebuttable presumed liability is the principle that an individual is vicariously liable where a legal interest or absolute right is violated by another person (e.g. an agent, child/other person in their custody), where such a violation is committed by an animal, or where such a violation takes place on the first individual's property. Strict liability for endangerment exists with regard to violations of protective laws (e.g. product liability, environmental laws, motor vehicle regulations) and in cases in which an individual is especially vulnerable due to the nature of a circumstance (e.g. medical or legal malpractice).\nThe BGB makes specific provisions for several different categories of torts pertaining to damages available, including damages and injunctions to prevent the commission of a tortious act. These provisions are supplemented by specific legislation, particularly protective laws. With regard to product liability, protective laws implementing European Union directives provide for a system of strict liability similar to that adopted in many common law jurisdictions; however, German tort law does not recognise class action lawsuits or the notion of mass torts. German tort law additionally does not permit punitive damages.\nJurisprudence.\nIn terms of tort liability, the BGB represents a school of legal jurisprudence \u2013 the pandectists \u2013 heavily shaped by 19th century classical liberalism and, accordingly, places great emphasis on minimising impairment to individual freedom of action. In this regard, it can be contrasted with the Napoleonic Code, which was authored a century earlier and placed greater emphasis on the protection of individuals from the actions of others. As the two codes form the basis for private law in a variety of jurisdictions across the world, with one or the other being substantially copied by most civil law jurisdictions on every continent, the differences underpinning the BGB and the Napoleonic Code represent a major schism in jurisprudence between civil law jurisdictions. Since 1900, both the judges and German legislators decisively rejected the idea of a general principle of civil liability commonly found in civil codes inspired by the Napoleonic Code as well as in those of Japan and the Republic of China which are otherwise based primarily on the same pandectist school as the BGB and that of the Philippines.\nOne distinguishing feature of German law is the extent to which liability depends not just on the damage caused but on the action of the purported tortfeasor. Sometimes it is enough to prove negligence, while in other cases a more serious fault is required. Thus, anyone who unlawfully interferes, intentionally or through recklessness, with the life, body, health, freedom or property of others is liable to others to repair the resulting damage. On the other hand, less protection is granted in the event of damage to purely intangible interests, nicht-gegenst\u00e4ndliche Interessen, that is to say when the victim only suffers purely economic or moral damage. Such is the case of a pecuniary loss caused by erroneous information or vexatious remarks. Apart from a rather marginal hypothesis provided for by article \u00a7 823 paragraph 2(9), the recourse will then suppose an intentional fault. The protection thus granted has proven to be incomplete. Consequently, over the course of the 20th century, case law has extended liability for recklessness to other cases, in particular by admitting that \u00a7 823 paragraph 1 BGB aims to protect a \"general right to personality\" and a \"right to the company\" or by recognising, alongside tort liability, the theory of culpa in contrahendo. Although Boris Starck makes no express reference to it, there are serious reasons to think that this right strongly inspired him in his elaboration of the theory of the guarantee. First, it takes up the idea of considering the event giving rise to the right to compensation, starting from the nature of the interest affected. Moreover, there is an astonishing resemblance between the respective formulations: \u00a7 823 paragraph 1 BGB is supposed to protect the integrity of property and persons by granting protection \"to life, body, health, freedom, to property\". Starck, for his part, claims \"a right to life, to bodily integrity and to the material integrity of the objects belonging to us\". Finally, on both sides, it is with the same arguments, such as the need to protect the freedom to act, that a less intense protection of purely economic and moral interests is justified. Nevertheless, Boris Starck departs from the German model by raising the protection of physical integrity by a notch, believing that the only breach here generates a right to compensation.\nIsrael.\nIsraeli tort law is codified in the Tort Ordinance, originally passed under British rule, and is largely based on common law principles with influences from civil law jurisdictions. The Jewish law of rabbinic damages in Israel is another example of tort, although the Tort Ordinance is far more relevant in secular life, having been enacted by British Mandate of Palestine authorities in 1944 and taking effect in 1947. The Tort Ordinance additionally provides that any civil court may grant either or both compensation or an injunction as a remedy for a tort and codifies common law rules regarding liability and defences to tort claims. Chapter Three of the ordinance provides a list of torts recognised under Israeli law, including: \nJapan.\nLike the French Civil Code, the Japanese Civil Code only has a single provision on tort liability. Article 709 of the Civil Code states: \"A person who has intentionally or negligently infringed any right of others, or legally protected interest of others, shall be liable to compensate any damages resulting in consequence.\" Tort liability in Japan therefore exists when three conditions are met: negligence or intentionality on the part of the tortfeasor, infringement of some legally recognised right, and a causal link between the tortfeasor's action and the infringement in question. As this leaves room for a broad and potentially unrestricted scope of tort liability, Japanese tort law gradually developed based on case law, including cases on pollution. Statutes outside the Civil Code also regulate specific types of torts, such as the Law on the Compensation of Losses arising from Car Accidents enacted in 1955, the 1973 Law on the Remedies of Harm Caused to Human Health by Pollution, and the 1994 Law on Product Liability. The standard of proof in Japanese tort litigation is that of \"proof of a high degree of probability\", a higher standard than the balance of probabilities utilised for tort liability in common law jurisdictions but lower than the reasonable doubt standard used in most legal systems for criminal trials, which the Japanese Supreme Court described in the leading case Miura v. Japan (a case on liability for medical malpractice):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Proving causation in litigation, unlike proving causation in the natural sciences (which permits no doubt at any point), requires proof of a high degree of probability that certain facts have induced the occurrence of a specific result by taking into necessary and sufficient account that the judge has been persuaded of the truthfulness to a degree where an average person would have no doubt.\nContemporary Japanese product liability law forms a distinct area of tort liability in which litigation may proceed under Article 709 of the Civil Code or the Product Liability Act of 1994. Under the Product Liability Act, which defines \"products\" as including any \"movable item that is manufactured or processed\"; manufacturers bear strict liability where a plaintiff proves the existence of:\nUnder Japanese tort law, plaintiffs may seek compensation for both economic and non-economic damages, and there is no statutory cap on damages; however, punitive damages are forbidden on public policy grounds. Japanese courts regard the compensation of plaintiffs as the paramount purpose of damages under tort law, regarding punishment and deterrence as the exclusive domain of criminal law. Punitive damages awarded against tortfeasors by arbitral tribunals or foreign courts are unenforceable in Japan. Additionally, Japanese civil procedure does not allow for class actions and does not recognise mass tort liability.\nAs a result of the structure of Japan's tort system, the country experiences a significantly lower litigation rate than other jurisdictions. In a 1990 article, Takao Tanase posited that the structure of Japan's civil court system and its tort jurisprudence account for its low litigation rate, rather than any fundamental difference in culture between Japan and other countries. Indeed; present literature finds that, although Japanese jurists take a narrow view of tort law as solely serving to compensate plaintiffs for proven damages, the general Japanese public views punishment and deterrence as being just as desirable in civil litigation as the public in other countries. In Japan in 1986, fewer than 1% of automobile accidents involving death or an injury resulted in litigation, compared to 21.5% in the United States, a difference Tanase argues can be attributed to the availability of non-litigious methods of assessing fault, advising victims, determining compensation, and ensuring payment. Non-litigious dispute resolution mechanisms, mediation services, consultation centres operated by governments, the bar association, and insurance companies. The Japanese judiciary also works hard at developing clear, detailed rules that guarantee virtually automatic, predictable, moderate compensation for most accident victims. This contrasts with the tort system in common law jurisdictions, where the legal rules concerning both liability and general damages (i.e. non-economic loss) are stated in general terms, leaving a great deal to the judgment of constantly rotating lay juries\u2014which in turn makes courtroom outcomes variable and difficult to predict. The result was a system that is vastly more efficient and reliable in delivering compensation than in common law jurisdictions, albeit without punitive or exemplary damages. Tanase estimated that legal fees comprised only 2% of the total compensation paid to injured persons. In the United States in the late 1980s, according to two big studies of motor vehicle accident tort claims (not just lawsuits), payments to lawyers equaled 47% of the total personal injury benefits paid by insurers. This expense drives up the cost of insurance to the point that huge numbers of drivers are uninsured or under-insured, which means that victims of their negligent driving will get little or nothing from the tort system.\nNew Zealand.\nIn 2024, the New Zealand Supreme Court gave leave for M\u0101ori climate activist Mike Smith to sue seven corporations for their roles in causing climate change and the common law harms that resulted. Several aspects of Smith v Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited are notable. Smith argued that the principles of tikanga M\u0101ori\u2014 atraditional system of obligations and recognitions of wrong\u2014 can be used to inform New Zealand common law. Smith argued that the activities of the seven defendants\u2014 by directly emitting greenhouse gasses or supplying fossil fuels\u2014 fall under the established torts of public nuisance and negligence and a new tort of climate change damage. Smith further argued that these seven corporations are harming his tribe's land, coastal waters, and traditional culture. Smith belongs to the Northland tribes of Ng\u0101puhi and Ng\u0101ti Kahu. This judgment simply allows Smith to pursue these matters in the High Court. The defendants have indicated that they will seek to convince the court that climate change responses are better left to government policy and not subject to civil litigation.\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korea's approach to tort liability is relatively unique in the 21st century since, as a result of its Juche ideology and centralised planned economy, its legal system puts little emphasis on civil liability between private citizens; instead, it views correcting damages caused by tortious acts as the prerogative of the state through its economic intervention and criminal penalties. Nevertheless, the Law on the Compensation of Damages adopted on 22 August 2001 provides for tort liability, including vicarious liability on the part of principals for the actions of agents, employers for the actions of employees, parents or guardians for the actions of children, and owners for the actions of pets or other animals under their control. North Korean tort law also recognises capacity as an important factor in determining whether or not someone may be held liable for their own actions.\nPhilippines.\nThe Philippines is a mixed law jurisdiction, shaped primarily by Spanish civil law and American common law as codified in the Philippine Civil Code. For the most part, the equivalent of tort law (insofar as it concerns negligence and product liability) in the Philippines is the law of quasi-delict. Article 2176 of the civil code provides that, in the absence of a contractual or quasi-contractual relationship, a person who \"by act or omission causes damage to another\" by way of fault or negligence is \"obliged to pay for the damage done\". Article 1174 (which is made applicable by article 2178) provides that an individual is generally exempt from liability if the events giving rise to the damage were unforeseeable or inevitable.\nThe Philippine law of quasi-delict is largely a codification of common law principles and doctrines. For instance, the common law doctrine of comparative negligence is codified in article 2179, providing for compensation to be reduced in proportion with the plaintiff's own fault for the damage they incurred. Similarly, the duty of care established in Donoghue v Stevenson is codified by article 2187 with regard to \"manufacturers and processors of foodstuffs, drinks, toilet articles and similar goods\", and is extended by article 2189 to provincial and local governments responsible for defective public amenities. Similarly, article 2190 establishes liability for the owners of defective buildings or structures that cause damage. Additionally, case law in the Philippines recognises the common law doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nOutside the law of quasi-delicts, the civil code also codifies other provisions of tort law in Chapter 2 of the Preliminary Title under the heading \"Human Relations\". This chapter provides that \"every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith\" and that \"every person who, contrary to law, wilfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall indemnify the latter for the same\". While negligence and product liability are primarily covered by the law of quasi-delicts, this chapter covers intentional wrongs in article 21, which provides that \"any person who wilfully causes loss or injury to another in manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage\". This chapter makes several other provisions in the realm of tortious liability, including: liability for defamation (article 33); violations of another person's privacy, causing humiliation on account of religion or economic status, causing another person to be alienated from their friends (article 26); benefitting from (without causing) damage to another person's property (article 23).\nDamages under Philippine law are provided for in the Philippine Civil Code, which establishes harmonised rules for damages arising under any kind of obligation.In addition to pecuniary or economic damages, the code provides for two categories of non-economic damages with regard to quasi-delicts. Firstly, moral damages (i.e. damages for \"physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury\" resulting from a quasi-delict) may be awarded under article 2217. Secondly, exemplary damages may be awarded under article 2231 if there was \"gross negligence\" on the part of the defendant. In special cases, a court may choose to award nominal damages under article 2221 if it finds that, although it is unnecessary to compensate the plaintiff, it is nevertheless desirable to \"vindicate\" or \"recognise\" the violation of their right. Additionally, where a court cannot determine the value of damage incurred with sufficient certainty to award economic damages, it may instead award \"temperate or moderate damages\" under article 2224, which are higher than purely nominal damages but less than compensatory economic damages.\nQu\u00e9bec.\nPrivate law in the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec derives from the pre-Napoleonic French law then in force, but was eventually codified in the Civil Code of Lower Canada and later the present Code Civil du Qu\u00e9bec (CCQ). While tort law in Canada's other provinces follows common law jurisprudence under which distinct nominate torts are recognised by precedent or statute, CCQ provides for a general and open-ended concept of \"civil liability\" or \"la responsabilit\u00e9 civile\" in article 1457:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every person has a duty to abide by the rules of conduct incumbent on him, according to the circumstances, usage or law, so as not to cause injury to another. Where he is endowed with reason and fails in this duty, he is liable for any injury he causes to another by such fault and is bound to make reparation for the injury, whether it be bodily, moral or material in nature. He is also bound, in certain cases, to make reparation for injury caused to another by the act, omission or fault of another person or by the act of things in his custody.\nThe CCQ provides for and defines the scope of civil liability for damages caused by inanimate objects. Article 1465 makes the general provision that the custodian of a thing or object (\"bien\") is liable for any damage caused by it, while article 1466 provides that the owner of an animal is liable for damage or injury caused by it even if it had escaped from their custody at the time of the incident. Similarly, article 1467 imposes liability for damages caused by the ruin of an immovable (i.e. a building or other fixed structure) upon its owner even if construction defects are the ultimate cause of the ruin. Strict liability is imposed upon the manufacturers of moveable things (i.e. product liability) by article 1468 for injuries caused by safety defects. An individual is exempt from civil liability in cases of force majeure (article 1470), harm caused in the process of assisting or rescuing another (article 1471), and in certain other cases prescribed by law.\nIn general, there are four conditions necessary for a finding of civil liability under the CCQ:\nThailand.\nThai tort law, as with contemporary Thai law in general, is a codified admixture of principles derived from common law and civil law systems. Title V of the Civil and Commercial Code of Thailand (CCT) establishes the principles of Thai tort law, with section 420 enshrining the basic doctrine that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A person who, willfully or negligently, unlawfully injures the life, body, health, liberty, property or any right of another person, is said to commit a wrongful act and is bound to make compensation therefore.\nThis is analogous to Article 709 of the Japanese Civil Code which establishes three criteria for tort liability: negligence or intentionality on the part of the tortfeasor, infringement of some legally recognised right and a causal link between the tortfeasor's action and the infringement in question.\nThe CCT comprehensively outlines rules for tort liability and the burden of proof. In general, section 429 provides the default rule that everyone is liable for their own tortious acts and that the guardians of a child or other person lacking capacity are jointly liable. While the burden of proof under Thai tort law is on the plaintiff by default, section 422 of the CCT provides that an individual who infringes \"a statutory provision intended for the protection of others\" is presumed to be liable. Sections 425 through 327 provide for vicarious liability in employer-employee and principal-agent relationships while providing that an employer or principal found vicariously liable may seek compensation from the employee or agent, respectively. Similarly, section 433 provides that the owner or caretaker of an animal is liable for any tortious conduct it may commit, with the caveat that the owner or caretaker may seek compensation for such liability from anyone who \"wrongfully excited or provoked the animal\" or from \"the owner of another animal\" which did so. Sections 434 to 436 provide special rules for liability for the owners and possessors/occupiers (e.g. tenants/lessees) of defective buildings and structures, whereby: 1) the possessor is liable for damage caused by defective construction or poor maintenance except if they exercised proper care to prevent the damage, 2) if the possessor exercised proper care, the owner is liable, 3) the occupier of a building is liable for damage caused by items that fall from the building, and 4) an individual who is at risk of damage or injury from such a building may require its owner or possessor to take preventive action. Certain provisions of the CCT also provide for strict liability with regard to specific categories of tortious conduct; for example, section 437 provides for strict liability for an individual in charge of a vehicle or conveyance which causes injury and for individuals possessing items which are \"dangerous by nature\" or \"on account of their mechanical action\", except where the individual demonstrates that the injury resulted from force majeure. Additionally, the CCT provides that self-defence, the aversion of a common danger, the use of reasonable and necessary force, and (where the thing or person damaged was the source of such danger) the aversion of an individual danger are defences against tort claims.\nThe rules regarding compensation under Thai tort law are prescribed by the CCT. In general, section 438 provides that courts may award such compensation as appears necessary with regard to \"the circumstances and gravity of the act\"; and that, in addition to damages, \"compensation may include restitution\" of any property of which the plaintiff has been deprived or which has decreased in value as a result of the tortious act. Per section 439, an individual who defaults on an obligation to return property they had wrongly deprived another individual of is liable to compensate the other individual for \"the accidental destruction\" or \"accidental impossibility of returning\" the property in question, except where such destruction or impossibility would have occurred regardless of the wrongful deprivation. Section 440 provides that compensation may additionally include interest for lost time. Where the tortious act contributed to an individual's death, compensation must include funerary expenses; and, where the act resulted in damage to an individual's health or body, compensation must include reimbursement of medical expenses and lost wages, and may additionally include non-pecuniary damages. Where the tortious act involves harm to an individual's reputation, the court may order \"proper measures to be taken\" to restore the individual's reputation either together with or in lieu of damages.\nEuropean Union.\nThe legal framework of the European Union consists of the treaties, regulations, directives and case law. Specifically in the area of tort law, a number of rules can be found in tort law directives. Examples of directives include the Product Liability Directive and the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices. A directives can be either a maximum harmonisation directives, which means member states are not allowed to deviate from it, or a minimum harmonisation directive, which only provide a general framework. Article 288 of the TFEU, however, concedes that a directive 'shall be binding as to the result to be achieved, upon each member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to national authorities the choice of form and methods'. Liability can also be based on the violation of community provisions. Article 288 of the TFEU explicitly regulates the liability of Community Institutions for damage caused by the breach of Union Law. This article does not give precise liability rules but refers to the general principles common to the laws of Member States. It does not mean that 'the Community judicature must search for a solution favoured by a majority of Member States ... It simply means that the Community judicature must look to the national systems for inspiration in devising a regime of non-contractual liability adapted to the specific circumstances of the Community.'\nThe development of a general principle of liability for breach of Union Law is also in the Francovich case law of the ECJ. In this 1991 decision, the ECJ acknowledged liability of the Member States towards individuals for violation of Union law as being inherent in the system of the Treaty and being necessary for the effectiveness of Community of law. On the basis of the general principles to which Article 288 refers, the ECJ developed three requirements for liability:\nThe fulfilment of these requirements is sufficient for a right to compensation, which is directly based in Union Law.\nWithin the European Union and neighbouring countries, the European Group on Tort Law promotes the harmonisation of tort law within the region. The group meets regularly to discuss fundamental issues of tort law liability as well as recent developments and the future directions of the law of tort. The Group has founded the European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law in Vienna. The Group has drafted a collection of Principles of European Tort Law similar to the Principles of European Contract Law drafted by the European Contract Law Commission. The \"Principles of European Tort Law\" are a compilation of guidelines by the European Group on Tort Law aiming at the harmonisation of European tort law. They are not intended to serve as a model code, even though their wording may resemble statutory texts. At least with respect to form and structure, they resemble an American \"Restatement of the Law\". The \"Principles of European Tort Law\" are intended to serve as a common framework for the further development of national tort laws and also of singular European legislation, which could avoid a further drifting-apart of piecemeal rule-making both on a national and on the European level.\nConflict of laws.\nIn certain instances, different jurisdictions' law may apply to a tort, in which case rules have developed for which law to apply. In common law jurisdictions, the traditional approach to determine which jurisdiction's tort law is applicable is the \"proper law\" test. When the jurisdiction is in dispute, one or more state laws will be relevant to the decision-making process. If the laws are the same, this will cause no problems, but if there are substantive differences, the choice of which law to apply will produce a different judgment. Each state, therefore, produces a set of rules to guide the choice of law, and one of the most significant rules is that the law to be applied in any given situation will be the \"proper law\". This is the law which seems to have the closest and most real connection to the facts of the case, and so has the best claim to be applied. The general rule is that the \"proper law\" is the primary system of law that governs most aspects of the factual situation giving rise to the dispute. This does not imply that all the aspects of the factual circumstances are necessarily governed by the same system of law, but there is a strong presumption that this will be the case (see characterisation). Traditionally, common law jurisdictions such as England required \"double actionability\" for torts, effectively requiring the conduct to be considered tortious both in England and in the jurisdiction whose law is to apply under the proper law rule.\nOver time, the proper law test has been refined or replaced in many common law jurisdictions either with reference to all instances of conflict of laws or specifically in the case of tort law. In English law, with the exception of defamation which continues to apply the \"proper law\" test, s10 Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 abolishes the \"double actionability\" test, and s11 applies the \"lex loci delicti\" rule subject to an exception under s12 derived from \"Boys v Chaplin\" [1971] AC 356 and \"Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA\" [1995] 1 AC 190. Thus, it is no longer necessary for the case to be based on a tort actionable in England. The English courts must apply wider international tests and respect any remedies available under the \"Applicable Law\" or \"lex causae\" including any rules on who may claim (e.g. whether a personal representative may claim for a fatal accident) and who the relevant defendant may be (i.e. the English court would have to apply the applicable law's rules on vicarious liability or the identity of an \"occupier\" of land). The first step is for the court to decide where the tort occurred, which may be complicated if relevant events took place in more than one state. s11(2) distinguishes between:\nIn exceptional circumstances, the \"lex loci delicti\" rule is displaced in favour of another law, if the \"factors relating to the parties\" or \"any of the events which constitute the tort\" show that this other law will be \"substantially\" more appropriate.\nWithin the European Union, there have been efforts to harmonise conflict of tort laws rules between member states. Under Article 3 of the proposed \"Rome II Regulation\" on the \"Law Applicable to Non-Contractual Obligations\" (22 July 2003), there would be a general presumption that the \"lex loci delicti\" will apply subject to either: an exception in Paragraph 2 for the application of the law to any common habitual residence between the parties, or an exception in Paragraph 3 for cases in which \"the non-contractual obligation is manifestly more closely connected with another country. . .\" the so-called \"proximity criterion\". In effect, where other specific rules of the regulation are not applied, these general rules replicate the effect of the English rules outlined above. In product liability cases, Article 4 selects the law of the injured party's habitual residence if the product was marketed there with the consent of the defendant. The rationale is that if a defendant knows of, and is benefiting from, sales in the plaintiff's state, the choice of that state's law is reasonable. Article 6 specifies the \"lex fori\" for actions arising out of breach of privacy or defamation, a rule that may increase the risk of forum shopping. Whether the plaintiff has any right of reply in a defamation case will be determined under the law of the state where the broadcaster or publisher is established. In cases where contract and tort issues overlap, Article 9 states that the same law should govern both sets of issues, thus applying contractual choice of law clauses to related tort litigation.\nIn the United States, where each state constitutes a distinct jurisdiction for the purposes of tort law, different jurisdictions take different approaches to conflict of laws, and rules regarding conflict of tort laws apply equally to conflicts between the tort laws of two American states and conflicts between an American state and a foreign jurisdiction. Until the 20th century, traditional choice of law rules were based on the principle that legal rights vest automatically at legally significant and ascertainable times and places. For example, a dispute regarding property would be decided by the law of the place the property was located. Disputes in tort would be decided by the place where the injury occurred. During the first half of the 20th century, the traditional conflict of laws approach came under criticism from some members of the American legal community who saw it as rigid and arbitrary; the traditional method sometimes forced the application of the laws of a state with no connection to either party, except that a tort or contract claim arose between the parties in that state. This period of intellectual ferment (which coincided with the rise of the legal realism movement) introduced a number of innovative approaches to American choice of laws jurisprudence:\nTheory and reform.\nScholars and lawyers have identified conflicting aims for the law of tort, to some extent reflected in the different types of damages awarded by the courts: compensatory, aggravated, and punitive. British scholar Glanville Williams notes four possible bases on which different torts rested: appeasement, justice, deterrence, and compensation.\nWilliam M. Landes, Richard A. Posner, and Steven Shavell have initiated a line of research in the law and economics literature that is focused on identifying the effects of tort law on people's behavior. These studies often make use of concepts that were developed in the field of game theory. Law and economic scholars characterise law in terms of incentives and deterrence, and identified the aim of tort as being the efficient distribution of risk. Ronald Coase, a principal proponent, argued in \"The Problem of Social Cost\" (1960) that the aim of tort law, when transaction costs are high, should be to reflect as closely as possible the allocation of risk and liability at which private parties arrive when transaction costs are low.\nSince the mid-to-late 20th century, calls for reform of tort law have come from various perspectives. Some calls for reform stress the difficulties encountered by potential claimants. For example, because not all people who have accidents can find solvent defendants from which to recover damages in the courts, P. S. Atiyah has called the situation a \"damages lottery\". Consequently, in New Zealand, the government in the 1960s established a no-fault system of state compensation for accidents. In the 1970s, Australia and the United Kingdom drew up proposals for similar no-fault schemes but they were later abandoned.\nA wide variety of tort reforms have been implemented or proposed in different jurisdictions, each attempting to address a particular deficiency perceived in the system of tort law. Generally, these can be broken down into two categories: reforms limiting damages recoverable by a plaintiff and procedural reforms limiting the ability of plaintiffs to file lawsuits. A large portion of tort reforms seek to limit the damages a plaintiff can be awarded. The rationale underlying these reforms is that, by limiting the profitability of tort lawsuits to plaintiffs, they will reduce the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits. There are several varieties of reforms to the system of damages:\nIn addition to reforms aimed at limiting plaintiff's abilities to claim particular categories of compensation, tort reform measures aimed at reducing the prevalence of lawsuits for negligence, the most commonly alleged tort, aim to revise the doctrine of comparative negligence. Comparative negligence is a partial legal defence that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury, which progressively displaced the erstwhile traditional doctrine of contributory negligence over the twentieth century which had precluded any damages being awarded in cases in which the plaintiff was deemed to be even partially at fault. Under standard or \"pure\" comparative negligence, a plaintiff can seek damages regardless of the portion of liability they bear, even where they are found to be more at fault than the respondent. As a tort reform measure aimed at combatting the perceived unfairness of allowing a party to seek extra-contractual damages where they are primarily at fault, many common law jurisdictions have adopted a \"modified\" doctrine of comparative negligence in which a party may only recover damages if it bears less than half the liability or if the other party bears more than half the liability. More radically, the American states of Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia continue to use contributory negligence, thus precluding a party who is even partly at fault from recovering damages for negligence.\nThe abolition of the collateral source rule (i.e. the principle that a respondent in a tort action cannot use the fact that a plaintiff has already been compensated as evidence) is another common proposal of tort reform advocates in jurisdictions where the rule exists. They argue that if the plaintiff's injuries and damages have already been compensated, it is unfair and duplicative to allow an award of damages against the respondent. As a result, numerous states have altered or partially abrogated the rule by statute.\nRegulation of contingent fees; as well as rules regarding barratry, champerty and maintenance, or litigation funding more generally; is another aspect of procedural policies and reforms designed to reduce the number of cases filed in civil court.\nIn common law jurisdictions, which typically rely on judicial precedent for the creation and development of new torts, the creation of statutory torts is a means through which legislatures reform and modify tort law. A statutory tort is like any other, in that it imposes duties on private or public parties, however, they are created by the legislature, not the courts. For example, the European Union's \"Product Liability Directive\" imposes strict liability for defective products that harm people; such strict liability is not uncommon although not necessarily statutory. As another example, in England common law liability of a landowner to guests or trespassers was replaced by the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957; a similar situation occurred in the U.S. State of California in which a judicial common law rule established in \"Rowland v. Christian\" was amended through a 1985 statute. Statutory torts also spread across workplace health and safety laws and health and safety in food. In some cases, federal or state statutes may preempt tort actions, which is particularly discussed in terms of the U.S. FDA Preemption; although actions in the United States for medical devices are preempted due to \"Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.\" (2008), actions for medical drugs are not due to \"Wyeth v. Levine\" (2009).\nComparison with other areas of law.\nTort law is closely related to other areas of law, particularly contract and criminal law. On one hand, tort and contract law are typically regarded as the two primary fields within the law of obligations, with tort forming a catch-all category encompassing civil wrongs that arise by operation of law in contrast to breach of contract, which encompasses violations of obligations that are freely assumed by parties to a contract. On the other hand, both tort and criminal law aim to address wrongful conduct and often overlap such that conduct which gives rise to a claim under tort law may also give rise to a prosecution under criminal law.\nContract law.\nTort is sometimes viewed as the causes of action which are not defined in other areas such as contract or fiduciary law. However, tort and contract law are similar in that both involve a breach of duties, and in modern law these duties have blurred and it may not be clear whether an action \"sounds in tort or contract\"; if both apply and different standards apply for each (such as a statute of limitations), courts will determine which is the \"gravamen\" (the most applicable). Circumstances such as those involving professional negligence may involve both torts and contracts. The choice may affect time limits or damages, particularly given that damages are typically relatively limited in contract cases while in tort cases noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering may be awarded. Punitive damages are relatively uncommon in contractual cases versus tort cases. However, compensation for defective but not unsafe products is typically available only through contractual actions through the law of warranty.\nIn the United Kingdom, plaintiffs in professional negligence cases have some degree of choice in which law while in commercial transactions contract law applies; in unusual cases, intangible losses have been awarded in contract law cases.\nThe English case \"Hadley v. Baxendale\" (1854), which was adopted in the United States, split contract and tort damages by foreseeability of the damages when the contract was made. In the United States, the pure economic loss rule was adopted to further prevent negligence lawsuits in breach of contract cases. This \"economic loss rule\" was adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States \"East River Steamship Corp V Transamerica Delaval Inc.\" (1986) and expanded across the country in a non-uniform manner, leading to confusion. Among other examples, the tort of insurance bad faith arises out of a contractual relationship, and \"collateral torts\" such as wrongful dismissal involving possible overlap with labour law contracts.\nCriminal law.\nThere is some overlap between criminal law and tort. For example, in English law an assault is both a crime and a tort (a form of trespass to the person). A tort allows a person to obtain a remedy that serves their own purposes (for example, the payment of damages or the obtaining of injunctive relief). Criminal actions on the other hand are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a person\u00a0\u2013 although often criminal courts do have the power to grant such remedies\u00a0\u2013 but to remove their liberty on the state's behalf. This explains why incarceration is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes, but not usually for torts. In early common law, the distinction between crime and tort was not distinct.\nThe more severe penalties available in criminal law also mean that it requires a higher burden of proof to be discharged than the related tort. As with other areas of private law, the burden of proof required in tort, known either as the 'balance of probabilities' in English common law or 'preponderance of evidence' in American law, is lower than the higher standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. Sometimes a claimant may prevail in a tort case even if the defendant who allegedly caused harm were acquitted in an earlier criminal trial. For example, O. J. Simpson was acquitted in the criminal court of murder but later found liable for the tort of wrongful death.\nBoth tort law and criminal law may impose liability where there is intentional action, reckless behaviour, carelessness, product liability without negligence (in the US and the EU), innocence, provided there is strict liability, battery, assault or trespass.\nUnder Indian tort law and in other jurisdictions which adopted a version of the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the torts of assault and battery are interpreted with reference to equivalent criminal offences under the Indian Penal Code.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"technology\" can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.\nTechnological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistory, followed by the control of fire\u2014which in turn contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age, according to the cooking hypothesis. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.\nWhile technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion, and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a result, philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing.\nEtymology.\n\"Technology\" is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' (from Greek , from the and (), 'study, knowledge').\"\" It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word (), used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.\nStarting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms (German) or (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments. At the time, (German and French) referred either to the academic discipline studying the \"methods of arts and crafts\", or to the political discipline \"intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts.\" The distinction between and is absent in English, and so both were translated as \"technology\". The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn the 20th century, as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution, \"technology\" stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric.\nTools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error. Around 2 Mya (million years ago), they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble, forming a sharp hand axe. This practice was refined 75 kya (thousand years ago) into pressure flaking, enabling much finer work.\nThe discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as \"possibly the greatest ever made by man\". Archaeological, dietary, and social evidence point to \"continuous [human] fire-use\" at least 1.5 Mya. Fire, fueled with wood and charcoal, allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten. The \"cooking hypothesis\" proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size, though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive. Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya; researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language.\nOther technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter. No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology, but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya and shelter 450 kya. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380 kya, humans were constructing temporary wood huts. Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya, initially moving to Eurasia.\nNeolithic.\nThe Neolithic Revolution (or \"First Agricultural Revolution\") brought about an acceleration of technological innovation, and a consequent increase in social complexity. The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming. This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland. Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities.\nWith this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization. What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as Uruk, and the first civilizations, such as Sumer, is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war among adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation, are all thought to have played a role.\nThe invention of writing led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history, libraries, schools, and scientific research.\nContinuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided, for the first time, the ability to smelt and forge gold, copper, silver, and lead\u00a0\u2013 native metals found in relatively pure form in nature. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times (about 10 kya). Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass (about 4,000 BCE). The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,800 BCE.\nAncient.\nAfter harnessing fire, humans discovered other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,000 BCE. From prehistoric times, Egyptians likely used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and \"catch\" basins. The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation.\nArchaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia (in present-day Iraq), the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture), and Central Europe. Time estimates range from 5,500 to 3,000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4,000 BCE. The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about 3,500 BCE. More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world as of 2024 was found in the Ljubljana Marsh of Slovenia; Austrian experts have established that the wheel is between 5,100 and 5,350 years old.\nThe invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. The ancient Sumerians used a potter's wheel and may have invented it. A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around 3,429 BCE, and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area. Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources. The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around 3,000 BCE.\nThe oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur, dating to c.\u20094,000 BCE, and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury, England, dating to around the same period. The first long-distance road, which came into use around 3,500 BCE, spanned 2,400\u00a0km from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea, but was not paved and was only partially maintained. In around 2,000 BCE, the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a 50\u00a0km road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island, through the mountains, to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island. Unlike the earlier road, the Minoan road was completely paved.\nAncient Minoan private homes had running water. A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos. Several Minoan private homes also had toilets, which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain. The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets, which emptied into an extensive sewage system. The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima; construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today.\nThe ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts, which were used to transport water across long distances. The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE. The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE. Put together, the Roman aqueducts extended over 450\u00a0km, but less than 70\u00a0km of this was above ground and supported by arches.\nPre-modern.\nInnovations continued through the Middle Ages with the introduction of silk production (in Asia and later Europe), the horse collar, and horseshoes. Simple machines (such as the lever, the screw, and the pulley) were combined into more complicated tools, such as the wheelbarrow, windmills, and clocks. A system of universities developed and spread scientific ideas and practices, including Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe Renaissance era produced many innovations, including the introduction of the movable type printing press to Europe, which facilitated the communication of knowledge. Technology became increasingly influenced by science, beginning a cycle of mutual advancement.\nModern.\nStarting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the discovery of steam power set off the Industrial Revolution, which saw wide-ranging technological discoveries, particularly in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transport, and the widespread application of the factory system. This was followed a century later by the Second Industrial Revolution which led to rapid scientific discovery, standardization, and mass production. New technologies were developed, including sewage systems, electricity, light bulbs, electric motors, railroads, automobiles, and airplanes. These technological advances led to significant developments in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering. They were accompanied by consequential social change, with the introduction of skyscrapers accompanied by rapid urbanization. Communication improved with the invention of the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, and television.\nThe 20th century brought a host of innovations. In physics, the discovery of nuclear fission in the Atomic Age led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Analog computers were invented and asserted dominance in processing complex data. While the invention of vacuum tubes allowed for digital computing with computers like the ENIAC, their sheer size precluded widespread use until innovations in quantum physics allowed for the invention of the transistor in 1947, which significantly compacted computers and led the digital transition. Information technology, particularly optical fiber and optical amplifiers, allowed for simple and fast long-distance communication, which ushered in the Information Age and the birth of the Internet. The Space Age began with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, and later the launch of crewed missions to the moon in the 1960s. Organized efforts to search for extraterrestrial intelligence have used radio telescopes to detect signs of technology use, or \"technosignatures\", given off by alien civilizations. In medicine, new technologies were developed for diagnosis (CT, PET, and MRI scanning), treatment (like the dialysis machine, defibrillator, pacemaker, and a wide array of new pharmaceutical drugs), and research (like interferon cloning and DNA microarrays).\nComplex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain more modern technologies, and entire industries have arisen to develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education\u00a0\u2013 their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have developed to support them, including engineering, medicine, and computer science; and other fields have become more complex, such as construction, transportation, and architecture.\nImpact.\nTechnological change is the largest cause of long-term economic growth. Throughout human history, energy production was the main constraint on economic development, and new technologies allowed humans to significantly increase the amount of available energy. First came fire, which made edible a wider variety of foods, and made it less physically demanding to digest them. Fire also enabled smelting, and the use of tin, copper, and iron tools, used for hunting or tradesmanship. Then came the agricultural revolution: humans no longer needed to hunt or gather to survive, and began to settle in towns and cities, forming more complex societies, with militaries and more organized forms of religion.\nTechnologies have contributed to human welfare through increased prosperity, improved comfort and quality of life, and medical progress, but they can also disrupt existing social hierarchies, cause pollution, and harm individuals or groups.\nRecent years have brought about a rise in social media's cultural prominence, with potential repercussions on democracy, and economic and social life. Early on, the internet was seen as a \"liberation technology\" that would democratize knowledge, improve access to education, and promote democracy. Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides, including disinformation, polarization, hate speech, and propaganda.\nSince the 1970s, technology's impact on the environment has been criticized, leading to a surge in investment in solar, wind, and other forms of clean energy.\nSocial.\nJobs.\nSince the invention of the wheel, technologies have helped increase humans' economic output. Past automation has both substituted and complemented labor; machines replaced humans at some lower-paying jobs (for example in agriculture), but this was compensated by the creation of new, higher-paying jobs. Studies have found that computers did not create significant net technological unemployment. Due to artificial intelligence being far more capable than computers, and still being in its infancy, it is not known whether it will follow the same trend; the question has been debated at length among economists and policymakers. A 2017 survey found no clear consensus among economists on whether AI would increase long-term unemployment. According to the World Economic Forum's \"The Future of Jobs Report 2020\", AI is predicted to replace 85 million jobs worldwide, and create 97\u00a0million new jobs by 2025. From 1990 to 2007, a study in the U.S. by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu showed that an addition of one robot for every 1,000 workers decreased the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2%, or about 3.3 workers, and lowered wages by 0.42%. Concerns about technology replacing human labor however are long-lasting. As US president Lyndon Johnson said in 1964, \"Technology is creating both new opportunities and new obligations for us, opportunity for greater productivity and progress; obligation to be sure that no workingman, no family must pay an unjust price for progress.\" upon signing the National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress bill.\nSecurity.\nWith the growing reliance of technology, there have been security and privacy concerns along with it. Billions of people use different online payment methods, such as WeChat Pay, PayPal, Alipay, and much more to help transfer money. Although security measures are placed, some criminals are able to bypass them. In March 2022, North Korea used Blender.io, a mixer which helped them to hide their cryptocurrency exchanges, to launder over $20.5\u00a0million in cryptocurrency, from Axie Infinity, and steal over $600\u00a0million worth of cryptocurrency from the game's owner. Because of this, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Blender.io, which marked the first time it has taken action against a mixer, to try to crack down on North Korean hackers. The privacy of cryptocurrency has been debated. Although many customers like the privacy of cryptocurrency, many also argue that it needs more transparency and stability.\nEnvironmental.\nTechnology can have both positive and negative effects on the environment. Environmental technology, describes an array of technologies which seek to reverse, mitigate or halt environmental damage to the environment. This can include measures to halt pollution through environmental regulations, capture and storage of pollution, or using pollutant byproducts in other industries. Other examples of environmental technology include deforestation and the reversing of deforestation. Emerging technologies in the fields of climate engineering may be able to halt or reverse global warming and its environmental impacts, although this remains highly controversial. As technology has advanced, so too has the negative environmental impact, with increased release of greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect. This continues to gradually heat the earth, causing global warming and climate change. Measures of technological innovation correlates with a rise in greenhouse gas emissions.\nPollution.\nPollution, the presence of contaminants in an environment that causes adverse effects, could have been present as early as the Inca Empire. They used a lead sulfide flux in the smelting of ores, along with the use of a wind-drafted clay kiln, which released lead into the atmosphere and the sediment of rivers.\nPhilosophy.\nPhilosophy of technology is a branch of philosophy that studies the \"practice of designing and creating artifacts\", and the \"nature of the things so created.\" It emerged as a discipline over the past two centuries, and has grown \"considerably\" since the 1970s. The \"humanities philosophy of technology\" is concerned with the \"meaning of technology for, and its impact on, society and culture\".\nInitially, technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties. Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat, but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was \"freed from societal deformations\". Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to \"daily life and living in a techno-material culture\", arguing that technology could oppress \"even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors.\" Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism, and considered how humans can learn to live with technology.\nEarly scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: technological determinism, and social construction. Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes.95 It usually encompasses a related argument, technological autonomy, which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented. Social constructivists argue that technologies follow no natural progression, and are shaped by cultural values, laws, politics, and economic incentives. Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of sociotechnical systems, \"assemblages of things, people, practices, and meanings\", looking at the value judgments that shape technology.\nCultural critic Neil Postman distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called \"technopolies\", societies that are dominated by an ideology of technological and scientific progress to the detriment of other cultural practices, values, and world views. Herbert Marcuse and John Zerzan suggest that technological society will inevitably deprive us of our freedom and psychological health.\nEthics.\nThe \"ethics of technology\" is an interdisciplinary subfield of ethics that analyzes technology's ethical implications and explores ways to mitigate potential negative impacts of new technologies. There is a broad range of ethical issues revolving around technology, from specific areas of focus affecting professionals working with technology to broader social, ethical, and legal issues concerning the role of technology in society and everyday life.\nProminent debates have surrounded genetically modified organisms, the use of robotic soldiers, algorithmic bias, and the issue of aligning AI behavior with human values.\nTechnology ethics encompasses several key fields: Bioethics looks at ethical issues surrounding biotechnologies and modern medicine, including cloning, human genetic engineering, and stem cell research. Computer ethics focuses on issues related to computing. Cyberethics explores internet-related issues like intellectual property rights, privacy, and censorship. Nanoethics examines issues surrounding the alteration of matter at the atomic and molecular level in various disciplines including computer science, engineering, and biology. And engineering ethics deals with the professional standards of engineers, including software engineers and their moral responsibilities to the public.\nA wide branch of technology ethics is concerned with the ethics of artificial intelligence: it includes robot ethics, which deals with ethical issues involved in the design, construction, use, and treatment of robots, as well as machine ethics, which is concerned with ensuring the ethical behavior of artificially intelligent agents. Within the field of AI ethics, significant yet-unsolved research problems include AI alignment (ensuring that AI behaviors are aligned with their creators' intended goals and interests) and the reduction of algorithmic bias. Some researchers have warned against the hypothetical risk of an AI takeover, and have advocated for the use of AI capability control in addition to AI alignment methods.\nOther fields of ethics have had to contend with technology-related issues, including military ethics, media ethics, and educational ethics.\nFutures studies.\n\"Futures studies\" is the study of social and technological progress. It aims to explore the range of plausible futures and incorporate human values in the development of new technologies.54 More generally, futures researchers are interested in improving \"the freedom and welfare of humankind\".73 It relies on a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of past and present technological trends, and attempts to rigorously extrapolate them into the future. Science fiction is often used as a source of ideas.173 Futures research methodologies include survey research, modeling, statistical analysis, and computer simulations.187\nExistential risk.\nExistential risk researchers analyze risks that could lead to human extinction or civilizational collapse, and look for ways to build resilience against them. Relevant research centers include the Cambridge Center for the Study of Existential Risk, and the Stanford Existential Risk Initiative. Future technologies may contribute to the risks of artificial general intelligence, biological warfare, nuclear warfare, nanotechnology, anthropogenic climate change, global warming, or stable global totalitarianism, though technologies may also help us mitigate asteroid impacts and gamma-ray bursts. In 2019 philosopher Nick Bostrom introduced the notion of a \"vulnerable world\", \"one in which there is some level of technological development at which civilization almost certainly gets devastated by default\", citing the risks of a pandemic caused by bioterrorists, or an arms race triggered by the development of novel armaments and the loss of mutual assured destruction. He invites policymakers to question the assumptions that technological progress is always beneficial, that scientific openness is always preferable, or that they can afford to wait until a dangerous technology has been invented before they prepare mitigations.\nEmerging technologies.\nEmerging technologies are novel technologies whose development or practical applications are still largely unrealized. They include nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics, 3D printing, and blockchains.\nIn 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil claimed the next technological revolution would rest upon advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, with robotics being the most impactful of the three technologies. Genetic engineering will allow far greater control over human biological nature through a process called directed evolution. Some thinkers believe that this may shatter our sense of self, and have urged for renewed public debate exploring the issue more thoroughly; others fear that directed evolution could lead to eugenics or extreme social inequality. Nanotechnology will grant us the ability to manipulate matter \"at the molecular and atomic scale\", which could allow us to reshape ourselves and our environment in fundamental ways. Nanobots could be used within the human body to destroy cancer cells or form new body parts, blurring the line between biology and technology. Autonomous robots have undergone rapid progress, and are expected to replace humans at many dangerous tasks, including search and rescue, bomb disposal, firefighting, and war.\nEstimates on the advent of artificial general intelligence vary, but half of machine learning experts surveyed in 2018 believe that AI will \"accomplish every task better and more cheaply\" than humans by 2063, and automate all human jobs by 2140. This expected technological unemployment has led to calls for increased emphasis on computer science education and debates about universal basic income. Political science experts predict that this could lead to a rise in extremism, while others see it as an opportunity to usher in a post-scarcity economy.\nMovements.\nAppropriate technology.\nSome segments of the 1960s hippie counterculture grew to dislike urban living and developed a preference for locally autonomous, sustainable, and decentralized technology, termed \"appropriate technology\". This later influenced hacker culture and technopaganism.\nTechnological utopianism.\nTechnological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a moral good, which can and should bring about a utopia, that is, a society in which laws, governments, and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens. Examples of techno-utopian goals include post-scarcity economics, life extension, mind uploading, cryonics, and the creation of artificial superintelligence. Major techno-utopian movements include transhumanism and singularitarianism.\nThe transhumanism movement is founded upon the \"continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form\" through science and technology, informed by \"life-promoting principles and values.\" The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century.\nSingularitarians believe that machine superintelligence will \"accelerate technological progress\" by orders of magnitude and \"create even more intelligent entities ever faster\", which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is \"incomprehensible\" to us. This \"event horizon\" is known as the technological singularity.\nMajor figures of techno-utopianism include Ray Kurzweil and Nick Bostrom. Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive, religious, and conservative thinkers.\nAnti-technology backlash.\nTechnology's central role in our lives has drawn concerns and backlash. The backlash against technology is not a uniform movement and encompasses many heterogeneous ideologies.\nThe earliest known revolt against technology was Luddism, a pushback against early automation in textile production. Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers, a process known as technological unemployment.\nBetween the 1970s and 1990s, American terrorist Ted Kaczynski carried out a series of bombings across America and published the \"Unabomber Manifesto\" denouncing technology's negative impacts on nature and human freedom. The essay resonated with a large part of the American public. It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's \"The Technological Society\".\nSome subcultures, like the off-the-grid movement, advocate a withdrawal from technology and a return to nature. The ecovillage movement seeks to reestablish harmony between technology and nature.\nRelation to science and engineering.\nEngineering is the process by which technology is developed. It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints. Technological development is \"action-oriented\", while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory. Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: \"science concerns itself with what is, technology with what is to be.\"\nThe direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists, philosophers and policymakers. Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge, most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge, but instead from engineering, tinkering and chance. For example, in the 1940s and 1950s, when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude, jet engines were invented through \"running the device to destruction, analyzing what broke [...] and repeating the process\". Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them. Many discoveries also arose from pure chance, like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination. Since the 1960s, the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility. Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes.\nDespite this, modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep, domain-specific scientific knowledge. In 1975, there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S.; by 1989, this increased to an average of one citation per patent. The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry, chemistry, and electronics. A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents.\nOther animal species.\nThe use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species. Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo. This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among chimpanzees and other primates, dolphins, and crows. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools, pestles, levers, using leaves as sponges, and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites. West African chimpanzees use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts, as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista, Brazil. Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use; for example, beaver dams, built with wooden sticks or large stones, are a technology with \"dramatic\" impacts on river habitats and ecosystems.\nIn popular culture.\nThe relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature, for example in \"Brave New World\", \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", Isaac Asimov's essays, and movies like \"Minority Report\", \"Total Recall\", \"Gattaca\", and \"Inception\". It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic cyberpunk genre, which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse, dystopia or decay. Notable cyberpunk works include William Gibson's \"Neuromancer\" novel, and movies like \"Blade Runner\", and \"The Matrix\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29818", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29818", "title": "The Doors (album)", "text": "The Doors is the debut studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released on January 4, 1967, by Elektra Records. Recorded in August 1966 at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California, the album was produced by Paul A. Rothchild. It contains the full-length version of the group's breakthrough single \"Light My Fire\" and concludes with \"The End\", noted for its improvised Oedipal spoken-word section.\nThe Doors developed much of the material for their debut during live performances in 1966, particularly at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. After being dismissed from the venue, they signed with Elektra and began recording sessions. Musically, the album incorporates a wide range of styles, including jazz, blues, classical, pop, and R&amp;B, all anchored in a rock foundation. \"The Doors\" has since been recognized as a landmark of psychedelic rock and one of the most influential albums of the 1960s, inspiring numerous subsequent artists and recordings.\nThe album was a commercial and critical success, establishing the Doors as a leading rock act of their era. Both \"The Doors\" and \"Light My Fire\" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected \"The Doors\" for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". As of 2015, the album has sold over 13 million copies worldwide, making it the Doors\u2019 best-selling record.\nWidely considered one of the greatest albums in rock history, \"The Doors\" has also been consistently ranked among the greatest albums of all time by various publications, including the \"BBC\" and \"Rolling Stone\". The latter placed it at number 42 on its 2003 and 2012 lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and at number 86 in the 2020 update.\nBackground.\nThe Doors' final lineup was formed in mid-1965 after keyboardist Ray Manzarek's two brothers Rick and Jim 'Manczarek' left Rick &amp; the Ravens, whose members included besides Manzarek, jazz-influenced drummer John Densmore and then-novice vocalist Jim Morrison. The group's four man membership was established when guitarist Robby Krieger agreed to join. Though he had previous experience playing folk and flamenco, Krieger had only been playing the electric guitar for a few months when he was invited to become a member of the band, soon renamed the Doors. They were initially signed to Columbia Records under a six-month contract, but they asked for an early release after the record company failed to secure a producer for the album and placed them on a drop list.\nFollowing their release from the label, the Doors played residencies in mid-1966 at two historic Sunset Strip club venues, the London Fog and Whisky a Go Go. They were spotted at the Whisky a Go Go by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman, who was present at the suggestion of Love singer Arthur Lee. After he saw two sets, Holzman called producer Paul A. Rothchild to see the group. On August 18, after attending several appearances of the band, Holzman and Rothchild ultimately signed them to Elektra Records.\nThe Doors continued performing at the Whisky until on August 21, when they were fired due to their performance of \"The End\" on which Morrison improvised a retelling section of \"Oedipus Rex\". \nRecording.\n\"The Doors\" was recorded by producer Paul A. Rothchild and audio engineer Bruce Botnick at Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, California, over about a week in late August 1966. \"Indian Summer\" and \"Moonlight Drive\" were the first rehearsal outtakes of the album, while the first recorded songs that appeared on the album being \"I Looked at You\" and \"Take It as It Comes\". A four-track tape machine was used at the cost of approximately $10,000. Three of the tracks were utilized as: bass and drums on one, guitar and organ on another, and Morrison's vocals on the third. The fourth track was used for overdubbing.\nThe album's instrumentation includes keyboards, electric guitar, occasional bass guitar, drums, and marxophone (on \"Alabama Song\"). Rothchild had forbidden Krieger from using any of his guitar effects (particularly the wah wah pedal) on the record in order to avoid what Rothchild thought was the overuse of these devices. However, the studio was equipped with an echo chamber which gave that specific effect to the sound.\nRay Manzarek, explaining the bass-overdubs, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to Botnick, \"What you hear on the first album is what they did live. It wasn't just playing the song\u2013it transcended that.\" Session musician Larry Knechtel and Krieger overdubbed bass guitar on several tracks in order to give some \"punch\" to the sound of Manzarek's keyboard bass. Morrison explained in 1969, \"We started almost immediately, and some of the songs took only a few takes. We'd do several takes just to make sure we couldn't do a better one.\" For \"The End\" and \"Light My Fire\", two takes were edited together to achieve the final recording. The album was mixed and completed in October 1966. Although \"Indian Summer\" was recorded during the sessions and thought was given to including it as the final track, it was eventually replaced with \"The End\".\nComposition.\n\"The Doors\" features many of the group's most famous compositions, including \"Light My Fire\", \"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\", and \"The End\". In 1969, Morrison stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every time I hear [\"The End\"], it means something else to me. It started out as a simple good-bye song\u00a0... Probably just to a girl, but I see how it could be a goodbye to a kind of childhood. I really don't know. I think it's sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that it could be almost anything you want it to be.\nInterviewed by Lizze James, he pointed out the meaning of the verse \"My only friend, the end\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sometimes the pain is too much to examine, or even tolerate\u00a0... That doesn't make it evil, though\u00a0\u2013 or necessarily dangerous. But people fear death even more than pain. It's strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over. Yeah\u00a0\u2013 I guess it is a friend.\n\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\" was released as the group's first single but it was relatively unsuccessful, peaking at No. 104 in \"Cash Box\" and No. 126 in \"Billboard\". Elektra Records edited the line \"she gets high\", knowing a drug reference would discourage airplay (many releases have the original portions of both \"Break On Through\" and \"The End\" edited). The song is in 4/4 time and quite fast-paced, starting with Densmore's bossa nova drum groove in which a clave pattern is played as a rim click underneath a driving ride cymbal pattern. Densmore appreciated the new bossa nova craze coming from Brazil, so he decided to use it in the song. Robby Krieger has stated that he took the idea for the guitar riff from Paul Butterfield's version of the song \"Shake Your Moneymaker\" (originally by blues guitarist Elmore James). Later, a disjointed quirky organ solo is played quite similar to the introduction of Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\".\nThe Doors' breakout hit \"Light My Fire\" was primarily composed by Krieger. Although the album version was just over seven minutes long, it was widely requested for radio play, so a single version was edited to under three minutes with nearly all the instrumental break removed for airplay on AM radio. Krieger has claimed that it was Morrison who encouraged the others to write songs when they realized they did not have enough original material. He recalled that Morrison had suggested to him to write \"about something universal.\"\nAdditionally, Morrison wrote \"Take It as It Comes\", which is thought to be a \"tribute to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\". It came from one of his observations on Maharishi's meditation classes, which Morrison wasn't initially studying contrary to the other group members, but was later convinced by them to attend. Manzarek's organ solo on the song was inspired by Johann Sebastian Bach. The lyrics to \"Twentieth Century Fox\" refer to either Manzarek's wife Dorothy Fujikawa or Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson.\n\"The Doors\" also contains two cover songs: \"Alabama Song\" and \"Back Door Man\". \"Alabama Song\" was written and composed by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill in 1927, for their opera \"Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny\" (\"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\"). The melody is changed and the verse beginning \"Show me the way to the next little dollar\" is omitted. On the album version, Morrison altered the second verse from \"Show us the way to the next pretty boy\" to \"Show me the way to the next little girl\", but on the 1967 \"Live at the Matrix\" recording, he sings the original \"next pretty boy\". Notable peculiarity of the band's version is the unusual use of the marxophone. The Chicago blues \"Back Door Man\" was written by Willie Dixon and originally recorded by Howlin' Wolf.\nReleases.\n\"The Doors\" was released on January 4, 1967, by Elektra Records. Jac Holzman originally intended to release the record in November 1966, but after a negotiation with the band, he decided to postpone the release to the new year, as he felt it was the appropriate time for better album sales. For the album's cover, Joel Brodsky was hired to provide a photo of the group, which later received a Grammy nomination. Holzman also suggested an association with \"Billboard\" magazine for the album's advertisement by promoting the record with \"hoarding\", a novel concept which was made popular later on. It was promoted with the slogan \"Break On Through With An Electrifying Album\". The Doors were the first rock band to use this advertising medium.\n\"The Doors\" made a steady climb up the \"Billboard\" 200, ultimately becoming a huge success in the US once the edited single version of \"Light My Fire\" scaled the charts to become No. 1, with the album peaking at No. 2 on the chart in September 1967 (kept off the top stop by the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\") and going on to achieve multi-platinum status. In Europe the band would have to wait slightly longer for similar recognition, with \"Light My Fire\" originally stalling at No. 49 in the UK singles chart and the album failing to chart at all; however, in 1991, buoyed by the high-profile Oliver Stone film \"The Doors\", a reissue of \"Light My Fire\" reached No. 7 in the singles chart, and the album reached No. 43.\nThe mono LP was withdrawn not long after its original release and remained unavailable until 2009, when it was reissued as a limited edition 180 gram audiophile LP by Rhino Records. The 40th anniversary mix of the debut album presents a stereo version of \"Light My Fire\" in speed-corrected form for the first time. Previously, only the original 45 RPM singles (\"Light My Fire\" and \"Break On Through\") were produced at the correct speed.\nReissues.\n\"The Doors\" has been reissued several times since the 1980s. In 1981, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a half speed mastered version of the album on vinyl, cut by Stan Ricker with the Ortofon Cutting System. In 1988, it was digitally remastered by Bruce Botnick and Paul A. Rothchild at Digital Magnetics, using the original master tapes. In 1992, DCC Compact Classics reissued the album on 24kt gold CD and 180g vinyl; the gold CD was remastered by Steve Hoffman while the vinyl was cut by Kevin Gray and Hoffman at Future Disc. It was remastered again in 1999 for \"The Complete Studio Recordings\" box set by Bernie Grundman and Botnick at Bernie Grundman Mastering using 96khz/24bit technology; it was also released as a standalone CD release. In 2006, the record was released in multichannel DVD-Audio as part of the \"Perception\" box set. The next year, a 40th anniversary edition was released featuring the 2006 stereo remix and three bonus tracks, which was mastered by Botnick at Uniteye. In 2009, the original mono mix was released on 180g vinyl, cut by Grundman.\nOn September 14, 2011, \"The Doors\" was released on hybrid stereo-multichannel Super Audio CD by Warner Japan in their Warner Premium Sound series. Analogue Productions reissued the album on hybrid SACD and double 45 RPM vinyl, both editions were mastered by Doug Sax and Sangwook Nam at The Mastering Lab; the CD layer of the Super Audio CD contains the original stereo mix while the SACD layer contains Botnick's 2006 5.1 surround mix. In 2017, a deluxe edition was released in commemoration of the album's 50th anniversary, and includes the original stereo and mono mixes, as well as a compilation of songs recorded live at The Matrix in San Francisco on March 7, 1967. This edition was remastered by Botnick from \"recently discovered original master tapes\".\nReception and legacy.\nEarly reception.\nIn a contemporary review for \"Crawdaddy!\" magazine, founder and critic Paul Williams hailed \"The Doors\" as \"an album of magnitude\" and described the band as creators of \"modern music\", with which \"contemporary 'jazz' and 'classical' composers must try to measure up\". Williams added: \"The birth of the group is in this album, and it's as good as anything in rock. The awesome fact about the Doors is that they will improve.\" \"Record Mirror\" wrote: \"[\"The Doors\"] for Elektra is wild, rough and although it's subtle in places, the overall sound is torrid. They're blues-based and get quite an effective sound.\" The Beatles had reportedly bought ten copies of the album, and Paul McCartney cited the Doors as an influence on the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\nRobert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his column for \"Esquire\", recommending the album but with reservations; he approved of Manzarek's organ playing and Morrison's \"flexible though sometimes faint\" singing while highlighting the presence of a \"great original hard rock\" in \"Break on Through\" and clever songs such as \"Twentieth Century Fox\", but was critical of more \"esoteric\" material such as the \"long, obscure dirge\" \"The End\". He also found Morrison's lyrics often self-indulgent, particularly lines like \"our love becomes a funeral pyre\", which he said spoiled \"Light My Fire\", and \"the nebulousness that passes for depth among so many lovers of rock poetry\" on \"The End\".\nRetrospective reception.\n\"The Doors\" has since been ranked by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 1985, \"Sounds\" magazine ranked it the ninth greatest album of all time. In 1993, \"New Musical Express\" writers cited \"The Doors\" the 25th greatest album of all time, while in 1998, it was named the 70th in a \"Music of the Millennium\" poll conducted in the UK by HMV, Channel 4, \"The Guardian\" and Classic FM. In 2003, Parke Puterbaugh of \"Rolling Stone\" called the record \"the L.A. foursome's most successful marriage of rock poetics with classically tempered hard rock\u00a0\u2013 a stoned, immaculate classic.\" Sean Egan of BBC Music opines, \"The eponymous debut of the Doors took popular music into areas previously thought impossible: the incitement to expand one's consciousness of opener 'Break on Through' was just the beginning of its incendiary agenda.\" AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger lauded \"The Doors\" as a \"tremendous debut album\" and \"one of the best first-time outings in rock history\", whose \"nonstop melodicism and dynamic tension would never be equaled by the group again, let alone bettered.\"\n\"The Doors\" has been often cited as the group's finest record. In 2000, the album was voted number 46 in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\". \"The Doors\" was ranked No. 42 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". When the list was revised in 2020, the album was repositioned at No. 86. Two of the album's songs, \"Light My Fire\" and \"The End\", also appeared on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 2004 list \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". \"Q\" magazine readers ranked the album at No. 75 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Albums Ever\", while \"NME\" magazine at No. 226 on their respective list \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2007, \"Rolling Stone\" included it on their list of The 40 Essential Albums of 1967. More recently, online media magazine \"Loudwire\" considers \"The Doors\" one of the \"25 Legendary Rock Albums With No Weak Songs\". \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" cited it as the fourth-top psychedelic rock album of all time.\nTrack listing.\nOriginal album.\nAll tracks are written by the Doors (Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore), except where noted.

{"id": "29821", "revid": "14965160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29821", "title": "The Doors of Perception", "text": "1954 book by Aldous Huxley\nThe Doors of Perception is an autobiographical book written by Aldous Huxley. Published in 1954, it elaborates on his psychedelic experience under the influence of mescaline in May 1953. Huxley recalls the insights he experienced, ranging from the \"purely aesthetic\" to \"sacramental vision\", and reflects on their philosophical and psychological implications. In 1956, he published \"Heaven and Hell\", another essay which elaborates these reflections further. The two works have since often been published together as one book; the titles of both come from William Blake's 1793 book \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\".\n\"The Doors of Perception\" provoked strong reactions for its evaluation of psychedelic drugs as facilitators of mystical insight with great potential benefits for science, art, and religion. While many found the argument compelling, others including German writer Thomas Mann, Vedantic monk Swami Prabhavananda, Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, and Orientalist scholar Robert Charles Zaehner countered that the effects of mescaline are subjective and should not be conflated with objective religious mysticism. Huxley himself continued to take psychedelics for the rest of his life, and the understanding he gained from them influenced his final novel \"Island\", published in 1962.\nBackground.\nWilliam Blake.\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827), who inspired the book's title and writing style, was an influential English artist most notable for his paintings and poetry. The \"doors of perception\" was originally a metaphor written by Blake in his 1790 book, \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\". The metaphor was used to represent Blake's feelings about mankind's limited perception of the reality around them:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.\nMescaline.\nMescaline is the principal active psychedelic agent of the peyote cactus, which has been used in Native American religious ceremonies for thousands of years. A German pharmacologist, Arthur Heffter, isolated the alkaloids in the peyote cactus in 1897. These included mescaline, which he showed through a combination of animal and self-experiments was the compound responsible for the psychoactive properties of the plant. In 1919, Ernst Sp\u00e4th, an Austrian chemist, synthesised the drug. Although personal accounts of taking the cactus had been written by psychologists such as Weir Mitchell in the US and Havelock Ellis in the UK during the 1890s, the German-American Heinrich Kl\u00fcver was the first to systematically study its psychological effects in a small book called \"Mescal and Mechanisms of Hallucinations\" published in 1928. The book stated that the drug could be used to research the unconscious mind.\nIn the 1930s, an American anthropologist Weston La Barre, published \"The Peyote Cult\", the first study of the ritual use of peyote as an entheogen drug amongst the Huichol people of western Mexico. La Barre noted that the Native American users of the cactus took it to obtain visions for prophecy, healing and inner strength. Most psychiatric research projects into the drug in the 1930s and early 1940s tended to look at the role of the drug in mimicking psychosis. In 1947 however, the US Navy undertook Project Chatter, which examined the potential for the drug as a truth revealing agent. In the early 1950s, when Huxley wrote his book, mescaline was still regarded as a research chemical rather than a drug and was listed in the Parke-Davis catalogue with no controls. Mescaline also played a paramount part in influencing the beat generation of poets and writers of the later 1940s to the early 1960s. Most notable, William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg\u2014all of whom were respected contemporary beat artists of their generation. Theirs and many other contemporary artists' works were heavily influenced by over-the-counter forms of mescaline during this time, due to its potency and attainability.\nHuxley had been interested in spiritual matters and had used alternative therapies for some time. In 1936 he told TS Eliot that he was starting to meditate, and he used other therapies too; the Alexander Technique and the Bates method of seeing had particular importance in guiding him through personal crises. In the late 1930s he had become interested in the spiritual teaching of Vedanta and in 1945 he published \"The Perennial Philosophy\", which set out a philosophy that he believed was found amongst mystics of all religions. He had known for some time of visionary experience achieved by taking drugs in certain religions.\nResearch by Humphry Osmond.\nHuxley had first heard of peyote use in ceremonies of the Native American Church in New Mexico, soon after coming to the United States in 1937. He first became aware of the cactus's active ingredient, mescaline, after reading an academic paper written by Humphry Osmond, a British psychiatrist working at Weyburn Mental Hospital, Saskatchewan, in early 1952. Osmond's paper set out results from his research into schizophrenia, using mescaline that he had been undertaking with colleagues, doctors Abram Hoffer and John Smythies. In the epilogue to his novel \"The Devils of Loudun,\" published earlier that year, Huxley had written that drugs were \"toxic short cuts to self-transcendence\". For the Canadian writer George Woodcock, Huxley had changed his opinion because mescaline was not addictive and appeared to be without unpleasant physical or mental side-effects. Further, he had found that hypnosis, autohypnosis and meditation had apparently failed to produce the results he wanted.\nHuxley's experience with mescaline.\nAfter reading Osmond's paper, Huxley sent him a letter on Thursday, 10 April 1952, expressing interest in the research and putting himself forward as an experimental subject. His letter explained his motivations as being rooted in an idea that the brain is a reducing valve that restricts consciousness, and hoping mescaline might help access a greater degree of awareness (an idea he later included in the book). Reflecting on his stated motivations, Woodcock wrote that Huxley had realised that the ways to enlightenment were many, including prayer and meditation. He hoped drugs might also break down the barriers of the ego, and both draw him closer to spiritual enlightenment and satisfy his quest as a seeker of knowledge.\nIn a second letter on Saturday, 19 April, Huxley invited Osmond to stay while he was visiting Los Angeles to attend the American Psychiatric Association convention. He also wrote that he looked forward to the mescaline experience and reassured Osmond that his doctor did not object to his taking it. Huxley had invited his friend, the writer Gerald Heard, to participate in the experiment; although Heard was too busy this time, he did join him for a session in November of that year.\nDay of the experiment.\nOsmond arrived at Huxley's house in West Hollywood on Sunday, 3 May 1953, and recorded his impressions of the famous author as a tolerant and kind man, although he had expected otherwise. The psychiatrist had misgivings about giving the drug to Huxley, and wrote, \"I did not relish the possibility, however remote, of being the man who drove Aldous Huxley mad,\" but instead found him an ideal subject. Huxley was \"shrewd, matter-of-fact and to the point\" and his wife Maria \"eminently sensible\". Overall, they all liked each other, which was very important when administering the drug. The mescaline was slow to take effect, but Osmond saw that after two and a half hours the drug was working and after three hours Huxley was responding well. The experience lasted eight hours and both Osmond and Maria remained with him throughout.\nThe experience started in Huxley's study before the party made a seven block trip to The Owl Drug (Rexall) store, known as World's Biggest Drugstore, at the corner of Beverly and La Cienega Boulevards. Huxley was particularly fond of the shop and the large variety of products available there (in stark contrast to the much smaller selection in English chemist's shops). There he considered a variety of paintings in art books. For one of his friends, Huxley's poor eyesight manifested in both a great desire to see and a strong interest in painting, which influenced the strong visual and artistic nature of his experience.\nAfter returning home to listen to music, eat, and walk in the garden, a friend drove the threesome to the hills overlooking the city. Photographs show Huxley standing, alternately arms on hips and outstretched with a grin on his face. Finally, they returned home and to ordinary consciousness. One of Huxley's friends who met him on the day said that despite writing about wearing flannel trousers, he was actually wearing blue jeans. Huxley admitted to having changed the fabric as Maria thought he should be better dressed for his readers. Osmond later said he had a photo of the day that showed Huxley wearing flannels.\nCompilation of the book.\nAfter Osmond's departure, Huxley and Maria left to go on a three-week, car trip around the national parks of the North West of the US. After returning to Los Angeles, he took a month to write the book. \"The Doors of Perception\" was the first book Huxley dedicated to his wife Maria. Harold Raymond, at his publisher Chatto and Windus, said of the manuscript, \"You are the most articulate guinea pig that any scientist could hope to engage.\" The title was taken from William Blake's poem \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\":\nIf the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is: Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.\nHuxley had used Blake's metaphor in \"The Doors of Perception\" while discussing the paintings of Vermeer and the Nain brothers, and previously in \"The Perennial Philosophy\", once in relation to the use of mortification as a means to remove persistent spiritual myopia and secondly to refer to the absence of separation in spiritual vision. Blake had a resounding impact on Huxley, who shared many of Blake's earlier revelations and interests in art and literature. In the early 1950s, Huxley had suffered a debilitating attack of the eye condition iritis. This increased his concern for his already poor eyesight and much of his work in the early part of the decade had featured metaphors of vision and sight.\nSynopsis.\nAfter a brief overview of research into mescaline, Huxley recounts that he was given 4/10 of a gram at 11:00\u00a0am one day in May 1953. Huxley writes that he hoped to gain insight into extraordinary states of mind and expected to see brightly coloured visionary landscapes. When he only sees lights and shapes, he puts this down to being a bad visualiser; however, he experiences a great change in his perception of the external world.\nBy 12:30\u00a0pm, a vase of flowers becomes the \"miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence\". The experience, he asserts, is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but simply \"is\". He likens it to Meister Eckhart's \"istigkeit\" or \"is-ness\", and Plato's \"Being\" but not separated from \"Becoming\". He feels he understands the Hindu concept of Satchitananda, as well as the Zen koan that, \"the dharma body of the Buddha is in the hedge\" and Buddhist suchness. In this state, Huxley explains that he did not have an \"I\", but instead a \"not-I\". Meaning and existence, pattern and colour become more significant than spatial relationships and time. Duration is replaced by a perpetual present.\nReflecting on the experience afterwards, Huxley finds himself in agreement with philosopher C. D. Broad that to enable us to live, the brain and nervous system eliminate unessential information from the totality of the 'Mind at Large'. (It was however noted in a 2023 paper that Huxley's citation of a passage from C. D. Broad's 1949 paper \"The Relevance of Psychical Research to Philosophy\" omitted two words and changed one other, thus altering the sense and accuracy of Broad's reference to the philosophy of time and memory proposed by philosopher Henri Bergson.)\nIn summary, Huxley writes that the ability to think straight is not reduced while under the influence of mescaline, visual impressions are intensified, and the human experimenter will see no reason for action because the experience is so fascinating.\nTemporarily leaving the chronological flow, he mentions that four or five hours into the experience he was taken to the World's Biggest Drug Store (WBDS), where he was presented with books on art. In one book, the dress in Botticelli's \"Judith\" provokes a reflection on drapery as a major artistic theme as it allows painters to include the abstract in representational art, to create mood, and also to represent the mystery of pure being. Huxley feels that human affairs are somewhat irrelevant whilst on mescaline and attempts to shed light on this by reflecting on paintings featuring people. C\u00e9zanne's \"Self-portrait with a straw hat\" seems incredibly pretentious, while Vermeer's human still lifes (also, the Le Nain brothers and Vuillard) are the nearest to reflecting this not-self state.\nFor Huxley, the reconciliation of these cleansed perceptions with humanity reflects the age old debate between active and contemplative life, known as the way of Martha and the way of Mary. As Huxley believes that contemplation should also include action and charity, he concludes that the experience represents contemplation at its height, but not its fullness. Correct behaviour and alertness are needed. Nonetheless, Huxley maintains that even quietistic contemplation has an ethical value, because it is concerned with negative virtues and acts to channel the transcendent into the world.\nAfter listening to Mozart's C-Minor Piano Concerto, Gesualdo's madrigals and Alban Berg's \"Lyric Suite\", Huxley heads into the garden. Outside, the garden chairs take on such an immense intensity that he fears being overwhelmed; this gives him an insight into madness. He reflects that spiritual literature, including the works of Jakob B\u00f6hme, William Law and the Tibetan Book of the Dead, talks of these pains and terrors. Huxley speculates that schizophrenia is the inability to escape from this reality into the world of common sense and thus help would be essential.\nAfter lunch and the drive to the WBDS he returns home and to his ordinary state of mind. His final insight is taken from Buddhist scripture: that within sameness there is difference, although that difference is not different from sameness.\nThe book finishes with Huxley's final reflections on the meaning of his experience. Firstly, the urge to transcend one's self is universal through times and cultures (and was characterised by H. G. Wells as The Door in the Wall). He reasons that better, healthier \"doors\" are needed than alcohol and tobacco. Mescaline has the advantage of not provoking violence in takers, but its effects last an inconveniently long time and some users can have negative reactions. Ideally, self-transcendence would be found in religion, but Huxley feels that it is unlikely that this will ever happen. Christianity and mescaline seem well-suited for each other; the Native American Church for instance uses the drug as a sacrament, where its use combines religious feeling with decorum.\nHuxley concludes that mescaline is neither divine illumination nor beatific vision, but a \"gratuitous grace\" (a term taken from Thomas Aquinas' \"Summa Theologica\"). It is not necessary but helpful, especially so for the intellectual, who can become the victim of words and symbols. Although systematic reasoning is important, direct perception has intrinsic value too. Finally, Huxley maintains that the person who has this experience will be transformed for the better.\nReception.\nThe book met with a variety of responses, both positive and negative, from writers in the fields of literature, psychiatry, philosophy and religion. These included a symposium published in \"The Saturday Review\" magazine with the unlikely title of, \"Mescalin \u2013 An Answer to Cigarettes\", including contributions from Huxley; J.S. Slotkin, a professor of anthropology; and a physician, Dr. W.C. Cutting.\nLiterature.\nFor the Scottish poet Edwin Muir, \"Mr. Huxley's experiment is extraordinary, and is beautifully described\". Thomas Mann, the author and friend of Huxley, believed the book demonstrated Huxley's escapism. He thought that while escapism found in mysticism might be honourable, drugs were not. Huxley's 'aesthetic self-indulgence' and indifference to humanity would lead to suffering or stupidity; Mann concluded the book was irresponsible, if not quite immoral, to encourage young people to try the drug mescaline.\nFor Huxley's biographer and friend, the author Sybille Bedford, the book combined sincerity with simplicity, passion with detachment. \"It reflects the heart and mind open to meet the given, ready, even longing, to accept the wonderful. \"The Doors\" is a quiet book. It is also one that postulates a goodwill \u2013 the choice once more of the nobler hypothesis. It turned out, for certain temperaments, a seductive book\". For biographer David King Dunaway, \"The Doors of Perception\", along with \"The Art of Seeing\", can be seen as the closest Huxley ever came to autobiographical writing.\nPsychiatry.\nWilliam Sargant, the controversial British psychiatrist, reviewed the book for \"The British Medical Journal\" and particularly focused on Huxley's reflections on schizophrenia. He wrote that the book brought to life the mental suffering of schizophrenics, which should make psychiatrists uneasy about their failure to relieve this. Also, he hoped that the book would encourage the investigation of the physiological, rather than psychological, aspects of psychiatry. Other medical researchers questioned the validity of Huxley's account. According to Roland Fisher, the book contained \"99 percent Aldous Huxley and only one half gram mescaline\". Joost A.M. Meerloo found Huxley's reactions \"not necessarily the same as... other people's experiences.\"\nFor Steven J. Novak, \"The Doors of Perception\" and \"Heaven and Hell\" redefined taking mescaline as a mystical experience with possible psychotherapeutic benefits, where physicians had previously thought of the drug in terms of mimicking a psychotic episode, known as psychotomimetic. The popularity of the book also affected research into these drugs, because researchers needed a random sample of subjects with no preconceptions about the drug to conduct experiments, and these became very difficult to find.\nPhilosophy and religion.\nHuxley's friend and spiritual mentor, the Vedantic monk Swami Prabhavananda, thought that mescaline was an illegitimate path to enlightenment, a \"deadly heresy\" as Christopher Isherwood put it. Other thinkers expressed similar apprehensions.\nMartin Buber.\nMartin Buber, the Jewish religious philosopher, attacked Huxley's notion that mescaline allowed a person to participate in \"common being\", and held that the drug ushered users \"merely into a strictly private sphere\". Buber believed the drug experiences to be holidays \"from the person participating in the community of logos and cosmos\u2014holidays from the very uncomfortable reminder to verify oneself as such a person.\" For Buber man must master, withstand and alter his situation, or even leave it, \"but the fugitive flight out of the claim of the situation into situationlessness is no legitimate affair of man.\"\nRobert Charles Zaehner.\nRobert Charles Zaehner, a professor at Oxford University, formed one of the fullest and earliest critiques of \"The Doors of Perception\" from a religious and philosophical perspective. In 1954, Zaehner published an article called \"The Menace of Mescaline\", in which he asserted that \"artificial interference with consciousness\" could have nothing to do with the Christian \"Beatific Vision\". Zaehner expanded on these criticisms in his book \"Mysticism Sacred and Profane\" (1957), which also acts as a theistic riposte to what he sees as the monism of Huxley's \"The Perennial Philosophy\". Although he acknowledged the importance of \"The Doors of Perception\" as a challenge to people interested in religious experience, he pointed out what he saw as inconsistencies and self-contradictions. Zaehner concludes that Huxley's apprehensions under mescaline are affected by his deep familiarity with Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism. So the experience may not be the same for others who take the drug and do not have this background, although they will undoubtedly experience a transformation of sensation. Zaehner himself was a convert to Catholicism.\nThat the longing to transcend oneself is \"one of the principal appetites of the soul\" is questioned by Zaehner. There are still people who do not feel this desire to escape themselves, and religion itself need not mean escaping from the ego. Zaehner criticises what he sees as Huxley's apparent call for all religious people to use drugs (including alcohol) as part of their practices. Quoting St Paul's proscriptions against drunkenness in church, in 1 Corinthians xi, Zaehner makes the point that artificial ecstatic states and spiritual union with God are not the same.\nHolding that there are similarities between the experience on mescaline, the mania in a manic-depressive psychosis and the visions of God of a mystical saint suggests, for Zaehner, that the saint's visions must be the same as those of a lunatic. The personality is dissipated into the world, for Huxley on mescaline and people in a manic state, which is similar to the experience of nature mystics. However, this experience is different from the theistic mystic who is absorbed into a God, who is quite different from the objective world. The appendices to \"Mysticism Sacred and Profane\" include three accounts of mescaline experiences, including those of Zaehner himself. He writes that he was transported into a world of farcical meaninglessness and that the experience was interesting and funny, but not religious.\nSoon after the publication of his book, Huxley wrote to Harold Raymond at Chatto and Windus that he thought it strange that when Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton wrote the praises of alcohol they were still considered good Christians, while anyone who suggested other routes to self-transcendence was accused of being a drug addict and perverter of mankind. Later Huxley responded to Zaehner in an article published in 1961: \"For most of those to whom the experiences have been vouchsafed, their value is self-evident. By Dr. Zaehner, the author of \"Mysticism, Sacred and Profane\", their deliberate induction is regarded as immoral. To which his colleague, Professor Price, retorts in effect, 'Speak for yourself!'\".\nHuston Smith.\nProfessor of religion and philosophy Huston Smith argued that \"Mysticism Sacred and Profane\" had not fully examined and refuted Huxley's claims made in \"The Doors of Perception\". Smith claims that consciousness-changing substances have been linked with religion both throughout history and across the world, and further it is possible that many religious perspectives had their origins in them, which were later forgotten. Acknowledging that personality, preparation and environment all play a role in the effects of the drugs, Huston Smith draws attention to evidence that suggests that a religious outcome of the experience may not be restricted to one of Huxley's temperament. Further, because Zaehner's experience was not religious, does not prove that none will be. Contrary to Zaehner, Huston Smith draws attention to evidence suggesting that these drugs can facilitate theistic mystical experience.\nAs the descriptions of naturally occurring and drug-stimulated mystical experiences cannot be distinguished phenomenologically, Huston Smith regards Zaehner's position in \"Mysticism Sacred and Profane\", as a product of the conflict between science and religion \u2013 that religion tends to ignore the findings of science. Nonetheless, although these drugs may produce a religious experience, they need not produce a religious life, unless set within a context of faith and discipline. Finally, he concludes that psychedelic drugs should not be forgotten in relation to religion because the phenomenon of religious awe, or the encounter with the holy, is declining and religion cannot survive long in its absence.\nLater experience.\nHuxley continued to take these substances several times a year until his death, but with a serious and temperate frame of mind. He refused to talk about the substances outside scientific meetings, turned down an invitation to talk about them on TV and refused the leadership of a foundation devoted to the study of psychedelics, explaining that they were only one of his diverse number of interests. For Philip Thody, a professor of French literature, Huxley's revelations made him conscious of the objections that had been put forward to his theory of mysticism set out in \"Eyeless in Gaza\" and \"Grey Eminence\", and consequently \"Island\" reveals a more humane philosophy. However, this change in perspective may lie elsewhere. In October 1955, Huxley had an experience while on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in \"The Doors of Perception\". He decided his previous experiments, the ones detailed in \"Doors\" and \"Heaven and Hell\", had been \"temptations to escape from the central reality into false, or at least imperfect and partial Nirvanas of beauty and mere knowledge.\" He wrote in a letter to Humphry Osmond, that he experienced \"the direct, total awareness, from the inside, so to say, of Love as the primary and fundamental cosmic fact. ... I was this fact; or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that this fact occupied the place where I had been.\" The experience made its way into the final chapter of \"Island\". This raised a troublesome point. Was it better to pursue a course of careful psychological experimentation... or was the real value of these drugs to \"stimulate the most basic kind of religious ecstasy\"?\nInfluence.\nA variety of influences have been claimed for the book. The psychedelic proselytiser Timothy Leary was given the book by a colleague soon after returning from Mexico where he had first taken psilocybin mushrooms in the summer of 1960. He found that \"The Doors of Perception\" corroborated what he had experienced 'and more too'. Leary soon set up a meeting with Huxley and the two became friendly. The book can also be seen as a part of the history of entheogenic model of understanding these drugs, that sees them within a spiritual context.\nThis book was the influence behind Jim Morrison naming his band The Doors in 1965.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2016 film \"Doctor Strange\", Stan Lee's character is seen reading the book, calling it, \"hilarious.\"\nPublication history.\n\"The Doors of Perception\" is usually published in a combined volume with Huxley's essay \"Heaven and Hell\" (1956)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29823", "revid": "49552034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29823", "title": "Thomas Hobbes", "text": "English philosopher (1588\u20131679)\nThomas Hobbes ( ; 5 April 1588 \u2013 4 December 1679) was an English philosopher, best known for his 1651 book \"Leviathan\", in which he expounds an influential formulation of social contract theory. He is considered to be one of the founders of modern political philosophy.\nIn his early life, overshadowed by his father's departure following a fight, he was taken under the care of his wealthy uncle. Hobbes's academic journey began in Westport, leading him to the University of Oxford, where he was exposed to classical literature and mathematics. He then graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1608. He became a tutor to the Cavendish family, which connected him to intellectual circles and initiated his extensive travels across Europe. These experiences, including meetings with figures like Galileo, shaped his intellectual development.\nAfter returning to England from France in 1637, Hobbes witnessed the destruction and brutality of the English Civil War from 1642 to 1651 between Parliamentarians and Royalists, which heavily influenced his advocacy for governance by an absolute sovereign in \"Leviathan\", as the solution to human conflict and societal breakdown. Aside from social contract theory, \"Leviathan\" also popularized ideas such as the state of nature (\"war of all against all\") and laws of nature. His other major works include the trilogy \"De Cive\" (1642), \"De Corpore\" (1655), and \"De Homine\" (1658) as well as the posthumous work \"Behemoth\" (1681).\nHobbes contributed to a diverse array of fields, including history, jurisprudence, geometry, optics, theology, classical translations, ethics, as well as philosophy in general, marking him as a polymath. Despite controversies and challenges, including accusations of atheism and contentious debates with contemporaries, Hobbes's work profoundly influenced the understanding of political structure and human nature.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nThomas Hobbes was born on 5 April 1588 (Old Style), in Westport, now part of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England. Having been born prematurely when his mother heard of the coming invasion of the Spanish Armada, Hobbes later reported that \"my mother gave birth to twins: myself and fear.\" Hobbes had a brother, Edmund, about two years older, as well as a sister, Anne.\nAlthough Thomas Hobbes's childhood is unknown to a large extent, as is his mother's name, it is known that Hobbes's father, Thomas Sr., was the vicar of both Charlton and Westport. Hobbes's father was uneducated, according to John Aubrey, Hobbes's biographer, and he \"disesteemed learning.\" Thomas Sr. was involved in a fight with the local clergy outside his church, forcing him to leave London. As a result, the family was left in the care of Thomas Sr.'s older brother, Francis, a wealthy glove manufacturer with no family of his own.\nEducation.\nHobbes was educated at Westport church from age four, went to the Malmesbury school, and then to a private school kept by a young man named Robert Latimer, a graduate of the University of Oxford. Hobbes was a good pupil, and between 1601 and 1602 he went to Magdalen Hall, the predecessor to Hertford College, Oxford, where he was taught scholastic logic and mathematics. The principal, John Wilkinson, was a Puritan and had some influence on Hobbes. Before going up to Oxford, Hobbes translated Euripides' \"Medea\" from Greek into Latin verse.\nAt university, Thomas Hobbes appears to have followed his own curriculum as he was little attracted by the scholastic learning. Leaving Oxford, Hobbes completed his B.A. degree by incorporation at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1608. He was recommended by Sir James Hussey, his master at Magdalen, as tutor to William, the son of William Cavendish, Baron of Hardwick (and later Earl of Devonshire), and began a lifelong connection with that family. William Cavendish was elevated to the peerage on his father's death in 1626, holding it for two years before his death in 1628. His son, also William, likewise became the 3rd Earl of Devonshire. Hobbes served as a tutor and secretary to both men. The 1st Earl's younger brother, Charles Cavendish, had two sons who were patrons of Hobbes. The elder son, William Cavendish, later 1st Duke of Newcastle, was a leading supporter of Charles I during the Civil War in which he personally financed an army for the king, having been governor to the Prince of Wales, Charles James, Duke of Cornwall. It was to this William Cavendish that Hobbes dedicated his \"Elements of Law\".\nHobbes became a companion to the younger William Cavendish and they both took part in a grand tour of Europe between 1610 and 1615. Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour, in contrast to the scholastic philosophy that he had learned in Oxford. In Venice, Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio, an associate of Paolo Sarpi, a Venetian scholar and statesman.\nHis scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classical Greek and Latin authors, the outcome of which was, in 1628, his edition of Thucydides' \"History of the Peloponnesian War\", the first translation of that work into English directly from a Greek manuscript. Hobbes professed a deep admiration for Thucydides, praising him as \"the most politic historiographer that ever writ,\" and one scholar has suggested that \"Hobbes' reading of Thucydides confirmed, or perhaps crystallized, the broad outlines and many of the details of [Hobbes'] own thought.\" It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as \"Horae Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses\" also represent the work of Hobbes from this period.\nAlthough he did associate with literary figures like Ben Jonson and briefly worked as Francis Bacon's amanuensis, translating several of his \"Essays\" into Latin, he did not extend his efforts into philosophy until after 1629. In June 1628, his employer Cavendish, then the Earl of Devonshire, died of the plague, and his widow, the countess Christian, dismissed Hobbes.\nIn Paris (1629\u20131637).\nHobbes soon (in 1629) found work as a tutor to Gervase Clifton, the son of Sir Gervase Clifton, 1st Baronet, and continued in this role until November 1630. He spent most of this time in Paris. Thereafter, he again found work with the Cavendish family, tutoring William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire, the eldest son of his previous pupil. Over the next seven years, as well as tutoring, he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy, awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates. He visited Galileo Galilei in Florence while he was under house arrest upon condemnation, in 1636, and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by Marin Mersenne.\nHobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum. Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in physics. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants. Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally, he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if people were not to fall back into \"brutishness and misery\". Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man, and the State.\nIn England (1637\u20131641).\nHobbes came back home from Paris, in 1637, to a country riven with discontent, which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan. However, by the end of the Short Parliament in 1640, he had written a short treatise called \"The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic\". It was not published and only circulated as a manuscript among his acquaintances. A pirated version, however, was published about ten years later. Although it seems that much of \"The Elements of Law\" was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament, there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis. Nevertheless, many (though not all) elements of Hobbes's political thought were unchanged between \"The Elements of Law\" and \"Leviathan\", which demonstrates that the events of the English Civil War had little effect on his contractarian methodology. However, the arguments in \"Leviathan\" were modified from \"The Elements of Law\" when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation: Hobbes wrote in \"The Elements of Law\" that patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the consent of the governed, while in \"Leviathan\" he argued that they were. This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbes's thoughts about the engagement controversy or of his reaction to treatises published by Patriarchalists, such as Sir Robert Filmer, between 1640 and 1651.\nWhen in November 1640 the Long Parliament succeeded the Short, Hobbes felt that he was in disfavour due to the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris. He did not return for 11 years. In Paris, he rejoined the coterie around Mersenne and wrote a critique of the \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, which was printed as third among the sets of \"Objections\" appended, with \"Replies\" from Descartes, in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two.\nHobbes also extended his own works in a way, working on the third section, \"De Cive\", which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received, and included lines of argumentation that were repeated a decade later in \"Leviathan\". He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except a short treatise on optics (\"Tractatus opticus\"), included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as \"Cogitata physico-mathematica\" in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, Gilles de Roberval and others to referee the controversy between John Pell and Longomontanus over the problem of squaring the circle.\nCivil War Period (1642\u20131651).\nThe English Civil War began in 1642, and when the royalist cause began to decline in mid-1644, many royalists came to Paris and were known to Hobbes. This revitalised Hobbes's political interests, and the \"De Cive\" was republished and more widely distributed. The printing began in 1646 by Samuel de Sorbiere through the Elsevier press in Amsterdam with a new preface and some new notes in reply to objections.\nIn 1647, Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young Charles, Prince of Wales, who had come to Paris from Jersey around July. This engagement lasted until 1648 when Charles went to Holland.\nThe company of the exiled royalists led Hobbes to produce \"Leviathan\", which set forth his theory of civil government in relation to the political crisis resulting from the war. Hobbes compared the State to a monster (leviathan) composed of men, created under pressure of human needs and dissolved by civil strife due to human passions. The work closed with a general \"Review and Conclusion\", in response to the war, which answered the question: Does a subject have the right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect is irrevocably lost?\nDuring the years of composing \"Leviathan\", Hobbes remained in or near Paris. In 1647, he suffered a near-fatal illness that disabled him for six months. On recovering, he resumed his literary task and completed it by 1650. Meanwhile, a translation of \"De Cive\" was being produced; scholars disagree about whether it was Hobbes who translated it.\nIn 1650, a pirated edition of \"The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic\" was published. It was divided into two small volumes: \"Human Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policie\"; and \"De corpore politico, or the Elements of Law, Moral and Politick\".\nIn 1651, the translation of \"De Cive\" was published under the title \"Philosophical Rudiments concerning Government and Society\". Also, the printing of the greater work proceeded, and finally appeared in mid-1651, titled \"Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common Wealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil\". It had a famous title-page engraving depicting a crowned giant above the waist towering above hills overlooking a landscape, holding a sword and a crozier and made up of tiny human figures. The work had immediate impact. Soon, Hobbes was more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time. The first effect of its publication was to sever his link with the exiled royalists, who might well have killed him. The secularist spirit of his book greatly angered both Anglicans and French Catholics. Hobbes appealed to the revolutionary English government for protection and fled back to London in winter 1651. After his submission to the Council of State, he was allowed to subside into private life in Fetter Lane.\nLater life.\nIn 1658, Hobbes published the final section of his philosophical system, completing the scheme he had planned more than 19 years before. \"De Homine\" consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision. The remainder of the treatise dealt partially with some of the topics more fully treated in the \"Human Nature\" and the \"Leviathan\". In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics, including disciplines like geometry, Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works.\nFrom the time of the Restoration, he acquired a new prominence; \"Hobbism\" became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce. The young king, Hobbes's former pupil, now Charles II, remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of \u00a3100.\nThe king was important in protecting Hobbes when, in 1666, the House of Commons introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness. That same year, on 17 October 1666, it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred \"should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy and profaneness... in particular... the book of Mr. Hobbes called the \"Leviathan\".\" Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic, and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers. At the same time, he examined the actual state of the law of heresy. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an \"Appendix\" to his \"Latin translation of Leviathan\", published in Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, Hobbes aimed to show that, since the High Court of Commission had been put down, there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the Nicene Creed, which, he maintained, \"Leviathan\" did not do.\nThe only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct. The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censor's licence for its publication in England. Other writings were not made public until after his death, including \"Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662\". For some time, Hobbes was not even allowed to respond to any attacks by his enemies. Despite this, his reputation abroad was formidable.\nHobbes spent the last four or five years of his life with his patron, William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire, at the family's Chatsworth House estate. He had been a friend of the family since 1608 when he first tutored an earlier William Cavendish. After Hobbes's death, many of his manuscripts would be found at Chatsworth House.\nHis final works were an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672, and a translation of four books of the \"Odyssey\" into \"rugged\" English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" in 1675.\nDeath.\nIn October 1679 Hobbes suffered a bladder disorder, and then a paralytic stroke, from which he died on 4 December 1679, aged 91,\nat Hardwick Hall, owned by the Cavendish family.\nHis last words were said to have been \"A great leap in the dark\", uttered in his final conscious moments. His body was interred in St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall, in Derbyshire.\nPolitical theory.\nAccording to Christopher Hill:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hobbes found official political thought dominated by the idea that government was to be obeyed because ordained of God; and he substituted the theory that the state was instituted by man for his own convenience, and that it should be obeyed because the consequences of disobedience can be demonstrated to be more disagreeable than obedience, in almost all cases. That is to say, expediency, not morality, is for Hobbes the motive for political obedience.\nHobbes, influenced by contemporary scientific ideas, had intended for his political theory to be a quasi-geometrical system, in which the conclusions followed inevitably from the premises. In his theory, the state or society cannot be secure unless at the disposal of an absolute sovereign. From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent. This particular view owes its significance to it being first developed in the 1630s when Charles I had sought to raise revenues without the consent of Parliament, and therefore of his subjects. Hobbes rejected one of the most famous theses of Aristotle's politics, namely that human beings are naturally suited to life in a polis and do not fully realize their natures until they exercise the role of citizen. It is perhaps also important to note that Hobbes extrapolated his mechanistic understanding of nature into the social and political realm, making him a progenitor of the term \"social structure\".\n\"Leviathan\".\nIn \"Leviathan\", Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality. Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.\nBeginning from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the state of nature. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a \"war of all against all\" (). The description contain one of the best-known passages in English philosophy, which describes the natural state humankind would be in, were it not for political community:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\n In such states, people fear death and lack both the things necessary to comfortable living, and the hope of being able to obtain them. So, in order to avoid it, people accede to a social contract and establish a civil society. According to Hobbes, society is a population and a sovereign authority, to whom all individuals in that society cede some right for the sake of protection. Power exercised by this authority cannot be resisted, because the protector's sovereign power derives from individuals' surrendering their own sovereign power for protection. The individuals are thereby the authors of all decisions made by the sovereign: \"he that complaineth of injury from his sovereign complaineth that whereof he himself is the author, and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himself, no nor himself of injury because to do injury to one's self is impossible\". There is no doctrine of separation of powers in Hobbes's discussion. He argues that any division of authority would lead to internal strife, jeopardizing the stability provided by an absolute sovereign. According to Hobbes, the sovereign must control civil, military, judicial and ecclesiastical powers, even the words.\nOpposition.\nJohn Bramhall.\nIn 1654 a small treatise, \"Of Liberty and Necessity\", directed at Hobbes, was published by Bishop John Bramhall. Bramhall, a strong Arminian, had met and debated with Hobbes and afterwards wrote down his views and sent them privately to be answered in this form by Hobbes. Hobbes duly replied, but not for publication. However, a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with \"an extravagantly laudatory epistle\". Bramhall countered in 1655, when he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of \"A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity\").\nIn 1656, Hobbes was ready with \"The Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance\", in which he replied \"with astonishing force\" to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes's own two pieces were important in the history of the free will controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with \"Castigations of Mr Hobbes's Animadversions\", and also included a bulky appendix entitled \"The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale\".\nJohn Wallis.\nHobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements, and assailed the system of the original universities in \"Leviathan\". He went on to publish \"De Corpore\", which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics but also an erroneous proof of the squaring of the circle. This all led mathematicians to target him for polemics and sparked John Wallis to become one of his most persistent opponents. From 1655, the publishing date of \"De Corpore\", Hobbes and Wallis continued name-calling and bickering for nearly a quarter of a century, with Hobbes failing to admit his error to the end of his life. After years of debate, the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that it has become one of the most infamous feuds in mathematical history.\nReligious views.\nThe religious opinions of Hobbes remain controversial as many positions have been attributed to him and range from atheism to orthodox Christianity. In \"The Elements of Law\", Hobbes provided a cosmological argument for the existence of God, saying that God is \"the first cause of all causes\".\nHobbes was accused of atheism by several contemporaries; Bramhall accused him of teachings that could lead to atheism. This was an important accusation, and Hobbes himself wrote, in his answer to Bramhall's \"The Catching of Leviathan\", that \"atheism, impiety, and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible\". Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations. In more recent times also, much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and J. G. A. Pocock, but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbes's unusual views on religion.\nAs Martinich has pointed out, in Hobbes's time the term \"atheist\" was often applied to people who believed in God but not in divine providence, or to people who believed in God but also maintained other beliefs that were considered to be inconsistent with such belief or judged incompatible with orthodox Christianity. He says that this \"sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the early modern period\". In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did take positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example, he argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that \"though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity\". (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following Tertullian.) Like John Locke, he also stated that true revelation can never disagree with human reason and experience, although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations for the same reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign: in order to avoid war.\nWhile in Venice on tour, Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio, a close associate of Paolo Sarpi, who had written against the pretensions of the papacy to temporal power in response to the Interdict of Pope Paul V against Venice, which refused to recognise papal prerogatives. James I had invited both men to England in 1612. Micanzio and Sarpi had argued that God willed human nature, and that human nature indicated the autonomy of the state in temporal affairs. When he returned to England in 1615, William Cavendish maintained correspondence with Micanzio and Sarpi, and Hobbes translated the latter's letters from Italian, which were circulated among the Duke's circle.\nWorks.\nComplete editions.\nMolesworth editions.\nEditions compiled by William Molesworth.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nAttribution:"}

Carl Sagan, an astronomer, proposed the planetary engineering of Venus in 1961, which is considered one of the first accounts of the concept. The term was coined by Jack Williamson in a science-fiction short story (\"Collision Orbit\") published in 1942 in \"Astounding Science Fiction\".\nEven if the environment of a planet could be altered deliberately, the feasibility of creating an unconstrained planetary environment that mimics Earth on another planet has yet to be verified. While Venus and the Moon have been studied in relation to the subject, Mars is usually considered to be the most likely candidate for terraforming. Much study has been done concerning the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and NASA has even hosted debates on the subject. Several potential methods for the terraforming of Mars may be within humanity's technological capabilities, but according to Martin Beech, the economic attitude of preferring short-term profits over long-term investments will not support a terraforming project.\nThe long timescales and practicality of terraforming are also the subject of debate. As the subject has gained traction, research has expanded to other possibilities including biological terraforming, para-terraforming, and modifying humans to better suit the environments of planets and moons. Despite this, questions still remain in areas relating to the ethics, logistics, economics, politics, and methodology of altering the environment of an extraterrestrial world, presenting issues to the implementation of the concept.\nConcept.\nThe term \"terraforming\" was coined by Jack Williamson in \u201cCollision Orbit\u201d in 1942, as a term for making the environment around people habitable. It later came to mean making planets Earth-like in the sense of \"Earth-forming\".\nThe concept gained traction when it became evident, with the first space probes going to other planets, that other planets were not habitable. Terraforming has since been envisioned as a means to \"colonize\" space or to make space relatable.\nDuring the 1980s, American geographer Richard Cathcart successfully lobbied for formal recognition of the verb \"to terraform\". The word was added to the fourth edition of the \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" in 1993.\nThe concept is contrasted by pantropy, the adaptation of humans to an alien environment rather than an environment to humans. That said pantropy has also been envisioned as a substitute when terraforming isnt complete.\nHistory of scholarly study.\nThe astronomer Carl Sagan proposed the planetary engineering of Venus in an article published in the journal \"Science\" in 1961. Sagan imagined seeding the atmosphere of Venus with algae, which would convert water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide into organic compounds. As this process removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect would be reduced until surface temperatures dropped to \"comfortable\" levels. The resulting plant matter, Sagan proposed, would be pyrolyzed by the high surface temperatures of Venus, and thus be sequestered in the form of \"graphite or some involatile form of carbon\" on the planet's surface. However, later discoveries about the conditions on Venus made this particular approach impossible. One problem is that the clouds of Venus are composed of a highly concentrated sulfuric acid solution. Even if atmospheric algae could thrive in the hostile environment of Venus's upper atmosphere, an even more insurmountable problem is that its atmosphere is simply far too thick: the high atmospheric pressure would result in a \"atmosphere of nearly pure molecular oxygen\" at high pressure. This volatile combination could not be sustained through time. Any carbon that had been reduced by photosynthesis would be quickly oxidized in this atmosphere through combustion, \"short-circuiting\" the terraforming process.\nSagan also visualized making Mars habitable for human life in an article published in the journal \"Icarus\", \"Planetary Engineering on Mars\" (1973). Three years later, NASA addressed the issue of planetary engineering officially in a study, but used the term \"planetary ecosynthesis\" instead. The study concluded that it was possible for Mars to support life and be made into a habitable planet. The first conference session on terraforming, then referred to as \"Planetary Modeling\", was organized that same year.\nIn March 1979, NASA engineer and author James Oberg organized the First Terraforming Colloquium, a special session at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. Oberg popularized the terraforming concepts discussed at the colloquium to the general public in his book \"New Earths\" (1981). Not until 1982 was the word \"terraforming\" used in the title of a published journal article. Planetologist Christopher McKay wrote \"Terraforming Mars\", a paper for the \"Journal of the British Interplanetary Society\". The paper discussed the prospects of a self-regulating Martian biosphere, and the word \"terraforming\" has since become the preferred term.\nIn 1984, James Lovelock and Michael Allaby published \"The Greening of Mars\". Lovelock's book was one of the first to describe a novel method of warming Mars, where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are added to the atmosphere to produce a strong greenhouse effect.\nMotivated by Lovelock's book, biophysicist Robert Haynes worked behind the scenes to promote terraforming, and contributed the neologism Ecopoiesis, forming the word from the Greek , \"oikos\", \"house\", and , \"poiesis\", \"production\". Ecopoiesis refers to the \"origin of an ecosystem\". In the context of space exploration, Haynes describes ecopoiesis as the \"fabrication of a sustainable ecosystem on a currently lifeless, sterile planet\". Fogg defines ecopoiesis as a type of planetary engineering and is one of the first stages of terraformation. This primary stage of ecosystem creation is usually restricted to the initial seeding of microbial life. A 2019 opinion piece by Lopez, Peixoto and Rosado has reintroduced microbiology as a necessary component of any possible colonization strategy based on the principles of microbial symbiosis and their beneficial ecosystem services. As conditions approach those of Earth, plant life could be brought in, and this will accelerate the production of oxygen, theoretically making the planet eventually able to support animal life.\nEcopoiesis potentially allows a form of co-evolution of terraforming with the target environment.\nAspects and definitions.\nIn 1985, Martyn Fogg started publishing several articles on terraforming. He also served as editor for a full issue on terraforming for the \"Journal of the British Interplanetary Society\" in 1992. In his book \"Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments\" (1995), Fogg proposed the following definitions for different aspects related to terraforming:\nFogg also devised definitions for candidate planets of varying degrees of human compatibility:\nFogg suggests that Mars was a biologically compatible planet in its youth, but is not now in any of these three categories, because it can only be terraformed with greater difficulty.\nHabitability requirements.\nPlanetary habitability, broadly defined as the capacity for an astronomical body to sustain life, requires that various geophysical, geochemical, and astrophysical criteria must be met before the surface of such a body is considered habitable. Modifying a planetary surface such that it is able to sustain life, particularly for humans, is generally the end-goal of the hypothetical process of terraforming. Of particular interest in the context of terraforming is the set of factors that have sustained complex, multicellular animals in addition to simpler organisms on Earth. Research and theory in this regard is a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology.\nClassifications of the criteria of habitability can be varied, but it is generally agreed upon that the presence of water, non-extreme temperatures, and an energy source put broad constraints on habitability. Other requirements for habitability have been defined as the presence of raw materials, a solvent, and clement conditions, or elemental requirements (such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur), and reasonable physiochemical conditions. When applied to organisms present on the earth, including humans, these constraints can substantially narrow.\nIn its astrobiology roadmap, NASA has defined the principal habitability criteria as \"extended regions of liquid water, conditions favorable for the assembly of complex organic molecules, and energy sources to sustain metabolism.\"\nTemperature.\nThe general temperature range for all life on Earth is -20\u00a0\u00b0C to 122\u00a0\u00b0C, set primarily by the ability of water (possibly saline, or under high pressure in the ocean bottom) to be available in liquid form. This may constitute a bounding range for the development of life on other planets, in the context of terraforming. For Earth, the temperature is set by the equilibrium of incident solar radiation absorbed and outgoing infrared radiation, including the effect of greenhouse gasses in modifying the planetary equilibrium temperature; terraforming concepts may include modifying temperature by methods including solar reflectors to increase or decrease the amount of solar illumination, and hence modify temperature.\nWater.\nAll known life requires water; thus the capacity for planetary body to sustain water is a critical aspect of habitability. The habitable zone of a solar system is generally defined as the region in which stable surface liquid water may be present on a planetary body. The boundaries of the habitable zone were originally defined by water loss by photolysis and hydrogen escape, setting a limit on how close a planet may be to its orbited star, and the prevalence of CO2 clouds that would increase albedo, setting an outer boundary on stable liquid water. These constraints are applicable in particular to Earth-like planets, and would not as easily apply to moons like Europa and Enceladus with ice-covered oceans, where the energy source to keep the water liquid is from tidal heating, rather than solar energy.\nEnergy.\nOn the most fundamental level, the only absolute requirement of life may be thermodynamic disequilibrium, or the presence of Gibbs free energy. It has been argued that habitability can be conceived of as a balance between life's demand for energy and the capacity for the environment to provide such energy. For humans, energy comes in the form of sugars, fats, and proteins provided by consuming plants and animals, necessitating in turn that a habitable planet for humans can sustain such organisms.\nMuch of Earth's biomass (~60%) relies on photosynthesis for an energy source, while a further ~40% is chemotropic. For the development of life on other planetary bodies, chemical energy may have been critical, while for sustaining life on another planetary body in the Solar System, sufficiently high solar energy may also be necessary for phototrophic organisms.\nElements.\nOn Earth, life generally requires six elements in high abundance: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. These elements are considered \"essential\" for all known life and plentiful within biological systems. Additional elements crucial to life include the cations Mg2+, Ca2+, K+ and Na+ and the anion Cl\u2212. Many of these elements may undergo biologically facilitated oxidation or reduction to produce usable metabolic energy.\nPreliminary stages.\nTerraforming a planet would involve making it fit the habitability requirements listed in the previous section. For example, a planet may be too cold for liquid water to exist on its surface. Its temperature could be raised by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, using orbiting mirrors to reflect more sunlight onto the planet, or lowering the albedo of the planet. Conversely, a planet too hot for liquid water could be cooled down by removing greenhouse gases (if these are present), placing a sunshade in the L1 point to reduce sunlight reaching the planet, or increasing the albedo.\nAtmospheric pressure is another issue: various celestial bodies including Mars, Mercury and most moons have lower pressure than Earth. At pressures below the triple point of water (611.7 Pa), water cannot be liquid at any temperature. Human survival requires a still-higher pressure of at least 6.3 kPa, the Armstrong limit; below this pressure, exposed body fluids boil at body temperature. Furthermore, a thick atmosphere protects the surface from cosmic rays. A thin atmosphere could be thickened using gases produced locally (e.g. the Moon could be given an atmosphere of oxygen by reducing lunar rock) or gases could be imported from elsewhere.\nOnce conditions become more suitable for life of the introduced species, the importation of microbial life could begin. As conditions approach that of Earth, plant life could also be brought in. This would accelerate the production of oxygen, which theoretically would make the planet eventually able to support animal life.\nProspective targets.\nMars.\nIn many respects, Mars is the most Earth-like planet in the Solar System. It is thought that Mars once had a more Earth-like environment early in its history, with a thicker atmosphere and abundant water that was lost over the course of hundreds of millions of years.\nThe exact mechanism of this loss is still unclear, though three mechanisms, in particular, seem likely: First, whenever surface water is present, carbon dioxide (CO2) reacts with rocks to form carbonates, thus drawing atmosphere off and binding it to the planetary surface. On Earth, this process is counteracted when plate tectonics works to cause volcanic eruptions that vent carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. On Mars, the lack of such tectonic activity worked to prevent the recycling of gases locked up in sediments.\nSecond, the lack of a magnetosphere around Mars may have allowed the solar wind to gradually erode the atmosphere. Convection within the core of Mars, which is made mostly of iron, originally generated a magnetic field. However the dynamo ceased to function long ago, and the magnetic field of Mars has largely disappeared, probably due to \"loss of core heat, solidification of most of the core, and/or changes in the mantle convection regime.\" Results from the NASA MAVEN mission show that the atmosphere is removed primarily due to coronal mass ejection events, where outbursts of high-velocity protons from the Sun impact the atmosphere. Mars does still retain a limited magnetosphere that covers approximately 40% of its surface. Rather than uniformly covering and protecting the atmosphere from solar wind, however, the magnetic field takes the form of a collection of smaller, umbrella-shaped fields, mainly clustered together around the planet's southern hemisphere.\nFinally, between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago, asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the surface environment of objects in the Solar System. The low gravity of Mars suggests that these impacts could have ejected much of the Martian atmosphere into deep space.\nTerraforming Mars would entail two major interlaced changes: building the atmosphere and heating it. A thicker atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide would trap incoming solar radiation. Because the raised temperature would add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the two processes would augment each other. Carbon dioxide alone would not suffice to sustain a temperature above the freezing point of water, so a mixture of specialized greenhouse molecules might be manufactured.\nA realistic path to radical terraforming of Mars was presented by . This would result in the creation of an atmosphere with a pressure of approximately 1000 hPa. The atmosphere would be obtained from bodies with a total mass of approximately 1019 kg (high in water and carbon dioxide) transported from the Kuiper Belt to Mars using thermonuclear rocket engines and gravity assist.\nVenus.\nTerraforming Venus requires two major changes: removing most of the planet's dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, and reducing the planet's surface temperature. These goals are closely interrelated because Venus's extreme temperature may result from the greenhouse effect caused by its dense atmosphere. \nVenus's atmosphere currently contains little oxygen, so an additional step would be to inject breathable O2 into the atmosphere. An early proposal for such a process comes from Carl Sagan, who suggested the injection of floating, photosynthetic bacteria into the Venusian atmosphere to reduce CO2 to organic form, and increase the atmospheric concentration of O2 in the atmosphere. This concept, however, was based in a flawed 1960s understanding of Venus's atmosphere as much lower pressure; in reality, the Venusian atmospheric pressure (9300 kPa) is far higher than early estimates. Sagan's idea is therefore untenable, as he later conceded.\nAn additional step noted by Martin Beech includes the injection of water and/or hydrogen into the planetary atmosphere; this step follows after sequestering CO2 and reducing the mass of the atmosphere. In order to combine hydrogen with O2 produced by other means, an estimated 4\u00d71019 kg of hydrogen is necessary; this may need to be mined from another source, such as Uranus or Neptune.\nMoon.\nAlthough the gravity on Earth's Moon is too low to hold an atmosphere for geological spans of time, if given one, it would retain it for spans of time that are long compared to human lifespans. Landis and others have thus proposed that it could be feasible to terraform the Moon, although not all agree with that proposal. Landis estimates that a 6.89 kPa atmosphere of pure oxygen on the Moon would require on the order of two hundred trillion tons of oxygen, and suggests it could be produced by reducing the oxygen from an amount of lunar rock equivalent to a cube about fifty kilometers on an edge. Alternatively, he suggests that the water content of \"fifty to a hundred comets\" the size of Halley's Comet would do the job, \"assuming that the water doesn't splash away when the comets hit the moon.\" Likewise, Benford calculates that terraforming the moon would require \"about 100 comets the size of Halley's.\"\nMercury.\nMercury would be difficult to terraform. Beech states \"There seems little prospect of terraforming Mercury such that any animals or plants might exist there,\" and suggests that its primary use in a terraforming project would be as a mining source for minerals. Nevertheless, terraforming has been considered. Mercury's magnetic field is only 1.1% that of Earth's, and, being closer to the Sun, any atmosphere would be stripped rapidly unless it can be protected from the solar wind. It is conjectured that Mercury's magnetic field should be much stronger, up to 30% of Earth's, if it weren't being suppressed by certain solar wind feedback effects. If some means of shielding Mercury from solar wind by placing an artificial magnetic shield at Mercury-Sun L1 (similar to the proposal for Mars), then Mercury's magnetic field could possibly grow in intensity to a point where Mercury's magnetic field could be self-sustaining provided the field wasn't made to \"stall\" by another solar event.\nDespite being much smaller than Mars, Mercury has an escape velocity only slightly less than that of Mars due to its higher density and could, if a magnetosphere prevents atmospheric stripping, hold a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere for millions of years.\nTo provide one atmosphere of pressure, roughly 1.1\u00d71018 kilograms of gas would be required; or a somewhat lower amount if lower pressure is acceptable. Water could be delivered from the outer Solar System. Once this water has been delivered, it would split the water into its constituent oxygen and hydrogen molecules, possibly using a photo-catalytic dust, with the hydrogen rapidly being lost to space. At an oxygen pressure of 20-30 kPa, the atmosphere would be breathable and nitrogen may be added as required to allow for plant growth in the presence of nitrates.\nTemperature management would be required, due to the equilibrium average temperature of ~159\u00b0C. However, millions of square kilometers at the poles have an average temperature of 0-50\u00b0C (\"i.e.,\" an area the size of Mexico at each pole with habitable temperatures). The total habitable area could be even larger if the planetary albedo were increased from 0.12 to ~0.6, potentially increasing the habitable area. Roy proposes that the temperature could be further managed by decreasing the solar flux at Mercury to near the terrestrial value by solar sails reflecting sunlight. He calculates that 16 to 17 million sails, each with an area of one square kilometer would be needed.\nEarth.\nIt has been recently proposed that due to the effects of climate change, an interventionist program might be designed to return Earth to pre-industrial climate parameters. In order to achieve this, multiple approaches have been proposed, such as the management of solar radiation, the sequestration of carbon dioxide, and the design and release of climate altering genetically engineered organisms. These are typically referred to as geoengineering or climate engineering, rather than terraforming.\nOther bodies in the Solar System.\nOther possible candidates for terraforming (possibly only partial or paraterraforming) include large moons of Jupiter or Saturn (Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Enceladus, Titan), and the dwarf planet Ceres.\nThe moons are covered in ice, so heating them would make some of this ice sublimate into an atmosphere of water vapour, ammonia and other gases. For Jupiter's moons, the intense radiation around Jupiter would cause radiolysis of water vapour, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen. The former would be rapidly lost to space, leaving behind the oxygen (this already occurs on the moons to a minor extent, giving them thin atmospheres of oxygen). For Saturn's moons, the water vapour could be split by using orbital mirrors to focus sunlight, causing photolysis. The ammonia could be converted to nitrogen by introducing bacteria such as \"Nitrosomonas\", \"Pseudomonas\" and \"Clostridium\", resulting in an Earth-like nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. This atmosphere would protect the surface from Jupiter's radiation, but it would also be possible to clear said radiation using orbiting tethers or radio waves.\nChallenges to terraforming the moons include their high amounts of ice and their low gravity. If all of the ice were fully melted, it would result in deep moon-spanning oceans, meaning any settlements would have to be floating (unless some of the ice was allowed to remain, to serve as land). Low gravity would cause atmospheric escape over time and may cause problems for human health. However, atmospheric escape would take place over spans of time that are long compared to human lifespans, as with the Moon.\nOne proposal for terraforming Ceres would involve heating it (using orbital mirrors, detonating thermonuclear devices or colliding small asteroids with Ceres), creating an atmosphere and deep ocean. However, this appears to be based on a misconception that Ceres' surface is icy in a similar way to the gas giant moons. In reality, Ceres' surface is \"a layer of mixed ice, silicates and light strong phases best matched by hydrated salts and clathrates\". It is unclear what the result of heating this up would be.\nOther possibilities.\nBiological terraforming.\nMany proposals for planetary engineering involve the use of genetically engineered bacteria.\nAs synthetic biology matures over the coming decades it may become possible to build designer organisms from scratch that directly manufacture desired products efficiently. Lisa Nip, Ph.D. candidate at the MIT Media Lab's Molecular Machines group, said that by synthetic biology, scientists could genetically engineer humans, plants and bacteria to create Earth-like conditions on another planet.\nGary King, microbiologist at Louisiana State University studying the most extreme organisms on Earth, notes that \"synthetic biology has given us a remarkable toolkit that can be used to manufacture new kinds of organisms specially suited for the systems we want to plan for\" and outlines the prospects for terraforming, saying \"we'll want to investigate our chosen microbes, find the genes that code for the survival and terraforming properties that we want (like radiation and drought resistance), and then use that knowledge to genetically engineer specifically Martian-designed microbes\". He sees the project's biggest bottleneck in the ability to genetically tweak and tailor the right microbes, estimating that this could take \"a decade or more\" to be solved. He also notes that it would be best to develop \"not a single kind of microbe but a suite of several that work together\".\nDARPA is researching the use of photosynthesizing plants, bacteria, and algae grown directly on the Mars surface that could warm up and thicken its atmosphere. In 2015 the agency and some of its research partners created a software called DTA GView, in which genomes of several organisms can be pulled up on the program to immediately show a list of known genes and where they are located in the genome. According to Alicia Jackson, deputy director of DARPA's Biological Technologies Office, they have developed a \"technological toolkit to transform not just hostile places here on Earth, but to go into space not just to visit, but to stay\".\nParaterraforming.\nAlso known as the \"world house\" concept, para-terraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet that encompasses most of the planet's usable area. The enclosure would consist of a transparent roof held one or more kilometers above the surface, pressurized with a breathable atmosphere, and anchored with tension towers and cables at regular intervals. The world house concept is similar to the concept of a domed habitat, but one which covers all (or most) of the planet.\nPotential targets for paraterraforming include Mercury, the Moon, Ceres and the gas giant moons.\nAdapting humans.\nIt has also been suggested that instead of or in addition to terraforming a hostile environment humans might adapt to these places by the use of genetic engineering, biotechnology and cybernetic enhancements. This is known as pantropy.\nExamples of such adjustments include the making organs fit for low gravity, increasing lung volumes for atmospheres with low oxygen levels and exoskeletons for high pressure ratios.\nIssues.\nEthical issues.\nThere is a philosophical debate within biology and ecology as to whether terraforming other worlds is an ethical endeavor. From the point of view of a cosmocentric ethic, this involves balancing the need for the preservation of human life against the intrinsic value of existing planetary ecologies. Lucianne Walkowicz has even called terraforming a \"planetary-scale strip mining operation\".\nOn the pro-terraforming side of the argument, there are those like Robert Zubrin, Martyn J. Fogg, Richard L. S. Taylor, and the late Carl Sagan who believe that it is humanity's moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for human life, as a continuation of the history of life-transforming the environments around it on Earth. They also point out that Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become extinct. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life.\nThe opposing argument posits that terraforming would be an unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may be better off without human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once it is completely certain that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, it should not try be reshaped to fit humans' own use, but rather to engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.\nEconomic issues.\nThe initial cost of such projects as planetary terraforming would be massive, and the infrastructure of such an enterprise would have to be built from scratch. Such technology has not yet been developed, let alone financially feasible at the moment. John Hickman has pointed out that almost none of the current schemes for terraforming incorporate economic strategies, and most of their models and expectations seem highly optimistic.\nIn popular culture.\nTerraforming is a common concept in science fiction, ranging from television, movies and novels to video games.\nA related concept from science fiction is xenoforming \u2013 a process in which aliens change the Earth or other planets to suit their own needs, already suggested in the classic \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898) of H.G. Wells, in its specific case of areoforming (from Ares, the Greek alternative name of Mars), Earth being its subject.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29826", "revid": "24886994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29826", "title": "Trial de novo", "text": "In law, the expression trial \"de novo\" means a \"new trial\" by a different tribunal (\"de novo\" is a Latin expression meaning \"afresh\", \"anew\", \"beginning again\", hence the literal meaning \"new trial\"). A trial \"de novo\" is usually ordered by an appellate court when the original trial failed to decide in a manner dictated by law.\nCommon law.\nIn common law systems, one feature that distinguishes a trial \"de novo\" from an appellate proceeding is that new evidence may not ordinarily be presented in an appeal (though there are rare instances when it may be allowed\u2014usually evidence that came to light only after the trial and could not, in all diligence, have been presented in the lower court). The general rule is that an appeal must be based solely on \"points of law\" and not on \"points of fact\". Appeals are frequently based on a claim that the trial judge or jury did not allow or appreciate all the facts; if that claim is successful, the appeal judges will often order a trial \"de novo\". To protect the individual's rights against double jeopardy, ordering a trial \"de novo\" is often the exclusive right of an appeal judge.\nFor example, a system may relegate a claim of a certain amount to a judge but preserve the right to a new trial before a jury.\nIn American federal courts, \"de novo\" can also refer to a standard of review for courts of appeal. Sometimes, particularly potent issues are brought before an appeals court, such as a constitutional determination made by a lower court, or summary judgment granted by a lower court. When this sort of issue is on appeal, the court of appeals will review the lower court decision \"de novo\" or from the beginning. In this process, the panel of judges for the court of appeals will review the lower court's reasoning and fact-finding from the beginning, based on the record. This is a high level of scrutiny that is more likely to result in reversal or remand of an issue.\nThis is in contrast to more relaxed standards of review, such as \"clearly erroneous\" or \"substantial evidence.\" These relaxed standards usually do not result in reversals, as the court of appeals grants more deference to the judgment of the lower courts.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the law of England and Wales, appeals to the Crown Court against convictions in a magistrates' court are held \"de novo\".\n\"De novo\" review refers to the appellate court's authority to review the trial court's conclusions on questions of the application, interpretation, and construction of law. Generally, the proper standard of review for employee benefit decisions, such as the denial of benefit claims, is \"de novo\". Also, where the appellate court undertakes judicial review of compulsory arbitration proceedings that were required by statute, the reviewing court must conduct a \"de novo\" review of the interpretation and application of the law by the arbitrators.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, some states provide for bench trials only for small claims, traffic offenses, and criminal offenses with a penalty of imprisonment of less than six months, then provide the ability to appeal a loss to the trial court of general jurisdiction for a brand-new trial. Unlike the appellate court which only examines the issues raised in the original trial, in a trial de novo a brand new trial takes place. The Supreme Court of Virginia said this in \"Santen v. Tuthill\", 265 Va. 492 (2003), about the practice of an appeal from district court \"trial de novo\" to circuit court: \"This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to 'annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.'\" Some states use a system combining aspects of traditional appeal and absolute trial \"de novo\"; for instance, in New Jersey, decisions in minor criminal and traffic cases heard in the state's municipal courts may be appealed to the Law Division, Criminal Part of the Superior Court for \"trial \"de novo\" on the record,\" in which the Law Division makes new findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the record produced in the municipal court's trial (i.e. based on the transcript of the municipal court proceeding and any physical or documentary evidence presented to the Municipal Court), but does not hold any evidentiary hearings itself.\nIt is often used in the review of \"administrative proceedings\" or the judgements of a \"small claims court\". If the determination made by a lower body is overturned, it may be renewed \"de novo\" in the review process (this is usually before it reaches the court system). Sometimes administrative decisions may be reviewed by the courts on a \"de novo\" basis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Additionally, the term can refer to a physical television set rather than the medium of transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports. The medium is capable of more than \"radio broadcasting\", which refers to an audio signal sent to radio receivers.\nTelevision became available in crude experimental forms in the 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries.\nThe availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material\u2014such as movies\u2014at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video-on-demand service by Netflix). At the beginning of the 2010s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer and Hulu.\nIn 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of earlier cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), OLED displays, and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most television sets sold in the 2000s were still CRT, and it was only in early 2010s that flat-screen TVs decisively overtook CRT. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, Digital Light Processing (DLP), plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are being gradually replaced by OLEDs. Also, major manufacturers have started increasingly producing smart TVs in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.\nTelevision signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency television transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively, television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems, and, since the 2000s, via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television was expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set consists of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device that lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.\nThe television broadcasts are mainly a simplex broadcast meaning that the transmitter cannot receive and the receiver cannot transmit.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"television\" comes from grc \" \"\u03c4\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5\" (tele)\"\u00a0'far' and lat \" visio\"\u00a0'sight'. The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist Constantin Perskyi used it in a paper that he presented in French at the first International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the International World Fair in Paris.\nThe anglicized version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still \"...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over telegraph or telephone wires\". It was \"...formed in English or borrowed from French .\" In the 19th century and early 20th century, other \"...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904).\"\nThe abbreviation \"TV\" is from 1948. The use of the term to mean \"a television set\" dates from 1941. The use of the term to mean \"television as a medium\" dates from 1927.\nThe term \"telly\" is more common in the UK. The slang term \"the tube\" derives from the bulky cathode-ray tube used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs. Another slang term for the TV is \"idiot box.\"\nHistory.\nMechanical.\nFacsimile transmission systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851. Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884 in Berlin. This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk \"image rasterizer\" became exceedingly common. Constantin Perskyi had coined the word \"television\" in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on 24 August 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others. However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn, among others, made the design practical.\nThe first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina. In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light, and a series of differently angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted \"several times\" each second.\nIn 1911 Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, \"very crude images\" over wires to the \"Braun tube\" (cathode-ray tube or \"CRT\") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: \"the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy\".\nIn 1921 \u00c9douard Belin sent the first image via radio waves with his belinograph.\nBy the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird employed the Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion at Selfridges's department store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named \"Stooky Bill\", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he had demonstrated before members of the Royal Institution the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the world's first true public television demonstration, exhibiting light, shade, and detail. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A brightly illuminated subject was placed in front of a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses that swept images across a static photocell. The thallium sulfide (thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the U.S., detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow. Baird's original 'televisor' now resides in the Science Museum, South Kensington.\nIn 1928 Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal between London and New York and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Path\u00e9 established France's first television company, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision-Baird-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast of The Derby. In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on BBC telecasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead, a 17.5 mm film was shot, rapidly developed, and then scanned while the film was still wet. \nA US inventor, Charles Francis Jenkins, also pioneered the television. He published an article on \"Motion Pictures by Wireless\" in 1913, transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses in December 1923, and on 13 June 1925, publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used the Nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion over a distance of 5 miles (8\u00a0km), from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution. He was granted U.S. Patent No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).\nHerbert E. Ives and Frank Gray of Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen (5 by 6\u00a0cm). The large receiver had a screen 24\u00a0inches wide by 30\u00a0inches high (60 by 75\u00a0cm). Both sets could reproduce reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. A flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds, respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \"It was, in fact, the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\"\nIn 1928 WRGB, then W2XB, was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady, NY. It was popularly known as \"WGY Television.\" Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Leon Theremin had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines, and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted and then projected near-simultaneous moving images on a screen.\nBy 1927 Theremin had achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines.\nOn 25 December 1926 Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus. His research in creating a production model was halted by the SCAP after World War II.\nBecause only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935 and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal. The advancement of all-electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode-ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the start of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical telecasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a lot of public universities in the United States.\nElectronic.\nIn 1897 English physicist J. J. Thomson was able, in his three well-known experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern cathode-ray tube (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the \"Braun\" tube. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube, with a phosphor-coated screen. Braun was the first to conceive the use of a CRT as a display device. The \"Braun tube\" became the foundation of 20th century television. In 1906 the Germans Max Dieckmann and Gustav Glage produced raster images for the first time in a CRT. In 1907, Russian scientist Boris Rosing used a CRT in the receiving end of an experimental video signal to form a picture. He managed to display simple geometric shapes onto the screen.\nIn 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, a fellow of the Royal Society (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal \"Nature\" in which he described how \"distant electric vision\" could be achieved by using a cathode-ray tube, or Braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device, he expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in \"The Times\" and the Journal of the R\u00f6ntgen Society. In a letter to \"Nature\" published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some \"not very successful experiments\" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died, but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937, by H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and by H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams successfully transmitted \"very faint\" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode-ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel. The first cathode-ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.\nIn 1926 Hungarian engineer K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tihanyi designed a television system using fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing the principle of \"charge storage\" within the scanning (or \"camera\") tube. The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or \"camera\" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tihanyi beginning in 1924. His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (\"photoelectrons\") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he called \"Radioskop\". After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930, so he applied for patents in the United States. Although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of RCA's \"iconoscope\" in 1931, the U.S. patent for Tihanyi's transmitting tube would not be granted until May 1939. The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October. Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval. Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day. On 25 December 1926, at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan, Japanese inventor Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a TV system with a 40-line resolution that employed a CRT display. This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver and Takayanagi's team later made improvements to this system parallel to other television developments. Takayanagi did not apply for a patent.\nIn the 1930s Allen B. DuMont made the first CRTs to last 1,000 hours of use, one of the factors that led to the widespread adoption of television.\nOn 7 September 1927 US inventor Philo Farnsworth's image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By 3 September 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was improved further by eliminating a motor generator so that his television system had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (\"Pem\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).\nMeanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin also experimented with the cathode-ray tube to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. However, in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. However, RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus, based on Zworykin's 1923 patent application, RCA filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system could not produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application. He also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and being determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1\u00a0million over ten years, in addition to license payments, to use his patents.\nIn 1933 RCA introduced an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle. Called the \"Iconoscope\" by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was claimed to be much more sensitive than Farnsworth's image dissector. However, Farnsworth had overcome his power issues with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique \"Multipactor\" device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. Unfortunately, an issue with the multipactor was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.\nAt the Berlin Radio Show in August 1931 in Berlin, Manfred von Ardenne gave a public demonstration of a television system using a CRT for both transmission and reception, the first completely electronic television transmission. However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film. Ardenne achieved his first transmission of television pictures on 24 December 1933, followed by test runs for a public television service in 1934. The world's first electronically scanned television service then started in Berlin in 1935, the Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow, culminating in the live broadcast of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games from Berlin to public places all over Germany.\nPhilo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on 25 August 1934 and for ten days afterward. Mexican inventor Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena also played an important role in early television. His experiments with television (known as telectroescop\u00eda at first) began in 1931 and led to a patent for the \"trichromatic field sequential system\" color television in 1940. In Britain, the EMI engineering team led by Isaac Shoenberg applied in 1932 for a patent for a new device they called \"the Emitron\", which formed the heart of the cameras they designed for the BBC. On 2 November 1936, a 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the Victorian building's towers. It alternated briefly with Baird's mechanical system in adjoining studios but was more reliable and visibly superior. This was the world's first regular \"high-definition\" television service.\nThe original US iconoscope was noisy, had a high ratio of interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially compared to the high-definition mechanical scanning systems that became available. The EMI team, under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg, analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produced an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes, and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch on a television set as the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph. This was the first time that anyone had broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighboring buildings because neither Farnsworth nor RCA would do the same until the 1939 New York World's Fair.\nOn the other hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken. The \"image iconoscope\" (\"Superikonoskop\" in Germany) was produced as a result of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their \"Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerr\u00f6hre f\u00fcr Fernseher\" (\"Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television\") in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it represented the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955; finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.\nU.S. television broadcasting, at the time, consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941. RCA, for example, used only Iconoscopes in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco. In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents. With this historic agreement in place, RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems. In 1941, the United States implemented 525-line television. Electrical engineer Benjamin Adler played a prominent role in the development of television.\nThe world's first 625-line television standard was designed in the Soviet Union in 1944 and became a national standard in 1946. The first broadcast in 625-line standard occurred in Moscow in 1948. The concept of 625 lines per frame was subsequently implemented in the European CCIR standard. In 1936, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tihanyi described the principle of plasma display, the first flat-panel display system.\nEarly electronic television sets were large and bulky, with analog circuits made of vacuum tubes. Following the invention of the first working transistor at Bell Labs, Sony founder Masaru Ibuka predicted in 1952 that the transition to electronic circuits made of transistors would lead to smaller and more portable television sets. The first fully transistorized, portable solid-state television set was the 8-inch Sony TV8-301, developed in 1959 and released in 1960. This began the transformation of television viewership from a communal viewing experience to a solitary viewing experience. By 1960, Sony had sold over 4million portable television sets worldwide.\nColor.\nThe basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning. Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end and could not have worked as he described it. Another inventor, Hovannes Adamian, also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him, and was patented in Germany on 31 March 1908, patent No. 197183, then in Britain, on 1 April 1908, patent No. 7219, in France (patent No. 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent No. 17912).\nScottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color, and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London's Dominion Theatre. Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full-color image.\nThe first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940, he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very \"deep\" but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console. However, Baird was unhappy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.\nIn 1939, Hungarian engineer Peter Carl Goldmark introduced an electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode-ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on 29 August 1940 and shown to the press on 4 September.\nCBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 August 1940 and live cameras by 12 November. NBC (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on 20 February 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941. These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.\nAs early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called Telechrome. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued, and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended the development of the Telechrome system. Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.\nOne of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and significantly reduced the resolution of the color information to conserve bandwidth. As black-and-white televisions could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] \"compatible\". (\"Compatible Color\", featured in RCA advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song \"America\", of \"West Side Story\", 1957.) The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution. In contrast, color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher-resolution black-and-white and lower-resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a significant technical achievement.\nThe first color broadcast (the first episode of the live program \"The Marriage\") occurred on 8 July 1954. However, during the following ten years, most network broadcasts and nearly all local programming continued to be black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965, in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\nEarly color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. GE's relatively compact and lightweight Porta-Color set was introduced in the spring of 1966. It used a transistor-based UHF tuner. The first fully transistorized color television in the United States was the Quasar television introduced in 1967. These developments made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition.\nIn 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point, many of the technical issues in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color. By the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s, even these last holdout niche B&amp;W environments had inevitably shifted to color sets.\nDigital.\nDigital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the analog and channel-separated signals used by analog television. Due to data compression, digital television can support more than one program on the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that represents the most significant evolution in television broadcast technology since color television emerged in the 1950s. Digital television's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital television became possible. Digital television was previously not practically possible due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed digital video, requiring around 200Mbit/s for a standard-definition television (SDTV) signal, and over 1Gbit/s for high-definition television (HDTV).\nA digital television service was proposed in 1986 by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication (MPT) in Japan, where there were plans to develop an \"Integrated Network System\" service. However, it was not possible to implement such a digital television service practically until the adoption of DCT video compression technology made it possible in the early 1990s.\nIn the mid-1980s, as Japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with the development of HDTV technology, the MUSE analog format proposed by NHK, a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 other technical concepts under consideration. Then, a U.S. company, General Instrument, demonstrated the possibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally-based standard could be developed.\nIn March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was possible, the FCC made several critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images. (7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \"simulcast\" on different channels. (8) The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.\nThe last standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes\u2014interlaced or progressive\u2014would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices. Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analog CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Interlaced scanning can be regarded as the first video compression model. It was partly developed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of television broadcast bandwidth. Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens, whose phosphor-coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration. However, interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as liquid-crystal display (LCD), for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.\nProgressive scanning, the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning, in effect, doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second instead of two passes in 1/30-second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. William F. Schreiber, who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.\nDigital television transition started in the late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by the 2010s. Initially, the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped television sets were costly. However, as the price of digital-capable television sets dropped, more and more households started converting to digital television sets. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by the mid to late 2010s.\nSmart television.\nThe advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart television sets. A smart television sometimes referred to as a \"connected TV\" or \"hybrid TV\", is a television set or set-top box with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 features and is an example of technological convergence between computers, television sets, and set-top boxes. Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional Broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access. These TVs come pre-loaded with an operating system.\nSmart TV is not to be confused with Internet TV, Internet Protocol television (IPTV), or with Web TV. Internet television refers to receiving television content over the Internet instead of through traditional systems\u2014terrestrial, cable, and satellite. IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for television networks. Web television (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV. A first patent was filed in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an \"intelligent\" television system, linked with data processing systems, using a digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines according to a user's demand and process their needs. Major TV manufacturers announced the production of smart TVs only for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015. Smart TVs have gotten more affordable compared to when they were first introduced, with 46 million U.S. households having at least one as of 2019.\n3D.\n3D television conveys depth perception to the viewer by employing techniques such as stereoscopic display, multi-view display, 2D-plus-depth, or any other form of 3D display. Most modern 3D television sets use an active shutter 3D system or a polarized 3D system, and some are autostereoscopic without the need for glasses. Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London. Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D television was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D television sets. Although 3D television sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media, such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public. As a result, many 3D television channels that started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s. According to DisplaySearch 3D television shipments totaled 41.45\u00a0million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010. As of late 2013, the number of 3D TV viewers started to decline.\nBroadcast systems.\nTerrestrial television.\nProgramming is broadcast by television stations, sometimes called \"channels\", as stations are licensed by their governments to broadcast only over assigned channels in the television band. At first, terrestrial broadcasting was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because bandwidth was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of channels available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941 but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which had public service as part of its Royal Charter.\nWRGB claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady, NY, under the call letters W2XB. It was popularly known as \"WGY Television\" after its sister radio station. Later, in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters W2XBS and which today is known as WNBC. The two stations were experimental and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a Felix the Cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as engineers tested new technology. On 2 November 1936, the BBC began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian Alexandra Palace in north London. It therefore claims to be the birthplace of television broadcasting as we now know it.\nWith the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna. A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternative to cable television (CATV) for cord cutters. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.\nCable television.\nCable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is sometimes used for cable television in the United States. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.\nSatellite television.\nSatellite television is a system of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna, usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a television set. Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.\nThe most common method of reception is direct-broadcast satellite television (DBSTV), also known as \"direct to home\" (DTH). In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the Ku wavelength and are completely digital. Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television receive-only. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C-band spectrum from FSS type satellites and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed \"big dish\" systems and were more expensive and less popular.\nThe direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. Digital signals may include high-definition television (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are free-to-air or free-to-view, while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription.\nIn 1945, British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed a worldwide communications system that would function by means of three satellites equally spaced apart in Earth orbit. This was published in the October 1945 issue of the \"Wireless World\" magazine and won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1963.\nThe first satellite television signals from Europe to North America were relayed via the Telstar satellite over the Atlantic Ocean on 23 July 1962. The signals were received and broadcast in North American and European countries and watched by over 100 million. Launched in 1962, the \"Relay 1\" satellite was the first satellite to transmit television signals from the US to Japan. The first geosynchronous communication satellite, Syncom 2, was launched on 26 July 1963.\nThe world's first commercial communications satellite, called Intelsat I and nicknamed \"Early Bird\", was launched into geosynchronous orbit on 6 April 1965. The first national network of television satellites, called Orbita, was created by the Soviet Union in October 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to ground downlink stations. The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972. ATS-6, the world's first experimental educational and Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), was launched on 30 May 1974. It transmitted at 860\u00a0MHz using wideband FM modulation and had two sound channels. The transmissions were focused on the Indian subcontinent, but experimenters were able to receive the signal in Western Europe using home-constructed equipment that drew on UHF television design techniques already in use.\nThe first in a series of Soviet geostationary satellites to carry Direct-To-Home television, Ekran 1, was launched on 26 October 1976. It used a 714\u00a0MHz UHF downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing UHF television technology rather than microwave technology.\nInternet television.\nInternet television (Internet TV) (or online television) is the digital distribution of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the Internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television series and other video content over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not be confused with Smart TV, IPTV, or with Web TV. Smart television refers to the television set which has a built-in operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television networks. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet television.\nTraditional cable and satellite television providers began to offer services such as Sling TV, owned by Dish Network, which was unveiled in January 2015. DirecTV, another satellite television provider, launched their own streaming service, DirecTV Stream, in 2016. Sky launched a similar streaming service in the UK called Now. In 2013, Video on demand website Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original streaming television at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its series, \"House of Cards\", \"Arrested Development\", and \"Hemlock Grove\", earned nominations that year. On July 13, 2015, cable company Comcast announced an HBO plus broadcast TV package at a price discounted from basic broadband plus basic cable.\nIn 2017, YouTube launched YouTube TV, a streaming service that allows users to watch live television programs from popular cable or network channels and record shows to stream anywhere, anytime. As of 2017, 28% of US adults cite streaming services as their main means for watching television, and 61% of those ages 18 to 29 cite it as their main method. As of 2018, Netflix is the world's largest streaming TV network and also the world's largest Internet media and entertainment company with 117 million paid subscribers, and by revenue and market cap. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact in the television streaming business with the lifestyle changes such as staying at home and lockdowns.\nSets.\nA television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or \"telly\", is a device that combines a tuner, display, amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode-ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax and VHS, which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies. In the subsequent decades, Television sets were used to watch DVDs and Blu-ray Discs of movies and other content. Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. Televisions since 2010s mostly use LEDs. LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs in the near future.\nDisplay technologies.\nDisk.\nThe earliest systems employed a spinning disk to create and reproduce images. These usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.\nCRT.\nThe cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns (a source of electrons or electron emitter) and a fluorescent screen used to view images. It has the means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope that is large, deep (i.e., long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.\nIn television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by \"magnetic deflection\", a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument.\nDLP.\nDigital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of video projector technology that uses a digital micromirror device. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP-based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the invention of the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications, from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications, including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and businesses primarily) but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection.\nPlasma.\nA plasma display panel (PDP) is a type of flat-panel display common to large television displays or larger. They are called \"plasma\" displays because the technology uses small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases, or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps.\nLCD.\nLiquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TVs) are television sets that use liquid-crystal display technology to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than cathode-ray tube (CRTs) of similar display size and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCDs come in two types: those using cold cathode fluorescent lamps, simply called LCDs, and those using LED as backlight called LEDs.\nIn 2007, LCD television sets surpassed sales of CRT-based television sets worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD television sets have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the Plasma display panel and rear-projection television. In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type. LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including OLEDs, FED and SED, but as of 2014[ [update]] none of these have entered widespread production.\nOLED.\nAn OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens. It is also used for computer monitors and portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game console, and PDAs.\nThere are two main groups of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either passive-matrix (PMOLED) or active-matrix (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.\nAn OLED display works without a backlight. Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room, an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight. OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in the near future.\nDisplay resolution.\nLD.\nLow-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such 240p (320*240). It is used in handheld television. The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution video files could overwhelm computer servers and take too long to download. Many mobile phones and portable devices such as Apple's iPod Nano, or Sony's PlayStation Portable use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens (320\u00d7240 and 480\u00d7272 pixels respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos has LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of iPod Touch and iPhone (480\u00d7320). For the first years of its existence, YouTube offered only one low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer-grade videotape can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 \u00d7 480i/576i).\nSD.\nStandard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: 576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed PAL and SECAM systems, and 480i based on the American National Television System Committee NTSC system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either high-definition television (720p, 1080i, 1080p, 1440p, 4K UHDTV, and 8K UHD) or enhanced-definition television (EDTV 480p). In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same aspect ratio as NTSC signals, with widescreen content being center cut. However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a aspect ratio, with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the United States as 4:3, with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a pillarboxed image.\nHD.\nHigh-definition television (HDTV) provides a resolution that is substantially higher than that of standard-definition television.\nHDTV may be transmitted in various formats:\nUHD.\nUltra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or UHD) includes 4K UHD (2160p) and 8K UHD (4320p), which are two digital video formats proposed by NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories and defined and approved by the International Telecommunication Union. The Consumer Electronics Association announced on 17 October 2012 that \"Ultra High Definition\", or \"Ultra HD\", would be used for displays that have an aspect ratio of at least 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting natural video at a minimum resolution of 3840\u00d72160 pixels.\nMarket share.\nNorth American consumers purchase a new television set on average every seven years, and the average household owns 2.8 televisions. In 2011, 48 million were being sold each year at an average price of US$460 () and size of .\nContent.\nProgramming.\nGetting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many other ways. After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:\nFirst-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside of the United States, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic free-to-air (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the United States, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, affiliates rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not focused on local programming.\nGenres.\nTelevision genres include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas. Other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.\nPop culture entertainment includes action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thrillers. There are other variants of the drama genre, such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas. Sci-fi series can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or adventure. Comedy is a popular genre that includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated series for the adult demographic, such as Comedy Central's \"South Park\".\nThe least expensive forms of entertainment programming are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music, and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or Master of Ceremonies. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows, as talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. Reality television series feature \"regular\" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (\"COPS\") to significant weight loss (\"The Biggest Loser\"). A derived version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (\"The Osbournes\") or doing regular jobs (\"The Simple Life\").\nFictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are \"quality television\", include series such as \"Twin Peaks\" and \"The Sopranos\". Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in art films, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. \nNonfiction television programs that scholars argue are \"quality television\" include news broadcasting and a range of serious, noncommercial programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.\nFunding.\nAround the world, broadcast television is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription television channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free-to-air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2\u00a0million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9\u00a0billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008). North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%). Globally, the different TV revenue sources are divided into 45\u201350% TV advertising revenues, 40\u201345% subscription fees, and 10% public funding.\nAdvertising.\nTelevision's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many television networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers (\"sponsors\") to fund their programming. Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial, or ad in American English, and known in British English as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length infomercials). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services, and ideas since the beginning of television.\nThe effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of discourse by philosophers, including Marshall McLuhan. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as Nielsen Media Research, is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement and, consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a \"daypart\"). In many countries, including the United States, television campaign advertisements is considered indispensable for a political campaign. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted, while some countries, such as Norway, completely ban political advertisements.\nThe first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941, over New York station WNBT (now WNBC) before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The announcement for Bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute. The first TV ad broadcast in the U.K. was on ITV on 22 September 1955, advertising Gibbs SR toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on Nippon Television in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising Seikosha (now Seiko), which also displayed a clock with the current time.\nUnited States.\nSince inception in the US in 1941, television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative control to the advertisers over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the quiz show scandals in the 1950s, networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with other advertisers.\nU.S. advertising rates are determined primarily by Nielsen ratings. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular singing competition \"American Idol\", while the same amount of time for the Super Bowl can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed time slots, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of infomercials at far lower rates. In recent years, paid programs or infomercials have become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some drug companies and other businesses have even created \"news\" items for broadcast, known in the industry as video news releases, paying program directors to use them.\nSome television programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films and known as product placement. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular chain restaurant, or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a product placement). Sometimes, a specific brand or trade mark, or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, Roy Thomson, likened the broadcasting license as being a \"license to print money\". Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the U.S. have unnatural pauses where the British company does not use the narrative breaks intended for more frequent U.S. advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs that last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious broadcasting service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The BBC, being strictly non-commercial, is not allowed to show adverts on television in the U.K., though it has advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from television license fees (see below) and broadcast syndication, the sale of content to other broadcasters.\nIreland.\nBroadcast advertising is regulated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.\nSubscription.\nSome TV channels are partly funded from subscriptions; therefore, the signals are encrypted during the broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch pay television or specialty channels. Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.\nTaxation or license.\nTelevision services in some countries may be funded by a television licence or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation's TV service carries no television advertising on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television license paid by the occupiers of premises receiving live telecasts. As of 2012[ [update]] it was estimated that approximately 26.8\u00a0million UK private domestic households owned televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010. This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government. As of 2009[ [update]] two main BBC TV channels were watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall had 27% share of total viewing, despite the fact that 85% of homes were multi-channel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free-to-air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via Freeview. As of June 2021[ [update]] the licence that funds the advertising-free BBC TV channels cost \u00a3159 for a colour TV Licence and \u00a353.50 for a black and white TV Licence (free or reduced for some groups).\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation's television services in Australia carry no advertising by external sources; it is banned under the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983\", which also ensures its editorial independence. The ABC receives most of its funding from the Australian Government (some revenue is received from its Commercial division), but it has suffered progressive funding cuts under Liberal governments since the 1996 Howard government, with particularly deep cuts in 2014 under the Turnbull government, and an ongoing indexation freeze as of 2021[ [update]]. The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs, although ABC Australia, which broadcasts throughout the Asia-Pacific region, receives additional funds through DFAT and some advertising on the channel.\nIn France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax (\"la redevance audiovisuelle\").\nIn Japan, NHK is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as ). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well as a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.\nBroadcast programming.\nBroadcast programming, or TV listings in the United Kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of TV programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters' programs.\nSocial aspects.\nTelevision has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as media violence. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation. Several studies have found that educational television has many advantages. The article \"The Good Things about Television\" argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely. With respect to faith, many Christian denominations use television for religious broadcasting.\nReligious opposition.\nMethodist denominations in the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and the Evangelical Wesleyan Church, eschew the use of the television. Some Baptists, such as those affiliated with Pensacola Christian College, also eschew television. Many Traditional Catholic congregations such as the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), as with Laestadian Lutherans, and Conservative Anabaptists such as the Dunkard Brethren Church and the Bruderhof, oppose the presence of television in the household, teaching that it is an occasion of sin.\nNegative impacts.\nChildren, especially those aged five or younger, are at risk of injury from falling televisions. A CRT-style television that falls on a child will, because of its weight, hit with the equivalent force of falling multiple stories from a building. Newer flat-screen televisions are \"top-heavy and have narrow bases\", which means that a small child can easily pull one over. As of 2015[ [update]], TV tip-overs were responsible for more than 10,000 injuries per year to children in the United States, at a cost of more than US$million per year (equivalent to US$million per year in 2024) in emergency care.\nA 2017 study in \"The Journal of Human Resources\" found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. The article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.\nWith high lead content in CRTs and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which (LCDs) use lamps which contain mercury, there is growing concern about electronic waste from discarded televisions. Related occupational health concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing electrical energy requirements.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29833", "revid": "3022076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29833", "title": "Americas", "text": "Landmass comprising North and South America\nThe Americas, sometimes collectively called America, are a landmass comprising the totality of North America and South America. When viewed as a single continent, the Americas are the 2nd largest continent by area after Asia and the 3rd largest continent by population. The Americas make up most of the land in Earth's Western Hemisphere and constitute the New World.\nAlong with their associated islands, the Americas cover 8% of Earth's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area. The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera, a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast. The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins, such as the Amazon, St. Lawrence River\u2013Great Lakes, Mississippi, and La Plata basins. Since the Americas extend from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska, to the tropical rainforests in Central America and South America.\nHumans first settled the Americas from Asia between 20,000 and 16,000 years ago. A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia. The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic c.\u20093500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson. However, the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned. The Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1504 resulted in permanent contact with European (and subsequently, other Old World) powers, which eventually led to the Columbian exchange and inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization whose effects and consequences persist to the present.\nThe Spanish presence involved the enslavement of large numbers of the indigenous population of the Americas. Diseases introduced from Europe and West Africa devastated the indigenous peoples, and the European powers colonized the Americas. Mass emigration from Europe, including large numbers of indentured servants, and importation of African slaves largely replaced the indigenous peoples in much of the Americas. Decolonization of the Americas began with the American Revolution in the 1770s and largely ended with the Spanish\u2013American War in the late 1890s. Currently, almost all of the population of the Americas resides in independent countries; however, the legacy of the colonization and settlement by Europeans is that the Americas share many common cultural traits, most notably Christianity and the use of West European languages: primarily Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and, to a lesser extent, Dutch.\nThe Americas are home to more than a billion inhabitants, two-thirds of whom reside in the United States, Brazil, and Mexico. It is home to eight megacities (metropolitan areas with 10\u00a0million inhabitants or more): Greater Mexico City (21.2\u00a0million), S\u00e3o Paulo (21.2\u00a0million), New York City (19.7\u00a0million), Los Angeles (18.8\u00a0million), Buenos Aires (15.6\u00a0million), Rio de Janeiro (13.0\u00a0million), Bogot\u00e1 (10.4\u00a0million), and Lima (10.1\u00a0million).\nEtymology and naming.\nThe name \"America\" was first recorded in 1507. A world map created by Martin Waldseem\u00fcller was the earliest recorded use of the term. The name was also used (together with the related term \"Amerigen\") in the \"Cosmographiae Introductio\", apparently written by Matthias Ringmann, in reference to South America. It was applied to both North and South America by Gerardus Mercator in 1538. \"America\" derives from , the Latin version of the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci's first name.\nThe feminine form \"America\" was originally used to refer to the newly discovered continent, which is why it was accorded with the feminine names of the other continents: Asia, Africa, and Europa.\nSince the 1950s, however, North America and South America have generally been considered by English speakers as separate continents, and taken together are called \"the Americas\", or more rarely \"America\". When conceived as a unitary continent, the form is generally \"the continent of America\" in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular \"America\" in English commonly refers to the United States of America.\nTerminology.\nHistory.\nThe region was initially termed America or New India on the Mercator maps.\nEnglish.\nSpeakers of English generally refer to the landmasses of North America and South America as \"the Americas\", the \"Western Hemisphere\", or the \"New World\". The adjective \"American\" may be used to indicate something pertaining to the Americas, but this term is primarily used in English to indicate something pertaining to the United States. Some non-ambiguous alternatives exist, such as the adjective \"Pan-American\", or \"New Worlder\" as a demonym for a resident of the closely related New World. Use of \"America\" in the hemispherical sense is sometimes retained, or can occur when translated from other languages. For example, the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) in Paris maintains a single continental association for \"America\", represented by one of the five Olympic rings.\nAmerican essayist H. L. Mencken said, \"The Latin-Americans use Norteamericano in formal writing, but, save in Panama, prefer nicknames in colloquial speech.\" To avoid \"American\" one can use constructed terms in their languages derived from \"United States\" or even \"North America\". In Canada, its southern neighbor is often referred to as \"the United States\", \"the U.S.A.\", or (informally) \"the States\", while U.S. citizens are generally referred to as \"Americans\". Most Canadians resent being referred to as \"Americans\".\nSpanish.\nIn Spanish, \"Am\u00e9rica\" is a single continent composed of the subcontinents of \"Am\u00e9rica del Sur\" and \"Am\u00e9rica del Norte\", the land bridge of \"Am\u00e9rica Central\", and the islands of the \"Antillas\". \"Americano\" or \"americana\" in Spanish refers to a person from \"Am\u00e9rica\" in a similar way that in which \"europeo\" or \"europea\" refers to a person from \"Europa\". The terms \"sudamericano/a\", \"centroamericano/a\", \"antillano/a\" and \"norteamericano/a\" can be used to more specifically refer to the location where a person may live.\nCitizens of the United States of America are normally referred to by the term \"estadounidense\" (rough literal translation: \"United Statesian\") instead of \"americano\" or \"americana\" which is discouraged, and the country's name itself is officially translated as \"Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica\" (United States of America), commonly abbreviated as \"Estados Unidos\" (EEUU). Also, the term \"norteamericano\" (North American) may refer to a citizen of the United States, though in formal writing it is less common since it is used for the inhabitants of North America.\nPortuguese.\nIn Portuguese, \"\" is a single continent composed of \"Am\u00e9rica do Sul\" (South America), \"Am\u00e9rica Central\" (Central America) and \"Am\u00e9rica do Norte\" (North America). It can be ambiguous, as \"Am\u00e9rica\" can be used to refer to the United States of America, but is avoided in print and formal environments. The demonym 'American' (americano) is commonly used in Portuguese to refer to people from the United States, although the terms 'norte-americano', 'estadounidense' or 'estadunidense' also formally exist and are preferred by those who wish to distinguish it from the continental demonym.\nFrench.\nIn French, the word \"am\u00e9ricain\" may be used for things relating to the Americas; however, similar to English, it is most often used for things relating to the United States, with the term \"\u00e9tats-unien\" sometimes used for clarity. \"Panam\u00e9ricain\" may be used as an adjective to refer to the Americas without ambiguity. French speakers may use the noun \"Am\u00e9rique\" to refer to the whole landmass as one continent, or two continents, \"Am\u00e9rique du Nord\" and \"Am\u00e9rique du Sud\". In French, \"Am\u00e9rique\" is seldom used to refer to the United States, leading to some ambiguity when it is. Similar to English usage, \"les Am\u00e9riques\" or \"des Am\u00e9riques\" is used to refer unambiguously to the Americas.\nDutch.\nIn Dutch, the word \"Amerika\" mostly refers to the United States. Although the United States is equally often referred to as \"de Verenigde Staten\" (\"the United States\") or \"de VS\" (\"the US\"), \"Amerika\" relatively rarely refers to the Americas, but it is the only commonly used Dutch word for the Americas. This often leads to ambiguity; and to stress that something concerns the Americas as a whole, Dutch uses a combination, namely \"Noord- en Zuid-Amerika\" (North and South America).\nLatin America and Central America are generally referred to as \"Latijns Amerika\" and \"Midden-Amerika\" respectively.\nThe adjective \"Amerikaans\" is most often used for things or people relating to the United States. There are no alternative words to distinguish between things relating to the United States or to the Americas. Dutch uses the local alternative for things relating to elsewhere in the Americas, such as \"Argentijns\" for Argentine, etc.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian era.\nThe pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents, spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic to European colonization during the Early Modern period. The term \"Pre-Columbian\" is used especially often in the context of the great indigenous civilizations of the Americas, such as those of Mesoamerica (Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacano, Zapotec, Mixtec, Aztec, Maya) and the Andean civilizations (Inca, Moche, Chav\u00edn, Muisca, Ca\u00f1ari).\nMany pre-Columbian civilizations established characteristics and hallmarks which included permanent or urban settlements, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c.\u2009late 15th\u2013early 16th centuries), and are known only through archeological investigations. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya, had their own written records. However, most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as pagan, and much was destroyed in Christian pyres. Only a few hidden documents remain today, leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.\nSettlement.\nThe first inhabitants migrated into the Americas from Asia. Habitation sites are known in Alaska and Yukon from at least 20,000 years ago, with suggested ages of up to 40,000 years. Beyond that, the specifics of the Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion. Widespread habitation of the Americas occurred after the Late Glacial Maximum, from 16,000 to 13,000 years ago.\nThe traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000\u201317,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered during the Quaternary glaciation. These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct pleistocene megafauna along \"ice-free corridors\" that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific coast to South America. Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of meters following the last ice age. Both routes may have been taken, although the genetic evidences suggests a single founding population. The micro-satellite diversity and distributions specific to South American Indigenous peoples indicates that certain populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.\nA second migration occurred after the initial peopling of the Americas; Na Dene speakers, found predominantly in North American groups at varying genetic rates, with the highest frequency found among the Athabaskans at 42%, derive from this second wave. Linguists and biologists have reached a similar conclusion based on analysis of Amerindian language groups and ABO blood group system distributions. Then the people of the Arctic small tool tradition, a broad cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait c.\u20092500 BCE, moved into North America. The Arctic small tool tradition, a Paleo-Eskimo culture, branched off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset and the Independence traditions of Greenland. The descendants of the Pre-Dorset cultural group, the Dorset culture, were displaced by the final migrants from the Bering sea coast line, the Thule people (the ancestors of modern Inuit), by 1000\u00a0CE.\nNorse colonization.\nAround the same time as the Inuit migrated into Greenland, Viking settlers began arriving in Greenland in 982 and Vinland shortly thereafter, establishing a settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland. Contact between the Norse colonies and Europe was maintained, as James Watson Curran states:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From 985 to 1410, Greenland was in touch with the world. Then silence. In 1492 the Vatican noted that no news of that country \"at the end of the world\" had been received for 80 years, and the bishopric of the colony was offered to a certain ecclesiastic if he would go and \"restore Christianity\" there. He didn't go.\nLarge-scale European colonization.\nAlthough there had been previous trans-oceanic contact, large-scale European colonization of the Americas began with the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. The first Spanish settlement in the Americas was La Isabela in northern Hispaniola. This town was abandoned shortly after in favor of Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, founded in 1496, the oldest American city of European foundation. This was the base from which the Spanish monarchy administered its new colonies and their expansion. Santo Domingo was subject to frequent raids by English and French pirates.\nOn the continent, Panama City on the Pacific coast of Central America, founded on August 15, 1519, played an important role, being the base for the Spanish conquest of South America. Conquistador Lucas V\u00e1zquez de Ayll\u00f3n established San Miguel de Guadalupe, the first European settlement in what is now the United States, on the Pee Dee River in South Carolina. During the first half of the 16th century, Spanish colonists conducted raids throughout the Caribbean Basin, bringing captives from Central America, northern South America, and Florida back to Hispaniola and other Spanish settlements.\nFrance, led by Jacques Cartier and Giovanni da Verrazzano, focused primarily on North America. English explorations of the Americas were led by Giovanni Caboto and Sir Walter Raleigh. The Dutch in New Netherland confined their operations to Manhattan Island, Long Island, the Hudson River Valley, and what later became New Jersey. The spread of new diseases brought by Europeans and African slaves killed many of the inhabitants of North America and South America, with a general population crash of Native Americans occurring in the mid-16th century, often well ahead of European contact. One of the most devastating diseases was smallpox.\nEuropean immigrants were often part of state-sponsored attempts to found colonies in the Americas. Migration continued as people moved to the Americas fleeing religious persecution or seeking economic opportunities. Millions of individuals were forcibly transported to the Americas as slaves, prisoners or indentured servants.\nDecolonization of the Americas began with the American Revolution and the Haitian Revolution in the late 1700s. This was followed by numerous Latin American wars of independence in the early 1800s. Between 1811 and 1825, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Gran Colombia, the United Provinces of Central America, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia gained independence from Spain and Portugal in armed revolutions. After the Dominican Republic won independence from Haiti, it was re-annexed by Spain in 1861, but reclaimed its independence in 1865 at the conclusion of the Dominican Restoration War. The last violent episode of decolonization was the Cuban War of Independence which became the Spanish\u2013American War, which resulted in the independence of Cuba in 1898, and the transfer of sovereignty over Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States.\nPeaceful decolonization began with the United States's purchase of Louisiana from France in 1803, Florida from Spain in 1819, Alaska from Russia in 1867, and the Danish West Indies from Denmark in 1916. Canada became independent of the United Kingdom, starting with the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931 and ending with the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982. The Dominion of Newfoundland similarly achieved independence under the Balfour Declaration and Statute of Westminster, but relinquished self-rule in 1934. It was subsequently confederated with Canada in 1949.\nThe remaining European colonies in the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after World War II. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago became independent in 1962, and Guyana and Barbados both achieved independence in 1966. In the 1970s, the Bahamas, Grenada, Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines all became independent of the United Kingdom, and Suriname became independent of the Netherlands. Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved independence from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\nGeography.\nExtent.\nThe Americas make up most of the land in Earth's Western Hemisphere. The northernmost point of the Americas is Kaffeklubben Island, which is the most northerly point of land on Earth. The southernmost undisputed point is \u00c1guila Islet, although the Antarctic islands of Southern Thule are sometimes taken into account. The mainland of the Americas is the world's longest north-to-south landmass. The distance between its two polar extremities, Murchison Promontory on the Boothia Peninsula in northern Canada and Cape Froward in Chilean Patagonia, is roughly . The mainland's most westerly point is the end of the Seward Peninsula in Alaska; Attu Island, further off the Alaskan coast to the west, is considered the westernmost point of the Americas. Ponta do Seixas in northeastern Brazil forms the easternmost extremity of the mainland, while Nordostrundingen, in Greenland, is the most easterly point of the continental shelf.\nGeology.\nSouth America broke off from the west of the supercontinent Gondwana around 135\u00a0million years ago, forming its own continent. Around 15\u00a0million years ago, the collision of the Caribbean Plate and the Pacific Plate resulted in the emergence of a series of volcanoes along the border that created a number of islands. The gaps in the archipelago of Central America filled in with material eroded off North America and South America, plus new land created by continued volcanism. By three million years ago, the continents of North America and South America were linked by the Isthmus of Panama, thereby forming the single landmass of the Americas. The Great American Interchange resulted in many species being spread across the Americas, such as the cougar, procyonids, porcupines, opossums, armadillos, and hummingbirds.\nTopography.\nThe geography of the western Americas is dominated by the American Cordillera, with the Andes running along the west coast of South America and the Rocky Mountains and other North American Cordillera ranges running along the western side of North America. The Appalachian Mountains run along the east coast of North America from Alabama to Newfoundland. North of the Appalachians, the Arctic Cordillera runs along the eastern coast of Canada.\nThe largest mountain ranges are the Andes and Rocky Mountains. The Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range reach similar altitudes as the Rocky Mountains, but are significantly smaller. In North America, the greatest number of fourteeners are in the United States, and more specifically in the US state of Colorado. The highest peaks of the Americas are located in the Andes, with Aconcagua of Argentina being the highest; in North America Denali (Mount McKinley) in the US state of Alaska is the tallest.\nBetween its coastal mountain ranges, North America has vast flat areas. The Interior Plains spread over much of the continent, with low relief. The Canadian Shield covers almost 5\u00a0million km2 of North America and is generally quite flat. Similarly, the north-east of South America is covered by the flat Amazon basin. The Brazilian Highlands on the east coast are fairly smooth but show some variations in landform, while farther south the Gran Chaco and Pampas are broad lowlands.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Americas varies significantly from region to region. Tropical rainforest climate occurs in the latitudes of the Amazon, American cloud forests, southeastern Florida and Dari\u00e9n Gap. In the Rocky Mountains and Andes, dry and continental climates are observed. Often the higher altitudes of these mountains are snow-capped.\nSoutheastern North America is well known for its occurrence of tornadoes and hurricanes, of which the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the United States' Tornado Alley, as well as in the southerly Dixie Alley in the North American late-winter and early spring seasons. Often parts of the Caribbean are exposed to the violent effects of hurricanes. These weather systems are formed by the collision of dry, cool air from Canada and wet, warm air from the Atlantic.\nHydrology.\nWith coastal mountains and interior plains, the Americas have several large river basins that drain the continents. The largest river basin in North America is that of the Mississippi, covering the second-largest watershed on the planet. The Mississippi\u2013Missouri river system drains most of 31 states of the United States, most of the Great Plains, and large areas between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. The Mississippi\u2013Missouri is the fourth-longest river system and has the tenth-greatest discharge in the world.\nIn North America, to the east of the Appalachian Mountains, there are no major rivers but rather a series of rivers and streams that flow east with their terminus in the Atlantic Ocean, such as the Hudson, Saint John, and Savannah rivers. A similar instance arises with central Canadian rivers that drain into Hudson Bay; the largest being the Churchill River. On the west coast of North America, the main rivers are the Colorado, Columbia, Yukon, Fraser, and Sacramento rivers.\nThe Colorado River drains much of the Southern Rockies and parts of the Basin and Range Province. The river flows approximately into the Gulf of California, during which over time it has carved out natural phenomena such as the Grand Canyon and created phenomena such as the Salton Sea. The Columbia is a large river, long, in central western North America and is the most powerful river on the West Coast of the Americas. In the far northwest of North America, the Yukon drains much of the Alaskan peninsula and flows from parts of Yukon and the Northwest Territory to the Pacific. Draining to the Arctic Ocean of Canada, the Mackenzie River drains waters from the Arctic Great Lakes of Arctic Canada, as opposed to the St Lawrence River that drains the Great Lakes of southern Canada into the Atlantic Ocean. The Mackenzie River is the largest in Canada and drains .\nThe largest river basin in South America is that of the Amazon, which has the highest volume flow of any river on Earth. The second largest watershed of South America is that of the Paran\u00e1 River, which covers about .\nEcology.\nNorth America and South America began to develop a shared population of flora and fauna around 2.5\u00a0million years ago, when continental drift brought the two continents into contact via the Isthmus of Panama. Initially, the exchange of biota was roughly equal, with North American genera migrating into South America in about the same proportions as South American genera migrated into North America. This exchange is known as the Great American Interchange. The exchange became lopsided after roughly a million years, with the total spread of South American genera into North America far more limited in scope than the spread of North American genera into South America.\nCountries and territories.\nThere are 35 sovereign states in the Americas, as well as an autonomous country of Denmark, three overseas departments of France, three overseas collectivities of France, and one uninhabited territory of France, eight overseas territories of the United Kingdom, three constituent countries of the Netherlands, three public bodies of the Netherlands, two unincorporated territories of the United States, and one uninhabited territory of the United States.\nEconomy.\nIn exports and imports, in 2020, the United States was the world's second largest exporter (US$1.64 trillion) and the largest importer (US$2.56 trillion). Mexico was the tenth largest exporter and importer. Canada was the twelfth largest exporter and importer. Brazil was the 24th largest exporter and the 28th largest importer. Chile was the 45th largest exporter and the 47th largest importer. Argentina was the 46th largest exporter and the 52nd largest importer. Colombia was the 54th largest exporter and the 51st largest importer; among others.\nThe agriculture of the continent is very strong and varied. Countries such as United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina are among the largest agricultural producers on the planet. In 2019, the continent dominated the world production of soy (almost 90% of the world total, with Brazil, the United States, Argentina, Paraguay, Canada and Bolivia among the 10 largest on the planet), sugarcane (about 55% of the world total, with Brazil, Mexico, the United States, and Guatemala among the 10 largest on the planet), coffee (about 55% of the world total, with Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Peru, and Guatemala among the 10 largest on the planet) and maize (about 48% of the world total, with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico among the 10 largest on the planet). The continent also produces almost 40% of world's orange (with Brazil, the United States, and Mexico among the top 10 producers), about 37% of world's pineapple (with Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia among the 10 largest producers), about 35% of world's lemon (with Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States among the 10 largest producers) and about 30% of world's cotton (with the United States, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina among the top 10 producers), among several other products.\nIn livestock, the Americas are major producers. In 2018, the continent produced around 45% of the world's beef (with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Canada among the world's 10 largest producers); about 36% of the world's chicken meat (with the United States, Brazil, and Mexico among the world's 10 largest producers), and about 28% of the world's cow's milk (with the United States and Brazil among the 10 largest producers in the world), among other products.\nIn industrial terms, the World Bank lists the top producing countries each year, based on the total value of production. According to the 2019 list, the United States has the second most valuable industry in the world (US$2.3 trillion), Mexico has the 12th most valuable industry in the world (US$217.8 billion), Brazil has the 13th most valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion), Canada has the 15th most valuable industry in the world (US$151.7 billion), Venezuela the 30th largest (US$58.2 billion, but depends on the oil to obtain this amount), Argentina was the 31st largest (US$57.7 billion), Colombia the 46th largest (US$35.4 billion), Peru the 50th largest ($28.7 billion), and Chile the 51st largest (US$28.3 billion), among others.\nIn the production of oil, the continent had 8 of the 30 largest world producers in 2020: United States (1st), Canada (4th), Brazil (8th), Mexico (14th), Colombia (20th), Venezuela (26th), Ecuador (27th), and Argentina (28th).\nIn the production of natural gas, the continent had 8 of the 32 largest world producers in 2015: United States (1st), Canada (5th), Argentina (18th), Trinidad and Tobago (20th), Mexico (21st), Venezuela (28th), Bolivia (31st), and Brazil (32nd).\nIn the production of coal, the continent had 5 of the 30 largest world producers in 2018: United States (3rd), Colombia (12th), Canada (13th), Mexico (24th), and Brazil (27th).\nIn the production of vehicles, the continent had 5 of the 30 largest world producers in 2019: United States (2nd), Mexico (7th), Brazil (9th), Canada (12th), and Argentina (28th).\nIn the production of steel, the continent had 5 of the 31 largest world producers in 2019: United States (4th), Brazil (9th), Mexico (15th), Canada (18th), and Argentina (31st).\nIn mining, the continent has large productions of gold (mainly in the United States, Canada, Peru, Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina); silver (mainly in Mexico, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and the United States); copper (mainly in Chile, Peru, the United States, Mexico, and Brazil); platinum (Canada and the United States); iron ore (Brazil, Canada, the United States, Peru, and Chile); zinc (Peru, the United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Canada, and Brazil); molybdenum (Chile, Peru, Mexico, Canada, and the United States); lithium (Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Canada); lead (Peru, the United States, Mexico, and Bolivia); bauxite (Brazil, Jamaica, Canada, and the United States); tin (Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil); manganese (Brazil and Mexico); antimony (Bolivia, Mexico, Guatemala, Canada, and Ecuador); nickel (Canada, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and the United States); niobium (Brazil and Canada); rhenium (Chile and the United States); and iodine (Chile), among others.\nDominica, Panama, and the Dominican Republic have the fastest-growing economy in the Americas according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 16, five to seven countries in the southern part of the Americas had weakening economies in decline, compared to only three countries in the northern part of the Americas. Haiti has the lowest GDP per capita in the Americas, although its economy was growing slightly as of 2016[ [update]].\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\nIn 2021 the total population of the Americas was about 1.03 billion people, divided as follows:\nLargest urban centers.\nThere are three urban centers that each hold titles for being the largest population area based on the three main demographic concepts:\nA city proper is the locality with legally fixed boundaries and an administratively recognized urban status that is usually characterized by some form of local government.\nAn urban area is characterized by higher population density and vast human features in comparison to areas surrounding it. Urban areas may be cities, towns or conurbations, but the term is not commonly extended to rural settlements such as villages and hamlets. Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization and do not include large swaths of rural land, as do metropolitan areas.\nUnlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities \"plus intervening rural land\" that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market.\nIn accordance with these definitions, the three largest population centers in the Americas are: Mexico City, anchor to the largest metropolitan area in the Americas; New York City, anchor to the largest urban area in the Americas; and S\u00e3o Paulo, the largest city proper in the Americas. All three cities maintain Alpha classification and large scale influence.\nEthnology.\nThe population of the Americas is made up of the descendants of four large ethnic groups and their combinations.\nThe majority of the population lives in Latin America, named for its predominant cultures, rooted in Latin Europe (including the two dominant languages, Spanish and Portuguese, both Romance languages), more specifically in the Iberian nations of Portugal and Spain (hence the use of the term Ibero-America as a synonym). Latin America is typically contrasted with Anglo-America, where English, a Germanic language, is prevalent, and which comprises Canada (with the exception of Francophone Canada rooted in Latin Europe [France]\u2014see Quebec and Acadia) and the United States. Both countries are located in North America, with cultures deriving predominantly from British and other Germanic roots.\nBlack population.\nThe transatlantic slave trade brought millions of Africans to the territories of the Americas under the colonial rule of European powers, especially South America. In South America, Portugal played a significant role in the trafficking of enslaved Africans, with estimates suggesting that around 40% of all Africans forcibly brought to the Americas were taken to Brazil alone, to work primarily in sugar cane plantations, mining, and agricultural endeavors. In North America, the British Empire was heavily involved in the transatlantic slave trade, with the establishment of colonies such as Virginia, where enslaved Africans were primarily used as labor in tobacco plantations and later in other agricultural and domestic sectors. This system perpetuated for centuries, shaping the socio-economic landscape of all nations of the hemisphere.\nAfter the Haitian Revolution led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, which started in 1791 and was the only successful slave revolt in history, the world's first black republic was established. It started with the massacre of the white population, between 3,000 and 5,000 white men and women of all ages were killed. Dessalines declared:\nOui, nous avons rendu \u00e0 ces vrais cannibales guerre pour guerre, crimes pour crimes, outrages pour outrages.&lt;br&gt; Oui, j\u2019ai sauv\u00e9 mon pays, j\u2019ai veng\u00e9 l\u2019Am\u00e9rique.Yes, we have rendered to these true cannibals war for war, crime for crime, outrage for outrage;&lt;br&gt; Yes, I have saved my country \u2013 I have avenged America.\u2014Dessalines, first president of the Republic of Haiti, 1804\nReligion.\nThe most prevalent faiths in the Americas are as follows:\nOther faiths include Buddhism; Hinduism; Sikhism; Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith; a wide variety of indigenous religions, many of which can be categorized as animistic; new age religions and many African and African-derived religions. Syncretic faiths can also be found throughout the Americas.\nLanguages.\nVarious languages are spoken in the Americas. Some are of European origin, others are spoken by indigenous peoples or are the mixture of various languages like the different creoles.\nThe most widely spoken first language in the Americas is Spanish, followed by English and Portuguese. The dominant language of Latin America is Spanish, though the most populous nation in Latin America, Brazil, speaks Portuguese. Small enclaves of French-, Dutch- and English-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in French Guiana, Suriname, and Belize and Guyana respectively. Haitian Creole is dominant in the nation of Haiti, where French is also spoken. Native languages are more prominent in Latin America than in Anglo-America, with Nahuatl, Quechua, Aymara, and Guaran\u00ed as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. Creole languages other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.\nThe dominant language of Anglo-America is English. French is also official in Canada, where it is the predominant language in Quebec and an official language in New Brunswick along with English. It is also an important language in Louisiana, and in parts of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the Southwestern United States, which formed part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, especially in California and New Mexico, where a distinct variety of Spanish spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the United States because of heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.\nThe nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language differences from Latin America, geographic differences from Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences from both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the primary language of Suriname.\nMost of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as Papiamento, which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native Arawak, various African languages, and, more recently English. The lingua franca Portu\u00f1ol, a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries. More specifically, Riverense Portu\u00f1ol is spoken by around 100,000 people in the border regions of Brazil and Uruguay. Because of immigration, there are many communities where other languages are spoken from all parts of the world, especially in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay\u2014very important destinations for immigrants.\nCulture.\nSports.\nBaseball is one of the most popular sports in the Americas, having spread through the hemisphere after the growth of US influence in the late 19th century. It overtook cricket, a fellow bat-and-ball sport spread by earlier British influence, in most places outside of the Commonwealth Caribbean. Other American sports, such as basketball, have grown throughout the region over time.\nFootball is perhaps the most popular and followed sport in the Americas. The North American region which also includes the Central and Caribbean national associations is overseen by the CONCACAF, while the South American region and its national teams are represented by the CONMEBOL.\nMultinational organizations.\nThe following is a list of multinational organizations in the Americas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29834", "revid": "13220696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29834", "title": "The Time Machine", "text": "1895 dystopian science fiction novella by H. G. Wells\nThe Time Machine is an 1895 dystopian, post-apocalyptic, science fiction novella by H.\u00a0G. Wells about a Victorian scientist known as the Time Traveller who travels to the year 802,701. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward through time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device.\nUtilizing a frame story set in then-present Victorian England, Wells's text focuses on a recount of the otherwise anonymous Time Traveller's journey into the far future. A work of future history and speculative evolution, \"The Time Machine\" is interpreted in modern times as a commentary on the increasing inequality and class divisions of Wells's era, which he projects as giving rise to two separate human species: the fair, childlike Eloi; and the savage, simian Morlocks, distant descendants of the contemporary upper and lower classes respectively. It is believed that Wells's depiction of the Eloi as a race living in plenitude and abandon was inspired by the utopic romance novel \"News from Nowhere\" (1890), though Wells's universe in the novel is notably more savage and brutal.\nIn his 1931 preface to the book, Wells wrote that \"The Time Machine\" seemed \"a very undergraduate performance to its now mature writer, as he looks over it once more\", though he states that \"the writer feels no remorse for this youthful effort\". However, critics have praised the novella's handling of its thematic concerns, with Marina Warner writing that the book was the most significant contribution to understanding before Sigmund Freud's \"The Interpretation of Dreams\", conveying \"how close [Wells] felt to the melancholy seeker after a door that he once opened on to a luminous vision and could never find again\".\n\"The Time Machine\" has been adapted into two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions and many comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions.\nHistory.\nWells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled \"The Chronic Argonauts\" (1888). This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for \"The Time Machine\".\nHe frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", but in response to a request by W. E. Henley, the editor of \"National Observer\", he rewrote \"The Chronic Argonauts\" into a series of seven loosely connected and fictionalized essays which were anonymously published in the newspaper from 17 March to 23 June 1894. The series was never completed as Henley stepped down from his role as editor in \"National Observer\". With his encouragement, Wells continued to work on the story, and at the end of the year, when Henley was given the position as editor of Heinemann's periodical \"The New Review\", he arranged for the story to be published there in serialized form in the January to May 1895 editions instead, for which Wells was paid \u00a3100 (equal to about \u00a3 today). Henry Holt and Company published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript) on 7 May 1895; Heinemann published a British edition on 29 May. These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the \"Holt text\" and \"Heinemann text\", respectively. Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.\nThe story reflects Wells's own socialist political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about industrial relations. It is also influenced by Ray Lankester's theories about social degeneration and shares many elements with Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel \"Vril, the Power of the Coming Race\" (1871). It is also thought that Wells's Eloi race shares many features with the works of other English socialists, most notably William Morris and his work \"News from Nowhere\" (1890), in which money is depicted as irrelevant and work is undertaken merely as a form of pleasure. Other science fiction works of the period, including Edward Bellamy's novel \"Looking Backward: 2000\u20131887\" (1888) and the later film \"Metropolis\" (1927), dealt with similar themes. In his later reassessment of the book, published as the 1931 preface to \"The Time Machine\", Wells wrote that the text has \"lasted as long as the diamond-framed safety bicycle, which came in at about the date of its first publication\", and is \"assured it will outlive him\", attesting to the power of the book.\nBased on Wells's personal experiences and childhood, the working class spent a large portion of their time literally underground. His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father's shop. Later, his own mother would work as a housekeeper in a house with tunnels below, where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters. A medical journal published in 1905 would focus on these living quarters for servants in poorly ventilated dark basements. In his early teens, Wells became a draper's apprentice, having to work in a basement for hours on end.\nThis work is an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre. The portion of the novella that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places \"The Time Machine\" within the realm of eschatology; that is, the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind.\nHolt, Rinehart &amp; Winston re-published the book in 2000, paired with \"The War of the Worlds\", and commissioned Michael Koelsch to illustrate a new cover art.\nPlot.\nA Victorian Englishman, identified only as the \"Time Traveller\", tells his weekly dinner guests that he has experimental verification of a machine that can travel through time. He shows them what he says is a small model, and they watch it disappear. He says he has a big machine nearly finished in his laboratory, in which a person could travel through time. At dinner the following week, a weary, bedraggled Traveller recounts to his guests what he experienced on his journey to the future.\nIn the new narrative, the Time Traveller goes into the future, observing things moving in quick motion around him. He sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden. The Traveller stops in A.D. 802,701, and meets the Eloi, a society of small, childlike humanoids. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet deteriorating buildings and adhere to a fruit-based diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline. The Eloi appear happy and carefree but fear the dark, particularly moonless nights. They give no response to nocturnal disappearances, possibly because they are so afraid of them. After exploring the area around the Eloi's residences, the Traveller reaches the top of a hill and sees the ruins of a former metropolis. He concludes that the entire planet has reverted to a natural state, with little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of thousands of years prior, and that communism has at last been achieved. He also theorizes that intelligence springs from necessity; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have devolved into weak and na\u00efve creatures with no understanding of the world around them.\nReturning to the site where he arrived, the Traveller finds his machine missing; he is confident that it at least has not travelled through time, as he had removed its levers. Later, he encounters the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Deducing that they must have taken his time machine, he explores one of many \"wells\" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings and discovers them operating the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible. He realizes that the Morlocks control and feed upon the Eloi. The Traveller speculates that the human race has diverged into two species: the favoured aristocracy has become the Eloi, and their mechanical servants have become the Morlocks.\nMeanwhile, he rescues Eloi Weena from drowning, as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight. The Traveller takes Weena with him on an expedition to \"The Palace of Green Porcelain\", a distant structure which turns out to be a derelict museum. Here, the Traveller finds fresh matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to recover his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time to save her from the horrors of the future world. Because the tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night. They are eventually attacked by Morlocks, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he left behind them to repel the Morlocks turns into a forest fire; Weena and the Morlocks are lost in the blaze.\nThe Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the machine as bait to capture the distraught Traveller, not understanding that he can use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before travelling further ahead to roughly 30\u00a0million years from his own time. There, he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: crab-like creatures wandering blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies, in a world covered in lichenoid vegetation. He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last living things die out.\nOverwhelmed, he returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left. He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two unusual white flowers Weena put in his pocket.\nThe original narrator relates that he returned to the Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time. After waiting for three years, however, the narrator says that the Traveller has not returned.\nDeleted text.\nA section from the thirteenth chapter of the serial published in \"New Review\" (May 1895, partway down p.\u00a0577 to p.\u00a0580, line 29) does not appear in either of the 1895 editions of the book. It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells's editor, William Ernest Henley, who wanted Wells to \"oblige your editor\" by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of \"the ultimate degeneracy\" of humanity. \"There was a slight struggle,\" Wells later recalled, \"between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to put a little 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text.\" This portion of the story was published elsewhere as \" (1940) and \". The deleted text was also published by Forrest J Ackerman in an issue of the American edition of \"Perry Rhodan\".\nThe deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the Traveller's escape from the Morlocks. He finds himself in the distant future in a frost-covered moorland with simple grasses and black bushes, populated with furry, hopping herbivores resembling kangaroos. He stuns or kills one with a rock, and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans / Eloi / Morlocks. A gigantic, centipede-like arthropod approaches and the Traveller flees into the next day, finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid. The Dover Press and Easton Press editions of the novella restore this deleted segment.\nScholarship.\nSignificant scholarly commentary on \"The Time Machine\" began from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells's early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi's \"The Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances\") and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas's \"The Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians\"). Much critical and textual work was done in the 1970s, including the tracing of the very complex publication history of the text, its drafts, and unpublished fragments.\nAcademic publications.\nA further resurgence in scholarship came around the time of the novella's centenary in 1995, and a major outcome of this was the 1995 conference and substantial anthology of academic papers, which was collected in print as \"H.G. Wells's Perennial Time Machine\". This publication then allowed the development of a guide-book for academic study at Master's and Ph.D. level: \"H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide\".\nThe scholarly journal \"The Wellsian\" has published around twenty articles on \"The Time Machine\", and a U.S. academic journal \"The Undying Fire\", devoted to H.G. Wells studies, has published three articles since its inception in 2002.\nSubtext of the names \"Eloi\" and \"Morlock\".\nAccording to Leon Stover in his book \"The Time Machine: An invention\", the name \"Eloi\" is the Hebrew plural for Elohim, or lesser gods, in the Old Testament. However, this derivation is unlikely as the word 'Elohim' is already in the plural, with the singular being 'eloah'.\nWells's source for the name \"Morlock\" is less clear. It may refer to the Canaanite god Moloch associated with child sacrifice. The name Morlock may also be a play on \"mollocks\" \u2013 what miners might call themselves \u2013 or a Scots word for rubbish, or a reference to the Morlacchi community in Dalmatia.\nSymbols.\n\"The Time Machine\" can be read as a symbolic novel. The time machine itself can be viewed as a symbol, and there are several symbols in the narrative, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire.\nAdaptations.\nRadio and audio.\n\"Escape\" radio broadcasts.\nThe CBS radio anthology \"Escape\" adapted \"The Time Machine\" twice, in 1948 starring Jeff Corey, and again in 1950 starring Lawrence Dobkin as the traveller. A script adapted by Irving Ravetch was used in both episodes. The Time Traveller was named Dudley and was accompanied by his sceptical friend Fowler as they travelled to the year 100,080.\n1994 Alien Voices audio drama.\nIn 1994, an audio drama was released on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starring Leonard Nimoy as the Time Traveller (named John in this adaptation) and John de Lancie as David Filby. John de Lancie's children, Owen de Lancie and Keegan de Lancie, played the parts of the Eloi. The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the story than several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.\n7th Voyage.\nIn 2016, Alan Young read \"The Time Machine\" for 7th Voyage Productions, Inc., to celebrate the 120th Anniversary of H.G. Wells's novella.\n2009 BBC Radio 3 broadcast.\nRobert Glenister starred as the Time Traveller, with William Gaunt as H. G. Wells in a new 100-minute radio dramatisation by Philip Osment, directed by Jeremy Mortimer as part of a BBC Radio Science Fiction season. This was the first adaptation of the novella for British radio. It was first broadcast on 22 February 2009 on BBC Radio 3 and later published as a 2-CD BBC audio book.\nThe other cast members were:\nThe adaptation retained the nameless status of the Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the US journalist, Martha, whilst firewatching on the roof of Broadcasting House during the Blitz. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30\u00a0million\u00a0AD at the end of the universe before disappearing or dying there.\nBig Finish.\nOn 5 September 2017, Big Finish Productions released an adaptation of \"The Time Machine\". This adaptation was written by Marc Platt and starred Ben Miles as the Time Traveller.\nPlatt explained in an interview that adapting \"The Time Machine\" to audio was not much different from writing \"Doctor Who\", and that he could see where some of the roots of early \"Doctor Who\" came from.\nFilm adaptations.\n1949 BBC teleplay.\nThe first visual adaptation of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from Alexandra Palace on 25 January 1949 by the BBC, which starred Russell Napier as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.\n1960 film.\nIn 1960, the novella was made into a US science fiction film, also known promotionally as \"H.G. Wells's The Time Machine\". The film starred Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux. The film was produced and directed by George Pal, who also filmed a 1953 version of Wells's \"The War of the Worlds\". The film won an Academy Award for time-lapse photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly.\nIn 1993, Rod Taylor hosted \"\" reuniting him with Alan Young and Whit Bissell, featuring the only sequel to Mr. Pal's classic film, written by the original screenwriter, David Duncan. In the special were Academy Award-winners special effect artists Wah Chang and Gene Warren.\n1978 television film.\nSunn Classic Pictures produced a television film version of \"The Time Machine\" as a part of their \"Classics Illustrated\" series in 1978. It was a modernization of the Wells's story, making the Time Traveller a 1970s scientist working for a fictional US defence contractor, \"the Mega Corporation\". Dr. Neil Perry (John Beck), the Time Traveller, is described as one of Mega's most reliable contributors by his senior co-worker Branly (Whit Bissell, an alumnus of the 1960 adaptation). Perry's skill is demonstrated by his rapid reprogramming of an off-course missile, averting a disaster that could have destroyed Los Angeles. His reputation secures him a grant of $20 million for his time machine project. Although nearing completion, the corporation wants Perry to put the project on hold so that he can head a military weapon development project. Perry accelerates work on the time machine, permitting him to test it before being forced to work on the new project.\n2002 film.\nThe 1960 film was remade in 2002, starring Guy Pearce as the Time Traveller, a mechanical engineering professor named Alexander Hartdegen, Mark Addy as his colleague David Philby, Sienna Guillory as Alex's ill-fated fianc\u00e9e Emma, Phyllida Law as Mrs. Watchit, and Jeremy Irons as the Uber-Morlock. Playing a quick cameo as a shopkeeper was Alan Young, who featured in the 1960 film. (H.\u00a0G. Wells himself can also be said to have a \"cameo\" appearance, in the form of a photograph on the wall of Alex's home, near the front door.)\nThe film was directed by Wells's great-grandson Simon Wells, with an even more revised plot that incorporated the ideas of paradoxes and changing the past. The place is changed from Richmond, Surrey, to downtown New York City, where the Time Traveller moves forward in time to find answers to his questions on 'Practical Application of Time Travel;' first in 2030 New York, to witness an orbital lunar catastrophe in 2037, before moving on to 802,701 for the main plot. He later briefly finds himself in 635,427,810 with toxic clouds and a world laid waste (presumably by the Morlocks) with devastation and Morlock artifacts stretching out to the horizon.\nIt was met with mixed reviews and earned $56 million before VHS/DVD sales. The Time Machine used a design that was very reminiscent of the one in the Pal film but was much larger and employed polished turned brass construction, along with rotating glass reminiscent of the Fresnel lenses common to lighthouses. (In Wells's original book, the Time Traveller mentioned his 'scientific papers on optics'.) Hartdegen becomes involved with a female Eloi named Mara, played by Samantha Mumba, who essentially takes the place of Weena, from the earlier versions of the story. In this film, the Eloi have, as a tradition, preserved a \"stone language\" that is identical to English. The Morlocks are much more barbaric and agile, and the Time Traveller has a direct impact on the plot.\nDerivative work.\n\"Time After Time\" (1979 film).\nIn \"Time After Time\", H.\u00a0G. Wells invents a time machine and shows it to some friends in a manner similar to the first part of the novella. He does not know that one of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which prevents the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 TV series of the same name.\nComics.\n\"Classics Illustrated\" was the first to adapt \"The Time Machine\" into a comic book format, issuing an American edition in July 1956.\nThe Classics Illustrated version was published in French by \"Classiques Illustres\" in Dec 1957, and \"Classics Illustrated\" Strato Publications (Australian) in 1957, and \"Kuvitettuja Klassikkoja\" (a Finnish edition) in November 1957. There were also \"Classics Illustrated\" Greek editions in 1976, Swedish in 1987, German in 1992 and 2001, and a Canadian reprint of the English edition in 2008.\nIn 1976, Marvel Comics published a new version of \"The Time Machine\", as #2 in their \"Marvel Classics Comics\" series, with art by Alex Ni\u00f1o. (This adaptation was originally published in 1973 by Pendulum Press as part of their \"Pendulum Now Age Classics\" series; it was colourised and reprinted by Marvel in 1976.)\nIn 1977, Polish painter Waldemar Andrzejewski adapted the novel as a 22-page comic book, written in Polish by Antoni Wolski.\nFrom April 1990, Eternity Comics published a three-issue miniseries adaptation of \"The Time Machine\", written by Bill Spangler and illustrated by John Ross \u2014 this was collected as a trade paperback graphic novel in 1991.\nIn 2018, US imprint Insight Comics published an adaptation of the novel, as part of their \"H. G. Wells\" series of comic books.\nIn IDW's 2024 comic series \"Godzilla's Monsterpiece Theatre,\" the Time Traveler appears as a character alongside other fictional characters of the era, such as Sherlock Holmes, Count Dracula and Jay Gatsby. In the comic, he travels through time to 1922 in order to help the other characters fight Godzilla. This version of the character is known as the \"Time Machinist\" and has a history with Godzilla.\nSequels by other authors.\nWells' novella has become one of the cornerstones of science-fiction literature. As a result, it has spawned many offspring. Works expanding on Wells's story include:\nThe Time Traveller.\nAlthough the Time Traveller's real name is never given in the original novella, other sources have named him:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29837", "revid": "50934192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29837", "title": "Trombone", "text": "Brass instrument\nThe trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's lips vibrate inside a mouthpiece, causing the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones use a telescoping slide mechanism to alter the pitch instead of the valves used by other brass instruments. The valve trombone is an exception, using three valves similar to those on a trumpet, and the superbone has valves and a slide.\nThe word \"trombone\" derives from Italian \"tromba\" (trumpet) and \"-one\" (a suffix meaning 'large'), so the name means 'large trumpet'. The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like the trumpet, in contrast to the more conical brass instruments like the cornet, the flugelhorn, the baritone, and the euphonium. The two most frequently encountered variants are the tenor trombone and bass trombone; when the word \"trombone\" is mentioned alone; it is mostly taken to mean the tenor model. These are treated as non-transposing instruments, reading at concert pitch in bass clef, with higher notes sometimes being notated in tenor clef. They are pitched in B\u266d, an octave below the B\u266d trumpet and an octave above the B\u266d contrabass tuba. The once common E\u266d alto trombone became less common as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is regaining popularity for its lighter sonority. In British brass-band music the tenor trombone is treated as a B\u266d transposing instrument, written in treble clef, and the alto trombone is written at concert pitch, usually in alto clef.\nA person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. \nHistory.\nEtymology.\n\"Trombone\" comes from the Italian word (trumpet) plus the suffix (large), meaning 'large trumpet'.\nDuring the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was \"sackbut\". The word first appears in court records in 1495 as \"shakbusshe\". \"Shakbusshe\" is similar to , attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent appears in 1466.\nThe German long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.\nOrigin.\nThe sackbut appeared in the 15th century and was used extensively across Europe, declining in most places by the mid to late 17th century. It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. Its principal role was as the contratenor part in a dance band. It was also used, along with shawms, in bands sponsored by towns and courts. Trumpeters and trombonists were employed in German city-states to stand watch in the city towers and herald the arrival of important people to the city, an activity that signified wealth and strength in 16th-century German cities. These heralding trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the alta capella wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles, which performed in religious settings such as St Mark's Basilica in Venice in the early 17th century. The 17th-century trombone had slightly smaller dimensions than a modern trombone, with a bell that was more conical and less flared. Modern period performers use the term \"sackbut\" to distinguish this earlier version of the trombone from the modern instrument.\nComposers who wrote for trombone during this period include Claudio Monteverdi, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Giovanni Gabrieli and his uncle Andrea Gabrieli. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.\nWhen the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known by its Italian name, \"trombone\". Its name remained constant in Italy () and in Germany ().\nDuring the later Baroque period, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel used trombones on a few occasions. Bach called for a \"tromba di tirarsi\", which may have been a form of the closely related slide trumpet, to double the cantus firmus in some liturgical cantatas. He also employed a choir of four trombones to double the chorus in three of his cantatas (BWV 2, BWV 21 and BWV 38), and used three trombones and a cornett in the cantata BWV 25. Handel used it in \"Samson\", in \"Israel in Egypt\", and in the \"Death March\" from \"Saul\". All were examples of an oratorio style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional \"Stadtpfeiffer\" or alta cappella musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions. Because of the relative scarcity of trombones, their solo parts were generally interchangeable with other instruments.\nClassical period.\nThe construction of the trombone did not change very much between the Baroque and Classical period, but the bell became slightly more flared. Christoph Willibald Gluck was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, in the opera \"Alceste \"(1767). He also used it in the operas \"Orfeo ed Euridice\", \"Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride \"(1779), and \"Echo et Narcisse\".\nEarly Classical composers occasionally included concertante movements with alto trombone as a solo instrument in divertimenti and serenades; these movements are often extracted from the multi-movement works and performed as standalone alto trombone concerti. Examples include the Serenade in E\u266d (1755) by Leopold Mozart and Divertimento in D major (1764) by Michael Haydn. The earliest known independent trombone concerto is probably the Concerto for Alto Trombone and Strings in B\u266d (1769) by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger.\nMozart used the trombone in operas (notably in scenes featuring the Commendatore in \"Don Giovanni\") and in sacred music. The prominent solo part in the \"Tuba Mirum\" section of his Requiem became a staple audition piece for the instrument. Aside from solo parts, Mozart's orchestration usually features a trio of alto, tenor and bass trombones, doubling the respective voices in the choir. The earliest known symphony featuring a trombone section is Symphony in C minor by Anton Zimmermann. The date is uncertain but it is most probably from the peak of the composer's activity in the 1770s. The earliest confident date for introducing the trombone to the symphony is therefore Zimmermann's death in 1781.\nTransition to Romantic period.\nSymphony in E\u266d (1807) by Swedish composer Joachim Nicolas Eggert features an independent trombone part. Ludwig van Beethoven is sometimes mistakenly credited with the trombone's introduction into the orchestra, having used it shortly afterwards in his Symphony No. 5 in C minor (1808), Symphony No. 6 in F major (\"Pastoral\"), and Symphony No. 9 (\"Choral\").\nRomantic period.\n19th-century orchestras.\nTrombones were included in operas, symphonies, and other compositions by Felix Mendelssohn, Ludwig van Beethoven, Hector Berlioz, Franz Berwald, Charles Gounod, Franz Liszt, Gioacchino Rossini, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Giuseppe Verdi, and Richard Wagner, and others.\nThe trombone trio was combined with one or two cornetts during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods. The replacement of cornetts with oboes and clarinets did not change the trombone's role as a support to the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings), whose moving harmonic lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. The introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon a tenor trombone replaced the alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the Second World War. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid-19th century.\nTrombonists were employed less by court orchestras and cathedrals, who had been providing the instruments. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E\u266d bass trombone remained in military use until around the First World War. Orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, as it could generally play any of the three trombone parts in orchestral scores.\nValve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section. While its use declined in German and French orchestras, the valve trombone remained popular in some countries, including Italy and Bohemia, almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, Bed\u0159ich Smetana, and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k scored for a valve trombone section.\nAs the ophicleide or the tuba was added to the orchestra during the 19th century, bass trombone parts were scored in a higher register than previously. The bass trombone regained some independence in the early 20th century. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner's addition of a contrabass trombone in \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" and Gustav Mahler's and Richard Strauss' addition of a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenors and one bass. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.\n19th-century wind bands.\nWind bands began during the French Revolution of 1791 and have always included trombones. They became more established in the 19th century and included circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones with the bell pointing behind the player's left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz's 1840 \"Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale\", which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement. Toward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. Arthur Pryor, who played with the John Philip Sousa band and formed his own band, was one of the most famous of these trombonists.\n19th-century pedagogy.\nIn the Romantic era, Leipzig became a center of trombone pedagogy, and the instrument was taught at the Musikhochschule founded by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. The Paris Conservatory and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, Karl Traugott Queisser, was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of the trombone. Several composers wrote works for Queisser, including Mendelssohn's concertmaster Ferdinand David, Ernst Sachse, and Friedrich August Belcke. David wrote his \"Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra\" in 1837, and Sachse's solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler's tenor-bass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.\n19th-century construction.\nSattler had a great influence on trombone design, introducing a significantly larger bore (the most important innovation since the Renaissance), \"Schlangenverzierungen\" (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare. These features were widely copied during the 19th century and are still found on German made trombones.\nThe trombone was improved in the 19th century with the addition of \"stockings\" at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of a valve that was designed to be set in a single position but later became the modern F-valve. The valve trombone appeared around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.\nTwentieth century.\nWith the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. In the 1940s, British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of the American/German choice of large bore tenors and B\u266d basses. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.\n20th-century wind bands.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the popularity of touring and community concert bands in the United States decreased. At the same time, the development of music education in the public school system made high-school and university concert bands and marching bands ubiquitous. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.\nUse in jazz.\nIn the 1900s the trombone and the tuba played bass lines and outlined chords to support improvisation by the higher-pitched instruments. It began to be used as a solo instrument during the swing era of the mid-1920s. Jack Teagarden and J.\u00a0J. Johnson were early trombone soloists.\n20th-century construction.\nThe trombone's construction changed in the 20th century. Different materials were used, mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions increased, and different mutes and valves were developed. Despite the overall trend towards larger bore instruments, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.\nOne of the most significant changes was the development of the F-attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century there was no need for orchestral trombonists to use instruments with the F attachment trigger. As contemporary composers such as Mahler began to write lower passages for the trombone, the trigger became necessary.\nContemporary use.\nThe trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, big bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, and trios, and also in trombone groups ranging from trios to choirs. A trombone choir can vary in size from five to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&amp;B, ska, and New Orleans brass bands.\nConstruction.\nThe trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube with two U-shaped bends and a flared bell at the end. The tubing is approximately cylindrical but contains a complex series of tapers which affect the instrument's intonation. As with other brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a standing wave in the instrument.\nThe detachable cup-shaped mouthpiece is similar to that of the baritone horn and closely related to that of the trumpet. It has a venturi: a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance, greatly affecting the tone of the instrument. The slide section consists of a leadpipe, inner and outer slide tubes, and bracing, or \"stays\". The soldered stays on modern instruments replaced the loose stays found on sackbuts (medieval precursors to trombones).\nThe most distinctive feature of the trombone is the slide that lengthens the tubing and lowers the pitch (cf. valve trombone). During the Renaissance, sleeves (called \"stockings\") were developed to decrease friction that would impede the slide's motion. These were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes to slightly increase their diameter. The ends of inner slides on modern instruments are manufactured with a slightly larger diameter to achieve the same end. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. The slide section is connected to the bell section by the neckpipe and a U-bend called the bell or back bow. The joint connecting the slide and bell sections has a threaded collar to secure the connection. Prior to the early 20th century this connection was made with friction joints alone.\nTrombones have a short tuning slide in the U-shaped bend between the neckpipe and the bell, a feature designed by the French maker Fran\u00e7ois Riedlocker in the early 19th century. It was incorporated into French and British designs, and later to German and American models, although German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. Many types of trombone also include one or more rotary valves connected to additional tubing which lengthens the instrument. This extends the low range of the instrument and creates the option of using alternate slide positions for many notes.\nLike the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing that are of unchanging diameter (the slide section must be cylindrical in order to function). Tenor trombones typically have a bore of (small bore) to (large or \"orchestral\" bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the bow to the bell, which is typically between . A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.\nBells.\nTrombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between in diameter, with most being between . The smallest sizes are found on jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common on orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be or more, with most being between . The bell may be made from two separate brass sheets or from one single piece of metal, hammered on a mandrel to shape it. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.\nValve attachments.\nModern trombones often have a valve attachment, an extra loop of tubing attached to the bell section and engaged by a valve operated by the left thumb by means of a lever or trigger. The valve attachment aids in increasing the lower range of the instrument, while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. A valve can also make trills easier.\nThe valve attachment was originally developed by German instrument maker Christian Friedrich Sattler in the late 1830s for the (lit.\u2009'tenor-bass trombone'), a B\u266d tenor trombone built with the wider bore and larger bell of a bass trombone that Sattler had earlier invented in 1821. Sattler's valve attachment added about of tubing to lower the fundamental pitch from B\u266d to F, controlled by a rotary valve, and is essentially unchanged in modern instruments.\nValve attachments are most commonly found on tenor and bass trombones, but they can appear on sizes from soprano to contrabass.\nIn the early 2010s Torbj\u00f6rn Hultmark of the Royal College of Music commissioned the first soprano trombone in B\u266d with an F valve, built by Thein Brass.\nAlthough rare on the E\u266d alto trombone, a valve attachment usually lowers the instrument a perfect fourth into B\u266d, providing the first five or six positions from the tenor trombone slide. Some alto models have what is called a \"trill valve\", providing a small loop of tubing that lowers the instrument by only a minor or major second, into D or D\u266d respectively.\nTenor trombones, especially the larger bore symphonic models, commonly have a valve attachment which lowers the instrument from B\u266d to F.\nIt provides access to the otherwise missing notes between the pedal B\u266d1 in first position, and the second partial E2 in seventh, as well as providing alternate slide positions for other notes in long (sixth and seventh) positions. Because the attachment tubing increases the length of the overall instrument by one-third, the distances between slide positions must also be one-third longer when the valve is engaged, resulting in only six positions available on the F slide, to low C2. Thus, the F attachment cannot provide the low B\u266e1, but it usually has a sufficiently long tuning slide to lower it into E as required, which will provide B\u266e1 in a very long position.\nTenor trombones without a valve are sometimes known as \"straight\" trombones.\nThe modern bass trombone usually has two valve attachments to provide all of the notes that are absent on an instrument with no valves (B\u266e1 \u2013 E2). This allows the player to produce a complete chromatic range upwards from the pedal register.\nThe first valve is an F attachment the same as that found on a tenor trombone and extends the range down to C2. The second valve, engaged together with the first, lowers the instrument to D (or less commonly, E\u266d) and provides the low B1. The second valve can be \"dependent\", where it serves to lower the F attachment to D and has no effect alone. More commonly the second valve is \"independent\", where it can be engaged separately to lower the instrument to G\u266d, or to D when both are engaged.\nSingle-valve B\u266d bass trombones with an F attachment are still made but are now less common than two-valve bass trombones. They are essentially very large bore tenor trombones, and likewise cannot provide the low B\u266e1 without lowering the valve to E with a long tuning slide.\nContrabass trombones in F typically have two independent valves, tuned either to C and D\u266d combining to A, or in European models tuned to D and B\u266d combining to A\u266d. Contrabass trombones in low B\u266d usually have only one valve in F, although Miraphone make a model in C with two independent valves in G and A\u266d, which combine to E.\nValve types.\nThe most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the rotary valve, appearing on most band instruments, as well as most student and intermediate model trombones. Many improvements of the rotary valve, as well as entirely new and radically different valve designs, have been invented since the mid 20th century to give the trombone a more open, free sound than the tight bends in conventional rotary valve designs would allow. Many of these new valve designs have been widely adopted by players, especially in symphony orchestras. The Thayer axial flow valve is offered on professional models from most trombone manufacturers, and the Hagmann valve particularly from European manufacturers.\nSome trombones have three piston or rotary valves instead of a slide; see valve trombone.\nTubing.\nF attachment tubing usually has a larger bore through the attachment than through the rest of the instrument. A typical slide bore for an orchestral tenor trombone is while the bore in the attachment is . The attachment tubing also incorporates a tuning slide to tune the valve separately from the rest of the instrument, usually long enough to lower the pitch by a semitone when fully extended (from F to E on tenor and bass trombones, to reach the missing low B1).\nValve attachment tubing is often coiled tightly to keep within the bell section (\"closed wrap \" or \"traditional wrap\"). A less coiled configuration, called \"open wrap\", is found on some 19th and early 20th century instruments. In the early 1980s, American instrument manufacturers began producing open wrap instruments after Californian instrument technician Larry Minick introduced open wraps around the same time that the Thayer valve began to emerge among orchestral players. Open wrap F attachment tubing is shaped in a single loop free of tight bends, resulting in a freer response and more \"open\" sound through the valve.\nIn marching bands and other situations where the trombone may be more prone to damage, the confined traditional wrap is more common, since open wrap tubing protrudes behind the bell section.\nTuning.\nSome trombones are tuned using a mechanism in the slide section instead of a tuning slide in the bell section. Having the tuning slide in the bell section (the more typical setup) requires two sections of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Placing the tuning mechanism in the cylindrical slide section allows the bell section to remain conical.\nSlides.\nCommon and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are for tenor trombones, and for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a \"dual-bore\" configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are , , , , for tenor trombones, and for bass trombones.\nMouthpiece.\nThe mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player's ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the timbre of that tone, its volume, the instrument's intonation tendencies, the player's subjective level of comfort, and the instrument's playability in a given pitch range.\nMouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a jazz trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.\nPlastic.\nInstruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.\nRegional variations.\nGermany and Austria.\nGerman trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German \"Konzertposaune\" can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least . The whole instrument is typically made of gold brass. They are constructed using very thin metal (especially in the bell section), and many have a metal ring called a (lit.\u2009'wreath') on the rim of the bell. Their sound is very even across dynamic levels but it can be difficult to play at louder volumes. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed in diameter.\nValve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B\u266d trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German \"Quart-Ventil\", built onto a B\u266d tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B\u266d or F for extended passages. Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.\nAs with other traditional German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long water keys as well as \"Schlangenverzierungen\" (snake decorations) on the slide and bell U-bows to help protect the tubing from damage.\nSince around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling \"American trombones\" as well. Most trombones made and/or played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper. However, some higher-end manufacturers such as Thein make modern iterations of the classic German \"Konzertposaune\", as well as American-style trombones with German features like the \"Kranz\" and snake decorations.\nFrance.\nFrench trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the Second World War and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid\u201320th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around , small bells of not more than in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the cornet or horn. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B\u266d, altos in D\u266d, sopranos in F, piccolos in B\u266d, basses in G and E\u266d, and contrabasses in B\u266d.\nTypes.\nThe most frequently encountered types of trombone today are the tenor and bass, though as with many other instrument families such as the clarinet, the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Although trombones are usually constructed with a slide to change the pitch, valve trombones instead use the set of three valves common on other brass instruments.\nSlide trombones.\nContrabass trombone.\nThe contrabass trombone is the lowest trombone, first appearing in BB\u266d an octave below the tenor with a double slide. This design was commissioned by Wagner in the 1870s for his \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" opera cycle. Since the late 20th century however, it has largely been supplanted by a less cumbersome single-slide bass-contrabass instrument pitched in 12' F. With two valve attachments to provide the same full range as its predecessor, this design is effectively a modern bass trombone built down a perfect fourth. Although the contrabass has only appeared occasionally in orchestral repertoire and is not a permanent member of the modern orchestra, it has enjoyed a revival in the 21st century, particularly in film and video game soundtracks.\nBass trombone.\nAlthough early instruments were pitched in G, F or E\u266d below the tenor trombone, the modern bass trombone is pitched in the same B\u266d as the tenor but with a wider bore, a larger bell, and a larger mouthpiece. These features facilitate playing in the lower register of the instrument. Modern bass trombones have valves that allow a fully chromatic range down to the pedal register (B\u266d1). In Britain, the bass trombone in G was used in orchestras from the mid-19th century and survived into the 1950s, particularly in British brass bands.\nTenor trombone.\nThe tenor trombone has a fundamental note of B\u266d and is usually treated as a non-transposing instrument (see below). Tenor trombones with C as their fundamental note were almost equally popular in the mid-19th century in Britain and France. As the trombone in its simplest form has neither crooks, valves nor keys to lower the pitch by a specific interval, trombonists use seven chromatic \"slide positions\". Each position progressively increases the length of the air column, thus lowering the pitch.\nExtending the slide from one position to the next lowers the pitch by one semitone. Thus, each note in the harmonic series can be lowered by an interval of up to a tritone. The lowest note of the standard instrument is therefore an E\u266e \u2013 a tritone below B\u266d. Most experienced trombonists can play lower \"falset\" notes and much lower pedal notes (first partials or fundamentals, which have a peculiar metallic rumbling sound). Slide positions are subject to adjustment, compensating for imperfections in the tuning of different harmonics. The fifth partial is rather flat on most trombones and usually requires a minute shortening of the slide position to compensate; other small adjustments are also normally required throughout the range. Trombonists make frequent use of alternate positions to minimize slide movement in rapid passages; for instance, B\u266d3 may be played in first or fifth position. Alternate positions are also needed to allow a player to produce a glissando to or from a higher note on the same partial.\nWhile the lowest note of the tenor trombone's range (excluding fundamentals or pedal notes) is E2, the trombone's upper range is theoretically open-ended. The practical top of the range is sometimes considered to be F5, or more conservatively D5. The range of the C tenor trombone is F\u266f2 to G5.\nAlto trombone.\nThe alto trombone is smaller than the tenor trombone and almost always pitched in E\u266d a fourth higher than the tenor, although examples pitched in F are occasionally found. Modern instruments are sometimes fitted with a valve to lower the pitch, either by a semitone to D (known as a \"trill\" valve), or by a fourth into B\u266d. The alto trombone was commonly used in the 16th to the 18th centuries in church music to strengthen the alto voice, particularly in the Mass. Early 19th century composers such as Beethoven, Brahms, and Schumann began writing for alto trombone in their symphonies, but the subsequent use and popularity of tenor trombones in the orchestra largely eclipsed their use until a modern revival that began in the late 20th century.\nSoprano trombone.\nThe soprano trombone is usually pitched in B\u266d an octave above the tenor, and has seldom been used since its first known appearance in 1677 outside of trombone choirs in Moravian Church music. Built with mouthpiece, bore and bell dimensions similar to the B\u266d trumpet, it tends to be played by trumpet players. During the 20th century some soprano trombones\u2014dubbed \"slide cornets\"\u2014were made as novelties or for use by jazz players including Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie. A small number of contemporary proponents of the instrument include jazz artists Wycliffe Gordon and Christian Scott, and classical trumpeter Torbj\u00f6rn Hultmark, who advocates for its use as an instrument for young children to learn music.\nSopranino and piccolo trombones.\nThe sopranino and piccolo trombones appeared in the 1950s as novelty instruments, and are even smaller and higher than the soprano. They are pitched in high E\u266d and B\u266d respectively, one octave above the alto and soprano trombones. Owing to being essentially a slide variant of the piccolo trumpet, they are played primarily by trumpet players.\nTrombones with valves.\nValve trombone.\nIn the 19th century as soon as brass instrument valves were invented, trombones with valves instead of slides were adopted widely in orchestras, and remain popular in some parts of Europe and in military bands.\nCimbasso.\nThe cimbasso covers the same range as a tuba or a contrabass trombone. The term first appeared in early 19th century Italian opera scores, and originally referred to an upright serpent or an ophicleide. The modern cimbasso first appeared as the \"trombone basso Verdi\" in the 1880s and has three to six piston or rotary valves and a predominantly cylindrical bore. They are most often pitched in 12' F, although models are available in E\u266d and occasionally 16' C and 18' B\u266d. The cimbasso is most commonly used in performances of late Romantic Italian operas by Verdi and Puccini, but has also experienced a 21st-century revival in film, television and video game soundtracks.\nSuperbone.\nA hybrid, \"duplex\" or \"double\" trombone is a design of trombone that has both a slide and a set of three valves for altering the pitch. It has been reinvented several times since first appearing in the 19th century by Besson, and later Conn. Jazz trombonist and machinist Brad Gowans invented his \"valide trombone\" in the 1940s with a short four-position slide. In the 1970s Maynard Ferguson and Holton produced the \"Superbone\", very similar to the earlier Conn. In 2013 Schagerl in collaboration with James Morrison announced a larger bore variant with rotary valves.\nFlugabone.\nThe \"flugabone\" (or sometimes \"flugelbone\"), portmanteau of \"flugelhorn\" and \"trombone\", also known as the \"marching trombone\", is a marching brass instrument, essentially a valve trombone wrapped into a compact flugelhorn shape. It retains the cylindrical bore of the trombone, rather than the conical bore of either the flugelhorn or bugle, and thus is similar in playing characteristics to a valve trombone. A similar marching trombone is the \"trombonium\" first produced by King Musical Instruments, wrapped and held vertically like a euphonium.\nOther variants.\nSackbut.\nThe term \"sackbut\" refers to the early forms of the trombone commonly used during the Renaissance and Baroque eras, with a characteristically smaller, more cylindrically proportioned bore, and a less-flared bell.\nBuccin.\nA distinctive form of tenor trombone was popularized in France in the early 19th century. Called the buccin, it featured a tenor trombone slide and a bell that ended in a zoomorphic (serpent or dragon) head. It sounds like a cross between a trombone and a French horn, with a very wide dynamic range but a limited and variable range of pitch. Hector Berlioz wrote for the buccin in his \"Messe solennelle\" of 1824.\nTromboon.\nA portmanteau of \"trombone\" and \"bassoon\", the \"tromboon\" was created by musical parodist Peter Schickele by replacing a trombone's mouthpiece with the reed and bocal of a bassoon. It appears in several humorous works of Schickele's fictional composer, P. D. Q. Bach.\nTechnique.\nBasic slide positions.\nThe modern system has seven chromatic slide positions on a tenor trombone in B\u266d. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795.\nIn 1811 Joseph Fr\u00f6hlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A. To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered \"drawn past\" then current 1st). In the modern system, each successive position outward (approximately ) will produce a note which is one semitone lower when played in the same partial. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to \"bend\" the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.\nPartials and intonation.\nAs with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different partial in the harmonic series. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B\u266d trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B\u266d2 (one octave higher than the pedal B\u266d1), F3 (a perfect fifth higher than the previous partial), B\u266d3 (a perfect fourth higher), D4 (a major third higher), and F4 (a minor third higher).\nF4 marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A\u266d4 (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone equal temperament scale. A\u266d4 in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh. On the slide trombone, such deviations from intonation are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position. Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have just intonation (see harmonic seventh as well for A\u266d4).\nThe next higher partials\u2014B\u266d4 (a major second higher), C5 (a major second higher), D5 (a major second higher)\u2014do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E\u266d5 (a minor second higher) is almost exactly a quarter tone higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E\u266d5 and F5 (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed facial musculature and diaphragm can go even higher to G5, A\u266d5, B\u266d5 and beyond.\nThe higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above). A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F4 (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B\u266d trombone. The note E1 (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a B\u266d tenor trombone, requiring a full of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B\u266d1 (the fundamental in first position) and E2 (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce \"falset\" notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.\nPedal tones.\nThe B\u266d pedal tone is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music, while notes below that are called for only rarely as they \"become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality\" with A\u266d or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists. The trombone's tubing is largely cylindrical, which inhibits the production of the fundamental as a pedal tone pitch. Instead, trombonists use the higher harmonics of the instrument to produce pedal tones, giving them a bright and hollow tone quality. Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B\u266d on the bass trombone.\nGlissando.\nThe trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true glissando, by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.\nThe trombone glissando can create remarkable effects, and it is used in jazz and popular music, as in the famous song \"The Stripper\" by David Rose and his orchestra.\n'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.\nTrills.\nTrills, though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B\u266d3/C4 is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B\u266d4/C5) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor's range. Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.\nNotation.\nUnlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a transposing instrument. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a \"crook\") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (\"e.g.\" Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).\nTrombone parts are typically notated in bass clef, though sometimes also written in tenor clef or alto clef. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German Robert Schumann was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.\nAn accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B\u266d as well.\nMutes.\nA variety of mutes can be used with the trombone to alter its timbre. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a wah-wah effect. Mutes used in this way include the \"hat\" (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or toilet plunger). The \"wah-wah\" sound of a trombone with a harmon mute is featured as the voices of adults in the \"Peanuts\" cartoons.\nDidactics.\nSeveral makers have begun to market compact B\u266d/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short attachment that puts the instrument in B\u266d has its valve \"open\" when the trigger is \"not\" depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (\"Preacher model\") was marketed by C.G. Conn in the 1920s, also under the Wurlitzer label. Currently, B\u266d/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers G\u00fcnter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the Yamaha Corporation.\nManufacturers.\nTrombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, Boston Musical Instrument Company, E. A. Couturier, H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments, J. W. York, and C.G. Conn. In the 21st century, leading mainstream manufacturers of trombones include Bach, Conn, Courtois, Edwards, Getzen, Jupiter, King, Rath, Schilke, S.E. Shires, Thein, Wessex, Willson and Yamaha.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29838", "revid": "4751563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29838", "title": "The Simpsons", "text": "American animated sitcom\nThe Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening and developed by Groening, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon for the Fox Broadcasting Company. It is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Set in the fictional town of Springfield, in an unspecified location in the United States, it caricatures society, Western culture, television and the human condition.\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to \"simpleton\". The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour primetime show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u20131990).\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, episodes of the show have been broadcast. It is the longest-running American animated series, longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in seasons and individual episodes. A feature-length film, \"The Simpsons Movie\" (2007), was released in theaters worldwide to critical and commercial success, with a sequel, \"The Simpsons 2\" (2027), set to release on July 23, 2027. The series has also spawned numerous comic book series, video games, books and other related media, as well as a billion-dollar merchandising industry. \"The Simpsons\" was initially a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th Television; 20th Television's involvement was later moved to 20th Television Animation, a separate unit of Disney Television Studios. On April 2, 2025, the show was renewed for four additional seasons on Fox, with 15 episodes and two Disney+ specials each, bringing the episode total from 790 to 858.\n\"The Simpsons\" received widespread acclaim throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered its \"golden age\". Since then, it has been criticized for a perceived decline in quality. \"Time\" named it the 20th century's best television series, and Erik Adams of \"The A.V. Club\" named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\". On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and 2 Peabody Awards. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase of \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while \"The Simpsons\" has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcom television series.\nPremise.\nCharacters.\nThe main characters are the Simpson family, who live in the fictional \"Middle America\" town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge (n\u00e9e Bouvier), a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie (named by Bart), the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.\nThe family also owns a greyhound, Santa's Little Helper, (who first appeared in the episode \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\") and a cat, Snowball II, who is replaced by a cat, also named Snowball II, in the fifteenth-season episode \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\". Extended members of the Simpson and Bouvier family in the main cast include Homer's father Abe and Marge's sisters Patty and Selma. Marge's mother Jacqueline and Homer's mother Mona appear less frequently.\nThe show includes a vast array of quirky supporting characters, which include Homer's friends Barney Gumble, Lenny Leonard, and Carl Carlson; the school principal Seymour Skinner and staff members such as Edna Krabappel and Groundskeeper Willie; students such as Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum; shopkeepers such as Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Comic Book Guy, and Moe Szyslak; government figures Mayor \"Diamond\" Joe Quimby and Clancy Wiggum; next-door neighbor Ned Flanders; local celebrities such as Krusty the Clown and news reporter Kent Brockman; nuclear tycoon Montgomery Burns and his devoted assistant Waylon Smithers; and many more.\nThe creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show \"SCTV\".\nContinuity and the floating timeline.\nDespite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters never age. The series uses a floating timeline in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, the 1991 episodes \"The Way We Was\" and \"I Married Marge\" depict Homer and Marge as high schoolers in the 1970s who had Bart (who is always 10 years old) in the early '80s, while the 2008 episode \"That '90s Show\" depicts Homer and Marge as a childless couple in the '90s, and the 2021 episode \"Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars\" portrays Homer as an adolescent in the same period. The 1995 episode \"Lisa's Wedding\" takes place during Lisa's college years in the then-future year of 2010, the same year the show began airing its 22nd season, in which Lisa was still 8. In 2015, the show reached the point where, had the characters been allowed to age in real time, Bart would have been older than Homer was in the first episode. Regarding the contradictory flashbacks, Selman stated that \"they all kind of happened in their imaginary world\".\nThe show follows a loose and inconsistent continuity. For example, Krusty the Clown may be able to read in one episode, but not in another. However, it is consistently portrayed that he is Jewish, that his father was a rabbi, and that his career began in the 1960s. The latter point introduces another snag in the floating timeline: historical periods that are a core part of a character's backstory remain so even when their age makes it unlikely or impossible, such as Grampa Simpson and Principal Skinner's respective service in World War II and Vietnam.\nThe only episodes not part of the series' main canon are the \"Treehouse of Horror\" episodes, which often feature the deaths of main characters. Characters who die in \"regular\" episodes, such as Maude Flanders, Mona Simpson, Edna Krabappel, etc, however, stay dead. An exception to this is Hans Moleman, who is often killed in his appearances \u2013 as of 2019[ [update]] he has been killed 26 times only to reappear later. Most episodes end with the status quo being restored, though occasionally major changes will stick, such as Lisa's conversions to vegetarianism and Buddhism, the divorce of Milhouse van Houten's parents, and the marriage and subsequent parenthood of Apu and Manjula.\nSetting.\n\"The Simpsons\" takes place in a fictional American town called Springfield. Although there are many real settlements in America named Springfield, the town the show is set in is fictional. The state it is in is not established. In fact, the show is intentionally evasive with regard to Springfield's location. Springfield's geography and that of its surroundings is inconsistent: from one episode to another, it may have coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series \"Father Knows Best\". He \"figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do.\" Many landmarks, including street names, have connections to Portland.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nWhen producer James L. Brooks was working on the television variety show \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist Matt Groening's \"Life in Hell\" comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his \"Life in Hell\" series. However, Groening later realized that animating \"Life in Hell\" would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons. He named the characters after his own family members, substituting \"Bart\" for his own name, adopting an anagram of the word \"brat\".\nThe Simpson family first appeared as shorts in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. The colorist, \"Georgie\" Gyorgyi Kovacs Peluce (Kov\u00e1cs Gy\u00f6rgyike) made the characters yellow; as Bart, Lisa, and Maggie have no hairlines, she felt they would look strange if they were flesh-colored. Groening supported the decision, saying: \"Marge is yellow with blue hair? That's hilarious \u2014 let's do it!\"\nIn 1989, a team of production companies adapted \"The Simpsons\" into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called \"the mainstream trash\" that they were watching. The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". \"Some Enchanted Evening\" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems. In 1992, Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success. The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of \"The Simpsons\"\u2014a claim rejected by the courts.\nExecutive producers and showrunners.\nList of showrunners throughout the series' run:\nMatt Groening and James L. Brooks have served as executive producers during the show's entire history, and also function as creative consultants. Sam Simon, described by former \"Simpsons\" director Brad Bird as \"the unsung hero\" of the show, served as creative supervisor for the first four seasons. He was constantly at odds with Groening, Brooks and the show's production company Gracie Films and left in 1993. Before leaving, he negotiated a deal that sees him receive a share of the profits every year, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993, at least until his death in 2015. A more involved position on the show is the showrunner, who acts as head writer and manages the show's production for an entire season.\nWriting.\nThe first team of writers, assembled by Sam Simon, consisted of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen, and Wallace Wolodarsky. Newer \"Simpsons\"' writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the beginning of each December. The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, inserting scenes, and calling for re-readings of lines by the show's vocal performers. Until 2004, George Meyer, who had developed the show since the first season, was active in these sessions. According to long-time writer Jon Vitti, Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even though other writers may receive script credits. Each episode takes approximately six months to produce, so the show rarely comments on current events.\nCredited with sixty episodes, John Swartzwelder is the most prolific writer on \"The Simpsons\". One of the best-known former writers is Conan O'Brien, who contributed to several episodes in the early 1990s before replacing David Letterman as host of the talk show \"Late Night\". English comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode \"Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife\", becoming the first celebrity both to write and guest star in the same episode. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, writers of the film \"Superbad\", wrote the episode \"Homer the Whopper\", with Rogen voicing a character in it.\nAt the end of 2007, the writers of \"The Simpsons\" went on strike together with the other members of the Writers Guild of America, East. The show's writers had joined the guild in 1998.\nIn May 2023, the writers of \"The Simpsons\" went on strike together with the other members of the Writers Guild of America, East.\nVoice actors.\n\"The Simpsons\" has six main cast members: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. Castellaneta voices Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Barney Gumble, and other adult male characters. Julie Kavner voices Marge Simpson, Patty, Selma, as well as several minor characters. Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed. Cartwright voices Bart Simpson, Maggie Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, and other children. Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson, is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character, although she occasionally plays other episodic characters. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high, so she was given the role of Lisa instead. Cartwright was originally brought in to voice Lisa, but upon arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the \"middle child\" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as \"devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever\". Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot. Cartwright is the only one of the six main \"Simpsons\" cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show. Azaria and Shearer do not voice members of the title family, but play a majority of the male townspeople. Azaria, who has been a part of the main voice cast since the second season in one episode \"Old Money\" and then perpetually part of the regular main voice cast since the third season, voices recurring characters such as Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, and Professor Frink. Shearer provides voices for Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers, Principal Skinner, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, and formerly Dr. Hibbert. Every main cast member has won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance.\nWith one exception, episode credits list only the voice actors, and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists. However, the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode \"Old Money\", because the producers said the voice actors should receive credit for their work. In 2003, the cast appeared in an episode of \"Inside the Actors Studio\", doing live performances of their characters' voices.\nThe six main actors were paid $30,000 per episode, until 1998, when they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but series creator Groening supported the actors in their action. The issue was soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode. The show's revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales, and in April 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode. The strike was resolved a month later and their salaries were increased to between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode. In 2008, production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a \"healthy bump\" in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode. The negotiations were soon completed, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, the cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.\nIn addition to the main cast, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, and Russi Taylor voice supporting characters. From 1999 to 2002, Roswell's characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven. Karl Wiedergott has also appeared in minor roles, but does not voice any recurring characters. Wiedergott left the show in 2010, and since then Chris Edgerly has appeared regularly to voice minor characters. Repeat \"special guest\" cast members include Albert Brooks, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, Maurice LaMarche, and Kelsey Grammer. Following Hartman's death in 1998, the characters he voiced (Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz) were retired; Wallace's character of Edna Krabappel was retired as well after her death in 2013. Following Taylor's death in 2019, her characters (including Sherri, Terri, and Martin Prince) are now voiced by Grey Griffin.\nEpisodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode \"Dancin' Homer\". \"The Simpsons\" holds the world record for \"Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series\".\n\"The Simpsons\" has been dubbed into several other languages, including Japanese, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong \"Simpsons\" fans in the area.\nAnimation.\nSeveral different American and international studios animate \"The Simpsons\". Throughout the run of the animated shorts on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo. With the debut of the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to several local and foreign studios. These are AKOM, Anivision, Rough Draft Studios, USAnimation, and Toonzone Entertainment.\nFor the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated \"The Simpsons\" in the United States. In 1992, the show's production company, Gracie Films, switched domestic production to Film Roman, who continued to animate the show until 2016 when they were replaced by Fox Television Animation, which allowed the show to be made more in-house. In the first episode of Season 14, production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint. The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was \"Radioactive Man\" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the season 12 episode \"Tennis the Menace\", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed \"Tennis the Menace\" was broadcast as made.\nThe production staff at the American animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, ink and paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later.\nThe series began high-definition production in season 20; the first episode, \"Take My Life, Please\", aired February 15, 2009. The move to HDTV included a new opening sequence. Matt Groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation.\nThemes.\n\"The Simpsons\" uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, \"The Simpsons\"' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of television channels, which enables the producers to make jokes about the entertainment industry and the press.\nSome commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias. Al Jean acknowledged in an interview that \"We [the show] are of liberal bent.\" The writers often evince an appreciation for progressive leanings, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum. The show portrays government and large corporations as evil entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In \"The Simpsons\", politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are dismissive to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent. Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.\nSexuality is often a source of jokes in the series or serves as the theme of certain episodes. Even though homosexuals are sometimes sources of gags, the series often comments on how American society treats them, with \"Homer's Phobia\" devoting an entire episode to the family making a gay friend and Homer's initial hostility to him. In 1990, \"The Simpsons\" became the first animated early evening show to depict a kiss between two men in \"Simpson and Delilah\".\nHallmarks.\nOpening sequence.\n\"The Simpsons\"' opening sequence is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. The standard opening has gone through three iterations (a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season, and a brand new sequence when the show switched to high-definition in 2009).\nEach has the same basic sequence of events: the camera zooms through cumulus clouds, through the show's title towards the town of Springfield. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by David Silverman, and was the first task he did when production began on the show. The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro-style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone (or occasionally a different instrument), and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.\nHalloween episodes.\nThe special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition. \"Treehouse of Horror\" first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode. These pieces usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres. They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the \"Treehouse\" series is meant to be seen on Halloween, this changed by the 2000s (and again in 2020), when new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox's current contract with Major League Baseball's World Series. Prior to 2020 (between 2011 and 2019), every \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode had aired in October.\nHumor.\nThe show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, billboards, and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show or viewing it in slow motion. Kristin Thompson argues that \"The Simpsons\" uses a \"flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.\"\nOne of Bart's early hallmarks was his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak where he asks for a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.\nMoe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis \"Red\" Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side. As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season. \"The Simpsons\" also often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting. For example, the episode \"She Used to Be My Girl\" included a scene in which a Fox News Channel van drove down the street while displaying a large \"Bush Cheney 2004\" banner and playing Queen's \"We Are the Champions\", in reference to the 2004 U.S. presidential election and claims of conservative bias in Fox News.\nThe show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each. Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt \"D'oh!\", Mr. Burns' \"Excellent\" and Nelson Muntz's \"\"Ha\"-ha!\" Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as \"\u00a1Ay, caramba!\", \"Don't have a cow, man!\" and \"Eat my shorts!\" appeared on T-shirts in the show's early days. However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode \"Bart Gets Famous\" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the \"Krusty the Clown Show\" solely for saying \"I didn't do it\".\nPurported foreshadowing of actual events.\n\"The Simpsons\" has gained notoriety for jokes that appeared to become reality. Perhaps the most famous example comes from the episode \"Bart to the Future\", which mentions billionaire Donald Trump having been president of the United States at one time and leaving the nation broke. The episode first aired in 2000, sixteen years before Trump (who at the time was exploring a presidential run) was elected. Another episode, \"When You Dish Upon a Star\", lampooned 20th Century Fox as a division of The Walt Disney Company. Nineteen years later, Disney purchased Fox. Other examples purported as \"The Simpsons\" predicting the future include the introduction of the smartwatch, video chat services, Richard Branson's spaceflight and Lady Gaga's acrobatic performance at the Super Bowl LI halftime show.\nAl Jean has commented on the show's purported ability to predict the future, explaining that they are really just \"educated guesses\" and stating that \"if you throw enough darts, you're going to get some bullseyes.\" Producer Bill Oakley stated, \"There are very few cases where \"The Simpsons\" predicted something. It's mainly just coincidence because the episodes are so old that history repeats itself.\" Fact-checking sources such as Snopes have debunked many of the claimed prophecies, explaining that the show's extensive run means \"a lot of jokes, and a lot of opportunities for coincidences to appear\" and \"most of these 'predictions' have rather simple and mundane explanations\". For example, the device shown on \"The Simpsons\" with autocorrection is an Apple Newton, a real 1993 device notorious for its poor handwriting recognition. Technologically advanced watches have appeared in numerous works of fiction, decades before \"The Simpsons\".\nInfluence and legacy.\nIdioms.\nA number of neologisms that originated on \"The Simpsons\" have entered popular vernacular. Mark Liberman, director of the Linguistic Data Consortium, remarked, \"\"The Simpsons\" has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture's greatest source of idioms, catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions.\" The most famous catchphrase is Homer's annoyed grunt: \"D'oh!\" So ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", but without the apostrophe. Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson, an actor in many Laurel and Hardy comedies, who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of \"The Simpsons\" told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known exclamation in the television series.\nGroundskeeper Willie's description of the French as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\" was used by \"National Review\" columnist Jonah Goldberg in 2003, after France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. The phrase quickly spread to other journalists. \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Cromulent\" and \"embiggen\", words used in \"Lisa the Iconoclast\", have since appeared in the Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon, and scientific journals respectively. \"Kwyjibo\", a fake \"Scrabble\" word invented by Bart in \"Bart the Genius\", was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm. \"I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\", was used by Kent Brockman in \"Deep Space Homer\" and has become a snowclone, with variants of the utterance used to express obsequious submission. It has been used in media, such as \"New Scientist\" magazine. The dismissive term \"Meh\", believed to have been popularized by the show, entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008. Other words credited as stemming from the show include \"yoink\" and \"craptacular\".\n\"The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations\" includes several quotations from the show. As well as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\", Homer's lines, \"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try\", from \"Burns' Heir\" (season five, 1994) as well as \"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\", from \"Eight Misbehavin'\" (season 11, 1999), entered the dictionary in August 2007.\nMany quotes/scenes have become popular Internet memes, including Jasper Beardley's quote \"That's a paddlin'\" from \"The PTA Disbands\" (season 6, 1995) and \"Steamed Hams\" from \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" (season 7, 1996).\nTelevision.\n\"The Simpsons\" was the first successful animated program in American prime-time since \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\" in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, American pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. \"The Simpsons\" changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like \"Capitol Critters\", \"Fish Police\", and \"Family Dog\", which were expensive and unsuccessful. \"The Simpsons\"' use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of \"The Simpsons\" and the lower production cost prompted American television networks to take chances on other adult animated series. This development led American producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows for adults, such as \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"South Park\", \"Family Guy\", \"King of the Hill\", \"Futurama\" (which was created by Matt Groening), and \"The Critic\" (which was also produced by Gracie Films). For \"Family Guy\" creator Seth MacFarlane, \"\"The Simpsons\" created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years\u00a0... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways\u2014you could classify it as\u2014a wholly new medium.\"\n\"The Simpsons\" has had crossovers with four other shows. In the episode \"A Star Is Burns\", Marge invites Jay Sherman, the main character of \"The Critic\", to be a judge for a film festival in Springfield. Matt Groening had his name removed from the episode since he had no involvement with \"The Critic\". \"South Park\" later paid homage to \"The Simpsons\" with the episode \"Simpsons Already Did It\". In \"Simpsorama\", the Planet Express crew from \"Futurama\" come to Springfield in the present to prevent the Simpsons from destroying the future. In the \"Family Guy\" episode \"The Simpsons Guy\", the Griffins visit Springfield and meet the Simpsons.\n\"The Simpsons\" has also influenced live-action shows like \"Malcolm in the Middle\", which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms. \"Malcolm in the Middle\" debuted January 9, 2000, in the time slot after \"The Simpsons\". Ricky Gervais called \"The Simpsons\" an influence on \"The Office\", and fellow British sitcom \"Spaced\" was, according to its director Edgar Wright, \"an attempt to do a live-action \"The Simpsons\"\". In Georgia, the animated television sitcom \"The Samsonadzes\", launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with \"The Simpsons\", which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged.\nLGBTQ representation.\n\"The Simpsons\" has historically been open to portrayals of LGBTQ characters and settings, and it has routinely challenged heteronormativity. It was one of several animated television shows in the United States that began introducing characters that were LGBTQ, both openly and implied, in the 1990s. While early episodes involving LGBTQ characters primarily included them through the use of stereotypes, \"The Simpsons\" developed several prominent LGBTQ characters over its run. Producers of the show, such as Matt Groening and Al Jean, have expressed their opinion that LGBTQ representation in media is important, and that they seek to actively include it. Some characters, such as Julio, were created with their sexual orientation in mind, with it being central to their character. The show expanded its roster of openly LGBTQ characters through episodes in which prominent characters Patty Bouvier and Waylon Smithers came out in seasons 16 and 27, respectively.\nRelease.\nRenewals.\nOn January 26, 2023, the series was renewed for its 35th and 36th seasons, taking the show through the 2024\u201325 television season. The two seasons contain a combined total of 51 episodes. Seven of these episodes are season 34 holdovers, while the other 44 will be produced in the production cycle of the upcoming seasons, bringing the show's overall episode total up to 801. Season 35 premiered on October 1, 2023. Season 36 premiered on September 29, 2024.\nOn April 2, 2025, it was announced that \"The Simpsons\" would be renewed for four more seasons in what is considered a \"mega deal\" with parent company Disney. This renewal will take the show through the 2028\u20132029 television season, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the show. Each season will consist of 15 episodes.\nSyndication.\nIn the United States, the cable television network FXX, a sibling of 20th Television and formerly the Fox network, has exclusive cable and digital syndication rights for \"The Simpsons.\" Original contracts had previously stated that syndication rights for \"The Simpsons\" would not be sold to cable until the series conclusion, at a time when cable syndication deals were highly rare. The series has been syndicated to local broadcast stations in nearly all markets throughout the United States since September 1994.\nFXX premiered \"The Simpsons\" on their network on August 21, 2014, by starting a twelve-day marathon which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including \"The Simpsons Movie\", which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. It was the longest continuous marathon in the history of television (until VH1 Classic aired a 433-hour, nineteen-day, marathon of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2015; celebrating that program's 40th anniversary). The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled those of regular prime time programming for FXX. Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night. In Australia, a marathon of every episode of the show (at the time) aired from December 16, 2019, to January 5, 2020, on Fox8 (a cable network operated on pay TV provider Foxtel and a corporate sibling to the American Fox network). In Canada, Bell Media's Much and Rogers Media's FXX Canada syndicate the series as of January 2025.\nAfter Disney acquired both 20th Television and FX Networks, it was announced that \"The Simpsons\" would air on the company's Freeform channel starting October 2, 2019.\nStreaming and digital sell-through.\nOn October 21, 2014, a digital service courtesy of the FXNOW app, called \"Simpsons World\", launched with every episode of the series accessible to authenticated FX subscribers, and is available on game consoles such as Xbox One, streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and online via web browser. There was early criticism of both wrong aspect ratios for earlier episodes and the length of commercial breaks on the streaming service, but that problem was soon amended with fewer commercial breaks during individual episodes. Later it was announced that \"Simpsons World\" would now let users watch all of the SD episodes in their original format. \"Simpsons World\" was discontinued after the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019, where the series streams exclusively. Initially, the series was only available cropped to without the option to view the original versions, reigniting criticisms of cropping old episodes. In response, Disney announced that \"in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from season 20) of \"The Simpsons\" available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series.\" On May 28, 2020, Disney+ made the first 19 seasons, along with some episodes from season 20, of \"The Simpsons\" available in both 16:9 and the original 4:3 aspect ratio. Season 31 came to Disney+ on October 2, 2020, with Hulu streaming the latest episodes of season 32 the next day. Season 32 came to Disney+ on September 29, 2021.\nThe season 3 premiere \"Stark Raving Dad\", which features Michael Jackson as the voice of Leon Kompowsky, was pulled out of rotation in 2019 by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Al Jean after HBO aired the documentary \"Leaving Neverland\", in which two men share details into how Jackson allegedly abused them as children. It is therefore unavailable on Disney+. However, the episode is still available on \"The Complete Third Season\" DVD box set released on August 26, 2003.\nIn July 2017, all episodes from seasons 4 to 19 were made available for purchase on the iTunes Store in Canada.\nOn August 10, 2024, it was announced that four episodes of season 36 would air exclusively on Disney+.\nReception and achievements.\nEarly success.\n\"The Simpsons\" was the Fox network's first television series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed \"Bartmania\". He became the most prevalent \"Simpsons\" character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as \"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\" and \"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\". \"The Simpsons\" merchandise sold well and generated $2\u00a0billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. Because of his popularity, Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot.\nDue to the show's success, over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided to switch \"The Simpsons\"' time slot from 8:00\u00a0p.m. ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it competed with \"The Cosby Show\" on NBC, the number one show at the time. Through the summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed \"Bill vs. Bart\" rivalry. \"Bart Gets an 'F'\" (season two, 1990) was the first episode to air against \"The Cosby Show\", and it received a lower Nielsen rating, tying for eighth behind \"The Cosby Show\", which had an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6\u00a0million viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network, and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of \"The Simpsons\". The show moved back to its Sunday slot in 1994 and has remained there ever since.\n\"The Simpsons\" has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, and it has been noted for being described as \"the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air\". In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described it as \"the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons. It's this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons.\" Tucker also described the show as a \"pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family.\"\nRun length achievements.\nOn February 9, 1997, \"The Simpsons\" surpassed \"The Flintstones\" with the episode \"The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show\" as the longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States. In 2004, \"The Simpsons\" replaced \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or live action) in the United States in terms of the number of years airing. In 2009, \"The Simpsons\" surpassed \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\"'s record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's longest running sitcom (in terms of episode count). In October 2004, \"Scooby-Doo\" briefly overtook \"The Simpsons\" as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes (albeit under several different iterations). However, network executives in April 2005 again canceled \"Scooby-Doo\", which finished with 371 episodes, and \"The Simpsons\" reclaimed the title with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season. In May 2007, \"The Simpsons\" reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season. While \"The Simpsons\" has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed \"The Simpsons\". For example, the Japanese anime series \"Sazae-san\" has over 2,000 episodes (7,000+ segments) to its credit.\nIn 2009, Fox began a year-long celebration of the show titled \"Best. 20 Years. Ever.\" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of \"The Simpsons\". One of the first parts of the celebration is the \"Unleash Your Yellow\" contest in which entrants must design a poster for the show. The celebration ended on January 10, 2010 (almost 20 years after \"Bart the Genius\" aired on January 14, 1990), with \"The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special\u00a0\u2013 In 3-D! On Ice!\", a documentary special by documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that examines the \"cultural phenomenon of \"The Simpsons\"\".\nAs of the twenty-first season (2009\u20132010), \"The Simpsons\" became the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, having surpassed the 1955\u20131975 run of \"Gunsmoke\". On April 29, 2018, \"The Simpsons\" also surpassed \"Gunsmoke\"'s 635-episode count with the episode \"Forgive and Regret\".\n\"The Simpsons\" is both the longest-running and the highest ranking animated series to feature on TV Time's top 50 most followed TV shows ever.\nOn February 6, 2019, it was announced that \"The Simpsons\" has been renewed for seasons 31 and 32.\nOn March 3, 2021, it was announced that \"The Simpsons\" was renewed for seasons 33 and 34.\nAwards and honors.\n\"The Simpsons\" has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. In a 1999 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, \"Time\" named \"The Simpsons\" the century's best television series, writing: \"Dazzlingly intelligent and unapologetically vulgar, the Simpsons have surpassed the humor, topicality and, yes, humanity of past TV greats.\" In that same issue, \"Time\" included Bart Simpson in the \"\", the publication's list of the century's 100 most influential people. Bart was the only fictional character on the list. On January 14, 2000, the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Also in 2000, \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named \"The Simpsons\" the greatest television show of the 1990s. Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 have voted \"The Simpsons\" at the top of two polls: 2001's 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows (despite the show not being aimed at children), and 2005's The 100 Greatest Cartoons, with Homer Simpson voted into first place in 2001's 100 Greatest TV Characters. Homer also placed ninth on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV icons\". \nIn 2002, \"The Simpsons\" ranked No. 8 on \"TV Guide\"'s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and was ranked the No. 6 cult show in 2004. In 2007, it moved to No. 8 on TV Guide's cult shows list and was included in \"Time\"'s list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\". In 2008 the show was placed in first on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s \"Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 Years\". \"Empire\" named it the greatest TV show of all time. In 2010, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named Homer \"the greatest character of the last 20 years\", while in 2013 the Writers Guild of America listed \"The Simpsons\" as the 11th \"best written\" series in television history. In 2013, TV Guide ranked \"The Simpsons\" as the greatest TV cartoon of all time and the tenth greatest show of all time. A 2015 \"The Hollywood Reporter\" survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named it as their No. 10 favorite show. In 2015, British newspaper \"The Telegraph\" named \"The Simpsons\" as one of the 10 best TV sitcoms of all time. Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked \"The Simpsons\" as the greatest American TV series of all time in their 2016 book \"TV (The Book)\". In 2022, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"The Simpsons\" as the second-greatest TV show of all time. In 2023, \"Variety\" ranked \"The Simpsons\" as the fourth-greatest TV show of all time.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Criticism.\nControversy.\nBart's rebellious, bad boy nature, which underlies his misbehavior and rarely leads to any punishment, led some people to characterize him as a poor role model for children. In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a \"threat to learning\" because of his \"underachiever and proud of it\" attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as \"egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited\". In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him \"angry, confused, frustrated\". In response, Matt Groening said, \"That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal [and] he thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do.\" On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in the form of a short segment that aired three days later before a rerun of \"Stark Raving Dad\" in which Bart replied, \"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\"\nThe show also received criticism from the nuclear power industry in its early years, with its portrayal of the evil boss Mr. Burns and \"bungling idiot\" employees (including Homer Simpson himself) with their lack of safety and security. In a letter to the nuclear power-backed U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, producer Sam Simon apologized, stating, \"I apologize that the Simpsons have offended a lot of people in the energy industry. I agree with you that in real life, Homer Simpson would not be employed at a nuclear power plant. On the other hand, he probably wouldn't be employed anywhere.\"\nVarious episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in \"Bart vs. Australia\" (season six, 1995) and Brazil in \"Blame It on Lisa\" (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board\u2014which claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations\u2014went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode \"A Star Is Burns\" (season six, 1995), which featured a crossover with \"The Critic\". He felt that it was just an advertisement for \"The Critic\", and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode \"violates the Simpsons' universe\". In response, Brooks said, \"I am furious with Matt,\u00a0... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far.\u00a0... his behavior right now is rotten.\"\n\"The Principal and the Pauper\" (season nine, 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of \"The Simpsons\". Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \"That's \"so\" wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\"\nBans.\nThe show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries. China banned it from prime-time television in August 2006, \"in an effort to protect China's struggling animation studios\". In 2008, Venezuela barred the show from airing on morning television as it was deemed \"unsuitable for children\". The same year, several Russian Pentecostal churches demanded that \"The Simpsons\", \"South Park\" and some other Western cartoons be removed from broadcast schedules \"for propaganda of various vices\" and the broadcaster's license to be revoked. However, a court decision later dismissed this request.\nPerceived decline in quality.\nCritics' reviews of early \"Simpsons\" episodes praised the show for its sassy humor, wit, realism, and intelligence. However, in the late 1990s, around the airing of season nine, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show \"tired\". By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show, and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics. Jim Schembri of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" attributed the decline in quality to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favor of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote in 2011: \"The central tragedy of \"The Simpsons\" is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention-seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue.\"\nIn 2010, the BBC noted \"the common consensus is that \"The Simpsons\"' golden era ended after season nine\", and Todd Leopold of CNN, in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated \"for many fans\u00a0... the glory days are long past.\" Similarly, Tyler Wilson of \"Coeur d'Alene Press\" has referred to seasons one to nine as the show's \"golden age\", and Ian Nathan of \"Empire\" described the show's classic era as being \"say, the first ten seasons\". Jon Heacock of LucidWorks stated that \"for the first ten years [seasons], the show was consistently at the top of its game\", with \"so many moments, quotations, and references \u2013 both epic and obscure \u2013 that helped turn the Simpson family into the cultural icons that they remain to this day\".\nMike Scully, who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve, has been the subject of criticism. Chris Suellentrop of \"Slate\" wrote that \"under Scully's tenure, \"The Simpsons\" became, well, a cartoon\u00a0... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck. The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years.\" When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked: \"Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever.\"\nAl Jean, who was showrunner during seasons thirteen through thirty-three, has also been the subject of criticism, with some arguing that the show has continued to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is \"on auto-pilot\", \"too sentimental\", and the episodes are \"just being cranked out\". Some critics believe that the show has \"entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny\". John Ortved, author of \"\", characterized the Jean era as \"toothless\", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: \"Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't.\"\nIn 2004, cast member Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: \"I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now.\" Cast member Dan Castellaneta responded: \"I don't agree,\u00a0... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh.\" Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as \"hogwash\", saying \"\"The Simpsons\" hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now.\" In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: \"I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will get too financially cumbersome\u00a0... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, the stories do things that we haven't done before, so creatively there's no reason to quit.\"\nIn 2016, popular culture writer Anna Leszkiewicz suggested that even though \"The Simpsons\" still holds cultural relevance, \"contemporary appeal\" is only for the \"first ten or so seasons\", with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4\u00a0million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2\u00a0million viewers.\nAlan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz argued in their 2016 book titled \"TV (The Book)\" that the peak of \"The Simpsons\" are \"roughly seasons 3\u201312\", and that despite the decline, episodes from the later seasons such as \"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\" and \"Holidays of Future Passed\" could be considered on par with the earlier classic episodes, further stating that \"even if you want to call the show today a thin shadow of its former self, think about how mind-boggingly great its former self had to be for so-diminished a version to be watchable at all.\"\nIn 2020, Uproxx writer Josh Kurp stated that while he agrees with the sentiment that \"The Simpsons\" is not as good as it used to be, it is because \"it was working at a level of comedy and characterization that no show ever has.\" He felt there were still many reasons to watch the series, as it was \"still capable of quality television, and even the occasional new classic\" and the fact that the show was willing to experiment, giving examples such as bringing on guest animators like Don Hertzfeldt and Sylvain Chomet to produce couch gags, and guest writers like Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Pete Holmes and Megan Amram to write episodes. In the season thirty-two episode \"I, Carumbus\", the show itself makes a nod to these concerns in its credits gag where the god Jupiter notes that \"It definitely feels like they're wrapping it up\u00a0... any day now.\"\nIn a 2021 interview with \"NME\", Jean was quoted as saying, \"To people who say \"The Simpsons\" isn't as good as it used to be, I would say I think the world isn't as good as it used to be. But we're declining at a slower rate.\"\nA counter-narrative since mid-2023 has asserted that\u2014with seasons thirty-three and thirty-four\u2014the show started to become \"good again\". \"ScreenRant\" asserted that season thirty-four was \"seen as a return to form\" and had been interpreted by reviewers as a \"comeback\". They then wrote of season thirty-five that there was \"no denying that there has been an obvious uptick in quality beginning as early as season 33\".\nRace controversy.\nThe stereotypical nature of the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has been the subject of controversy. Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu stated in his 2017 documentary \"The Problem with Apu\" that as a child he was a fan of \"The Simpsons\" and liked Apu, but he now finds the character's stereotypical nature troublesome. Defenders of the character responded that the show is built on comical stereotypes, with creator Matt Groening saying, \"that's the nature of cartooning.\" He added that he was \"proud of what we do on the show\", and \"it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended\". In response to the controversy, Apu's voice actor, Hank Azaria, said he was willing to step aside from his role as Apu: \"The most important thing is to listen to South Asian people, Indian people in this country when they talk about what they feel and how they think about this character.\" In February 2020, he confirmed that he would no longer voice Apu. Groening stated at the same time that the character would remain in the show.\nThe criticisms were referenced in the season 29 episode \"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\", when Lisa breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience by saying, \"Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?\" to which Marge replies, \"Some things will be addressed at a later date.\" Lisa adds, \"If at all.\" This reference was clarified by the fact that there was a framed photo of Apu with the caption on the photo saying \"Don't have a cow, Apu\", a play on Bart's catchphrase \"Don't have a cow, man\", as well as the fact that many Hindus do not eat cows as they are considered sacred. In October 2018, it was reported that Apu would be written out of the show, which Groening denied.\nOn June 26, 2020, in light of the various Black Lives Matter protests, Fox announced that recurring characters of color (Carl Carlson and Dr. Hibbert, among others) would no longer be voiced by white actors. Beginning with season 32, Carl, a black character originally voiced by Azaria, is now voiced by black actor Alex D\u00e9sert. In addition, Bumblebee Man, a Spanish-speaking Latino character also originally voiced by Azaria, is now voiced by Mexican-American actor Eric Lopez, and Dr. Hibbert, a black character originally voiced by Harry Shearer, is now voiced by black actor Kevin Michael Richardson.\nOther media.\nComic books.\nNumerous Simpson-related comic books have been released over the years. The first comic strips based on \"The Simpsons\" appeared in 1991 in the magazine \"Simpsons Illustrated\", which was a companion magazine to the show. The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book titled \"Simpsons Comics and Stories\", containing four different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans. The book was a success and due to this, Groening and his companions Bill Morrison, Mike Rote, and Steve and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo Comics. A total of nine comic book series were published by Bongo Comics between 1993 and the company's dissolution in 2018. Issues of \"Simpsons Comics\", \"Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror\" and \"Bart Simpson\" have been collected and reprinted in trade paperbacks in the United States by HarperCollins.\nFilm.\n20th Century Fox and Gracie Films produced \"The Simpsons Movie\", an animated film that was released on July 27, 2007. The film was directed by long-time \"Simpsons\" producer David Silverman and written by a team of \"Simpsons\" writers comprising Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Al Jean, George Meyer, Mike Reiss, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, David Mirkin, Mike Scully, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded. There had been talk of a possible feature-length \"Simpsons\" film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode \"Kamp Krusty\" was suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length. For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project.\nOn August 10, 2018, 20th Century Fox announced that a sequel is in development. In September 2025, a sequel was officially announced to be in production, set for theatrical release on July 23, 2027.\nMusic.\nCollections of original music featured in the series have been released on the albums \"Songs in the Key of Springfield\", \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons\" and \"\". Several songs have been recorded with the purpose of a single or album release and have not been featured on the show. The album \"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\" was released in September 1990 and was a success, peaking at No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and becoming certified 2\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The first single from the album was the pop rap song \"Do the Bartman\", performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. The song had backing vocals by Michael Jackson, although he did not receive any credit. \"The Yellow Album\" was released in 1998, but received poor reception and did not chart in any country.\n\"The Simpsons\" Ride.\nIn 2007, it was officially announced that \"The Simpsons Ride\", a simulator ride, would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood. It officially opened May 15, 2008, in Florida and May 19, 2008, in Hollywood. In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. However, Sideshow Bob is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. It features more than 24 regular characters from \"The Simpsons\" and features the voices of the regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer did not participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts. The ride also features clips from the show in the waiting line.\nVideo games.\nNumerous video games based on the show have been produced. Some of the early games include Konami's arcade game \"The Simpsons\" (1991) and Acclaim Entertainment's ' (1991). More modern games include ' (2001), \"\" (2003) and \"The Simpsons Game\" (2007). Electronic Arts, which produced \"The Simpsons Game\", has owned the exclusive rights to create video games based on the show since 2005. In 2010, they released a game called \"The Simpsons Arcade\" for iOS. Another EA-produced mobile game, \"Tapped Out\", was released in 2012 for iOS users, then in 2013 for Android and Kindle users. Two \"Simpsons\" pinball machines have been produced: one that was available briefly after the first season, and another in 2007, both out of production.\nMerchandise.\nThe popularity of \"The Simpsons\" has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. \"The Simpsons\" has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including Clue, Scrabble, Monopoly, Operation, and The Game of Life, as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons \"Jeopardy!\". Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial \"Simpsons\" books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of \"Chappelle's Show\". In particular, seasons one through seventeen were released on DVD for 13 years between September 2001 to December 2014 in the U.S./Canada (Region 1), Europe (Region 2), and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4). However, on April 8, 2015, Al Jean announced that the season 17 DVD would be the last one ever produced, leaving the collection from seasons 1 to 17, season 20 (released out of order in 2010), with seasons 18, 19, and 21 onwards unreleased. Jean also stated that the deleted scenes and commentaries would try to be released to the Simpsons World app, and that they were pushing for Simpsons World to be expanded outside of the U.S. Two years later, however, on July 22, 2017, it was announced that season 18 would be released on December 5, 2017, on DVD. Another two years later, on July 20, 2019, it was announced that season 19 would be released on December 3, 2019, on DVD.\nIn 2003, about 500 companies around the world were licensed to use \"Simpsons\" characters in their advertising. As a promotion for \"The Simpsons Movie\", twelve 7-Eleven stores were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts and sold \"The Simpsons\" related products. These included \"Buzz Cola\", \"Krusty-O\" cereal, pink doughnuts with sprinkles, and \"Squishees\".\nIn 2008, consumers around the world spent $750\u00a0million on merchandise related to \"The Simpsons\", with half of the amount originating from the United States. By 2009, 20th Century Fox had greatly increased merchandising efforts. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, to commemorate the show's twentieth anniversary. \"The Simpsons\" is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. Approximately one billion were printed, but only 318\u00a0million were sold, costing the Postal Service $1.2\u00a0million.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29839", "revid": "1819986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29839", "title": "Television (band)", "text": "American rock band\nTelevision was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973. The group's most prominent lineup consisted of Tom Verlaine (vocals, guitar), Richard Lloyd (guitar), Billy Ficca (drums), and Fred Smith (bass). An early fixture of CBGB and the 1970s New York rock scene, the band is considered influential in the development of punk and alternative rock.\nAlthough they recorded in a stripped-down, guitar-based manner similar to their punk contemporaries, Television's music was by comparison clean, improvisational, and technically proficient, drawing influence from jazz and 1960s rock. The group's 1977 debut album, \"Marquee Moon\", is considered one of the defining releases of the punk era.\nHistory.\nEarly history and formation.\nTelevision's roots can be traced to the teenage friendship between Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. The duo met at Sanford School in Hockessin, Delaware, from which they ran away. Both moved to New York, separately, in the early 1970s, aspiring to be poets.\nTheir first group together was the Neon Boys, consisting of Verlaine on guitar and vocals, Hell on bass and vocals and Billy Ficca on drums. The group lasted from late 1972 to March 11, 1973. A 7-inch record featuring \"That's All I Know (Right Now)\" and \"Love Comes in Spurts\" was released in 1980.\nOn March 12, 1973, the group reformed, calling themselves Television and recruiting Richard Lloyd as a second guitarist. The name, devised by Hell, was a pun on 'tell a vision' as well as a reference to reclaiming the dominant media of the era. Their first gig was at the Townhouse Theatre, on March 2, 1974. Their manager, Terry Ork, persuaded CBGB owner Hilly Kristal to give the band a regular gig at his club, where they reportedly constructed their first stage. After playing several gigs at CBGB in early 1974, they played at Max's Kansas City and other clubs, returning to CBGB in January 1975, where they established a significant cult following.\nDeparture of Richard Hell and debut release.\nInitially, songwriting was split almost equally between Hell and Verlaine, Lloyd being an infrequent contributor as well. However, friction began to develop as Verlaine, Lloyd, and Ficca became increasingly confident and adept with both instruments and composition, while Hell remained defiantly untrained in his approach. Verlaine, feeling that Hell's frenzied onstage demeanor was upstaging his songs, reportedly told him to \"stop jumping around\" during the songs and occasionally refused to play Hell's songs, such as \"Blank Generation\", in concert. This conflict, as well as one of their songs being picked up by Island Records, led Hell to leave the group and take some of his songs with him. He co-founded the Heartbreakers in 1975 with former New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan, later forming Richard Hell and the Voidoids. Fred Smith, briefly of Blondie, replaced Hell as Television's bassist.\nTelevision made their vinyl debut in 1975 with \"Little Johnny Jewel\" (Parts One and Two), a 7-inch single on the independent label Ork Records, owned by their manager, Terry Ork. Lloyd apparently disagreed with the selection of this song, preferring \"O Mi Amore\" for their debut, to the extent that he seriously considered leaving the band. Reportedly Pere Ubu guitarist Peter Laughner auditioned for his spot during this time.\n\"Marquee Moon\", \"Adventure\" and break-up (1977\u201378).\nTelevision's first album, \"Marquee Moon\", was received positively by music critics and audiences, and although failing to enter the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart, it exceeded commercial expectations in Europe, reaching the top 30 in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Upon its initial release in 1977, Roy Trakin wrote in the \"SoHo Weekly\" \"forget everything you've heard about Television, forget punk, forget New York, forget CBGB's ... hell, forget rock and roll\u2014this is the real item.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes that the album was \"revolutionary\" and composed \"entirely of tense garage rockers that spiral into heady intellectual territory, which is achieved through the group's long, interweaving instrumental sections.\"\nTelevision's second album, \"Adventure\", was recorded and released in 1978. Softer and more reflective than their debut album, \"Adventure\" was well received by critics despite modest sales. The members' independent and strongly held artistic visions, along with Lloyd's drug abuse and lack of commercial success, led to the band's break-up in July 1978. Both Lloyd and Verlaine pursued solo careers, while Ficca became the drummer for the new wave band the Waitresses.\nFinal years.\nTelevision reformed in 1992, released a self-titled third album and have performed live sporadically thereafter. After being wooed back on stage together for the 2001 All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands, England, they played a number of dates around the world on an irregular basis.\nIn 2007, Lloyd announced he would be amicably leaving the band after a midsummer show in New York City's Central Park. Due to an extended hospital stay recovering from pneumonia, he was unable to make the Central Park concert. Jimmy Rip substituted for him that day and was subsequently asked to join the band full-time in Lloyd's place. On July 7, 2011, the new lineup performed at the Beco 203 music festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In an MTV Brazil interview, the band confirmed that an album with about ten new tracks was close to being finished, but as of 2023, that album has not surfaced. In the 2010s, the band kept on touring performing \"Marquee Moon\" in its entirety; they notably did European tours in 2014 and 2016. In New York in October 2015, the band performed a four-song show that lasted an hour: \"Village Voice\" reviewed it saying the highlight of the set was a new number \"Persia\", dubbing it \"a pulsing, rhythmic exploration lasting close to 20 minutes, to which each member of the band contributed in equal strength\".\nVerlaine died on January 28, 2023, at the age of 73. In 2025, journalist David Fricke reported that the tracks comprising their unreleased fourth album remain unfinished, lacking vocals and lead guitar.\nArtistry.\nMusical style and influences.\nTelevision are contemporarily regarded as an art punk band. The band broke from standard rock convention by omitting blues influence and instead incorporating elements of jazz, while retaining the \"raw energy\" that was influenced by garage rock. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of \"AllMusic\", \"With its angular rhythms and fluid leads, Television's music always went in unconventional directions.\" \nAs with many emerging punk bands, the Velvet Underground was a strong influence. Television also drew inspiration from minimalist composers such as Steve Reich. Tom Verlaine has often cited the influence of surf bands the Ventures and Dick Dale on Television's approach to the guitar, and he has also expressed a fondness for the bands Love and Buffalo Springfield, two groups noted for their dual-guitar interplay. Television's ties to punk were underscored by their late '60s garage rock leanings; the band often covered the Count Five's \"Psychotic Reaction\" and the 13th Floor Elevators' \"Fire Engine\" in concert, whilst also covering \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" by the Rolling Stones, a band that was also known for its guitar interplay. Tom Verlaine also cited the Doors and Five Live Yardbirds as being influential to his improvisation.\nLester Bangs heard in Television's music the influence of Quicksilver Messenger Service, noting a similarity between Verlaine's guitar playing and John Cipollina's. Tom Verlaine has downplayed the comparison, citing The Ventures as a more apt reference point.\nInstrumentation.\nThough Verlaine and Lloyd were nominally \"rhythm\" and \"lead\" guitarists, they often rendered such labels obsolete by crafting interlocking parts, where the ostensible rhythm role could be as intriguing as the lead. Al Handa writes, \"In Television's case, Lloyd was the guitarist who affected the tonality of the music more often than not, and Verlaine and the rhythm section the ones who gave the ear its anchor and familiar musical elements. Listen only to Lloyd, and you can hear some truly off the wall ideas being played.\" Matt LeMay of \"Pitchfork\" noted: \"Like the Velvet Underground before them, Television\u2019s songs focus on interplay and exploration, rather than individual melodies and chord progressions.\"\nMembers.\nTimeline\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nSingles &amp; Eps\nLive albums\nCompilation albums\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29840", "revid": "20542576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29840", "title": "Television channel", "text": "Frequency/channel over which a television station is distributed\nA television channel, or TV channel, is a terrestrial frequency or allocated number over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, \"channel 2\" refers to the terrestrial or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25\u00a0MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75\u00a0MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31\u00a0MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider.\nDepending on the multinational bandplan for a given region, analog television channels are typically 6, 7, or 8\u00a0MHz in bandwidth, and therefore television channel frequencies vary as well. Channel numbering is also different. Digital terrestrial television channels are the same as their analog predecessors for legacy reasons, however through multiplexing, each physical radio frequency (RF) channel can carry several digital subchannels. On satellites, each transponder normally carries one channel, however multiple small, independent channels can be on one transponder, with some loss of bandwidth due to the need for guard bands between unrelated transmissions. ISDB, used in Japan and Brazil, has a similar segmented mode.\nPreventing interference between terrestrial channels in the same area is accomplished by skipping at least one channel between two analog stations' frequency allocations. Where channel numbers are sequential, frequencies are not contiguous, such as channel 6 to 7 skip from VHF low to high band, and channel 13 to 14 jump to UHF. On cable TV, it is possible to use adjacent channels only because they are all at the same power, something which could only be done terrestrially if the two stations were transmitted at the same power and height from the same location. For DTT, selectivity is inherently better, therefore channels adjacent (either to analog or digital stations) can be used even in the same area.\nOther meanings.\nCommonly, the term \"television channel\" is used to mean a television station or its pay television counterpart (both outlined below). Sometimes, especially outside the U.S. and in the context of pay television, it is used instead of the term television network, which otherwise (in its technical use above) describes a group of geographically-distributed television stations that share affiliation/ownership and some or all of their programming with one another.\nThis terminology may be muddled somewhat in other jurisdictions, for instance Europe, where terrestrial channels are commonly mapped from physical channels to common numerical positions (i.e. BBC One does not broadcast on any particular \"channel 1\" but is nonetheless mapped to the \"1\" input on most British television sets). On digital platforms, such (location) channels are usually arbitrary and changeable, due to virtual channels.\nTelevision station.\nA television station is a type of terrestrial station that broadcasts both audio \"and\" video to television receivers in a particular area. Traditionally, TV stations made their broadcasts by sending specially-encoded radio signals over the air, called terrestrial television. Individual television stations are usually granted licenses by a government agency to use a particular section of the radio spectrum (a channel) through which they send their signals. Some stations use LPTV broadcast translators to retransmit to further areas.\nMany television stations are now in the process of converting from analog terrestrial (NTSC, PAL or SECAM) broadcast, to digital terrestrial (ATSC broadcast, DVB or ISDB).\nNon-terrestrial television channels.\nBecause some regions have had difficulty picking up terrestrial television signals (particularly in mountainous areas), alternative means of distribution such as direct-to-home satellite and cable television have been introduced. Television channels specifically built to run on cable or satellite blur the line between TV station and TV network. That fact led some early cable channels to call themselves superstations.\nSatellite and cable have created changes. Local programming TV stations in an area can sign-up or even be required to be carried on cable, but content providers like TLC cannot. They are not licensed to run broadcast equipment like a station, and they do not regularly provide content to licensed broadcasters either. Furthermore, a distributor like TNT may start producing its own programming, and shows presented exclusively on pay-TV by one distributor may be syndicated to terrestrial stations. The cost of creating a nationwide channel has been reduced and there has been a huge increase in the number of such channels, with most catering to a small group.\nFrom the definitions above, use of the terms \"network\" or \"station\" in reference to nationwide cable or satellite channels is technically inaccurate. However, this is an arbitrary, inconsequential distinction, and varies from company to company. Indeed, the term \"cable network\" has entered into common usage in the United States in reference to such channels, even with the existence of direct broadcast satellite. There is even some geographical separation among \"national\" pay television channels in the U.S., be it programming (e.g., the Bally Sports group of regional sports channels, which share several programs), or simply regionalized advertising inserted by the local cable company.\nShould a legal distinction be necessary between a (location) channel as defined above and a television channel in this sense, the terms \"programming service\" (e.g.) or \"programming undertaking\" (for instance,) may be used instead of the latter definition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29843", "revid": "51030817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29843", "title": "The Goon Show", "text": "BBC Radio show broadcast from 1951 to 1960\nThe Goon Show is a British radio comedy programme, originally produced and broadcast by the BBC Home Service from 1951 to 1960, with occasional repeats on the BBC Light Programme. The first series, broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951, was titled Crazy People; subsequent series had the title \"The Goon Show\".\nThe show's creator and primary writer was Spike Milligan, who performed in the series alongside Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers and (for the first two series) Michael Bentine. The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. There were also light music interludes. Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop, many of which were reused by other shows for decades. Elements of the show satirised contemporary life in 1950s Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, geography, the military, education, class structure, literature and film.\nThe show was released internationally through the BBC Transcription Services (TS). It aired regularly from the 1950s in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Canada, although these TS versions were frequently edited to avoid controversial subjects. In the United States, NBC began broadcasting the programme on its radio network from the mid-1950s.\nSubversive and absurdist, \"The Goon Show\" exercised a considerable influence on the development of British and American comedy and popular culture. It was cited as a major influence by the Beatles, the American comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre,:4,5,61 and the British comedy troupe Monty Python.\nBackground.\nThe series was devised and written by Spike Milligan with the regular collaboration of other writers including Larry Stephens (contributing to around 140 episodes), Eric Sykes (who co-wrote most of the episodes in Series 5), Maurice Wiltshire and John Antrobus, initially under the supervision of Jimmy Grafton.\nMilligan and Harry Secombe became friends while serving in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first encountered Lance Bombardier Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe was sitting in a small wireless truck: \"Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, and in the middle of it all the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody seen a gun?' It was Milligan.\" Secombe's answer to that question was \"What colour was it?\" Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.:20\nThe group first formed at The Grafton Arms Pub &amp; Rooms, 2 Strutton Ground, Victoria, London,&lt;ref name=\"LR/goon\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"camra/grafton-arms\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Grafton's&lt;ref name=\"BEHP/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; London public house in 1948.&lt;ref name=\"standard/spike-dies\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"telegraph/obit/Spike\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers had already d\u00e9buted with the BBC. Secombe was often heard on \"Variety Bandbox\". Milligan was writing for and acting in the high-profile BBC show \"Hip-Hip-Hoo-Roy\" with Derek Roy. Michael Bentine, who appeared in the first series, had just begun appearing in Charlie Chester's peak-time radio show \"Stand Easy\".\nThe four clicked immediately. \"It was always a relief to get away from the theatre and join in the revels at Grafton's on a Sunday night,\" said Secombe years later. They took to calling themselves \"The Goons\" and started recording their pub goings-on with a Pickersgill aluminium disk recorder. BBC producer Pat Dixon heard a recording and took interest in the group. He pressed the BBC for a long-term contract for the gang, knowing that it would secure Sellers for more than just seasonal work, something for which the BBC had been aiming. The BBC acquiesced and ordered an initial series, though without much enthusiasm.\nThe series had its premiere in May 1951 and audience figures grew rapidly, from around 370,000 to nearly two million by the end of the 17th show. No recordings of any episode of this series are known to have survived. The BBC commissioned a second series and a number of other changes occurred. The musical interludes were shortened, and Max Geldray joined the lineup. Peter Eton, from the BBC's drama department, replaced Dennis Main Wilson as producer. Eton brought stricter discipline to the show's production. He was also an expert at sound effects and microphone technique, ensuring that the show became a far more dynamic listening experience. However, a few episodes into the series Milligan suffered a major nervous breakdown. He was hospitalised in early December 1952,:136-139 just before the broadcast of episode five, but it, and the following episode, had already been written, and the next 12 episodes were co-written by Stephens and Grafton. Milligan was absent as a performer for about two months, returning for episode 17, broadcast in early March 1953. As with Series 2, all episodes were co-written by Milligan and Stephens and edited by Jimmy Grafton.\nBentine left the show at the end of series 2, citing a desire to pursue solo projects, although there had been an increasing degree of creative tension between him and Milligan.\nMilligan blamed his breakdown and the collapse of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required. His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series. The BBC however made sure he was surrounded by accomplished radio comedy writers\u2014Sykes, Stephens, Antrobus, Wiltshire, and Grafton\u2014so many of the problems caused by his ill health were skilfully covered over by composite scripts.\nMany senior BBC staff were variously bemused and befuddled by the show's surreal humour and it has been reported that senior programme executives erroneously referred to it as \"The Go On Show\" or even \"The Coon Show\". The show's title was inspired, according to Spike Milligan, by Alice the Goon, a character from the \"Popeye\" comic.\nSeveral of the Goons' nonsense songs were recorded in the late 1950s such as the \"Ying Tong Song\", number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1956. The radio show had high audience ratings in Britain at its peak; tickets for the recording sessions at the BBC's Camden Theatre (now known as KOKO) in London were constantly over-subscribed and the various character voices and catchphrases from the show quickly became part of the vernacular. The series has remained consistently popular ever since, with the show being broadcast weekly by Australia's ABC network as late as 2012.&lt;ref name=\"abc.net.au/rn/goons\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The show is also broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.\nThe scripts exist mostly in fan-transcribed versions via dedicated websites. Although three books were published containing selected scripts, they are out of print, and typically available only in libraries or second-hand. Some more recent biographical books contain selected scripts.\nThere were 10 series in total, plus an additional series called \"Vintage Goons\", recorded at the same time as the eighth series, which featured recordings of redevelopments (by Milligan) of short sketches from early shows which had not been recorded by transcription services. The first series had 17 episodes plus one special, \"Cinderella\" (1951); the second series had 25 episodes, (1952); the third series had 25 episodes plus one special - \"The Coronation Special\" (1952\u201353); the fourth series had 30 episodes plus one special, \"Archie In Goonland\" (1953\u201354); the fifth series had 26 episodes plus one special - \"The Starlings\" (1954\u201355); the sixth series had 27 episodes plus three specials, (1955\u201356); the seventh series had 25 episodes plus two specials, (1956\u201357); the eighth series had 26 episodes, (1957\u201358); the \"Vintage Goons\" were re-performances of 14 episodes from series four; the ninth series had 17 episodes, (1958\u201359); and the tenth series had six episodes, (1959\u20131960).\nFormat.\nThroughout its history, each episode of \"The Goon Show, \"which usually ran just under 30 minutes, was essentially structured as a comedy-variety programme, consisting of scripted comedy segments alternating with musical interludes.\nThe first two series were mostly produced by Dennis Main Wilson; none of the episodes was given an individual title and these early shows were loosely structured and consisted of four or five unconnected sketches, separated by musical items. According to later producer Peter Eton, the musical segments took up around half the programme.:113 In this formative phase the show co-starred Milligan (who played only minor roles in the early shows), Sellers, Secombe and Michael Bentine as the nominal 'hero' of each episode, madcap inventor Dr Osric Pureheart.:124 Musical performances were by virtuoso jazz harmonica player Max Geldray, singer Ray Ellington and his quartet (both of whom were recruited by Dixon) and vocal group the Stargazers, but they left after Episode 6 of Series 2, and for the remaining episodes Secombe filled in, singing a straight vocal number.:124 Incidental, theme and backing music was provided by Stanley Black and the BBC Dance Orchestra.:127 Series 2 also saw the first appearances of popular characters Minnie Bannister (Milligan) and Henry Crun (Sellers).\nFrom Series 3, \"The Goon Show\" (as it was now officially titled) gradually settled into its 'classic' format. Milligan, Stephens and Grafton began to work within a narrative structure and by the second half of Series 4 each episode typically consisted of three acts linked by a continuing plot,:143 with Geldray performing between Acts I and II and Ellington between Acts II and III. Almost all of the principal and occasional characters were now performed by Milligan and Sellers, with Secombe usually playing only Neddie Seagoon, who had replaced Pureheart as the hero of most of the stories. The closing theme, backing for Geldray and incidental music was now provided by a big band of freelance musicians under the direction of Angela Morley (known at the time as Wally Stott), who had been writing for the show since the first series.:127 After the end of Series 3, original announcer Andrew Timothy was replaced (at the suggestion of John Snagge) by Wallace Greenslade,:127 who provided spoken narrative links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts.\nFrom Series 3 onwards, the principal character roles were:\nSecondary characters were the \"Indians\", Banerjee and Lalkaka, the servant Abdul/Singez Thingz, Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers, Cyril, Jim Spriggs, Little Jim, Flowerdew and Chief Ellinga/The Red Bladder \u2013 both played by Ray Ellington. There were also occasional guest stars including senior BBC announcer John Snagge, and actors Valentine Dyall, Dick Emery, Kenneth Connor, Dennis Price and Bernard Miles. The traditional plots involved Grytpype-Thynne and Moriarty getting Neddie Seagoon involved in some far-fetched plan, and meeting the other cast members along the way.\nMany characters had regular catchphrases which quickly moved into the vernacular; among the best known are:\nSurrealism.\n\"The Goon Show\" has been variously described as \"avant-garde\", \"surrealist\", \"abstract\", and \"four dimensional\". The show played games with the medium of radio itself. Whole scenes were written in which characters would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, but it would be another character who had left the room. That character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.\nThe show paved the way for surreal and alternative humour, as acknowledged by comedians such as Eddie Izzard.:vii The surreality was part of the attraction for Sellers, and this exacerbated his mental instability especially during the third series. \nMany of the sequences have been cited as being visionary in the way that they challenged the traditional conventions of comedy. In the Pythons' autobiography, Terry Jones states \"The Goons of course were my favourite. It was the surreality of the imagery and the speed of the comedy that I loved - the way they broke up the conventions of radio and played with the very nature of the medium.\" This is reiterated by Michael Palin and John Cleese. Cleese recalls listening to \"The Goon Show\" as a teenager in the mid-1950s \"and being absolutely amazed by its surreal humour. It came at a key stage in my own development and I never missed a show\".\nMusic and sound effects.\nOrchestral introductions, links and accompaniment were provided by a hand-picked big band made up of London-based session musicians. The arrangements and musical direction were done by Angela Morley from the third to the 10th series. Morley produced many arrangements and link passages, further improved by the first-class sound quality the BBC engineers managed to achieve. Members of the band featured prominently in the comedy proceedings, particularly jazz trombonist George Chisholm who frequently played Scots characters. The show's concluding music was usually either \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" or a truncated and ironic rendition of the \"Alte Kameraden\" (Old Comrades') march, followed by Max Geldray and the Ray Ellington Quartet playing \"Crazy Rhythm\" as play-out music. Other theme tunes used included \"Goons' Gallop\", a play on Devil's Galop, \"I Want to Be Happy\" and \"Lucky Strike\", which the cast sang over at the conclusion of the episode called \"The Great Bank Robbery\".\nIn keeping with the variety requirements of the BBC's \"light entertainment\" format, \"The Goon Show\" scripts were structured in three acts, separated by two musical interludes. These were provided by the Ray Ellington Quartet\u00a0\u2013 who performed a mixture of jazz, rhythm &amp; blues and calypso songs\u00a0\u2013 and by harmonica virtuoso Max Geldray who performed mostly middle of the road numbers and jazz standards of the 1930s and 1940s accompanied by the big band. Both Ellington and Geldray also made occasional cameo appearances; Ellington was often drafted in to play stereotypical \"black\" roles such as a tribal chieftain, native bearer or Major Bloodnok's nemesis (and counterpoint to Bloodnok's affliction) \"The Red Bladder\".\nIt was in its use of pre-recorded and live sound effects that \"The Goon Show\" broke the most new ground. Part of the problem was that \"not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head\u00a0\u2013 he just knew when it had not yet happened\".:205 An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard\u00a0\u2013 which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled \"Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone.\" One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking (\"So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!\").:205 Secombe noted that \"Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each\u00a0\u2013 chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens\u00a0\u2013 all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects.\" An FX instruction in one script read \"Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do\". Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.:205\nMilligan's relationship with BBC managers preparing for the recording of episodes was often acrimonious and resulted in rows, and Milligan later agreed that he was a diva during this time, adding \"I was trying to shake the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were a knock on the door and tramps on gravel \u2013 that was it, and I tried to transform it.\"\nMany of the sound effects created for later programmes featured innovative production techniques borrowed from the realm of \"musique concr\u00e8te\", and using the then new technology of magnetic tape. Many of these sequences involved the use of complex multiple edits, echo and reverberation and the deliberate slowing down, speeding up or reversing of tapes. One of the most famous was the legendary \"Bloodnok's Stomach\" sound effect, created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to represent the sound of Major Bloodnok's digestive system in action, which included a variety of inexplicable gurgling and explosive noises. Lewis (1995, p.\u00a0218) states Bloodnok's stomach \"was achieved by overlaying burps, whoops from oscillators, water splashes, cork-like pops, and light artillery blasts\".\n\n\n\nProf. Osric Pureheart and more\nRunning jokes.\nLurgi.\nSeveral of the words and phrases invented for the show soon entered common usage, the most famous being the word lurgi. In the episode \"Lurgi Strikes Britain\", Spike Milligan introduced the fictional malady of Lurgi (sometimes spelled Lurgy), which has survived into modern usage to mean the common cold, or any miscellaneous or non-specific illness (often preceded by the adjective \"dreaded\"). The symptoms of Lurgi included the uncontrollable urge to cry \"Eeeeyack-a-boo\", though even during the episode the ailment proved to be an extortionate attempt to sell brass band musical instruments. Milligan was later to make up his own definition in \"Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan\", where Jim Hawkins' mother describes it as \"like brown spots of shit on the liver\".\nBrandyyy!\nAlcohol was strictly forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk in turn was fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase \"round the back for the old brandy!\" or \"the old Marlon Brando\" was used to announce the exit of one or more characters, or a break for music. In \"The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy\" (Series 9, Episode 4), Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, \"I wonder where he keeps that stuff!\". In \"The Scarlet Capsule\" (Series 9, Episode 14), Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of \"Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there\" was \"The introductions he gives me...\". In \"The Moon Show\" (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating \"Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!\", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail \"MATE!\" in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.\nRhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb!\nDuring radio programmes of the 1920s and 1930s, the background noise for crowd scenes was often achieved by a moderately large group of people mumbling \"rhubarb\" under their breath with random inflections. This was often parodied by Milligan, who would try to get the same effect with only three or four people, clearly intoning the word rather than mumbling. After some time, Secombe began throwing in \"custard\" during these scenes (for example, in \"The Fear of Wages and Wings Over Dagenham\", where the phrase was amended to 'flying rhubarb').\nRaspberry blowing.\nAs well as being used as a comic device randomly inserted into different sketches to avoid silence, the blowing of raspberries entered the Goons as Harry Secombe's signal to the other actors that he was going to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter. In the Goons' musical recording \"The Ying-Tong Song\", Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone. Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia Records 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title \"Donkey\" on the label. Approximating possibly the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show \"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\" as a sound to accompany an oyster called Fred opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts. This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke. Examples include \"The Last Goon Show of All\" during which Neddie shouts old jokes into a fuel tank in order to \"start the show\".\nYears later, Milligan collaborated with Ronnie Barker on \"The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town\" in which the credits read, \"Raspberries professionally blown by Spike Milligan\". David Jason has also claimed to have produced the sound effect and indeed was credited with this in the second segment of Ronnie Barker's LWT series \"Six Dates with Barker\" (1971).\n\"Trapped in a piano\".\nIn several shows, one character, typically either Henry Crun or Minnie Bannister, would be found trapped in a piano. In \"The Mystery of the Fake Neddie Seagoon\", Crun was inside a piano and his speech was accompanied by suitable piano noises. In \"The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI\", Moriarty is hiding in a piano disguised as one of the strings. He thinks he's a G-string. Grytpype-Thynne plays a \"do-re-mi\" scale to find him \u2013 Moriarty is \"me\". When Moriarty escapes, he is two feet taller than he used to be -- someone sent in a piano tuner.\nThe \"in a piano\" joke was re-used one last time in \"The Last Goon Show of All\".\nOther references.\nSometimes characters were introduced as \"scion of the house of Rowton\", or \"member of Rowton House\". This was a reference to the \"Rowton Houses\", which were hostels for working men in London.\nFilms.\nThe following films were a product of Goon activity:\nLater revivals.\nBooks.\nSpike Milligan teamed up with illustrator Pete Clarke to produce two books of comic strip Goons. The stories were slightly modified versions of classic Goon shows.\n\"The Last Goon Show of All\", \"The Affair of the Lone Banana\", \"The Scarlet Capsule\", \"The Pevensey Bay Disaster\"\n\"The Case of the Vanishing Room\", \"The Case of the Missing C.D. Plates\", \"The Saga of the Internal Mountain\", \"Rommel's Treasure\"\n\"Foreword by Sellers\", Details of the Show, Cast, Characters, etc., and \"The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler\", \"The Phantom Head Shaver\", \"The Affair of the Lone Banana\", \"The Canal\", \"Napoleon's Piano\", \"Foiled by President Fred\", \"The Mighty Wurlitzer\", \"The Hastings Flyer\", \"The House of Teeth\".\n\"The Battle of Spion Kop\", \"Ned's Atomic Dustbin\", \"The spy; or, Who Is Pink Oboe?\", \"Call of the West\", \"The Scarlet Capsule\", \"The Tay Bridge Disaster\", \"The Gold-plate Robbery\", \"The \u00a350 cure\".\n\"Operation Christ Duff\", \"The Internal Mountain\", \"The Silent Bugler\", \"The Dreaded Piano Clubber\", \"The Siege of Fort Night\", \"The Tree Maniac\".\nFilms.\nA re-creation of a \"Goon Show\" recording before a studio audience is seen early in the HBO Original Movie \"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\" (2004), with Geoffrey Rush as Sellers, Edward Tudor-Pole as Spike Milligan, Steve Pemberton as Harry Secombe and Lance Ellington as Ray Ellington. A brief moment from that re-creation is seen in the trailer for that film.\nStage.\n\"Ying Tong\" is a play written by Roy Smiles which is set partly in a radio studio, partly in a mental asylum and partly in Spike Milligan's mind. It recreates the Goons recording the show, but part way through Spike has a mental breakdown and is committed to an asylum. While it features all of the Goons throughout (although Bentine is mentioned, the fourth character represents Wallace Greenslade), the focus is on Milligan and his breakdown.\nBirmingham Comedy Festival produced a theatre production as part of their festival in 2014 staging two Milligan Goon Show scripts, \"The Canal\" and \"The Phantom Head Shaver (of Brighton)\". The festival produced a second touring production in 2017 featuring two more Milligan scripts, \"The House Of Teeth\" and \"The Jet Propelled Guided NAAFI\". Both runs were sanctioned by Norma Farnes and Spike Milligan Productions. The festival returned to The Goon Show in 2023 to mark the centenary of the birth of Larry Stephens, staging \"The Seagoon Memoirs\" and \"The Moriarty Murder Mystery\". Cast: Sellers - Richard Usher; Milligan - Robert Coletta (2014), Mark Earby (2017, 2023), Secombe - Jimm Rennie (2014, 2023), Stephan Bessant (2017); Wallace Greenslade/ Valentine Dyal - Phil Hemming (2014, 2017), Ian Danter (2024). Director by Robert F. Ball (2014, 2017); Director/Producer Dave Freak.\nTouring in late 2018 in the UK, Apollo Theatre Company in conjunction with Spike Milligan Productions recreated three episodes of The Goon Show - The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler, Tails of Men's Shirts, and The Phantom Head Shaver - with recreations of the original scripts. Co-producer Norma Farnes, Milligan's ex-manager, agreed to the use of the material on the basis the production was respectful of the scripts. The roles of Sellers, Milligan, and Secombe were played by Julian McDowell, Colin Elmer and Clive Greenwood and the production was directed by McDowell and Tim Astley.\nRadio and television.\n\"The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d\", which starred Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate \"Goon Show\" humour to television. Made for Associated-Rediffusion during 1956 and only broadcast in the London area, it was mainly written by Milligan, with contributions from other writers in the Associated London Scripts cooperative including Dave Freeman and Terry Nation, with Eric Sykes as script editor. \"The Idiot Weekly\" (1958\u20131962) was an Australian radio comedy series written by and starring Milligan with an Australian supporting cast including Ray Barrett and John Bluthal. It was made for the ABC during Milligan's numerous visits to Australia, where his family had emigrated. Milligan adapted some \"Goon Show\" scripts and included his \"Goon Show\" characters (notably Eccles) in many episodes. Six episodes of \"The Idiot Weekly\" were remade by the BBC as \"The Omar Khayyam Show\" in 1963.\n\"The Telegoons\" (1963\u20131964) was a 15-minute BBC puppet show featuring the voices of Milligan, Secombe and Sellers and adapted from the radio scripts. 26 episodes were made. The series was briefly repeated immediately after its original run, and all episodes are known to survive, having been unofficially released online.\nRecorded for Harry Secombe's six-part comedy series, of which only a portion was actually used for the original broadcast, this was similar to \"Tales of Men's Shirts\" as a re-enactment of a radio play for television. Whilst initially it was thought that only the portion used in the TV show survived, a full copy of the performance was found by the British Film Institute.\nEssentially a re-enactment of a radio performance, the three Goons were joined by John Cleese as announcer for a special shown on Thames Television. An almost-complete copy of this broadcast is held by the British Film Institute.\nIn 1972, the Goons reunited to perform \"The Last Goon Show of All\".\nIn 2001, the BBC recorded a \"new\" \"Goon Show\", \"Goon Again\", featuring Andy Secombe (son of Harry), Jon Glover and Jeffrey Holland, with Christopher Timothy (son of Andrew Timothy) announcing and Lance Ellington (son of Ray Ellington) singing, based on two lost series 3 episodes from 1953, \"The Story of Civilisation\" and \"The Plymouth Hoe Armada\", both written by Milligan and Stephens.\nRecords.\nThe Goons made a number of records, including \"I'm Walking Backwards for Christmas\" (originally sung by Milligan in the show to fill in during a musicians' strike), and \"Bloodnok's Rock and Roll Call\", the B-side of which, the \"Ying Tong Song\", soon became more popular and was reissued as an A-side in the mid-1970s, becoming a surprise novelty hit. The last time all three Goons worked together was in 1978 when they recorded two new songs, \"The Raspberry Song\" and \"Rhymes\".\nA 1962 comedy LP with Milligan and Sellers as well as Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller. A spoof of the film \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", it was originally recorded under that name. However, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Thus some clever editing of the recording by future Beatles producer George Martin removed the \"K\" every time the word \"Kwai\" was uttered, creating \"Bridge on the River Wye\". The LP is based on \"The Goon Show\"'s \"African Incident\" (30 December 1957),:183 which featured Sellers' vocal impersonation of Alec Guinness. Lewis' (1995, pp.\u00a0205\u2013206) gives a good account of this background.\nIn 1964, Milligan, Secombe and Sellers lent their voices to a comedy LP, \"How to Win an Election (or Not Lose by Much)\", which was written by Leslie Bricusse. It was not exactly a Goons reunion, because Sellers was in Hollywood and had to record his lines separately. The album was reissued on CD in 1997.\nImpact on comedy and culture.\nIn George Perry's book \"The Life of Python\" (1999) he comments: \"In the Britain of 1950, humour was derived from three main sources: print, film and radio, and despite the advent of television, throughout the 1950s radio remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy. In this period, two radio comedy shows exercised a profound influence. The first was \"Take It from Here\", with its polished professionalism. The other was \"The Goon Show\", with its absurdity, manic surreality and unpredictability.\"\nOn the influence of The Goons, Eric Sykes wrote that in the post-World War II years, \"other shows came along but 'The House of Comedy' needed electricity. Then, out of the blue\u00a0... \"The Goons\"\u00a0...Spike Milligan simply blew the roof off, and lit the whole place with sunshine. At a cursory glance, \"The Goon Show\" was merely quick-fire delivery of extremely funny lines mouthed by eccentric characters, but this was only the froth. In \"The Goon Show\", Spike was unknowingly portraying every facet of the British psyche\".\nSykes and Milligan, along with Ray Galton, Alan Simpson, Frankie Howerd and Stanley (\"Scruffy\") Dale, co-founded the writers' cooperative Associated London Scripts (ALS), which over time included others such as Larry Stephens. In his book \"Spike &amp; Co\", Graham McCann says \"the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show...would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", \" The Young Ones\", \"Vic Reeves Big Night Out\", \"The League of Gentlemen\", \"Brass Eye\" and countless other strange and bold new comedies\". Other ALS-related comedies such as \"Sykes and A...\", \"Hancock's Half Hour\", \"Steptoe and Son\", \"Beyond Our Ken\", and \"Round The Horne\" influenced their own genres of comedy.:344\u2013345\nEddie Izzard notes that the Goons and Milligan in particular \"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'.\":vii John Cleese notes that \"In comedy, there are a very small number of defining moments when somebody comes along and genuinely creates a breakthrough, takes us into territory where nobody has been before. The only experiences to which I can compare my own discovery of the Goons are going to see N. F. Simpson's play \"One Way Pendulum\"\u00a0... or, later on, hearing Peter Cook for the first time. They were just light years ahead of everyone else.\":151\nThe Beatles.\nThe Goons made a considerable impact on the humour of the Beatles, especially John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book \"The Goon Show Scripts\" for \"The New York Times\". He wrote: \"I was 12 when \"The Goon Show\" first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof that the world was insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called \"The Daily Howl\". I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to \"The Goon Show\".\" Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.\nIn a discussion of an accidentally Goonish nature, about introducing the next song during the 1963 BBC production of \"Pop Go The Beatles\", Lennon is also recorded as quipping \"Love these Goon shows\". This was included in the double album and CD titled \" Live at the BBC\" (side 4, track 10 of the LP; track 62 of CD).\nRoyal family.\nThe Goons were popular among the British royal family, particularly with Prince Charles (who would become King Charles III) who would often mimic the voices of the characters. Prince Philip and Princess Anne attended the recording of \"The Last Goon Show of All\" in 1972; Charles was unable to do so due to naval duties but sent a telegram to the cast. Charles wrote an introduction to the book \"More Goon Show Scripts\" (1973), and became patron of the Goon Show Preservation Society in 1998.\nFiresign Theatre.\nThe NBC radio network broadcast the programme in the United States in the mid-1950s. In 1965, Peter Bergman met and befriended Milligan during the time he worked in the UK on the BBC television programme \"Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life\". He also saw the Beatles in concert, which gave him the inspiration to form a four-man comedy group. When he returned to the US the next year to host the radio show \"Radio Free Oz\" on KPFK-FM in Los Angeles, he teamed with Philip Proctor, Phil Austin, and David Ossman to form the Firesign Theatre. Proctor, Austin, and Ossman were big fans of the \"Monitor\" broadcasts of the \"Goon Show\". According to Ossman:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We all listened to \"The Goon Show\", Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, at various times in our lives. We heard a lot of those shows. They impressed us when we started doing radio ourselves, because they sustained characters in a really surreal and weird kind of situation for a long period of time. They were doing that show for 10 years, all the way through the 1950s. So we were just listening to them at the end. It was that madness and the ability to go anywhere and do anything and yet sustain those funny characters. So when we first did written radio, where we would sit down and write half hour skits and do them once a week, which we did in the fall of 1967, we did things that were imitative of \"The Goon Show\" and learned a lot of voices from them and such.\nMonty Python.\nAmong the influences on Monty Python, the members of the comedy team are described as being \"indebted to BBC radio comedy, and particularly to the \"Goon Show\".\" The future members of Monty Python were fans, and on many occasions they expressed their collective debt to Milligan and The Goons. Scudamore cites an interview for example, in which John Cleese stated \"\"the Goon Show\" influenced us enormously\".:170 He reiterates this point in his contribution to Ventham's book: \"We all loved \"The Goon Show\" in the Monty Python Team: it ignited some energy in us. It was more a spirit that was passed on, rather than any particular technique. The point is that once somebody has crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it is terribly easy for everybody else to cross it\".:151\nSimilarly, in the introduction to Graham Chapman's posthumous anthology (2006, p. xvii) Yoakum notes that while other radio comedies influenced Chapman, \"the show that truly astounded Graham, and was a major influence on his comedy was \"The Goon Show\".\" And on page 23 Chapman states: \"from about the age of seven or eight I used to be an avid listener to a radio programme called \"The Goon Show\". In fact, at that stage I wanted to \"be\" a Goon\".\nIn their sketch \"Election Night Special\", the Pythons gave an appreciative nod to their forebears. When one of the onscreen elections reporters asks his companion, \"What do you make of the nylon dog cardigan and plastic mule rest?\" a voice offstage yells, \"There's no such thing!\" to which the reporter replies, \"Thank you, Spike.\"\nDeaths.\nPeter Sellers died on 24 July 1980, aged 54. Michael Bentine died on 26 November 1996, aged 74. Harry Secombe died on 11 April 2001, aged 79. Milligan claimed to be relieved that Secombe had died before him, because if so then Secombe would have been in a position to sing at his funeral. Terence \"Spike\" Milligan died on 27 February 2002, aged 83; Secombe ended up singing at his funeral anyway, as a recording. Two years later, Milligan's wish to have the words \"I told you I was ill\" inscribed on his gravestone was finally granted, although the church would only agree if the words were written in Irish, as .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nFansites\nAudio\nPhotos"}
{"id": "29848", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29848", "title": "Marge Simpson", "text": "Fictional character from The Simpsons franchise\nMarjorie Bouvier \"Marge\" Simpson (n\u00e9e\u00a0Bouvier) is one of the main characters in the American animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\" and part of the eponymous family. Voiced by Julie Kavner, she first appeared on television in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" short \"Good Night\" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on \"Life in Hell\" but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He based the character on his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.\nMarge is the matriarch and housewife of the Simpson family. With her husband Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She cooks, cleans, and without her in the Simpson family, they would be in despair. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top \"TV moms\". She has appeared in other media relating to \"The Simpsons\"\u2014including video games, \"The Simpsons Movie\", \"The Simpsons\" Ride, commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise.\nMarge's distinctive blue beehive hairstyle was inspired by a combination of the Bride's in \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, who was a member of the original cast of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992. She was also nominated for an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in \"The Simpsons Movie\". In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\n\"The Simpsons\" uses a floating timeline (the characters do not physically age), and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Marge Simpson is married to Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. She was raised by her parents, Jacqueline and Clancy Bouvier. She has a pair of sisters, the joyless Patty and Selma, both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer. In \"The Way We Was\" (season two, 1991), it is revealed via flashback that Marge attended Springfield High School, and in her final year met Homer, after they both were sent to detention\u2014Homer for smoking in the bathroom with Barney, and Marge for burning her bra in a feminist protest. She was at first wary of Homer, but agreed to go to the prom with him, although she ended up going with Artie Ziff after Homer received tutoring lessons as a means to get to know her better, while knowing that she needed to sleep for a school meet. However, she regretted going with Artie when he started to pressure her to have sex after prom. At the end of the evening, while Artie drove her home after receiving a slap, she spied Homer walking along the side of the road with the corsage meant for her. After hearing her parents voicing their negative opinions about Homer, she took her own car and went back to give him a ride. She then told Homer she should've gone to the prom with him and he fixes her snapped shoulder strap with the corsage. During the ride, he tells her he will hug her and kiss her and never be able to let her go. After the two had been dating for several years, Marge discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and she and Homer were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line. Bart was born soon after, and the couple bought their first house. The episode \"That '90s Show\" (season 19, 2008) contradicted much of the established back-story; for example, it was revealed that Marge and Homer were childless in the early 1990s although past episodes had suggested Bart and Lisa were born in the 1980s.\nAs with many \"Simpsons\" characters, Marge's age and birthday changes to serve the story. In season one (1990) episodes \"Life on the Fast Lane\" and \"Some Enchanted Evening\", Marge was said to be 34. This is also the age given in \"\", a book written by \"The Simpsons\"' creator, Matt Groening. In \"Homer's Paternity Coot\" (season 17, 2006), Marge states that Emerald would have been her birthstone if she had been born three months later, placing her birthday sometime in February. In \"Regarding Margie\" (season 17, 2006), Homer mentioned that Marge was his age, meaning she could have been anywhere between 36 and 40. During this episode (Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore), Lisa questions Homer's memory of Marge's birthday. When he cannot remember, Marge yells that it is in May. In the season eighteen episode \"Marge Gamer\" she states that she and actor Randy Quaid share the same birthdate (October 1).\nMarge has been nonworking for most of the series, choosing to be a homemaker and take care of her family. However, she has held several one-episode jobs in the course of the series. These include working as a nuclear technician alongside Homer at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in \"Marge Gets a Job\" (season four, 1992); selling houses in \"Realty Bites\" (season nine, 1997); owning her own pretzel business in \"The Twisted World of Marge Simpson\" (season eight, 1997), and working at an erotic bakery in \"Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes\" (season 20, 2008). While Marge has never expressed discontent with her role as a homemaker, she has become bored with it. In \"The Springfield Connection\" (season six, 1995), Marge decided that she needed more excitement in her life and became a police officer. However, by the end of the episode, she became upset with the corruption in the force and quit.\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nMatt Groening first conceived Marge and the rest of the Simpson family in 1987 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", and had intended to present an adaptation of his \"Life in Hell\" comic strip. When he realized that animating \"Life in Hell\" would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret \"Marge\" Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, \"It's really weird to have people think you're a cartoon.\" Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.\nMarge debuted with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" short \"Good Night\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into \"The Simpsons\", a half-hour series airing on the Fox Network. Marge and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.\nMatt Groening believes that episodes featuring Marge are among the most difficult episodes to write. Bill Oakley believes that the \"junior\" writers are usually given Marge episodes because he and writing partner Josh Weinstein were given several to write during their first season. During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so David M. Stern decided to write a Marge episode, which became \"Homer Alone\" (season three, 1992). He felt that they could achieve a \"deeper vein\" of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved.\nDesign.\nThe entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly in the middle of the sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, \"Life in Hell\"-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for \"The Simpsons\".\nVoice.\nMarge's voice is performed by Julie Kavner, who also does the voices of Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma. Kavner had been part of the regular cast of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member Dan Castellaneta to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors. Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote \"The Simpsons\" on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it \"destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people.\" Kavner takes recording sessions seriously and feels that voice acting is \"a little more limiting than live acting. And I have nothing to do with my character's movement.\"\nMarge's raspy voice is only slightly different from Kavner's, who has a \"honeyed gravel voice\" which she says is due to \"a bump on [her] vocal cords.\" While Marge is her most famous character, Kavner's favorite characters to voice are Patty and Selma because \"they're really funny and sad at the same time.\" In \"The Simpsons Movie\", some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted. Kristen Bell provided Marge's singing voice in \"The Star of the Backstage\".\nUntil 1998, Kavner was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Kavner earned $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Kavner and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.\nPersonality.\nMarge is generally a stereotypical sitcom mother, and she also plays the \"long-suffering wife\" who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in \"Homer Alone\" (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a nervous breakdown. After spending time at \"Rancho Relaxo\", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often.\nMarge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she \"put[s] up with a lot in [their] marriage,\" and has left Homer or thrown him out of the house on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is \"Secrets of a Successful Marriage\" (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is \"complete and utter dependence.\" At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he \"really [does] make a gal feel needed.\" Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show.\nThrough it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in \"Life on the Fast Lane\" (season one, 1990), where she resists Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.\nMarge is more caring, understanding, and nurturing toward Bart than Homer, but she refers to him as \"a handful\" and is often embarrassed by his antics. In \"Marge Be Not Proud\" (season seven, 1995), she felt she was mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her \"over-mothering\", but as she started becoming distant, he felt bad about it and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her \"special little guy\" and has defended him on many occasions. She once said \"I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing ... Of course, it makes him \"do\" bad things.\"\nMarge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge.\nMarge maintains a good relationship with her mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma, though they disapprove of Homer and are vocal about it. Marge has tolerated their criticism, but has occasionally lost patience with them, once referring to them as \"ghouls\".\nMarge's late father Clancy is rarely referred to in the series and has had speaking parts in only two episodes. It was revealed in \"Fear of Flying\" (season six, 1994) that Clancy told Marge that he was a pilot, but in reality, he was a flight attendant. Marge discovered this one day and developed aerophobia. In \"Jazzy and the Pussycats\" (season 18, 2006), Homer casually mentions that they once attended his funeral. It was finally revealed that Clancy died of lung cancer in season 27 episode \"Puffless\".\nMarge believes she has higher morals and is more law-abiding than most other characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent \"The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show\" and being a prominent member of the \"Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene\". She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, but many of the townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms.\nMarge is the only member of the family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In \"Homer the Heretic\" (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him \"don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win.\" Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with Lisa, who is a feminist. In \"Lisa the Skeptic\" (season nine, 1997), an \"angel skeleton\" is discovered, much to Lisa's skepticism. As Lisa rants about the people who believe it is an angel, Marge informs her that she also believes it is an angel. She tells Lisa, \"There has to be more to life than just what we see, everyone needs something to believe in.\"\nIn spite of her highly debatable moral stances, Marge struggles with vices, such as a gambling addiction. While Marge has learned to cope with her addiction, it has never completely disappeared and remains an underlying problem that is referenced occasionally on the show. Marge is also known to suffer OCD as shown when she won a house cleaning but she then cleaned the whole house herself and it thus led to her accidentally causing her to suffer amnesia. Another time is when the family had to house sit for Mr. Burns, she forced Lisa and herself to clean the entire mansion.\nPolitically, Marge generally aligns with the Democratic Party, having supported the candidacy of her state's progressive governor Mary Bailey, and voted for Jimmy Carter in both of his presidential elections. She was also deeply affected by the death of Lyndon B. Johnson, to the point where she wanted him to be alive so badly that she kept seeing him everywhere she looked.\nReception.\nAt the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards, Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Marge in the season three episode \"I Married Marge\". In 2004, Kavner and Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer) won a Young Artist Award for \"Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series\". For her performance in \"The Simpsons Movie\", Kavner was nominated for \"Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature\" at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm from \"Ratatouille\". Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she \"gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever.\" Various episodes in which Marge is prominently featured have been nominated for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, including \"The Way We Weren't\" in 2004 and \"Life on the Fast Lane\", which won the award in 1990. In 2000, Marge and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.\nMarge has been ranked highly in lists of the top television mothers of all time. She was ranked first on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list in 1994; first on Fox News' list in 2005; eighth on CityNews' list in 2008; and was included in \"Time\"'s list of the \"10 Best Moms Ever\". In a 2004 poll in the United Kingdom, Marge was named the \"most respected mother\" by respondents. Still in 2004, Marge was ranked third in a poll conducted by the Opinion Research Company. In May 2012, Marge was one of the 12 moms chosen by users of iVillage on their list of \"Mommy Dearest: The TV Moms You Love\". AOL has named Marge the 24th \"Most Memorable Female TV Character\". Her relationship with Homer was included in \"TV Guide\"'s list of \"The Best TV Couples of All Time\".\nReligious writer Kenneth Briggs has written that \"Marge is my candidate for sainthood ... She lives in the real world, she lives with crises, with flawed people. She forgives and she makes her own mistakes. She is a forgiving, loving person ... absolutely saintly.\"\nMarge and Lisa are James L. Brooks's favorite characters in the series, and the two with whom he identifies with most. Marge and Lisa are more popular than Homer and Bart in Japan, France, and many French speaking countries. Matt Groening has spoken fondly of them, though he prefers Homer and Bart. Sam Simon also prefers Homer and Bart finding Marge and Lisa to be too \"goody two-shoes\" for his tastes.\nCultural influence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Dear First Lady, I recently read your criticism of my family. I was deeply hurt. Heaven knows we're far from perfect and, if truth be known, maybe just a wee bit short from normal; but as Dr. Seuss says, \"a person is a person\". I try to teach my children ... always to give somebody the benefit of the doubt and not talk badly about them, even if they're rich. It's hard to get them to understand this advice when the very First Lady in the country calls us not only dumb, but \"the dumbest thing\" she ever saw. I hope there is some way out of this controversy. I thought, perhaps, it would be a good start to just speak my mind. \n\u2014Marge Simpson in her letter to Barbara Bush\nThe edition of October\u00a01, 1990, of \"People\" included an interview with then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: \"She loves \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" but remains baffled after sampling \"The Simpsons\". \"It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen,\" she says, \"but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean.\" The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September\u00a028 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October\u00a09, Bush sent a reply: \"Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking at a picture of you ... depicted on a plastic cup ... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family\u00a0\u2014 Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie\u00a0\u2014 are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example for the rest of the country. Please forgive a loose tongue.\"\nIn 2002, opponents of the Seattle Monorail Project planned on showing the episode \"Marge vs. the Monorail\" at a protest event. Following complaints, 20th Century Fox sent a letter to the event organizers ordering that the episode not be shown due to copyright laws. In 2004, Marge appeared on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom for the Alternative Christmas message, which is annually broadcast at the same time that Queen Elizabeth II gives her Christmas message.\nOn April\u00a09, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Marge and the four other members of the Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while the show is still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May\u00a07, 2009.\nMarge makes an appearance in the \"Fortnite\" x \"Simpsons\" mini season that was released in November 2025. She appears as a skin for players to purchase.\nMerchandising.\nMarge is depicted in much \"The Simpsons\"-related merchandise, including T-shirts, baseball caps, bumper stickers, cardboard stand-ups, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons, dolls, posters and figurines. She has appeared in each of \"The Simpsons\" video games. Besides the television series, Marge regularly appears in issues of \"Simpsons Comics\", which were published from 1993 to 2018. Marge also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.\nMarge appeared in a 2005 advertisement for Dove Styling, where her normal beehive hair was exchanged for a more stylish look for a series of ads featuring several popular cartoon women.\nIn April 2004, Marge appeared on the cover of \"Maxim\". She also appeared on the cover of the November 2009 issue of \"Playboy,\" becoming the first cartoon character to appear on the cover. The cover and a three-page picture spread, as well as a story inside entitled \"The Devil in Marge Simpson\", commemorated the 20th anniversary of \"The Simpsons\", but as also part of a plan to appeal to younger readers, a decision which has been criticized due to a page in which the character is depicted nude. Darine Stern's picture on the October 1971 cover served as the inspiration for Playboy's November 2009 cover.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29918", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29918", "title": "Tamil Nadu", "text": "State in southern India\nTamil Nadu is the southernmost state of India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, who speak the Tamil language\u2014the state's official language and the first to be recognised as a classical language in India. The capital and largest city is Chennai.\nLocated on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula, with the river Kaveri bisecting the state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and encloses a part of the union territory of Puducherry. It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.\nArchaeological evidence indicates that the Tamil Nadu region could have been inhabited more than 385,000 years ago by archaic humans. The state has more than 5,500 years of continuous cultural history. Historically, the Tamilakam region was inhabited by Tamil-speaking Dravidian people, who were ruled by several regimes over centuries such as the Sangam era triumvirate of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, the Pallavas (3rd\u20139th century CE), and the later Vijayanagara Empire (14th\u201317th century CE). European colonisation began with establishing trade ports in the 17th century, with the British controlling much of the state as a part of the Madras Presidency for two centuries. After the Indian Independence in 1947, the region became the Madras State of the Republic of India and was further reorganised when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into its current shape. The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil Country\", in 1969. Hence, culture, cuisine and architecture have seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely.\nAs of \u00a02023[ [update]], Tamil Nadu had an economy with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of \u20b9 (), making it the second-largest economy amongst the 28 states of India. It has the country's 9th-highest GSDP per capita of \u20b9 and ranks 11th in human development index. Tamil Nadu is also one of the most industrialised states, with the manufacturing sector accounting for nearly one-third of the state's GDP. With its diverse culture and architecture, long coastline, forests and mountains, Tamil Nadu is home to a number of ancient relics, historic buildings, religious sites, beaches, hill stations, forts, waterfalls and four World Heritage Sites. The state's tourism industry is the largest among the Indian states. The state has three biosphere reserves, mangrove forests, five National Parks, 18 wildlife sanctuaries and 17 bird sanctuaries. The Tamil film industry, nicknamed as Kollywood, plays an influential role in the state's popular culture.\nEtymology.\nThe name is derived from Tamil language with \"nadu\" meaning \"land\" and Tamil Nadu meaning \"the land of Tamils\". The origin and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it. In the ancient Sangam literature, Tamilakam refers to the area of present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. \"Tolk\u0101ppiyam\" (2nd to 1st century BCE) indicates the borders of Tamilakam as Tirumala and Kanniyakumari. The name \"Tamilakam\" is used in other Sangam era literature such as \"Pu\u1e5fan\u0101\u1e49\u016b\u1e5fu\", \"Pati\u1e5f\u1e5fuppattu\", \"Cilappatikaram\", and \"Manimekalai\". \"Cilappatikaram\" (5th to 6th century CE) and \"Ramavataram\" (12th century CE) mention the name \"Tamil Nadu\" to denote the region.\nHistory.\nPrehistory (before 5th century BCE).\nArchaeological evidence indicates that the Tamil Nadu region could have been inhabited more than 385,000 years ago by archaic humans. Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a continuous history from more than 3,800 years ago. Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 1500 and 2000 BCE indicate the use of the Harappan language. Excavations at Keezhadi have revealed a large urban settlement, with the earliest artefact dated to 580 BCE, during the time of urbanisation in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Further epigraphical inscriptions found at Adichanallur use Tamil Brahmi, a rudimentary script dated to 5th century BCE. Potsherds uncovered from Keeladi indicate a script which might be a transition between the Indus Valley script and Tamil Brahmi script used later.\nSangam period (5th century BCE\u20133rd century CE).\nThe Sangam period lasted for about eight centuries, from 500 BCE to 300 CE with the main source of history during the period coming from the Sangam literature. Ancient Tamilakam was ruled by a triumvirate of monarchical states, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilkam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the Kaveri delta. The kings called \"Vendhar\" ruled over several tribes of \"Velala\" (peasants), headed by the \"Velir\" chiefs. The rulers patronised multiple religions including vedic religion, Buddhism and Jainism and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature with the oldest surviving work being Tolk\u0101ppiyam, a book of Tamil grammar.\nThe kingdoms had significant diplomatic and trade contacts with other kingdoms to the north and with the Romans. Much of the commerce from the Romans and Han China were facilitated via seaports including Muziris and Korkai with spices being the most prized goods along with pearls and silk. From 300\u00a0CE, the region was ruled by the Kalabhras, warriors belonging to the Vellalar community, who were once feudatories of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms. The Kalabhra era is referred to as the \"dark period\" of Tamil history, and information about it is generally inferred from any mentions in the literature and inscriptions that are dated many centuries after their era ended. The twin Tamil epics Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai were written during the era. Tamil classic Tirukkural by Thiruvalluvar, a collection of couplets is attributed to the same period.\nMedieval era (4th\u201313th century CE).\nAround the 7th century CE, the Kalabhras were overthrown by the Pandyas and Cholas, who patronised Buddhism and Jainism before the revival of Saivism and Vaishnavism during the Bhakti movement. Though they existed previously, the period saw the rise of the Pallavas in the sixth century CE under Mahendravarman I, who ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. The Pallavas were noted for their patronage of architecture: the massive gopuram, ornate towers at the entrance of temples, originated with the Pallava architecture. They built the group of rock-cut monuments in Mahabalipuram and temples in Kanchipuram. Throughout their reign, the Pallavas remained in constant conflict with the Cholas and Pandyas. The Pandyas were revived by Kadungon towards the end of the 6th century CE and with the Cholas in obscurity in Uraiyur, the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas. The Pallavas were finally defeated by Chola prince Aditya I in the 9th century CE.\nThe Cholas became the dominant kingdom in the 9th century under Vijayalaya Chola, who established Thanjavur as Chola's new capital with further expansions by subsequent rulers. In the 11th century CE, Rajaraja I expanded the Chola Empire with conquests of entire Southern India and parts of present-day Sri Lanka and Maldives, and increased Chola influence across the Indian Ocean. Rajaraja brought in administrative reforms including the reorganisation of Tamil country into individual administrative units. Under his son Rajendra Chola I, the Chola Empire reached its zenith and stretched as far as Bengal in the north and across the Indian Ocean. The Cholas built many temples in the Dravidian style with the most notable being the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, one of the foremost temples of the era built by Rajaraja, and Gangaikonda Cholapuram, built by Rajendra.\nThe Pandyas again reigned supreme early in the 13th century under Maravarman Sundara I. They ruled from their capital of Madurai and expanded trade links with other maritime empires. During the 13th century, Marco Polo mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. The Pandyas also built a number of temples including the Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai.\nVijayanagar and Nayak period (14th\u201317th century CE).\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, there were repeated attacks from Delhi Sultanate. The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in \u00a0CE. The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c.\u20091370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates.\nLater, the Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region amongst whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent. They introduced the palayakkararar system and re-constructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.\nLater conflicts and European colonisation (17th to 20th century CE).\nIn the 18th century, the Mughal Empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic with his seat at Arcot, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks. The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly (1751\u20131752). This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom.\nEuropeans started to establish trade centres from the 16th century along the eastern coast. The Portuguese arrived in 1522 and built a port named S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 near present-day Mylapore in Madras. In 1609, the Dutch established a settlement in Pulicat and the Danes had their establishment in Tharangambadi. On 20 August 1639, Francis Day of the British East India Company met with the Vijayanager emperor Peda Venkata Raya and obtained a grant for land on the Coromandel coast for their trading activities. A year later, the company built Fort St. George, the first major English settlement in India, which became the nucleus of the British Raj in the region. By 1693, the French established trading posts at Pondich\u00e9ry. In September 1746, the French captured Madras during the Battle of Madras. The British regained control of Madras in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and resisted a French siege attempt in 1759. The British and French competed to expand the trade which led to Battle of Wandiwash in 1760 as part of the Seven Years' War. The Nawabs of the Carnatic surrendered much of their territory to the British East India Company in the north and bestowed tax revenue collection rights in the South, which led to constant conflicts with the Palaiyakkarars known as the Polygar Wars. Puli Thevar was one of the earliest opponents, joined later by Rani Velu Nachiyar of Sivagangai and Kattabomman of Panchalakurichi in the first series of Polygar wars. The Maruthu brothers along with Oomaithurai, the brother of Kattabomman, formed a coalition with Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, which fought the British in the Second Polygar War. In the later 18th century, the Mysore kingdom captured parts of the region and engaged in constant fighting with the British which culminated in the four Anglo-Mysore Wars.\nBy the 18th century, the British had conquered most of the region and established the Madras Presidency with Madras as the capital. After the defeat of Mysore in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799 and the British victory in the second Polygar war in 1801, the British consolidated most of southern India into what was later known as the Madras Presidency. On 10 July 1806, the Vellore mutiny, which was the first instance of a large-scale mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British East India Company, took place in Vellore Fort. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Parliament passed the Government of India Act 1858, which transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British crown, forming the British Raj.\nFailure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in two severe famines in the Madras Presidency, the Great Famine of 1876\u201378 and the Indian famine of 1896\u201397 which killed millions and the migration of many Tamils as bonded labourers to other British countries eventually forming the present Tamil diaspora. The Indian Independence movement gathered momentum in the early 20th century with the formation of the Indian National Congress, which was based on an idea propagated by the members of the Theosophical Society movement after a Theosophical convention held in Madras in December 1884. Tamil Nadu was the base of various contributors to the Independence movement including V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Subramaniya Siva and Bharatiyar. The Tamils formed a significant percentage of the members of the Indian National Army (INA), founded by Subhas Chandra Bose.\nPost-Independence (1947\u2013present).\nAfter the Independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Andhra state was split from the state in 1953 and the state was further reorganised when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape. On 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\". In 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi. After independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment. After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu consistently exceeded national average growth rates from the 1970s, due to reform-oriented economic policies. In the 2000s, the state has become one of the most urbanised states in the country with a higher Human Development Index compared to national average.\nEnvironment.\nGeography.\nTamil Nadu covers an area of and is the tenth-largest state in India. Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, and the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry. It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island. The Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama's Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka, which lies off the southeastern coast. The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.\nThe Western Ghats run south along the western boundary with the highest peak at Doddabetta () in the Nilgiri Hills. The Eastern Ghats run parallel to the Bay of Bengal along the eastern coast and the strip of land between them forms the Coromandel region. They are a discontinuous range of mountains intersected by Kaveri river. Both mountain ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains which run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, extending to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu\u2013Andhra Pradesh border. The Deccan Plateau is the elevated region bound by the mountain ranges and the plateau slopes gently from west to east resulting in major rivers arising in the Western Ghats and flowing east into the Bay of Bengal. The coastline of Tamil Nadu is long, and is the second longest state coastline in the country after Gujarat. There are coral reefs located in the Gulf of Mannar and Lakshadweep islands. Tamil Nadu's coastline was permanently altered by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.\nGeology.\nTamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in Zones II and III. The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan plateau were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period, between 67 and 66 million years ago. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many years and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. The predominant soils of Tamil Nadu are red loam, laterite, black, alluvial and saline. Red soil, with a higher iron content, occupies a larger portion of the state and all the inland districts. Black soil is found in western Tamil Nadu and parts of the southern coast. Alluvial soil is found in the fertile Kaveri delta region, with laterite soil found in pockets, and saline soil across the coast where the evaporation is high.\nClimate.\nThe region has a tropical climate and depends on monsoons for rainfall. Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: northeast, northwest, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and Kaveri delta. A tropical wet and dry climate prevails over most of the inland peninsular region except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long dry periods with temperatures averaging above ; summer is exceedingly hot with temperatures in low-lying areas exceeding ; and the rainy season lasts from June to September, with annual rainfall averaging between across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls in Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry.\nA hot semi-arid climate predominates in the land east of the Western Ghats which includes inland south and south central parts of the state and gets between of rainfall annually, with hot summers and dry winters with temperatures around . The months between March and May are hot and dry, with mean monthly temperatures hovering around , with precipitation. Without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for agriculture.\nThe southwest monsoon from June to September accounts for most of the rainfall in the west of the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon hits the Western Ghats from Kerala and moves northward along the Konkan coast, with precipitation on the western region of the state. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau; hence, the leeward region (the region deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of the southwest monsoon heads toward northeast India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the southwest monsoon, due to the shape of the land. The northern and eastern parts of Tamil Nadu receive most of their rains from the northeast monsoon.\nThe northeast monsoon takes place from November to early March, when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall. The annual rainfall of the state is about of which 48 per cent is through the northeast monsoon, and 52 per cent through the southwest monsoon. The state has only 3% of the water resources nationally and is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources. Monsoon failures lead to acute water scarcity and severe drought.\nFlora and fauna.\nForests occupy an area of constituting 17.4% of the geographic area. There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in Tamil Nadu, resulting from its varied climates and geography. Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior. The southern Western Ghats have rain forests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The Western Ghats eco-region is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are about 2,000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu, 5640 species of angiosperms (including 1,559 species of medicinal plants, 533 endemic species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants, 230 red-listed species), 64 species of gymnosperms (including four indigenous species and 60 introduced species) and 184 species of pteridophytes apart from bryophytes, lichen, fungi, algae, and bacteria. Common plant species include the state tree: palmyra palm, eucalyptus, rubber, cinchona, clumping bamboos (\"Bambusa arundinacea\"), common teak, \"Anogeissus latifolia\", Indian laurel, grewia, and blooming trees like Indian laburnum, ardisia, and solanaceae. Rare and unique plant life includes \"Combretum ovalifolium\", ebony (\"Diospyros nilagrica\"), \"Habenaria rariflora\" (orchid), \"Alsophila\", \"Impatiens elegans\", \"Ranunculus reniformis\", and royal fern.\nImportant ecological regions of Tamil Nadu are the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in the Nilgiri Hills, the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve in the Agastya Mala-Cardamom Hills and Gulf of Mannar coral reefs. The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve covers an area of of ocean, islands and the adjoining coastline including coral reefs, salt marshes and mangroves. It is home to endangered aquatic species, including dolphins, dugongs, whales and sea cucumbers. Bird sanctuaries, including Thattekad, Kadalundi, Vedanthangal, Ranganathittu, Kumarakom, Neelapattu, and Pulicat, are home to numerous migratory and local birds.\nProtected areas cover an area of , constituting 2.54% of the geographic area and 15% of the recorded forest area of the state. Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, established in 1936, was India's first wildlife sanctuary. Mudumalai National Park was established later in 1940. The protected areas are administered by the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the government of India and the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Pichavaram consists of a number of islands interspersing the Vellar estuary in the north and Coleroon estuary in the south with mangrove forests. The Pichavaram mangrove forests is one of the largest mangrove forests in India covering and supports the existence of rare varieties of economically important shells, fishes and migrant birds. The state has five National Parks covering \u2013Anamalai, Mudumalai, Mukurthi, Gulf of Mannar, a marine national park and Guindy, an urban national park within Chennai. Tamil Nadu has 18 wildlife sanctuaries. Tamil Nadu is home to one of the largest populations of endangered Bengal tigers and Indian elephants in India. There are five declared elephant sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu as per Project Elephant\u2013Agasthyamalai, Anamalai, Coimbatore, Nilgiris and Srivilliputtur. Tamil Nadu participates in Project Tiger and has five declared tiger reserves\u2013Anamalai, Kalakkad-Mundanthurai, Mudumalai, Sathyamangalam and Megamalai. There are seventeen declared bird sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu.\nThere is one conservation reserve at Tiruvidaimarudur in Thanjavur district. There are two zoos recognised by the Central Zoo Authority of India namely Arignar Anna Zoological Park and Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, both located in Chennai. The state has other smaller zoos run by local administrative bodies such as Coimbatore Zoo in Coimbatore, Amirthi Zoological Park in Vellore, Kurumpampatti Wildlife Park in Salem, Yercaud Deer Park in Yercaud, Mukkombu Deer Park in Tiruchirapalli and Ooty Deer Park in Nilgiris. There are five crocodile farms located at Amaravati in Coimbatore district, Hogenakkal in Dharmapuri district, Kurumbapatti in Salem district, Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in Chennai and Sathanur in Tiruvannamalai district.

The administration of the state government functions through various secretariat departments. There are 43 departments of the state and the departments have further sub-divisions which may govern various undertakings and boards. The state is divided into 38 districts, each of which is administered by a District Collector, who is an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) appointed to the district by the Government of Tamil Nadu. For revenue administration, the districts are further subdivided into 87 revenue divisions administered by Revenue Divisional Officers (RDO) which comprise 310 taluks administered by Tahsildars. The taluks are divided into 1349 revenue blocks called \"Firkas\" which consist of 17,680 revenue villages. The local administration consists of 15 municipal corporations, 121 and 528 town panchayats in the urban areas, and 385 panchayat unions and 12,618 village panchayats, administered by Village Administrative Officers (VAO). Greater Chennai Corporation, established in 1688, is the second oldest in the world and Tamil Nadu was the first state to establish town panchayats as a new administrative unit.\nLegislature.\nIn accordance with the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's \"de jure\" head and appoints the chief minister who has the \"de facto\" executive authority. The Indian Councils Act 1861 established the Madras Presidency legislative council with four to eight members but was a mere advisory body to the governor of the presidency. The strength was increased to twenty in 1892 and fifty in 1909. Madras legislative council was set-up in 1921 by the Government of India Act 1919 with a term of three years and consisted of 132 Members of which 34 were nominated by the Governor and the rest were elected. The Government of India Act 1935 established a bicameral legislature with the creation of a new legislative council with 54 to 56 members in July 1937.\nThe first legislature of Madras state under the Constitution of India was constituted on 1 March 1952 after the 1952 elections. The number of seats post the reorganisation in 1956 was 206, which was further increased to 234 in 1962. In 1986, the state moved to a unicameral legislature with the abolition of the Legislative Council by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council (Abolition) act, 1986. The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly is housed in the Fort St. George in Chennai. The state elects 39 members to the Lok Sabha and 18 to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.\nLaw and order.\nThe Madras High Court was established on 26 June 1862 and is the highest judicial authority of the state with control over all the civil and criminal courts in the state. It is headed by a Chief Justice and has a bench at Madurai since 2004.\nThe Tamil Nadu Police, established as Madras state police in 1859, operates under the home ministry of the Government of Tamil Nadu and is responsible for maintaining law and order in the state. As of 2023[ [update]], it consists of more than 132,000 police personnel, headed by a Director General of Police. Women form 17.6% of the police force and specifically handle violence against women through 222 special all-women police stations. As of 2023[ [update]], the state has 1854 police stations, the highest in the country, including 47 railway and 243 traffic police stations. The traffic police under different district administrations are responsible for the traffic management in the respective regions. The state is consistently ranked as one of the safest for women with a crime rate of 22 per 100,000 in 2018.\nPolitics.\nElections in India are conducted by the Election Commission of India, an independent body established in 1950. Politics in Tamil Nadu was dominated by national parties till the 1960s. Regional parties have ruled ever since. The Justice Party and Swaraj Party were the two major parties in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by Theagaroya Chetty and E. V. Ramaswamy (commonly known as Periyar), emerged in the Madras Presidency and led to the formation of the Justice party. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became the chief minister of the Madras Presidency. In 1944, Periyar transformed the Justice party into a social organisation, renaming the party Dravidar Kazhagam, and withdrew from electoral politics.\nAfter independence, Rajagopalachari served as the last Governor General of India before India became a republic. C. N. Annadurai, a follower of Periyar, formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949. The Congress dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of K. Kamaraj, who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi as prime ministers.\nThe anti-Hindi agitations led to the rise of Dravidian parties and the first such government was formed in 1967. In 1972, a split in the DMK resulted in the formation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led by M. G. Ramachandran. These two Dravidian parties continued to dominate the electoral politics in the state with the national parties often aligning as junior partners. M. Karunanidhi, who became the leader of the DMK after Annadurai and J. Jayalalithaa, who succeeded as the leader of AIADMK after M. G. Ramachandran dominated the state politics from the 1980s to early 2010s, serving as chief ministers combined for over 32 years.\nThe state has produced three Indian presidents, namely, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, R. Venkataraman, and APJ Abdul Kalam.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs per the 2011 census, Tamil Nadu had a population of 72.1 million and is the seventh most populous state in India.

As of 2011[ [update]], the state had 3.49 million immigrants.\nLanguage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTamil is the official language of Tamil Nadu, while English serves as the additional official language. Tamil is one of the oldest languages and was the first to be recognised as a classical language of India. As per the 2011 census, Tamil is spoken as the first language by 88.4% of the state's population, followed by Telugu (5.87%), Kannada (1.78%), Urdu (1.75%), Malayalam (1.01%) and other languages (1.24%) Various varieties of Tamil are spoken across regions such as Madras Bashai in northern Tamil Nadu, Kongu Tamil in Western Tamil Nadu, Madurai Tamil around Madurai and Nellai Tamil in South-eastern Tamil Nadu.

Korean, Japanese, French, Mandarin Chinese, German and Spanish are spoken by foreign expatriates in the state.\nLGBT rights.\nThe LGBT rights in Tamil Nadu are among the most progressive in India. In 2008, Tamil Nadu set up the Transgender welfare board and was the first to introduce a transgender welfare policy, wherein transgender people can avail free sex reassignment surgery in government hospitals. Chennai Rainbow Pride has been held in Chennai annually since 2009. In 2021, Tamil Nadu became the first Indian state to ban conversion therapy and forced sex-selective surgeries on intersex infants, following the directions of the Madras High\u00a0Court. In 2019, the Madras High Court ruled that the term \"bride\" under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 includes trans-women, thereby legalising marriage between a man and a transgender woman.\nCulture and heritage.\nClothing.\nTamil women traditionally wear a \"sari\", a garment that consists of a drape varying from in length and in breadth that is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, baring the midriff, as according to Indian philosophy, the navel is considered as the source of life and creativity. Ancient Tamil poetry such as the \"Cilappadhikaram\", describes women in exquisite drapery or sari. Women wear colourful silk saris on special occasions such as marriages. The men wear a \"dhoti\", a long, white rectangular piece of non-stitched cloth often bordered in brightly coloured stripes. It is usually wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist. A colourful \"lungi\" with typical batik patterns is the most common form of male attire in the countryside. People in urban areas generally wear tailored clothing, and western dress is popular. Western-style school uniforms are worn by both boys and girls in schools, even in rural areas. The Kanchipuram silk sari is a type of silk sari made in the Kanchipuram region in Tamil Nadu and these saris are worn as bridal and special occasion saris by most women in South India. It has been recognised as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2005\u20132006. Kovai Cora is a type of cotton sari made in the Coimbatore.\nCuisine.\nRice is the diet staple and is served with \"sambar\", \"rasam\", and \"poriyal\" as a part of a Tamil meal. Coconut and spices are used extensively in Tamil cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes made of rice, legumes, and lentils with its distinct aroma and flavour achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf, and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavour to the food, and is considered healthy. \"Idli\", \"dosa\", \"uthappam\", \"pongal\", and \"paniyaram\" are popular breakfast dishes in Tamil Nadu. Palani Panchamirtham, Ooty varkey, Kovilpatti Kadalai Mittai, Manapparai Murukku and Srivilliputhur Palkova are unique foods that have been recognised as Geographical Indications.\nLiterature.\nTamil Nadu has an independent literary tradition dating back over 2500 years from the Sangam era. Early Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as the Tamil Sangams, the earliest of which, according to legend, were held on a now vanished continent far to the south of India. This includes the oldest grammatical treatise, \"Tolkappiyam\", and the epics \"Cilappatikaram\" and \"Manimekalai\". The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and \"hero stones\" date from around the 3rd century BCE. The available literature from the Sangam period was categorised and compiled into two categories based roughly on chronology: the Pati\u1e49e\u1e47m\u0113lka\u1e47akku consisting of E\u1e6d\u1e6duttokai and the Pattupattu, and the Pati\u1e49e\u1e47k\u012b\u1e3bka\u1e47akku. The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book ' based on the \"Tolk\u0101ppiyam.\" Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ', \"sol\", ', \"y\u0101ppu\", '. \"Tirukkural\", a book on ethics by Thiruvalluvar, is amongst the most popular works of Tamil literature.\nThe Tamil literature that followed in the next 300 years after the Sangam period is generally called the \"post-Sangam\" literature which included the Five Great Epics and the Five Minor Epics.\nIn the early medieval period, Vaishnava and Shaiva literature became prominent following the Bhakti movement in the sixth century CE with hymns composed by the Alvars and the Nayanars. In the following years, Tamil literature again flourished with notable works including Ramavataram, written in the 12th century CE by Kambar. After a lull in the intermediate years due to various invasions and instability, the Tamil literature recovered in the 14th century CE, with the notable work being \"Tiruppukal\" by Arunagirinathar. In 1578, the Portuguese published a Tamil book in old Tamil script named \"Thambiraan Vanakkam\", thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. \"Tamil Lexicon\", published by the University of Madras, is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language. The 19th century gave rise to the Tamil Renaissance and writings and poems by authors such as Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, U.V. Swaminatha Iyer, Ramalinga Swamigal, Maraimalai Adigal, and Bharathidasan. During the Indian Independence Movement, many Tamil poets and writers sought to provoke national spirit, social equity and secularist thoughts, notably Subramania Bharati and Bharathidasan.\nArchitecture.\nDravidian architecture is the distinct style of rock architecture in Tamil Nadu. In Dravidian architecture, the temples consisted of porches or \"mantapas\" preceding the door leading to the sanctum, gate-pyramids or \"gopurams\" in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple, and \"pillared halls\" used for many purposes. These features are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple usually has a tank called the \"kalyani\" or \"pushkarni\". The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate at the entrance of the temple forms a prominent feature of koils and Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the \"kalasam\", a bulbous stone finial and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The gopuram's origins can be traced back to the Pallavas who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram. The Cholas later expanded the same and by the Pandya rule in twelfth century, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance. The state emblem also features the Lion Capital of Ashoka with an image of a Gopuram on the background. \"Vimanam\" are similar structures built over the \"garbhagriha\" or inner sanctum of the temple but are usually smaller than the gopurams in the Dravidian architecture with a few exceptions including the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur.\nThe Mugal influence in medieval times and the British influence later gave rise to a blend of Hindu, Islamic and Gothic revival styles, resulting in the distinct Indo-Saracenic architecture. Several buildings and institutions built during the British era followed the style. By the early 20th century, art deco made its entry in the urban landscape. After Indian Independence, Tamil architecture witnessed a rise in Modernism with the transition from lime-and-brick construction to concrete columns.\nArts.\nTamil Nadu is a major centre for music, art and dance in India. Chennai is called the cultural capital of South India. In the Sangam era, art forms were classified into: \"iyal\" (poetry), \"isai\" (music) and \"nadakam\" (drama). Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form that originated in Tamil Nadu and is one of the oldest dances of India. Other regional folk dances include Karakattam, Kavadi, Koodiyattam, Oyilattam, Paraiattam and Puravaiattam. The dance, clothing, and sculptures of Tamil Nadu exemplify the beauty of the body and motherhood. Koothu is an ancient folk art, where artists tell stories from the epics accompanied by dance and music.\nThe ancient Tamil country had its own system of music called Tamil Pannisai described by Sangam literature such as the \"Silappatikaram\". A Pallava inscription dated to the 7th century CE has one of the earliest surviving examples of Indian music in notation. There are many traditional instruments from the region dating back to the Sangam period such as parai, tharai, yazh and murasu. Nadaswaram, a reed instrument that is often accompanied by the thavil, a type of drum instrument, are the major musical instruments used in temples and weddings. Melam is a group of madhalams and other similar percussion instruments from the ancient Tamilakam which are played during events. The traditional music of Tamil Nadu is known as Carnatic music, which includes rhythmic and structured music by composers such as Muthuswami Dikshitar. Gaana, a combination of various folk musics, is sung mainly in the working-class area of North Chennai.\nThe state is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions which engage in arts research and are major tourist attractions. Established in the early 18th century, the Government Museum and the National Art Gallery are amongst the oldest in the country. The museum inside the premises of Fort St. George maintains a collection of objects of the British era. The museum is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India, and has in its possession the first Flag of India hoisted at Fort St George after the declaration of India's Independence on 15 August 1947.\nTamil Nadu is also home to the Tamil film industry nicknamed as \"Kollywood\" and is one of the largest industries of film production in India. The term \"Kollywood\" is a blend of Kodambakkam and Hollywood. The first silent film in South India was produced in Tamil in 1916 and the first talkie was a multilingual film, \"Kalidas\", which was released on 31 October 1931, barely seven months after India's first talking picture \"Alam Ara\". Samikannu Vincent, who had built the first cinema of South India in Coimbatore, introduced the concept of \"Tent Cinema\" in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land close to a town or village to screen the films. The first of its kind was established in Madras, called \"Edison's Grand Cinemamegaphone\".\nFestivals.\nPongal is a major and multi-day harvest festival celebrated by Tamils.

{"id": "29919", "revid": "49920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29919", "title": "Tamil language", "text": "Dravidian language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nTamil (, , ), is a Dravidian language spoken by the Tamil people of South Asia. It is one of the longest-surviving classical languages in the world, attested since c. 300 BCE.\nTamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders in South India, with Tamil inscriptions found outside of the Indian subcontinent, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Egypt. The language has a well-documented history with literary works like Sangam literature, consisting of over 2,000 poems. Tamil script evolved from Tamil Brahmi, and later, the vatteluttu script was used until the current script was standardized. The language has a distinct grammatical structure, with agglutinative morphology that allows for complex word formations.\nTamil is the official language of the state of Tamil Nadu and union territory of Puducherry in India. It is also one of the official languages of Sri Lanka and Singapore. Tamil-speaking diaspora communities exist in several countries across the world. Tamil was the first to be recognized as a classical language of India by the Central Government in 2004.\nEtymology.\nThe earliest extant Tamil literary works and their commentaries celebrate the Pandiyan Kings for the organization of long-term Tamil Sangams, which researched, developed and made amendments to the Tamil language. Although the name of the language which was developed by these Tamil Sangams is mentioned as Tamil, the period when the name \"Tamil\" came to be applied to the language is unclear, as is the precise etymology of the name. The earliest attested use of the name is found in Tholkappiyam, which is dated as early as the 2nd century BCE. The Hathigumpha inscription, inscribed around a similar period (150 BCE) by Kharavela, the Jain king of Kalinga, also refers to a \"Tamira Samghatta\" (\"Tamil confederacy\").\nThe Samavayanga Sutra, dated to the 3rd century BCE, contains a reference to a Tamil script named 'Damili'.\nSouthworth suggests that the name comes from &gt; \"self-speak\", or \"our own speech\". Kamil Zvelebil suggests an etymology of , with meaning \"self\" or \"one's self\", and \"\" having the connotation of \"unfolding sound\". Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of &lt; &lt; * &lt; *, meaning in origin \"the proper process (of speaking)\". However, this is deemed unlikely by Southworth due to the contemporary use of the compound 'centami\u1e3b', which means refined speech in the earliest literature.\nThe Tamil Lexicon of the University of Madras defines the word \"Tamil\" as \"sweetness\". S. V. Subramanian suggests the meaning \"sweet sound\", from \"tam\" \u2013 \"sweet\" and \"il\" \u2013 \"sound\".\nDavid Shulman cites Cuntaramurti's \"Tevaram\", in which he writes to Shiva, \"Do you know proper Tamil?\" and ascribes it the meaning \"Do you know how to behave properly as a male lover should? Can you understand the hints and implicit meaning that a proficient lover ought to be able to decipher?\" He also states that at some point in history, Tamil meant something like \"knowing how to love\", in a poetic sense, and that to \"know Tamil\" could also mean \"to be a civilized being\".\nClassification.\n\"Tamil\" belongs to the southern branch of the Dravidian languages, a family of around 26 languages native to the Indian subcontinent. It is also classified as being part of a Tamil language family that, alongside Tamil proper, includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups such as the Irula and Yerukula languages (see SIL Ethnologue).\nThe closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam; the two began diverging around the 9th century CE. Although many of the differences between Tamil and Malayalam demonstrate a pre-historic divergence of the western dialect, the process of separation into a distinct language, Malayalam, was not completed until sometime in the 13th or 14th century.\nAdditionally Kannada is also relatively close to the Tamil language and shares the format of the formal ancient Tamil language. While there are some variations from the Tamil language, Kannada still preserves a lot from its roots. As part of the southern family of Indian languages and situated relatively close to the northern parts of India, Kannada also shares some Sanskrit words, similar to Malayalam. Many of the formerly used words in Tamil have been preserved with little change in Kannada. This shows a relative parallel to Tamil, even as Tamil has undergone some changes in modern ways of speaking.\nHistory.\nLegendary origins.\nAccording to Hindu legend, Tamil or in personification form Tamil Th\u0101i (Mother Tamil) was created by Lord Shiva. Murugan, revered as the Tamil God, along with sage Agastya, brought it to the people.\nHistorical origins.\nTamil, like other Dravidian languages, ultimately descends from the Proto-Dravidian language, which was most likely spoken around the third millennium BCE, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin. The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India.\nScholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods: Old Tamil (300 BCE\u2013700 CE), Middle Tamil (700\u20131600) and Modern Tamil (1600\u2013present).\nBrahmi script.\nAbout 60,000 of the approximately 100,000 inscriptions found by the Archaeological Survey of India in India are in Tamil Nadu. Of them, most are in Tamil, with only about 5 percent in other languages such as Telugu, Kannada, Sanskrit and Marathi.\nIn 2004, a number of skeletons were found buried in earthenware urns dating from at least 696 BCE in Adichanallur. Some of these urns contained writing in Tamil Brahmi script, and some contained skeletons of Tamil origin. Between 2017 and 2018, 5,820 artifacts have been found in Keezhadi. These were sent to Beta Analytic in Miami, Florida, for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating. One sample containing Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions was claimed to be dated to around 580 BCE.\nJohn Guy states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India. Tamil language inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt. In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim (likely the classical-era port town Myos Hormos) revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BCE with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. There are a number of apparent Tamil loanwords in Biblical Hebrew dating to before 500 BCE, the oldest attestation of the language.\nOld Tamil.\nOld Tamil is the period of the Tamil language spanning the 3rd century BCE to the 8th century CE. The earliest records in Old Tamil are short inscriptions written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil-Brahmi. The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the \"Tolk\u0101ppiyam\", an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could be as old as the late 2nd century BCE. Many literary works in Old Tamil have also survived. These include a corpus of 2,381 poems collectively known as Sangam literature. These poems are usually dated to between the 1st century BCE and 5th century CE.\nMiddle Tamil.\nThe evolution of Old Tamil into Middle Tamil, which is generally taken to have been completed by the 8th century, was characterised by a number of phonological and grammatical changes. In phonological terms, the most important shifts were the virtual disappearance of the aytam (\u0b83), an old phoneme, the coalescence of the alveolar and dental nasals, and the transformation of the alveolar plosive into a rhotic. In grammar, the most important change was the emergence of the present tense. The present tense evolved out of the verb ' (), meaning \"to be possible\" or \"to befall\". In Old Tamil, this verb was used as an aspect marker to indicate that an action was micro-durative, non-sustained or non-lasting, usually in combination with a time marker such as ' (). In Middle Tamil, this usage evolved into a present tense marker \u2013 \"\" () \u2013 which combined the old aspect and time markers.\nModern Tamil.\nThe Nann\u016bl remains the standard normative grammar for modern literary Tamil, which therefore continues to be based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil. Colloquial spoken Tamil, in contrast, shows a number of changes. The negative conjugation of verbs, for example, has fallen out of use in Modern Tamil \u2013 instead, negation is expressed either morphologically or syntactically. Modern spoken Tamil also shows a number of sound changes, in particular, a tendency to lower high vowels in initial and medial positions, and the disappearance of vowels between plosives and between a plosive and rhotic.\nContact with European languages affected written and spoken Tamil. Changes in written Tamil include the use of European-style punctuation and the use of consonant clusters that were not permitted in Middle Tamil. The syntax of written Tamil has also changed, with the introduction of new aspectual auxiliaries and more complex sentence structures, and with the emergence of a more rigid word order that resembles the syntactic argument structure of English.\nIn 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries published a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named \"Thambiran Vanakkam\", thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. The \"Tamil Lexicon\", published by the University of Madras, was one of the earliest dictionaries published in Indian languages.\nA strong strain of linguistic purism emerged in the early 20th century, culminating in the Pure Tamil Movement which called for removal of all Sanskritic elements from Tamil. It received some support from Dravidian parties. This led to the replacement of a significant number of Sanskrit loanwords by Tamil equivalents, though many others remain.\nAccording to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies.\nGeographic distribution.\nTamil is the primary language of the majority of the people residing in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, (in India) and in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. The language is spoken among small minority groups in other states of India which include Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India and in certain regions of Sri Lanka such as Colombo and the hill country. Tamil or dialects of it were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century CE. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in southern Andhra Pradesh districts of Chittoor and Nellore until the 12th century CE. Tamil was used for inscriptions from the 10th through 14th centuries in southern Karnataka districts such as Kolar, Mysore, Mandya and Bengaluru.\nThere are currently sizeable Tamil-speaking populations descended from colonial-era migrants in Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Mauritius, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, Brunei, and Vietnam. Tamil is used as one of the languages of education in Malaysia, along with English, Malay and Mandarin. A large community of Pakistani Tamils speakers exists in Karachi, Pakistan, which includes Tamil-speaking Hindus as well as Christians and Muslims \u2013 including some Tamil-speaking Muslim refugees from Sri Lanka. There are about 100 Tamil Hindu families in Madrasi Para colony in Karachi. They speak impeccable Tamil along with Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi. Many in R\u00e9union, Guyana, Fiji, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have Tamil origins, but only a small number speak the language. In Reunion where the Tamil language was forbidden to be learnt and used in public space by France it is now being relearnt by students and adults. Tamil is also spoken by migrants from Sri Lanka and India in Canada, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Australia.\nStatus.\nOfficial status.\nTamil is the official language of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one of the 22 languages under schedule 8 of the constitution of India. It is one of the official languages of the union territories of Puducherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Tamil is also one of the official languages of Singapore. Tamil is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka, along with Sinhala. It was once given nominal official status in the Indian state of Haryana, purportedly as a rebuff to Punjab, though there was no attested Tamil-speaking population in the state, and was later replaced by Punjabi, in 2010.\nIn addition, with the creation in October 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the Government of India and following a political campaign supported by several Tamil associations, Tamil became the first legally recognised Classical language of India. The recognition was announced by the contemporaneous President of India, Abdul Kalam, who was a Tamil himself, in a joint sitting of both houses of the Indian Parliament on 6 June 2004.\nEducation.\nIn Malaysia, 543 primary education government schools are available fully in Tamil as the medium of instruction. The establishment of Tamil-medium schools has been in process in Myanmar to provide education completely in Tamil language by the Tamils who settled there 200 years ago. Tamil language is available as a course in some local school boards and major universities in Canada and the month of January has been declared \"Tamil Heritage Month\" by the Parliament of Canada. Tamil enjoys a special status of protection under Article 6(b), Chapter 1 of the Constitution of South Africa and is taught as a subject in schools in KwaZulu-Natal province. Recently, it has been rolled out as a subject of study in schools in the French overseas department of R\u00e9union.\nMass media.\nTamil-language paper media such as newspapers are very common, with a 2001 survey claiming there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil (including 353 dailies). Tamil-language digital media is also abundant, with films being especially common.\nDialects.\nRegion-specific variations.\nThe socio-linguistic situation of Tamil is characterised by diglossia: there are two separate registers varying by socioeconomic status, a high register and a low one. Tamil dialects are primarily differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. For example, the word for \"here\"\u2014' in \"Centamil\" (the classic variety)\u2014has evolved into ' in the Kongu dialect of Coimbatore, \"inga\" in the dialects of Thanjavur and Palakkad, and ' in some dialects of Sri Lanka. Old Tamil's ' (where ' means place) is the source of ' in the dialect of Tirunelveli, Old Tamil ' is the source of ' in the dialect of Madurai, and \" in some northern dialects. Even now, in the Coimbatore area, it is common to hear \" meaning \"that place\". Although Tamil dialects do not differ significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in Sri Lanka retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India, and use many other words slightly differently. Tamil dialects include Central Tamil dialect, Kongu Tamil, Madras Bashai, Madurai Tamil, Nellai Tamil, Kumari Tamil in India; Batticaloa Tamil dialect, Jaffna Tamil dialect, Negombo Tamil dialect in Sri Lanka; and Malaysian Tamil in Malaysia.\nLoanword variations.\nThe dialect of the district of Palakkad in Kerala has many Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax, and has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the \"Vaishnava paribasai\", a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. For example, Tamil Brahmins tend to speak a variety of dialects that are all collectively known as Brahmin Tamil. These dialects tend to have softer consonants (with consonant deletion also common). These dialects also tend to have many Sanskrit loanwords. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.\nSpoken and literary variants.\nIn addition to its dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language ('), a modern literary and formal style ('), and a modern colloquial form ('). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write ' with a vocabulary drawn from ', or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking '.\nIn modern times, ' is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of Tamil literature and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, ' has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of '. Most contemporary cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ', and many politicians use it to bring themselves closer to their audience. The increasing use of ' in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial 'standard' spoken dialects. In India, the 'standard' ', rather than on any one dialect, but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of Thanjavur and Madurai. Spoken Tamil in India is often mixed with English to create the hybrid language Tanglish, which has been growing in popularity, especially in cities. In Sri Lanka, the standard is based on the dialect of Jaffna.\nLexical differences.\nThere are some words that are only used in Literary Tamil such as: \"annai\" (mother), \"ali\" (offer), \"iyalum\" (possible), \"illam\" (house), and \"karpi\" (teach).\nThere are also some words only used in Colloquial Tamil, such as: \"Le:cu\" (easy), \"rompa\" (much), \"vantava:\"lam \"(unpleasant facts)\", \"tatave\" (times/occasion).\nWriting system.\nAfter Tamil Brahmi fell out of use, Tamil was written using a script called amongst others such as Grantha and Pallava. The current Tamil script consists of 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one special character, the \"\u0101ytam\". The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters (12 + 18 + 1 + (12 \u00d7 18)). All consonants have an inherent vowel \"a\", as with other Indic scripts. This inherent vowel is removed by adding a tittle called a \"\", to the consonantal sign. For example, is \"\u1e49a\" (with the inherent \"a\") and is \"\u1e49\" (without a vowel). Many Indic scripts have a similar sign, generically called virama, but the Tamil script is somewhat different in that it nearly always uses a visible \"pu\u1e37\u1e37i\" to indicate a 'dead consonant' (a consonant without a vowel). In other Indic scripts, it is generally preferred to use a ligature or a half form to write a syllable or a cluster containing a dead consonant, although writing it with a visible virama is also possible. The Tamil script does not differentiate voiced and unvoiced plosives. Instead, plosives are articulated with voice depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of Tamil phonology.\nIn addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script, which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit, and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied. ISO 15919 is an international standard for the transliteration of Tamil and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to Latin script, and thus the alphabets of various languages, including English.\nNumerals and symbols.\nApart from the usual numerals, Tamil has numerals for 10, 100 and 1000. Symbols for day, month, year, debit, credit, as above, rupee, and numeral are present as well. Tamil also uses several historical fractional signs.\nPhonology.\n, , , , and are only found in loanwords and may be considered marginal phonemes, though they are traditionally not seen as fully phonemic.\nTamil has two diphthongs: ' and ', the latter of which is restricted to a few lexical items.\nPhonotactics.\nTamil has no consonant clusters at the beginning of words and the consonant clusters which do occur are: /mp/, /rt/, /\u0273\u0288/, /\u014bk/, /\u1e47t/, /ll/, /\u026d\u026d/, /pp/, /cc/, /tt/, /kk/, /rr/, /\u027ek/, /mm/, and /nn/.\nGrammar.\nTamil employs agglutinative grammar, where suffixes are used to mark noun class, number, and case, verb tense and other grammatical categories. Tamil's standard metalinguistic terminology and scholarly vocabulary is itself Tamil, as opposed to the Sanskrit that is standard for most Indo-Aryan languages.\nMuch of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the \"Tolk\u0101ppiyam\". Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th-century grammar ' which restated and clarified the rules of the \"Tolk\u0101ppiyam\", with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ', ', ', ', '. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.\nTamil words consist of a lexical root to which one or more affixes are attached. Most Tamil affixes are suffixes. Tamil suffixes can be derivational suffixes, which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or inflectional suffixes, which mark categories such as person, number, mood, tense, etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of agglutination, which can lead to long words with many suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English. To give an example, the word \"p\u014dkamu\u1e6diy\u0101tavarka\u1e37ukk\u0101ka\" (\u0baa\u0bcb\u0b95\u0bae\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b95) means \"for the sake of those who cannot go\" and consists of the following morphemes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMorphology.\nTamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (')\u2014the \"rational\" ('), and the \"irrational\" (\"\")\u2014which include a total of five classes (\"p\u0101l\", which literally means \"gender\"). Humans and deities are classified as \"rational\", and all other nouns (animals, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The \"rational\" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (\"p\u0101l\")\u2014masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The \"irrational\" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes: irrational singular and irrational plural. The \"p\u0101l\" is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an honorific, gender-neutral, singular form.\nSuffixes are used to perform the functions of cases or postpositions. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in Sanskrit. These were the nominative, accusative, dative, sociative, genitive, instrumental, locative, and ablative. Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case. Tamil nouns can take one of four prefixes: \"i\", \"a\", \"u\", and \"e\" which are functionally equivalent to the demonstratives in English. For example, the word \"vazhi\" (\u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf) meaning \"way\" can take these to produce \"ivvazhi\" (\u0b87\u0bb5\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf) \"this way\", \"avvazhi\" (\u0b85\u0bb5\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf) \"that way\", \"uvvazhi\" (\u0b89\u0bb5\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf) \"the medial way\" (only used in Sri Lanka) and \"evvazhi\" (\u0b8e\u0bb5\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf) \"which way\".\nTamil verbs are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of suffixes, which show person, number, mood, tense, and voice.\nTraditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, including both of them under the category \"uriccol\", although modern grammarians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds. Tamil has many ideophones that act as adverbs indicating the way the object in a given state \"says\" or \"sounds\".\nTamil does not have articles. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number \"one\" as an indefinite article, or by the context. In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between inclusive pronouns ' (we), ' (our) that include the addressee, and exclusive pronouns ' (we), ' (our) that do not.\nSyntax.\nTamil is a consistently head-final language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject\u2013object\u2013verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.\nTamil is a null-subject language. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs, and objects. It is possible to construct grammatically valid and meaningful sentences which lack one or more of the three. For example, a sentence may only have a verb\u2014such as ' (\"completed\")\u2014or only a subject and object, without a verb such as ' (\"That [is] my house\"). Tamil does not have a copula (a linking verb equivalent to the word \"is\"). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.\nVocabulary.\nThe vocabulary of Tamil is mainly Dravidian. A strong sense of linguistic purism is found in Modern Tamil, which opposes the use of foreign loanwords. Nonetheless, a number of words used in classical and modern Tamil are loanwords from the languages of neighbouring groups, or with whom the Tamils had trading links, including Malay (e.g. \"sago\" from Malay ), Chinese (for example, \"skiff\" from Chinese san-pan) and Greek (for example, from Greek \u1f65\u03c1\u03b1). In more modern times, Tamil has imported words from Urdu and Marathi, reflecting groups that have influenced the Tamil area at times, and from neighbouring languages such as Telugu, Kannada, and Sinhala. During the modern period, words have also been adapted from European languages, such as Portuguese, French, and English.\nThe strongest effect of purism in Tamil has been on words taken from Sanskrit. During its history, Tamil, along with other Dravidian languages like Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam etc., was influenced by Sanskrit in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles, reflecting the increased trend of Sanskritisation in the Tamil country. Tamil vocabulary never became quite as heavily Sanskritised as that of the other Dravidian languages, and unlike in those languages, it was and remains possible to express complex ideas (including in science, art, religion and law) without the use of Sanskrit loan words. In addition, Sanskritisation was actively resisted by a number of authors of the late medieval period, culminating in the 20th century in a movement called ' (meaning \"pure Tamil movement\"), led by Parithimaar Kalaignar and Maraimalai Adigal, which sought to remove the accumulated influence of Sanskrit on Tamil. As a result of this, Tamil in formal documents, literature and public speeches has seen a marked decline in the use Sanskrit loan words in the past few decades, under some estimates having fallen from 40 to 50% to about 20%. As a result, the Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words used in modern Tamil are, unlike in some other Dravidian languages, restricted mainly to some spiritual terminology and abstract nouns.\nIn the 20th century, institutions and learned bodies have, with government support, generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing neologisms and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages. As of 2019,[ [update]] the language had a listed vocabulary of over 470,000 unique words, including those from old literary sources. In November 2019, the state government issued an order to add 9,000 new words to the vocabulary.\nInfluence.\nWords of Tamil origin occur in other languages. For example, scholars trace the origin of the word 'rice' in English and other European languages to Tamil \"arici\" / \u0b85\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bbf, through loans from 400 BCE Tamil to Hebrew and ultimately to Greek \"\u00f3ruza\" / \u03cc\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1. Another notable example of a word in worldwide use with Dravidian (not specifically Tamil) etymology is \"orange\", via Sanskrit from a Dravidian predecessor of Tamil 'fragrant fruit'. One suggestion as to the origin of the word \"anaconda\" is the Tamil 'having killed an elephant'. Examples in English include \"cheroot\" ( meaning 'rolled up'), \"mango\" (from ), \"mulligatawny\" (from 'pepper water'), \"pariah\" (from ), \"curry\" (from ), \"catamaran\" (from 'bundled logs'), and \"congee\" (from 'rice porridge' or 'gruel').\nSample text.\nThe following is a sample text in literary Tamil of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

{"id": "29920", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29920", "title": "Truth", "text": "Property of being in accord with reality\nTruth or verity is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. In everyday language, it is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it, such as beliefs, propositions, and declarative sentences.\nTrue statements are usually held to be the opposite of false statements. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, law, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion, including journalism and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. Most commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. This is called the correspondence theory of truth.\nVarious theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. There are many different questions about the nature of truth which are still the subject of contemporary debates. These include the question of defining truth; whether it is even possible to give an informative definition of truth; identifying things as truth-bearers capable of being true or false; if truth and falsehood are bivalent, or if there are other truth values; identifying the criteria of truth that allows people to identify it and to distinguish it from falsehood; the role that truth plays in constituting knowledge; and, if truth is always absolute or if it can be relative to one's perspective.\nEtymology and ordinary usage.\nThe English word \"truth\" is derived from Old English , Middle English , as a \"-th\" nominalisation of the adjective \"true\" (Old English ). In ordinary usage, the word may denote either a quality of \"faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity\", or that of \"agreement with fact or reality\".\nThe adjective, cognate with German 'faithful', stems from Proto-Germanic 'having good faith', and perhaps ultimately from Proto-Indo-European 'tree', on the notion of \"steadfast as an oak\" (cf. Sanskrit '(piece of) wood'; Old Norse 'faith, word of honour, belief').\nMajor theories.\nThe question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.\nTheories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean toward correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean toward deflationary theories and 14% epistemic theories.\nSubstantive.\nCorrespondence.\nCorrespondence theories emphasize that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs. This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to \"things\" according to whether it accurately describes those \"things\". A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas: \"Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus\" (\"Truth is the adequation of things and intellect\"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli. Aquinas also restated the theory as: \"A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality\".\nCorrespondence theory centres around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as \"objective reality\" and then representing it in thoughts, words, and other symbols. Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors. For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The German word \"Zeitgeist\" is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may \"know\" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in agglutinative languages). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate truth predicate. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is Alfred Tarski, whose semantic theory is summarized further on.\nCoherence.\nFor coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system. A central tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to an individual proposition only in virtue of its relationship to that system as a whole. Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.\nSome variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of formal systems in logic and mathematics. Formal reasoners are content to contemplate axiomatically independent and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various alternative geometries. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the natural world, empirical data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.\nCoherence theories distinguish the thought of rationalist philosophers, particularly of Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, along with the British philosopher F. H. Bradley. They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of logical positivism, notably Otto Neurath and Carl Hempel.\nPragmatic.\nThree influential forms of the \"pragmatic theory of truth\" were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they all hold that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.\nPeirce defines it: \"Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.\" This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as \"fallibilism\" and \"reference to the future\", are essential to a proper conception of truth. Although Peirce uses words like \"concordance\" and \"correspondence\" to describe one aspect of the pragmatic sign relation, he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than \"nominal\" definitions, which he accords a lower status than \"real\" definitions.\nJames' version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that \"the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving.\" By this, James meant that truth is a \"quality\", the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, \"pragmatic\").\nDewey, less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that inquiry, whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical, or cultural, is self-corrective over time \"if\" openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine, and/or refute proposed truths.\nThough not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by William Ernest Hocking, this variation is known as \"negative pragmatism\". Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works. Philosopher of science Richard Feynman also subscribed to it: \"We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.\" This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey. For Peirce, the idea of \"endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief\" fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing. As Feynman noted, an idea or theory \"could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right.\" Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is \"self-corrective\" over time.\nPragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the coherence theory of truth in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience. The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity. As Feynman said, \"...if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.\"150\nConstructivist.\nSocial constructivism holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as \"constructed,\" because it does not reflect any external \"transcendent\" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold). Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender, are socially constructed.\nGiambattista Vico was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's epistemological orientation unfolds in one axiom: \"verum ipsum factum\"\u2014\"truth itself is constructed\". Hegel and Marx were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth, but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is \"in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history\" and ideological knowledge is \"an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement\".\nConsensus.\nConsensus theory holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a subset thereof consisting of more than one person.\nAmong the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of \"truth\" is the philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation. Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher Nicholas Rescher.\nMinimalist.\nDeflationary.\nModern developments in the field of philosophy have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term \"truth\" does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of \"truth predicates\" (e.g., that some particular thing \"...is true\") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century. From this point of view, to assert that \"'2 + 2 = 4' is true\" is logically equivalent to asserting that \"2 + 2 = 4\", and the phrase \"is true\" is\u2014philosophically, if not practically (see: \"Michael\" example, below)\u2014completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilize a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account, and work with sentence structures as actually employed in common discourse, can be broadly described:\nWhichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that \"the predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis.\" Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it \"does\" appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., Semantic paradoxes, and below.)\nThe scope of deflationary principles is generally limited to representations that resemble sentences. They do not encompass a broader range of entities that are typically considered true or otherwise. In addition, some deflationists point out that the concept employed in \"...is true\" formulations does enable us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences; for example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says... etc.\"\nThis assertion can instead be succinctly expressed by saying: \"What Michael says is true\".\nRedundancy and related.\nAn early variety of deflationary theory is the redundancy theory of truth, so-called because\u2014in examples like those above, e.g. \"snow is white [is true]\"\u2014the concept of \"truth\" is redundant and need not have been articulated; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held that the use of words like \"fact\" and \"truth\" was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a \"linguistic muddle\".\nA variant of redundancy theory is the \"disquotational\" theory, which uses a modified form of the logician Alfred Tarski's schema: proponents observe that to say that \"'P' is true\" \"is\" to assert \"P\". A version of this theory was defended by C. J. F. Williams (in his book \"What is Truth?\"). Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims. They argue that utterances such as \"that's true\", when said in response to (e.g.) \"it's raining\", are \"prosentences\"\u2014expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. In the same way that \"it\" means the same as \"my dog\" in the statement \"my dog was hungry, so I fed it\", \"that's true\" is supposed to mean the same as \"it's raining\" when the former is said in reply to the latter.\nAs noted above, proponents of these ideas do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is not a \"property;\" rather, they can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion \"P\" \"may well\" involve a substantial truth\u2014it is only the redundancy involved in statements such as \"that's true\" (i.e., a prosentence) which is to be minimized.\nPerformative.\nAttributed to philosopher P. F. Strawson is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say \"'Snow is white' is true\" is to perform the speech act of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. For example, when a wedding couple says \"I do\" at the appropriate time in a wedding, they are performing the act of taking the other to be their lawful wedded spouse. They are not \"describing\" themselves as taking the other, but actually \"doing\" so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such \"illocutionary acts\" is J. L. Austin, most notably in \"How to Do Things With Words\").\nStrawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: \"To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement. When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.' The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'\"\nPhilosophical skepticism.\nPhilosophical skepticism is generally any doubt of one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions. The primary target of philosophical skepticism is epistemology, but it can be applied to any domain, such as the supernatural, morality (moral skepticism), and religion (skepticism about the existence of God).\nPhilosophical skepticism comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the \"big questions\" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. Religious skepticism is \"doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)\". Scientific skepticism concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to systematic investigation using the scientific method, to discover empirical evidence for them.\nA notable early expression of philosophical skepticism appears in the Gospel of John, where the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, after hearing Jesus claim to \u201cbear witness to the truth,\u201d replies with the rhetorical question, \u201cQuid est veritas?\u201d (\u201cWhat is truth?\u201d) (). Commentators have frequently interpreted this question as a dismissal of the very possibility of objective or knowable truth. Alfred Plummer characterizes Pilate as a \u201cpractical man of the world\u201d who regards such talk as visionary and naive. Similarly, Francis Bacon cited the episode in his essay \"Of Truth\" as illustrative of those who \u201cjest at truth\u201d and refuse to remain for an answer, reflecting a skeptical or cynical stance. The episode remains a widely referenced example of epistemological doubt, emblematic of philosophical skepticism toward the existence or accessibility of absolute truth.\nPluralist.\nSeveral of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.\nSome of the pragmatic theories, such as those by Charles Peirce and William James, included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories. Crispin Wright argued in his 1992 book \"Truth and Objectivity\" that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility. Michael Lynch, in a 2009 book \"Truth as One and Many\", argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.\nFormal theories.\nLogic.\nLogic is concerned with the patterns in reason that can help tell if a proposition is true or not. Logicians use formal languages to express the truths they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system.\nA logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement that is true in all logically possible worlds or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a \"fact\" (also called a \"synthetic claim\" or a \"contingency\"), which is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as \"If p and q, then p\" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the symbols and words in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.\nDegrees of truth in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with bivalent logic (or binary logic), three-valued logic, and other forms of finite-valued logic. Truth in logic can be represented using numbers comprising a continuous range, typically between 0 and 1, as with fuzzy logic and other forms of infinite-valued logic. In general, the concept of representing truth using more than two values is known as many-valued logic.\nMathematics.\nThere are two main approaches to truth in mathematics. They are the \"model theory of truth\" and the \"proof theory of truth\".\nHistorically, with the nineteenth century development of Boolean algebra, mathematical models of logic began to treat \"truth\", also represented as \"T\" or \"1\", as an arbitrary constant. \"Falsity\" is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as \"F\" or \"0\". In propositional logic, these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of axioms and rules of inference, often given in the form of truth tables.\nIn addition, before the time of Hilbert's program at the turn of the twentieth century, the proof of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems and the development of the Church\u2013Turing thesis in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were generally assumed to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.\nThe works of Kurt G\u00f6del, Alan Turing, and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system. Two examples of the latter can be found in Hilbert's problems. Work on Hilbert's 10th problem led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific Diophantine equations for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution, or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, Hilbert's first problem was on the continuum hypothesis. G\u00f6del and Paul Cohen showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard axioms of set theory. In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.\nG\u00f6del thought that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of intuition, an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics and perhaps best considered in the realm of human comprehension and communication. But he commented, \"The more I think about language, the more it amazes me that people ever understand each other at all\".\nTarski's semantics.\nTarski's theory of truth (named after Alfred Tarski) was developed for formal languages, such as formal logic. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression \"is true\" could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an \"object language\", the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain paradoxical sentences such as, \"This sentence is not true\". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. Donald Davidson used it as the foundation of his truth-conditional semantics and linked it to radical interpretation in a form of coherentism.\nBertrand Russell is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, Russell's paradox. Russell and Whitehead attempted to solve these problems in \"Principia Mathematica\" by putting statements into a hierarchy of types, wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy. This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible type systems that have yet to be resolved to this day.\nKripke's semantics.\nKripke's theory of truth (named after Saul Kripke) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:\nTruth never gets defined for sentences like \"This sentence is false\", since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are \"ungrounded.\" Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the principle of bivalence: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the liar paradox, the paradox is dissolved.\nKripke's semantics are related to the use of topoi and other concepts from category theory in the study of mathematical logic. They provide a choice of formal semantics for intuitionistic logic.\nFolk beliefs.\nThe truth predicate \"\"P\" is true\" has great practical value in human language, allowing \"efficient\" endorsement or impeaching of claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect (Gricean) conversational implications. Individuals or societies will sometime punish \"false\" statements to deter falsehoods; the oldest surviving law text, the Code of Ur-Nammu, lists penalties for false accusations of sorcery or adultery, as well as for committing perjury in court. Even four-year-old children can pass simple \"false belief\" tests and successfully assess that another individual's belief diverges from reality in a specific way; by adulthood there are strong implicit intuitions about \"truth\" that form a \"folk theory\" of truth. These intuitions include:\nLike many folk theories, the folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any formal system that fully obeys \"capture and release\" semantics for truth (also known as the \"T-schema\"), and that also respects classical logic, is provably inconsistent and succumbs to the liar paradox or to a similar contradiction.\nAncient Greek philosophy.\nSocrates', Plato's and Aristotle's ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory. In his \"Metaphysics\", Aristotle stated: \"To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true\". The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy proceeds to say of Aristotle:\n...Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the \"Categories\" (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of \"underlying things\" that make statements true and implies that these \"things\" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in \"De Interpretatione\" (16a3) that thoughts are \"likenesses\" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind...\nSimilar statements can also be found in Plato's dialogues (\"Cratylus\" 385b2, \"Sophist\" 263b).\nSome Greek philosophers maintained that truth was either not accessible to mortals, or of greatly limited accessibility, forming early philosophical skepticism. Among these were Xenophanes, Democritus, and Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism, who argued that there was no criterion of truth.\nThe Epicureans believed that all sense perceptions were true, and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions.\nThe Stoics conceived truth as accessible from impressions via cognitive grasping.\nMedieval philosophy.\nAvicenna (980\u20131037).\nIn early Islamic philosophy, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work \"The Book of Healing\", Book I, Chapter 8, as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.\nAvicenna elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis definition is but a rendering of the medieval Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet. A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence [of something].\nAquinas (1225\u20131274).\nReevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas stated in his \"Disputed Questions on Truth\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A natural thing, being placed between two intellects, is called \"true\" insofar as it conforms to either. It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.\nThus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth). Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his http://:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the Creator God who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; reality) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the senses, then through the understanding and the judgement done by reason. For Aquinas, human intelligence (\"intus\", within and \"legere\", to read) has the capability to reach the essence and existence of things because it has a non-material, spiritual element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.\nChanging concepts of truth in the Middle Ages.\nRichard Firth Green examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his \"A Crisis of Truth\", and concludes that roughly during the reign of Richard II of England the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance Romance literature, changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in Derek Pearsall's summary). Whereas truth (the \"trouthe\" of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\") was first \"an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons\", in Ricardian England it \"transforms... into a political truth in which truth is understood to reside in documents\".\nModern philosophy.\nKant (1724\u20131804).\nImmanuel Kant endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth. Kant writes in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\": \"The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed\". He denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. He states in his logic lectures:\n...Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only \"by cognizing it\". Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object. The ancients called such a circle in explanation a \"diallelon\". And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man...\nThis passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain objects and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition. Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is \"impossible without qualification and for every man\".\nHegel (1770\u20131831).\nG. W. F. Hegel distanced his philosophy from empiricism by presenting truth as a self-moving process, rather than a matter of merely subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to an organism in that it is self-determining according to its own inner logic: \"Truth is its own self-movement within itself.\"\nSchopenhauer (1788\u20131860).\nFor Arthur Schopenhauer, a judgment is a combination or separation of two or more concepts. If a judgment is to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. \"Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)\". Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has \"material\" truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or \"formal\". If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has \"transcendental\" truth.\nKierkegaard (1813\u20131855).\nWhen S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, as his character \"Johannes Climacus\", ends his writings: \"My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth\", he does not advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.\nWhile objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.\nNietzsche (1844\u20131900).\nFriedrich Nietzsche believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the \"will to power\" of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the \"will to power\", and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in \"Beyond Good and Evil\", \"The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding...\" (aphorism 4). He proposed the \"will to power\" as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.\nRobert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:\n...Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, \"On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\" (\"\") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call \"truth\" is only \"a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.\" His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; \"truth\" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence...\nSeparately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent Western intellectual tradition: \"But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests\u2014that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take \"our\" fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'...\"\nMoreover, Nietzsche challenges the notion of objective truth, arguing that truths are human creations and serve practical purposes. He wrote, \"Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.\" He argues that truth is a human invention, arising from the artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images, serving practical purposes like repose, security, and consistency; formed through metaphorical and rhetorical devices, shaped by societal conventions and forgotten origins: \"What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms \u2013 in short, a sum of human relations which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically...\"\nNietzsche argues that truth is always filtered through individual perspectives and shaped by various interests and biases. In \"On the Genealogy of Morality,\" he asserts, \"There are no facts, only interpretations.\" He suggests that truth is subject to constant reinterpretation and change, influenced by shifting cultural and historical contexts as he writes in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" that \"I say unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.\" In the same book, Zarathustra proclaims, \"Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.\"\nHeidegger (1889\u20131976).\nOther philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to Martin Heidegger, the original meaning and essence of truth in Ancient Greece was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, . On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the Latin term . Owing to the primacy of ontology in Heidegger's philosophy, he considered this truth to lie within Being itself, and already in \"Being and Time\" (1927) had identified truth with \"being-truth\" or the \"truth of Being\" and partially with the Kantian thing-in-itself in an epistemology essentially concerning a mode of \"Dasein\".\nSartre (1905\u20131980).\nIn \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943), partially following Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre identified our knowledge of the truth as a relation between the in-itself and for-itself of being - yet simultaneously closely connected in this vein to the data available to the material personhood, in the body, of an individual in their interaction with the world and others - with Sartre's description that \"the world is human\" allowing him to postulate all truth as strictly \"understood\" by self-consciousness as self-consciousness \"of\" something, a view also preceded by Henri Bergson in \"Time and Free Will\" (1889), the reading of which Sartre had credited for his interest in philosophy. This first existentialist theory, more fully fleshed out in Sartre's essay \"Truth and Existence\" (1948), which already demonstrates a more radical departure from Heidegger in its emphasis on the primacy of the idea, already formulated in \"Being and Nothingness\", of existence as preceding essence in its role in the formulation of truth, has nevertheless been critically examined as idealist rather than materialist in its departure from more traditional idealist epistemologies such as those of Ancient Greek philosophy in Plato and Aristotle, and staying as does Heidegger with Kant.\nLater, in the \"Search for a Method\" (1957), in which Sartre used a unification of existentialism and Marxism that he would later formulate in the \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\" (1960), Sartre, with his growing emphasis on the Hegelian totalisation of historicity, posited a conception of truth still defined by its process of relation to a container giving it material meaning, but with specific reference to a role in this broader totalisation, for \"subjectivity is neither everything nor nothing; it represents a moment in the objective process (that in which externality is internalised), and this moment is perpetually eliminated only to be perpetually reborn\": \"For us, truth is something which becomes, it \"has\" and \"will have\" become. It is a totalisation which is forever being totalised. Particular facts do not signify anything; they are neither true nor false so long as they are not related, through the mediation of various partial totalities, to the totalisation in process.\" Sartre describes this as a \"\"realistic\" epistemology\", developed out of Marx's ideas but with such a development only possible in an existentialist light, as with the theme of the whole work. In an early segment of the lengthy two-volume \"Critique\" of 1960, Sartre continued to describe truth as a \"totalising\" \"truth of history\" to be interpreted by a \"Marxist historian\", whilst his break with Heidegger's epistemological ideas is finalised in the description of a seemingly antinomous \"dualism of Being and Truth\" as the essence of a truly Marxist epistemology.\nCamus (1913\u20131960).\nThe well-regarded French philosopher Albert Camus wrote in his famous essay, \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" (1942), that \"there are truths but no truth\", in fundamental agreement with Nietzsche's perspectivism, and favourably cites Kierkegaard in posing that \"no truth is absolute or can render satisfactory an existence that is impossible in itself\". Later, in \"The Rebel\" (1951), he declared, akin to Sartre, that \"the very lowest form of truth\" is \"the truth of history\", but describes this in the context of its abuse and like Kierkegaard in the \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\" he criticizes Hegel in holding a historical attitude \"which consists of saying: 'This is truth, which appears to us, however, to be error, but which is true precisely because it happens to be error. As for proof, it is not I, but history, at its conclusion, that will furnish it.'\"\nPeirce (1839\u20131914).\nPragmatists like C. S. Peirce take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and discovering truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human inquiry would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: \"The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth...\"\nNishida (1870\u20131945).\nAccording to Kitaro Nishida, \"knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing.\"\nFromm (1900\u20131980).\nErich Fromm finds that trying to discuss truth as \"absolute truth\" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on \"optimal truth\". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in \"a strange and powerful world\". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described below:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where \"it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles\".[...] In that respect, \"a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of the desired result\". The history of science is \"a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation.\"[...] As a result \"the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period.\" Fromm furthermore notes that \"different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth\" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.\nFoucault (1926\u20131984).\nTruth, says Michel Foucault, is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an \"objective\" quality. He prefers not to use the term truth itself but \"Regimes of Truth\". In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure. Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of Nietzsche. Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various episteme throughout history.\nBaudrillard (1929\u20132007).\nJean Baudrillard considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something. He took his cue from iconoclasts whom he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist. Baudrillard wrote in \"Precession of the Simulacra\":\nThe simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth\u2014it is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true.\n\u2014Ecclesiastes\nSome examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the \"truth\" that society is free; scandals (e.g., Watergate) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. Though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.\nOther contemporary positions.\nTruthmaker theory is \"the branch of metaphysics that explores the relationships between what is true and what exists\". It is different from substantive theories of truth in the sense that it does not aim at giving a definition of what truth is. Instead, it has the goal of \"determining\" how truth depends on being.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther theorists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
