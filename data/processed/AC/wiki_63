The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree has only minor differences across the three versions, making the Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the Egyptian scripts.\nThe stone was carved during the Hellenistic period and is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at Sais. It was probably moved in late antiquity or during the Mamluk period, and was eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. It was found there in July 1799 by French army officer Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Bouchard during France's invasion of Egypt. It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic script. Lithographic copies and plaster casts soon began circulating among European museums and scholars. When the British defeated the French, they took the stone to London under the terms of the Capitulation of Alexandria in 1801. Since 1802, it has been on public display at the British Museum almost continuously and it is the most visited object there.\nStudy of the decree was already underway when the first complete translation of the Greek text was published in 1803. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion announced the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the Demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the Demotic (1814); and that phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (1822\u20131824).\nThree other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including three slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees: the Decree of Alexandria in 243\u00a0BC, the Decree of Canopus in 238\u00a0BC, and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy\u00a0IV, c.\u2009218\u00a0BC. Though the Rosetta Stone is now known not to be unique, it was the essential key to the modern understanding of ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term \"Rosetta Stone\" is now used to refer to the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.\nDescription.\nThe Rosetta Stone is listed as \"a stone of black granodiorite, bearing three inscriptions\u00a0... found at Rosetta\" in a contemporary catalogue of the artefacts discovered by the French expedition and surrendered to British troops in 1801. At some period after its arrival in London, the inscriptions were coloured in white chalk to make them more legible, and the remaining surface was covered with a layer of carnauba wax designed to protect it from visitors' fingers. This gave a dark colour to the stone that led to its mistaken identification as black basalt. These additions were removed when the stone was cleaned in 1999, revealing the original dark grey tint of the rock, the sparkle of its crystalline structure, and a pink vein running across the top left corner. Comparisons with the Klemm collection of Egyptian rock samples showed a close resemblance to rock from a small granodiorite quarry at Gebel Tingar on the west bank of the Nile, west of Elephantine in the region of Aswan; the pink vein is typical of granodiorite from this region.\nThe Rosetta Stone is high at its highest point, wide, and thick. It weighs approximately . It bears three inscriptions: the top register in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the second in the Egyptian Demotic script, and the third in Ancient Greek. The hieroglyphic text is Middle Egyptian, a form of the Egyptian language that had been obsolete for centuries at the time the stone was inscribed, and specifically \"neo-Middle Egyptian\", a deliberately archaic imitation of the original Middle Egyptian language that was used in formal religious texts. The Demotic text more closely represents the stage of Egyptian that was spoken in Ptolemaic times. The front surface is polished and the inscriptions lightly incised on it; the sides of the stone are smoothed, but the back is only roughly worked, presumably because it would have not been visible when the stele was erected.\nOriginal stele.\nThe Rosetta Stone is a fragment of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Due to its damaged condition, none of the three texts is complete. The top register, written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, has suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text remain visible; all are broken on the right side, and 12 of them are also damaged on the left. Below it, the middle register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The bottom register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.\nThe full length of the hieroglyphic text and the total size of the original stele, of which the Rosetta Stone is a fragment, can be estimated based on comparable steles that have survived, including other copies of the same order. The slightly earlier decree of Canopus, erected in 238 BC during the reign of Ptolemy\u00a0III, is and wide, and contains 36 lines of hieroglyphic text, 73 of demotic text, and 74 of Greek. The texts are of similar length. From such comparisons, it can be estimated that an additional 14 or 15 lines of hieroglyphic inscription are missing from the top register of the Rosetta Stone, amounting to another . In addition to the inscriptions, there would probably have been a scene depicting the king being presented to the gods, topped with a winged disc, as on the Canopus Stele. These parallels, and a hieroglyphic sign for \"stela\" on the stone itself (see Gardiner's sign list),\nO26\nsuggest that it originally had a rounded top. The height of the original stele is estimated to have been about .\nMemphis decree and its context.\nThe stele was erected after the coronation of King Ptolemy\u00a0V and was inscribed with a decree that established the divine cult of the new ruler. The decree was issued by a congress of priests who gathered at Memphis. The date is given as \"4 Xandikos\" in the Macedonian calendar and \"18 Mekhir\" in the Egyptian calendar, which corresponds to 27 March 196 BC. The year is stated as the ninth year of Ptolemy\u00a0V's reign (equated with 197/196 BC), which is confirmed by naming four priests who officiated in that year: Aetos son of Aetos was priest of the divine cults of Alexander the Great and the five Ptolemies down to Ptolemy\u00a0V himself; the other three priests named in turn in the inscription are those who led the worship of Berenice Euergetis (wife of Ptolemy\u00a0III), Arsinoe Philadelphos (wife and sister of Ptolemy\u00a0II), and Arsinoe Philopator, mother of Ptolemy\u00a0V. However, a second date is also given in the Greek and hieroglyphic texts, corresponding to 27 November 197 BC, the official anniversary of Ptolemy's coronation. The demotic text conflicts with this, listing consecutive days in March for the decree and the anniversary. It is uncertain why this discrepancy exists, but it is clear that the decree was issued in 196 BC and that it was designed to re-establish the rule of the Ptolemaic kings over Egypt.\nThe decree was issued during a turbulent period in Egyptian history. Ptolemy V Epiphanes, the son of Ptolemy\u00a0IV Philopator and his wife and sister Arsinoe, reigned from 204 to 181 BC. He had become ruler at the age of five after the sudden death of both of his parents, who were murdered in a conspiracy that involved Ptolemy IV's mistress Agathoclea, according to contemporary sources. The conspirators effectively ruled Egypt as Ptolemy\u00a0V's guardians until a revolt broke out two years later under general Tlepolemus, when Agathoclea and her family were lynched by a mob in Alexandria. Tlepolemus, in turn, was replaced as guardian in 201 BC by Aristomenes of Alyzia, who was chief minister at the time of the Memphis decree.\nPolitical forces beyond the borders of Egypt exacerbated the internal problems of the Ptolemaic kingdom. Antiochus\u00a0III the Great and Philip\u00a0V of Macedon had made a pact to divide Egypt's overseas possessions. Philip had seized several islands and cities in Caria and Thrace, while the Battle of Panium (198 BC) had resulted in the transfer of Coele-Syria, including Judaea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Meanwhile, in the south of Egypt, there was a long-standing revolt that had begun during the reign of Ptolemy IV, led by Horwennefer and by his successor Ankhwennefer. Both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing when the young Ptolemy V was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign) and when, just over a year later, the Memphis decree was issued.\nStelae of this kind, which were established on the initiative of the temples rather than that of the king, are unique to Ptolemaic Egypt. In the preceding Pharaonic period it would have been unheard of for anyone but the divine rulers themselves to make national decisions: by contrast, this way of honouring a king was a feature of Greek cities. Rather than making his eulogy himself, the king had himself glorified and deified by his subjects or representative groups of his subjects. The decree records that Ptolemy\u00a0V gave a gift of silver and grain to the temples. It also records that there was particularly high flooding of the Nile in the eighth year of his reign, and he had the excess waters dammed for the benefit of the farmers. In return the priesthood pledged that the king's birthday and coronation days would be celebrated annually and that all the priests of Egypt would serve him alongside the other gods. The decree concludes with the instruction that a copy was to be placed in every temple, inscribed in the \"language of the gods\" (Egyptian hieroglyphs), the \"language of documents\" (Demotic), and the \"language of the Greeks\" as used by the Ptolemaic government.\nSecuring the favour of the priesthood was essential for the Ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace. The High Priests of Memphis\u2014where the king was crowned\u2014were particularly important, as they were the highest religious authorities of the time and had influence throughout the kingdom. Given that the decree was issued at Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, rather than Alexandria, the centre of government of the ruling Ptolemies, it is evident that the young king was anxious to gain their active support. Thus, although the government of Egypt had been Greek-speaking ever since the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Memphis decree, like the three similar earlier decrees, included texts in Egyptian to show its connection to the general populace by way of the literate Egyptian priesthood.\nThere can be no one definitive English translation of the decree, not only because modern understanding of the ancient languages continues to develop, but also because of the minor differences between the three original texts. Older translations by E. A. Wallis Budge (1904, 1913) and Edwyn R. Bevan (1927) are easily available but are now outdated, as can be seen by comparing them with the recent translation by R. S. Simpson, which is based on the demotic text and can be found online, or with the modern translations of all three texts, with introduction and facsimile drawing, that were published by Quirke and Andrews in 1989.\nThe stele was almost certainly not originally placed at Rashid (Rosetta) where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of Sais. The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship. The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we now know as the Rosetta Stone. Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the Rosetta Stone was probably re-used in this manner. Later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the Mameluke Sultan Qaitbay (c.\u20091416/18\u20131496) to defend the Bolbitine branch of the Nile at Rashid. There it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery.\nThree other inscriptions relevant to the same Memphis decree have been found since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone: the Nubayrah Stele, a stele found in Elephantine and Noub Taha, and an inscription found at the Temple of Philae (on the Philae obelisk). Unlike the Rosetta Stone, the hieroglyphic texts of these inscriptions were relatively intact. The Rosetta Stone had been deciphered long before they were found, but later Egyptologists have used it to refine the reconstruction of the hieroglyphs that must have been used in the lost portions of the hieroglyphic text on the Rosetta Stone.\nRediscovery.\nLed by Napoleon, the French Army of the Orient invaded Egypt in 1798. The French army was accompanied by a corps of 151 technical experts (\"savants\"), known as the Commission des Sciences et des Arts. In mid-July 1799, French soldiers under the command of Colonel d'Hautpoul were strengthening the defences of Fort Julien, a couple of miles north-east of the Egyptian port city of Rosetta (modern-day Rashid). Lieutenant Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Bouchard spotted a slab with inscriptions on one side that the soldiers had uncovered when demolishing a wall within the fort. He and d'Hautpoul saw at once that it might be important and informed General Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou, who happened to be at Rosetta.[A] The find was announced to Napoleon's newly founded scientific association in Cairo, the Institut d'\u00c9gypte, in a report by Commission member Michel Ange Lancret noting that it contained three inscriptions, the first in hieroglyphs and the third in Greek, and rightly suggesting that the three inscriptions were versions of the same text. Lancret's report was received at a meeting of the Institute on 19 July. Bouchard, meanwhile, transported the stone to Cairo for examination by scholars.\nThe discovery was reported in September in \"Courrier de l'\u00c9gypte\", the official newspaper of the French occupational authorities. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day be the key to deciphering hieroglyphs.[A] In 1800 three of the commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9 who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.\nNapoleon returned to Europe in August 1799, abandoning his troops in Egypt. In March 1801, British forces landed at Abu Qir Bay. Menou, now in command of the Army of the Orient, marched north towards the Mediterranean coast to meet the British, transporting the stone along with many other antiquities. The French were defeated in the Battle of Alexandria, and the remnant of Menou's army retreated to Alexandria where they were surrounded and besieged, with the stone now inside the city. Menou surrendered to the British and Ottomans on 30 August.\nFrom French to British possession.\nAfter the surrender, a dispute arose over the fate of the French archaeological and scientific discoveries in Egypt, including the artefacts, biological specimens, notes, plans, and drawings collected by the members of the commission. Menou refused to hand them over, claiming that they belonged to the institute. British General John Hely-Hutchinson refused to end the siege until Menou gave in. Scholars Edward Daniel Clarke and William Richard Hamilton, newly arrived from England, agreed to examine the collections in Alexandria and said they had found many artefacts that the French had not revealed. In a letter home, Clarke wrote that \"we found much more in their possession than was represented or imagined\".\nHutchinson claimed that all materials were property of the British Crown, but French scholar \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire told Clarke and Hamilton that the French would rather burn all their discoveries than turn them over, referring ominously to the destruction of the Library of Alexandria. Clarke and Hamilton pleaded the French scholars' case to Hutchinson, who finally agreed that items such as natural history specimens would be considered the scholars' private property. Menou quickly claimed the stone, too, as his private property. Hutchinson was equally aware of the stone's unique value and rejected Menou's claim. Eventually an agreement was reached, and the transfer of the objects was incorporated into the Capitulation of Alexandria signed by representatives of the British, French, and Ottoman forces.\nIt is not clear exactly how the stone was transferred into British hands, as contemporary accounts differ. Colonel Tomkyns Hilgrove Turner, who was to escort it to England, claimed later that he had personally seized it from Menou and carried it away on a gun-carriage. In a much more detailed account, Edward Daniel Clarke stated that a French \"officer and member of the Institute\" had taken him, his student John Cripps, and Hamilton secretly into the back streets behind Menou's residence and revealed the stone hidden under protective carpets among Menou's baggage. According to Clarke, their informant feared that the stone might be stolen if French soldiers saw it. Hutchinson was informed at once and the stone was taken away\u2014possibly by Turner and his gun-carriage.\nTurner brought the stone to England aboard the captured French frigate HMS \"\u00c9gyptienne\", landing in Portsmouth in February 1802. His orders were to present it and the other antiquities to King George\u00a0III. The King, represented by War Secretary Lord Hobart, directed that it should be placed in the British Museum. According to Turner's narrative, he and Hobart agreed that the stone should be presented to scholars at the Society of Antiquaries of London, of which Turner was a member, before its final deposit in the museum. It was first seen and discussed there at a meeting on 11 March 1802.[B][H]\nIn 1802, the Society created four plaster casts of the inscriptions, which were given to the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh and to Trinity College Dublin. Soon afterwards, prints of the inscriptions were made and circulated to European scholars.[E] Before the end of 1802, the stone was transferred to the British Museum, where it is located today. New inscriptions painted in white on the left and right edges of the slab stated that it was \"Captured in Egypt by the British Army in 1801\" and \"Presented by King George\u00a0III\".\nThe stone has been exhibited almost continuously in the British Museum since June 1802. During the middle of the 19th century, it was given the inventory number \"EA 24\", \"EA\" standing for \"Egyptian Antiquities\". It was part of a collection of ancient Egyptian monuments captured from the French expedition, including a sarcophagus of Nectanebo\u00a0II (EA 10), the statue of a high priest of Amun (EA 81), and a large granite fist (EA 9). The objects were soon discovered to be too heavy for the floors of Montagu House (the original building of The British Museum), and they were transferred to a new extension that was added to the mansion. The Rosetta Stone was transferred to the sculpture gallery in 1834 shortly after Montagu House was demolished and replaced by the building that now houses the British Museum. According to the museum's records, the Rosetta Stone is its most-visited single object, a simple image of it was the museum's best selling postcard for several decades, and a wide variety of merchandise bearing the text from the Rosetta Stone (or replicating its distinctive shape) is sold in the museum shops.\nThe Rosetta Stone was originally displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle that was made for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides to ensure that the cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004 the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.\nThe museum was concerned about heavy bombing in London towards the end of the First World War in 1917, and the Rosetta Stone was moved to safety, along with other portable objects of value. The stone spent the next two years below ground level in a station of the Postal Tube Railway at Mount Pleasant near Holborn. Other than during wartime, the Rosetta Stone has left the British Museum only once: for one month in October 1972, to be displayed alongside Champollion's \"Lettre\" at the Louvre in Paris on the 150th anniversary of the letter's publication. Even when the Rosetta Stone was undergoing conservation measures in 1999, the work was done in the gallery so that it could remain visible to the public.\nReading the Rosetta Stone.\nPrior to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and its eventual decipherment, the ancient Egyptian language and script had not been understood since shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire. The usage of the hieroglyphic script had become increasingly specialised even in the later Pharaonic period; by the 4th century AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading them. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased as temple priesthoods died out and Egypt was converted to Christianity; the last known inscription is dated to 24 August 394, found at Philae and known as the Graffito of Esmet-Akhom. The last known demotic text, also from Philae, was written in 452.\nHieroglyphs retained their pictorial appearance, and classical authors emphasised this aspect, in sharp contrast to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote \"Hieroglyphica\", an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Pierius Valerianus in the 16th century and Athanasius Kircher in the 17th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.\nGreek text.\nThe Greek text on the Rosetta Stone provided the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, but they were not familiar with details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek papyri were a long way in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.\nMeanwhile, two of the lithographic copies made in Egypt had reached the Institut de France in Paris in 1801. There, librarian and antiquarian Gabriel de La Porte du Theil set to work on a translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon's orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely.[H] At Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. He produced a skillful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, Christian Gottlob Heyne in G\u00f6ttingen was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was more reliable than Ameilhon's and was first published in 1803.[G] It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal \"Archaeologia\" in 1811, alongside Weston's previously unpublished English translation, Colonel Turner's narrative, and other documents.[H]\nDemotic text.\nAt the time of the stone's discovery, Swedish diplomat and scholar Johan David \u00c5kerblad was working on a little-known script of which some examples had recently been found in Egypt, which came to be known as Demotic. He called it \"cursive Coptic\" because he was convinced that it was used to record some form of the Coptic language (the direct descendant of Ancient Egyptian), although it had few similarities with the later Coptic script. French Orientalist Antoine-Isaac Silvestre de Sacy had been discussing this work with \u00c5kerblad when, in 1801, he received one of the early lithographic prints of the Rosetta Stone, from Jean-Antoine Chaptal, French minister of the Interior. He realised that the middle text was in this same script. He and \u00c5kerblad set to work, both focusing on the middle text and assuming that the script was alphabetical. They attempted to identify the points where Greek names ought to occur within this unknown text, by comparing it with the Greek. In 1802, Silvestre de Sacy reported to Chaptal that he had successfully identified five names (\"Alexandros\", \"Alexandreia\", \"Ptolemaios\", \"Arsinoe\", and Ptolemy's title \"Epiphanes\"),[C] while \u00c5kerblad published an alphabet of 29 letters (more than half of which were correct) that he had identified from the Greek names in the Demotic text.[D] They could not, however, identify the remaining characters in the Demotic text, which, as is now known, included ideographic and other symbols alongside the phonetic ones.\nHieroglyphic text.\nSilvestre de Sacy eventually gave up work on the stone, but he was to make another contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zo\u00ebga in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote to him about the stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.\nYoung did so, with two results that together paved the way for the final decipherment. In the hieroglyphic text, he discovered the phonetic characters (in today's transliteration ) that were used to write the Greek name . He also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the demotic script, and went on to note as many as 80 similarities between the hieroglyphic and demotic texts on the stone, an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely different from one another. This led him to deduce correctly that the demotic script was only partly phonetic, also consisting of ideographic characters derived from hieroglyphs.[I] Young's new insights were prominent in the long article \"Egypt\" that he contributed to the in 1819.[J] He could make no further progress, however.\nIn 1814, Young first exchanged correspondence about the stone with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, a teacher at Grenoble who had produced a scholarly work on ancient Egypt. Champollion saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and Greek inscriptions of the Philae obelisk in 1822, on which William John Bankes had tentatively noted the names and in both languages. From this, Champollion identified the phonetic characters (in today's transliteration ). On the basis of this and the foreign names on the Rosetta Stone, he quickly constructed an alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphic characters, completing his work on 14 September and announcing it publicly on 27 September in a lecture to the . On the same day he wrote the famous to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie, detailing his discovery.[K] In the postscript Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur in both Greek and Egyptian names, a hypothesis confirmed in 1823, when he identified the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches at Abu Simbel. These far older hieroglyphic inscriptions had been copied by Bankes and sent to Champollion by Jean-Nicolas Huyot.[M] From this point, the stories of the Rosetta Stone and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs diverge, as Champollion drew on many other texts to develop an Ancient Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary which were published after his death in 1832.\nLater work.\nWork on the stone now focused on fuller understanding of the texts and their contexts by comparing the three versions with one another. In 1824 Classical scholar Antoine-Jean Letronne promised to prepare a new literal translation of the Greek text for Champollion's use. Champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ. Following Champollion's sudden death in 1832, his draft of this analysis could not be found, and Letronne's work stalled. Fran\u00e7ois Salvolini, Champollion's former student and assistant, died in 1838, and this analysis and other missing drafts were found among his papers. This discovery incidentally demonstrated that Salvolini's own publication on the stone, published in 1837, was plagiarism.[O] Letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the Greek text and his new French translation of it, which appeared in 1841.[P] During the early 1850s, German Egyptologists Heinrich Brugsch and Max Uhlemann produced revised Latin translations based on the demotic and hieroglyphic texts.[Q][R] The first English translation followed in 1858, the work of three members of the Philomathean Society at the University of Pennsylvania.[S]\nWhether one of the three texts was the standard version, from which the other two were originally translated, is a question that has remained controversial. Letronne attempted to show in 1841 that the Greek version, the product of the Egyptian government under the Macedonian Ptolemies, was the original.[P] Among recent authors, John Ray has stated that \"the hieroglyphs were the most important of the scripts on the stone: they were there for the gods to read, and the more learned of their priesthood\". Philippe Derchain and Heinz Josef Thissen have argued that all three versions were composed simultaneously, while Stephen Quirke sees in the decree \"an intricate coalescence of three vital textual traditions\". Richard Parkinson points out that the hieroglyphic version strays from archaic formalism and occasionally lapses into language closer to that of the demotic register that the priests more commonly used in everyday life. The fact that the three versions cannot be matched word for word helps to explain why the decipherment has been more difficult than originally expected, especially for those original scholars who were expecting an exact bilingual key to Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nRivalries.\nEven before the Salvolini affair, disputes over precedence and plagiarism punctuated the decipherment story. Thomas Young's work is acknowledged in Champollion's 1822 \"Lettre \u00e0 M. Dacier\", but incompletely, according to early British critics: for example, James Browne, a sub-editor on the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" (which had published Young's 1819 article), anonymously contributed a series of review articles to the \"Edinburgh Review\" in 1823, praising Young's work highly and alleging that the \"unscrupulous\" Champollion plagiarised it. These articles were translated into French by Julius Klaproth and published in book form in 1827.[N] Young's own 1823 publication reasserted the contribution that he had made.[L] The early deaths of Young (1829) and Champollion (1832) did not put an end to these disputes. In his work on the stone in 1904 E. A. Wallis Budge gave special emphasis to Young's contribution compared with Champollion's. In the early 1970s, French visitors complained that the portrait of Champollion was smaller than one of Young on an adjacent information panel; English visitors complained that the opposite was true. The portraits were in fact the same size.\nRequests for repatriation to Egypt.\nCalls for the Rosetta Stone to be returned to Egypt were made in July 2003 by Zahi Hawass, then Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. These calls, expressed in the Egyptian and international media, asked that the stele be repatriated to Egypt, commenting that it was the \"icon of our Egyptian identity\". He repeated the proposal two years later in Paris, listing the stone as one of several key items belonging to Egypt's cultural heritage, a list which also included: the iconic bust of Nefertiti in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin; a statue of the Great Pyramid architect Hemiunu in the Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim, Germany; the Dendera Temple Zodiac in the Louvre in Paris; and the bust of Ankhhaf in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. In August 2022, Hawass reiterated his previous demands.\nIn 2005, the British Museum presented Egypt with a full-sized fibreglass colour-matched replica of the stele. This was initially displayed in the renovated Rashid National Museum, an Ottoman house in the town of Rashid (Rosetta), the closest city to the site where the stone was found. In November 2005, Hawass suggested a three-month loan of the Rosetta Stone, while reiterating the eventual goal of a permanent return. In December 2009, he proposed to drop his claim for the permanent return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum lent the stone to Egypt for three months for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013.\nAs John Ray has observed: \"The day may come when the stone has spent longer in the British Museum than it ever did in Rosetta.\"\nNational museums typically express strong opposition to the repatriation of objects of international cultural significance such as the Rosetta Stone. In response to repeated Greek requests for return of the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and similar requests to other museums around the world, in 2002, over 30 of the world's leading museums\u2014including the British Museum, the Louvre, the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City\u2014issued a joint statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Objects acquired in earlier times must be viewed in the light of different sensitivities and values reflective of that earlier era...museums serve not just the citizens of one nation but the people of every nation.\nIdiomatic use.\nVarious ancient bilingual or even trilingual epigraphical documents have sometimes been described as \"Rosetta stones\", as they permitted the decipherment of ancient written scripts. For example, the bilingual Greek-Brahmi coins of the Greco-Bactrian king Agathocles have been described as \"little Rosetta stones\", allowing Christian Lassen's initial progress towards deciphering the Brahmi script, thus unlocking ancient Indian epigraphy. The Behistun Inscription in Iran has also been compared to the Rosetta stone, as it links the translations of three ancient Middle-Eastern languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Akkadian. The Sardis bilingual has been called the Rosetta stone for the Lydian language.\nThe term \"Rosetta stone\" has been also used idiomatically to denote the first crucial key in the process of decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells's 1933 novel \"The Shape of Things to Come\", where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on a typewriter.\nSince then, the term has been widely used in other contexts. For example, Nobel laureate Theodor W. H\u00e4nsch in a 1979 \"Scientific American\" article on spectroscopy wrote that \"the spectrum of the hydrogen atoms has proven to be the Rosetta Stone of modern physics: once this pattern of lines had been deciphered much else could also be understood\". Fully understanding the key set of genes to the human leucocyte antigen has been described as \"the Rosetta Stone of immunology\". The flowering plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" has been called the \"Rosetta Stone of flowering time\". A gamma-ray burst (GRB) found in conjunction with a supernova has been called a Rosetta Stone for understanding the origin of GRBs. The technique of Doppler echocardiography has been called a Rosetta Stone for clinicians trying to understand the complex process by which the left ventricle of the human heart can be filled during various forms of diastolic dysfunction. The European Space Agency's \"Rosetta\" spacecraft, launched to study the comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in the hope that determining its composition will advance understanding of the origins of the Solar System.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term often implies that said character was introduced for the sole purpose of being killed off while adding little else to the story, and is sometimes used pejoratively to point out a redshirt's lack of good characterization or the predictability of the character's death. Redshirt deaths are often used to emphasize the potential peril faced by more important characters.\nThe term originates from the (1966\u201369), in which red-uniformed security officers and engineers often suffered deaths in the episode in which they first appeared, in contrast to most of the show's main characters wearing other colors.\nOrigin.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2026red-shirted security guards [who] often got torn apart by a monster or dematerialized by a Klingon\u2026\u2014\u200a\nIn \"Star Trek\", red-uniformed security officers and engineers who accompany the main characters on landing parties often suffer quick deaths. The first instance of what now is an established trope can be seen in the 1966 episode \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\".\nOf the 55 crew members killed in the series, twenty-four were wearing red shirts, compared to fifteen who had unconfirmed shirt colors, nine in gold shirts, and seven in blue shirts.\nThe \"\" book \"Legends of the Ferengi\" says Starfleet security personnel \"rarely survive beyond the second act break\".

The 2009 cinematic reboot of the franchise features a character named Olson (portrayed by Greg Ellis) who dies early on during a mission; he wears a red uniform in homage to the trope from the original series.\nUsage.\nIn other media, the term \"redshirt\" and images of characters wearing red shirts have come to represent disposable characters destined for suffering or death.\nThe trope, and its particular usage in \"Star Trek\", has been parodied and deconstructed in other media. Parodies include the 1999 comedy film \"Galaxy Quest\", about actors from a defunct science-fiction television series serving on a real starship, which includes an actor who is terrified that he is going to die because his only appearance in the show was as an unnamed character who was killed early in the episode. The novel \"Redshirts\" by John Scalzi satirizes the trope, as does the video game \"Redshirt\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each submarine was armed with up to 16 UGM-27 Polaris A-3 nuclear missiles.\nThe class comprised , , and . They were built by Vickers Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness and Cammell Laird in Birkenhead between 1964 and 1968. All four boats were based at HM Naval Base Clyde (HMS \"Neptune\"), west of Glasgow, Scotland.\nThe \"Resolution\" class was the launch platform for the United Kingdom's strategic nuclear deterrent from the late 1960s until 1996, when it was replaced by the carrying the Trident II.\nBackground.\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent was based on the RAF's V-bombers. But in the early 1960s developments in radar and surface-to-air missiles made it clear that bombers were becoming vulnerable, and would be unlikely to penetrate Soviet airspace. Free-fall nuclear weapons would no longer be a credible deterrent.\nTo address this problem, in May 1960 the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan arranged a deal with US President Eisenhower to equip the V bombers with the US-designed AGM-48 Skybolt. The Skybolt was a range ballistic missile that allowed the launching bombers to remain well away from Soviet defences and launch attacks that would be basically invulnerable. With this range, the V bombers would have to fly only a few hundred miles from their bases before being in range for an attack on Moscow.\nUnder the agreement the UK's contribution to the programme was limited to developing suitable mounting points on the Avro Vulcan bomber, installing the required guidance systems that fed the missiles updated positioning information, and development of a British version of the US W47 warhead to arm it, the RE.179 http:// .\nThe Skybolt crisis.\nThe incoming Kennedy administration expressed serious doubts of both Skybolt and the US deterrent force in general. Robert McNamara was highly critical of the US bomber fleet, which he saw as obsolete in an age of ICBMs. Skybolt was seen simply as a means of continuing the existence of a system he no longer considered credible, and given the rapidly improving capabilities of ICBM inertial guidance systems, a precision strike capability with free-fall bombs would no longer be needed. McNamara was equally concerned about the UK also having its own nuclear force, and worried that the US could be drawn into a war by the UK. He wanted to bring the UK into a dual-key arrangement.\nMcNamara first broached the idea of cancelling Skybolt with the British in November 1962. When this was reported in the House of Commons, a storm of protest broke out. A meeting was arranged to settle the issue, and Macmillan stated in no uncertain terms that the UK would be retaining their independent deterrent capability, no matter what the cost. With development of their Polaris-derived warheads well along, a suitable launch platform would be developed, if need be.\nFaced with a clear failure in policy terms, Kennedy gave up on the idea of strong-arming Britain into accepting a dual-key arrangement. By the end of the series of meetings, the UK had gained the much more impressive Polaris system, and would start development of a new submarine to launch it. The SSBNs would then take over the nuclear deterrent role from the RAF's V bombers from 1968 onwards.\nConstruction.\nTwo pairs of the boats were ordered in May 1963 from Vickers Shipbuilding Ltd, Barrow in Furness and from Cammell Laird and Co. Ltd, Birkenhead. The option of buying a fifth unit, planned as ,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a] was cancelled in February 1965 as a cost-savings measure by the government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Traditional battleship names were used, signifying that they were the capital ships of their time.\nVickers Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness constructed \"Resolution\" and \"Repulse\" and Cammell Laird in Birkenhead constructed \"Renown\" and \"Revenge\". The construction was unusual in that the bow and stern were constructed separately before being assembled together with the American-designed missile compartment.\nThe design was a modification of the fleet submarine, but greatly extended to incorporate the missile compartment between the fin and the nuclear reactor. The length was , breadth , height and the displacement submerged and surfaced. A Rolls-Royce pressurised water reactor (PWR1) and English Electric Company turbines gave them a speed of and they could dive to depths of . Sixteen Polaris A3 missiles were carried, in two rows of eight. For emergencies there was a diesel generator and six torpedo tubes located at the bow, firing the Tigerfish wire-guided homing torpedoes. The submarines put to sea with a crew of 143.\nAccording to former head of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors R.J. Daniel, the \"Resolution\"-class SSBNs possessed five features that were envied by the United States Navy: the machinery loading hatch, automated hovering system, welded hull valves, standardised valves, and raft-mounted propulsion machinery.\nOperational service.\nThe first to be completed was \"Resolution\", laid down in February 1964 and launched in September 1966. After commissioning in 1967 she underwent a long period of sea trials, culminating in the test firing of a Polaris missile from the USAF Eastern Test Range off Cape Kennedy at 11:15 on 15 February 1968. \"Resolution\" commenced her first operational patrol on 15 June 1968, beginning 28 years of Polaris patrols. The class were part of the 10th Submarine Squadron, all based at Faslane Naval Base, Scotland.\nAll four of the class underwent conversion during the 1980s so that they could be fitted with the Polaris A3TK missile which was fitted with the British-developed Chevaline MRV system.\nAs the newer \"Vanguard\"-class submarines entered service, the \"Resolution\" class was eventually retired and all boats laid up at Rosyth dockyard with their used nuclear fuel removed. All four will eventually be disposed of via MOD's Submarine Dismantling Project (SDP). This project will begin in 2016 with as the first submarine to prove the technique. The selected method will first remove all Low-level radioactive waste from the vessel, followed by the more radioactive intermediate-level waste. All non-radioactive material in the remainder of the vessel will be recycled for re-use by conventional ship-breaking techniques.\nRefits.\nNew methods of project management were used in the refits of the \"Resolution\" class, including:\nReferences.\nCited footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a regular contributor to \"The New Yorker\" and was its chief fiction editor for many years. He wrote numerous works of fiction, non-fiction, and criticism, and for many years wrote an annual Christmas poem for \"The New Yorker\". Sportswriter Jane Leavy called him \"the Babe Ruth of baseball writers.\"\nEarly life and education.\nBorn on September 19, 1920, in Manhattan, New York, Angell was the son of Katharine Sergeant Angell White, \"The New Yorker\"'s first fiction editor; he was raised for the most part by his father, Ernest Angell, an attorney who became head of the American Civil Liberties Union. He was the stepson of renowned essayist E.\u00a0B. White.\nAfter graduating in 1938 from the Pomfret School, he attended Harvard University. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.\nCareer.\nIn 1948, Angell was employed at \"Holiday Magazine\", a travel magazine that featured literary writers. His earliest published works were pieces of short fiction and personal narratives, several of which were collected in \"The Stone Arbor and Other Stories\" (1960) and \"A Day in the Life of Roger Angell\" (1970).\nAngell first contributed to \"The New Yorker\" while serving in Hawaii as editor of an Air Force magazine; his short story titled \"Three Ladies in the Morning\" was published in March 1944. He became \"The New Yorker\"'s fiction editor in the 1950s, occupying the same office as his mother, and continued to write for the magazine until 2020. \"Longevity was actually quite low on his list of accomplishments\", wrote his colleague David Remnick. \"He did as much to distinguish \"The New Yorker\" as anyone in the magazine's nearly century-long history. His prose and his editorial judgment left an imprint that's hard to overstate.\"\nHe first wrote professionally about baseball in 1962, when \"New Yorker\" editor William Shawn had him travel to Florida to write about spring training. His career as a baseball writer coincided with the first season of the New York Mets. His style of baseball writing was inspired, he said, by John Updike's article on Ted Williams's farewell to fans at Fenway Park, \"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu\". Angell said \"John had already supplied my tone, while also seeming to invite me to try for a good sentence now and then, down the line.\u201d His first two baseball collections were \"The Summer Game\" (1972) and \"Five Seasons\" (1977). These were followed by \"Late Innings\" (1982) and \"\" (1988). \nAngell has been called the \"Poet Laureate of baseball\" but he disliked the term. In a review of \"Once More Around the Park\" for the \"Journal of Sport History\", Richard C. Crepeau wrote that \"Gone for Good\", Angell's essay on the career of Steve Blass, \"may be the best piece that anyone has ever written on baseball or any other sport\". Another essay of Angell's, \"The Web of the Game\", about the epic pitchers' duel between future major-league All-Stars (and eventual teammates) Ron Darling and Frank Viola in the 1981 NCAA baseball tournament, was called \"perhaps the greatest baseball essay ever penned\" by ESPN journalist Ryan McGee in 2021. Angell contributed commentary to the Ken Burns series \"Baseball\", in 1994.\nPersonal life and death.\nAngell was married three times. He had two daughters, Callie and Alice, with his first wife, Evelyn Baker, to whom he was married for 19 years before divorcing. Angell had a son, John Henry, with his second wife, Carol Rogge. After 48 years of marriage, Carol Angell died on April 10, 2012, at the age of 73 of metastatic breast cancer. In 2014, he married Margaret \"Peggy\" Moorman.\nHis daughter Callie, an authority on the films of Andy Warhol, died by suicide on May 5, 2010, in Manhattan, where she worked as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art; she was 62. In a 2014 essay, he mentioned her death \u2013 \"the oceanic force and mystery of that event\" \u2013 and his struggle to comprehend that \"a beautiful daughter of mine, my oldest child, had ended her life\".\nAngell died of congestive heart failure at his home in Manhattan on May 20, 2022, at the age of 101.\nAwards and legacy.\nDavid Remnick said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s ever been a writer so strong, and an editor so important, all at once, at a magazine since the days of H. L. Mencken running \"The American Mercury\",\u201d adding \u201cRoger was a vigorous editor, and an intellect with broad tastes.\u201d Per his \"New York Times\" obituary, \"Like his mother, Mr. Angell became a New Yorker fiction editor, discovering and nurturing writers, including Ann Beattie, Bobbie Ann Mason and Garrison Keillor. For a while he occupied his mother\u2019s old office \u2014 an experience, he told an interviewer, that was 'the weirdest thing in the world.' He also worked closely with writers like Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike, Donald Barthelme, Ruth Jhabvala and V.S. Pritchett.\"\nAngell received a number of awards for his writing, including the George Polk Award for Commentary in 1980, the \"Kenyon Review\" Award for Literary Achievement in 2005 along with Umberto Eco, and the inaugural PEN/ESPN Lifetime Achievement Award for Literary Sports Writing in 2011. He was a long-time ex-officio member of the council of the Authors Guild, and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007. His article \"This Old Man\" in \"The New Yorker\" on his \"challenges and joys of being 93\" garnered the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism in 2015.\nHe was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2010, and he was the 2014 recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, now known as the BBWAA Career Excellence Award, of the Baseball Writers' Association of America; despite being a \"New Yorker\" writer, he was nominated by the San Francisco\u2013Oakland chapter. In 2015 he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a unique combination with the Baseball Hall of Fame. \nRoss Douthat named \"Late Innings\", \"The Summer Game\" and \"Five Seasons\" as influences: \"I can\u2019t point to any specific philosophy or perspective on contemporary America that I arrived at from reading, re-reading, and re-re-reading Angell\u2019s luminous accounts of baseball seasons past. But if I were to make a list of writers who taught me how to write, he\u2019d be near the top of it.\" Michael Chabon names Angell and Jan Morris as \"two of my favorite authors who are primarily writers of non-fiction.\" \nAngell has four pieces excerpted in the Library of America volume \"Baseball: A Literary Anthology\", more than any other author. Editor Nicholas Dawidoff quotes a letter Angell's stepfather, E. B. White, wrote to Angell: \"It's new and exciting to have someone exploring baseball at the depth you have ventured into.\" Dawidoff writes: Angell's achievement was to turn quotidian baseball writing into belles lettres. In so doing he became the preeminent baseball writer of our era, a generous, appreciative, meticulous observer whose descriptions of the game are set forth with grace, brio, and wit. (Who else would refer to \"the vast pastel conch of Dodger Stadium\"?) Angell has Wagnerian range (Honus, that is); he is a master capable of vivid excursions into the profile (see Bob Gibson); he can make games he never saw breathtaking in their excitement (witness the 1986 National League playoffs); and he often reflects on matters philosophical (\"The Interior Stadium\" is the consummate baseball essay). He can write at length and, what is often more difficult, can write in brief.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26436", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26436", "title": "Rent (musical)", "text": "American rock musical by Jonathan Larson\nRent (stylized in all caps) is a rock musical with music, lyrics, and book by Jonathan Larson. Loosely based on the 1896 opera \"La boh\u00e8me\" by Giacomo Puccini, Luigi Illica, and Giuseppe Giacosa, it tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in Lower Manhattan's East Village, in the thriving days of the bohemian culture of Alphabet City, under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.\nThe musical was first seen in 1993 in a workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop, the off-Broadway theatre which was also where the musical began performances on January 26, 1996. The show's creator, Jonathan Larson, had died suddenly of an aortic dissection the night before. The musical moved to Broadway's larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.\nOn Broadway, \"Rent\" gained critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Musical. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after 12 years, making it one of the longest-running shows on Broadway. The production grossed over $280 million.\nThe success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions. In 2005, it was adapted into a motion picture featuring six of the eight principal cast members from the 1996 stage premiere.\nConcept and genesis.\nIn 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create \"a musical based on Puccini's \"La Boh\u00e8me\", in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York.\" In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together \"Santa Fe\", \"Rent\", and \"I Should Tell You\". Larson suggested setting the play \"in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. He suggested making \"Rent\" the title; Aronson agreed. In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make \"Rent\" his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for \"Rent\"; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera \"to bring musical theater to the MTV generation\". Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for \"original concept &amp; additional lyrics\".\nJonathan Larson focused on composing \"Rent\" in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of \"Rent\"'s script.\nIn the 1992 script, the homeless characters were named Rudy, Dogman, Mrs. Chance, and later, were joined by politician-turned-homeless Otam Desnofla. They were also given significantly more material. Some of their characteristics remained in the final version of the show, such as the former Mrs. Chance becoming the \"Seasons of Love\" soloist.\nThe early 1993 version of \"Rent\" also featured songs that were dropped before subsequent revisions, including:\nWhen \"Rent\" had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.\nAs of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of \"Rent\" featured songs that never made it into the final version, such as:\nThis workshop version of \"Rent\" starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi. Larson continued to work on \"Rent\", gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.\nOn January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview; music critic Anthony Tommasini of \"The New York Times\"\u00a0\u2013 who had been attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera\u00a0\u2013 requested the interview. Larson would not live to see \"Rent\"'s success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic dissection (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome) early the next morning, January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of \"Rent\" became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.\nThe show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theatre Workshop. Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, \"Rent\" moved to Broadway's then-under-renovation Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street and opened on April 29, 1996.\nSources and inspiration.\nLarson's inspiration for \"Rent\"'s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera \"La Boh\u00e8me\", the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before \"Rent\"'s premiere. \"La Boh\u00e8me\" was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in \"Rent\"; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of \"Rent\"'s characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in \"Rent\" represents the character of Alcindoro in \"Boh\u00e8me\", but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only \"Rent\" character whose predecessor in \"La Boh\u00e8me\" is a different sex.\nOther examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song \"Light My Candle\", which draws melodic content directly from \"Che gelida manina\"; \"Quando me'n vo'\" (\"Musetta's Waltz\"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and \"Goodbye Love\", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work. \"Quando me'n vo'\" is paralleled in the first verse of \"Take Me or Leave Me\", when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, \"Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song...\" Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, \"...that \"doesn't\" remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'.\" This part of \"Musetta's Waltz\" is also later used in \"Your Eyes\", a song Roger writes.\n\"Rent\" is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in \"Rent\"]) made their way into the musical . Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman. The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.\nPlaywright Sarah Schulman alleged that \"Rent\" bore striking similarities to her novel \"People in Trouble\". Schulman's 1998 book \"Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS, and the Marketing of Gay America\" details these similarities and discusses her critiques of the musical.\nThe line, \"I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!\", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films \"Mannequin\" (1987) and \"\" (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing. This line was originally in the film \"Car Wash\" (1976), delivered by Antonio Fargas as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser named Lindy.\nThe earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off Oedipus in her performance piece instead of Hey Diddle Diddle; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a jazz philosopher, while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like \"Real Estate\", which was later cut.\nMany actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Caf\u00e9, where the \"La Vie Boh\u00e8me\" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City. The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village riot in 1988 that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park.\n\"Will I?\", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or had died from AIDS.\nThe scene and song \"Life Support\" were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the \"forget regret\" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this \"credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?\" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, \"Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?\" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, \"Then why choose fear?\" Gordon says, \"I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life.\"\nLynn Thomson lawsuit.\nLynn Thomson was a dramaturge who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework \"Rent\". She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a \"new version\" of the musical, and that she had a verbal agreement with Larson to a percentage of the royalties. She sued Jonathan Larson's estate for $40 million and sought 16 percent of the show's royalties, ultimately losing that suit. A revised suit claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the \"new version\" of \"Rent\" was filed later. The estate settled out of court.\nDuring the trial, according to a partner in the firm representing the Larson estate, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she allegedly wrote, nor the structures of the libretto she claimed to have created. The judge ruled against her and gave Larson's estate full credit and right to \"Rent\". A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In the judgement, the court ruled against Thomson saying \"she had brought the wrong suit.\" Thomson had sued over a verbal agreement she claimed to have with Larson, which she could not prove. However, the court stated in the judgment that her claim to have written some of the material in RENT, including the lyrics to the song \"Glory,\" was credible and that she had standing to sue for ownership of some of the material in RENT. She filed suit with revised claims. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\nPart of the issue of this case concerns the development of the field of .\nSynopsis.\nAct I.\nOn Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates\u2014Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician\u2014struggle to stay warm and produce their art (\"Tune Up #1\"). Mark's mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a Merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him (\"Voice Mail #1\"). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor of computer-age philosophy at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power (\"Tune Up #2\"). However, Mark and Roger stubbornly resolve against paying the rent, which they were promised would not be a problem (\"Rent\"). Meanwhile, Angel, a cross-dressing street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him (\"You Okay Honey?\") - the two are immediately attracted to each other, each learning that the other is HIV positive. It is revealed that Roger also has HIV, which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who died by suicide after learning of her diagnosis, causing Roger to fall into depression. Mark leaves the loft while Roger stays home (\"Tune Up #3\"), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies (\"One Song Glory\"). Their neighbor Mimi, an exotic dancer and drug addict, arrives at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections (\"Light My Candle\"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents (\"Voice Mail #2\").\nAt last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in full drag; she amusingly shares the money she earned from killing an affluent couple's dog by loudly playing nonstop for an hour (\"Today 4 U\"). Mark comes home, and Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they can successfully convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves (\"You'll See\"). Mark leaves the loft again to go help Maureen with the sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen's \"gaslighting\" and promiscuous behavior (\"Tango: Maureen\"). Mark then joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting (\"Life Support\"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment (\"Out Tonight\"). Extremely upset by Mimi's intrusion, he demands that she leave him alone and resists any romantic feelings he may harbor for her (\"Another Day\"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts (\"Will I\").\nCollins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment using Mark's camera, but she chastises them, believing their intent was for Mark to make a name for himself from her situation (\"On the Street\"). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe (\"Santa Fe\"). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger; while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other (\"I'll Cover You\"). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen's show, trying to balance the simultaneous multiple calls (\"We're Okay\"). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest (\"Christmas Bells\"). Maureen performs in an avant-garde, if not over-the-top, manner, basing her piece on \"Hey Diddle Diddle\" (\"Over the Moon\"). At the post-show party at the Life Caf\u00e9, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group's bohemian lifestyle while also revealing that his wife Alison's Akita, Evita, died due to Angel's actions; Mark and his group defiantly respond by celebrating their status (\"La Vie Boh\u00e8me\"). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to continue their relationship (\"I Should Tell You\"). At the end of the Act, Joanne explains that Mark and Roger's building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out; Roger and Mimi, unaware of the violence, share their first kiss. The celebration continues (\"La Vie Boh\u00e8me B\").\nAct II.\nThe cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life \"in love\" (\"Seasons of Love\"). On New Year's Eve, Mark, Mimi, Roger, Maureen, Joanne, Collins and Angel gather to break back into Mark and Roger's apartment which they have been locked out of. (\"Happy New Year\"). Once Mark, Joanne and Maureen break in through the window, a voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a tabloid news company called Buzzline (\"Voice Mail #3\"). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix (\"Happy New Year B\").\nAround Valentine's Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, Collins and Angel are nowhere to be found, and Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest; during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's controlling behavior, while Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuity. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum (\"Take Me or Leave Me\"). Time progresses to spring (\"Seasons of Love B\"), where Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating heroin usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS (\"Without You\"). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline (\"Voice Mail #4\"). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives (\"Contact\"). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies in Collins' arms. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories, with Collins being the last to reminisce (\"I'll Cover You [Reprise]\"). Mark expresses his fear of being the sole survivor when his friends eventually die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer (\"Halloween\"). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, while Maureen and Joanne argue. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group share a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will become undone. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, where Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi's declining health, becomes furious with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhearing everything Roger had said and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab, which Benny pays for (\"Goodbye Love\"). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral; Benny shows compassion by paying and offering Mark and Collins drinks. Collins accepts, causing the latter and Benny to rekindle their old friendship, but Mark turns down the offer due to work commitments.\nSome time later, both Mark and Roger simultaneously reach an artistic epiphany, as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory; Roger decides to return to New York in time for Christmas, while Mark quits his job to devote his efforts to working on his own film (\"What You Own\"). The characters' parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their answering machines (\"Voice Mail #5\"). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but apparently, Mimi is missing, and no one has seen her. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's past relationship with Mimi, has pulled him out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code 'ANGEL'. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him (\"Finale\"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her (\"Your Eyes\"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a white light before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is \"no day but today\" (\"Finale B\").\nMusical numbers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRoles.\nMinor characters.\nThere are also many other non-named roles such as Cops, Bohemians, Vendors, Homeless People.\nIn professional productions, all the minor characters are played by the seven members of the ensemble. The usual doubling is as follows:\nReception.\n\"Rent\" received several awards including a Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards.\nCritical reception of \"Rent\" was positive not only for its acting and musical components, but also for its representation of HIV-positive individuals. Many critics praised the portrayal of characters such as Angel and Collins as being happy, with positive outlooks on life, rather than being resigned to death. While critics and theatre patrons had largely positive reviews of the show, it was criticized for its stereotypically negative portrayal of lesbian characters and the \"glamourization\" of the East Village in the late 1980s.\nBilly Aronson said, \"For the record, although I was ambivalent about Jonathan's ideas for \"Rent\" when we were working together on it, I have come to love the show. And as tragic as it is that he didn't live to see his work become a huge success, I believe he knew it would be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible.\"\nCultural impact and legacy.\nThe song \"Seasons of Love\" became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own. Because of its connection to New Years and looking back at times past, it is sometimes performed at graduations or school holiday programs.\nRENT-heads.\n\"Rent\" gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as \"RENT-heads\". The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show. These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show. Other Broadway shows have followed \"Rent\"'s example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.\nPopular culture references.\nThe film \"\" includes a character who plays a lead role in \"Lease\", a Broadway musical parody of \"Rent\". In 2017, the song \"Out Tonight\" was covered by the characters Josie and the Pussycats in an episode of the television series \"Riverdale\". Satirist Randy Rainbow parodied \"Seasons of Love\" as \"Seasons of Trump\" for his 2021 look back at the Trump administration, and \"Tango: Maureen\" as \"Tango: Vaccine\" to highlight purveyors of COVID-19 misinformation.\n\"Rent\" has also been referenced in other musicals. Yitzhak in \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" wears a \"Rent\" T-shirt and speaks of his aspiration to play the role of Angel. The off-Broadway musical revue \"Forbidden Broadway Strikes Back\" includes parodies of \"Rent\" songs such as \"Rant\" (\"Rent\"), \"Ouch! They're Tight\" (\"Out Tonight\"), \"Season of Hype\" (\"Seasons of Love\"), \"Too Gay 4 U (Too Het'ro 4 Me)\" (\"Today 4 U\"), \"Pretty Voices Singing\" (\"Christmas Bells\") and \"This Ain't Boheme\" (\"La Vie Boh\u00e8me\"). Lin-Manuel Miranda, the composer and writer of the Broadway show \"Hamilton\", has cited \"Rent\" as a main source of inspiration. He also referenced the show in a verse of the song \"Wrote My Way Out\" on \"The Hamilton Mixtape\" in the line \"Running out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check\".\nProductions.\nNew York workshops and Off-Broadway production.\n\"Rent\" had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993. A further two-week New York Theatre Workshop version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened in 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews. \"The New York Times\" theater critic Ben Brantley called it an \"exhilarating, landmark rock opera\" with a \"glittering, inventive score\" that \"shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical.\" Another reviewer wrote, \"\"Rent\" speaks to Generation X the way that the musical \"Hair\" spoke to the baby boomers or those who grew up in the 1960s,\" while the \"New York Times\" similarly called it \"a rock opera for our time, a \"Hair\" for the 90s.\" The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre.\nOriginal Broadway production.\nDue to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, \"Rent\" moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996. On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production's ethnically diverse principal cast originally included Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Jesse L. Martin, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker.\nThe production's controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation. The production was nominated for ten Tony Awards in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia).\nOn April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation, Friends In Deed and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of \"Seasons of Love\" as the finale of the performance.\n\"Rent\" closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run and 5,123 performances, making it the seventh-longest-running Broadway show at that time, and currently the twelfth-longest-running Broadway show. The production grossed over $280 million.\nOriginal cast ensemble members Rodney Hicks and Gwen Stewart returned to the cast at the time of the Broadway closing. Hicks played Benny and Stewart played the role she created, the soloist in the song \"Seasons of Love\". In addition, actress Tracie Thoms joined the cast at the end of the run playing Joanne, the role she portrayed in the 2005 film version. The last Broadway performance was filmed and screened in movie theaters as \"Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway\" in September 2008. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on February 3, 2009.\nNorth American touring productions.\nSuccessful United States national tours, the \"Angel Tour\" and the \"Benny Tour\", launched in the 1990s. Later, the non-Equity tour started its run. There was also a Canadian tour (often referred to as the \"Collins Tour\").\nThe Angel tour began in November 1996 at the Shubert Theatre in Boston, where it ran for approximately six months. Anthony Rapp joined the cast for the Chicago run, and Daphne Rubin-Vega joined for the Los Angeles run. The tour finished in San Francisco in September 1999. Other members of the Angel cast included Carrie Hamilton, Amy Spanger, Luther Creek, Kristoffer Cusick, Lisa Simone, Queen Esther, and Tony Vincent.\nThe Benny Tour began in July 1997 in San Diego, California, at the LaJolla Playhouse. Michael Grief, the original director of the Broadway show was also the artistic director of the LaJolla Playhouse and was instrumental in arranging for the Benny tour to begin in the smaller city of San Diego rather than Los Angeles, California. It originally featured Neil Patrick Harris as Mark Cohen in his first musical theatre role. The Benny tour generally played shorter stops and often-smaller markets than the Angel Tour did. Other cast members included Wilson Cruz and d'Monroe.\nTours ran each season from 2005 to 2008. Cast members throughout the run included Aaron Tveit, Ava Gaudet, Declan Bennett, Rebecca Naomi Jones, Constantine Maroulis, Dan Rosenbaum, Heinz Winckler, Anwar Robinson, Christine Dwyer, Caissie Levy and Karen Olivo.

There was also a successful production for a limited run in Manchester in 2006 with an additional 'goodbye' performance in 2008 from the Manchester cast.\nOn October 16, 2007, the heavily revised production titled \"Rent Remixed\" opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End. Directed by William Baker, it was set in the present day. The cast included Oliver Thornton (Mark), Luke Evans (Roger), Craig Stein (Benny), Leon Lopez (Collins), Francesca Jackson (Joanne), Jay Webb (Angel), Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy (Mimi), and Denise Van Outen (Maureen). From December 24, 2007, the role of Maureen was played by Jessie Wallace. The production received generally unfavorable reviews. The Guardian gave it only one out of five stars, writing, \"They call this 'Rent Remixed'. I'd dub it 'Rent Reduced', in that the late Jonathan Larson's reworking of La Boh\u00e8me, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity.\" The production closed on February 2, 2008.\nThe production radically altered elements of the musical including defining the characters of Mimi, Angel and Mark as British. Songs were reordered (including Maureen's first appearance as the Act I finale). The rehaul of the score was masterminded by Steve Anderson and featured radically rearranged versions of Out Tonight, Today 4 U, Over the Moon and Happy New Year.\nA one-off Rent - The 20th Anniversary Concert was held at the Blackpool Opera house Monday November 11, 2013.

This was the first New York Revival of the show since the original production closed less than three years earlier. The production was directed by \"Rent\"'s original director Michael Greif. Almost the entire show was different from the original, yet the reinvention did not please the critics, who complained that the new actors did not have a feel for the characters they were playing and that it made the show feel contrived. The off-Broadway production of \"Rent\" closed on September 9, 2012.\nAdditional productions.\nIn 1999, an Australian production featured Justin Smith as Mark, Rodger Corser as Roger and Christine Anu as Mimi.

Billed as \"Rent: School Edition\", this version omits the song \"Contact\" and eliminates some of the coarse language and tones down some public displays of affection in the original. Shorewood High School in Shorewood, Wisconsin, became the first high school to perform an early version of the adaptation in May 2006. The high school was selected to present a workshop performance as part of Music Theatre International's work to adapt the musical for younger actors and potentially more conservative audiences.

Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, featuring a wide variety of cuisines and service models \u2014 ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants to high-priced luxury establishments.\nEtymology.\nThe word derives from the early 19th century, taken from the French word 'provide meat for', literally 'restore to a former state' and, being the present participle of the verb, the term \"restaurant\" may have been used in 1507 as a \"restorative beverage\", and in correspondence in 1521 to mean 'that which restores the strength, a fortifying food or remedy'.\nHistory.\nA public eating-establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt. It served only one dish, a plate of cereal, wildfowl, and onions.\nA forerunner for the modern restaurant is the , an establishment in Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat food and beverages. These establishments were somewhat similar in function to modern fast-food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private kitchens. In the Roman Empire, they were popular among residents of .\nIn Pompeii, 158 with service-counters have been identified throughout the town. They were concentrated along the main axis of the town and near public spaces where they were frequented by the locals.\nThe Romans also had the popina, a wine bar which in addition to a variety of wines offered a limited selection of simple foods such as olives, bread, cheese, stews, sausage, and porridge. The popinae were known as places for the plebeians of the lower classes of Roman society to socialize. While some were confined to one standing room only, others had tables and stools and a few even had couches.\nAnother early forerunner of the restaurant was the inn. Throughout the ancient world, inns were set up alongside roads to cater to people travelling between cities, offering lodging and food. Meals were typically served at a common table to guests. However, there were no menus or options to choose from.\nEarly eating establishments recognizable as restaurants in the modern sense emerged in Song dynasty China during the 11th and 12th centuries. In large cities, such as Kaifeng and Hangzhou, food catering establishments catered to merchants who travelled between cities. Probably growing out of tea houses and taverns which catered to travellers, Kaifeng's restaurants blossomed into an industry that catered to locals as well as people from other regions of China. As travelling merchants were not used to the local cuisine of other cities, these establishments were set up to serve dishes familiar to merchants from other parts of China. Such establishments were located in the entertainment districts of major cities, alongside hotels, bars, and brothels. The larger and more opulent of these establishments offered a dining experience similar to modern restaurant culture. According to a Chinese manuscript from 1126, patrons of one such establishment were greeted with a selection of pre-plated demonstration dishes which represented food options. Customers had their orders taken by a team of waiters who would then sing their orders to the kitchen and distribute the dishes in the exact order in which they had been ordered.\nThere is a direct correlation between the growth of the restaurant businesses and institutions of theatrical stage drama, gambling and prostitution which served the burgeoning merchant middle class during the Song dynasty. Restaurants catered to different styles of cuisine, price brackets, and religious requirements. Even within a single restaurant choices were available, and people ordered the entr\u00e9e from written menus. An account from 1275 writes of Hangzhou, the capital city for the last half of the dynasty:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The people of Hangzhou are very difficult to please. Hundreds of orders are given on all sides: this person wants something hot, another something cold, a third something tepid, a fourth something chilled. one wants cooked food, another raw, another chooses roast, another grill.\nThe restaurants in Hangzhou also catered to many northern Chinese who had fled south from Kaifeng during the Jurchen invasion of the 1120s, while it is also known that many restaurants were run by families formerly from Kaifeng.\nIn Japan, a restaurant culture emerged in the 16th century out of local tea houses. Tea house owner Sen no Riky\u016b created the \"kaiseki\" multi-course meal tradition, and his grandsons expanded the tradition to include speciality dishes and cutlery which matched the aesthetic of the food.\nIn Europe, inns which offered food and lodgings and taverns where food was served alongside alcoholic beverages were common into the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They typically served common fare of the type normally available to peasants. In Spain, such establishments were called \"bodegas\" and served tapas. In England, they typically served foods such as sausage and shepherd's pie. Cookshops were also common in European cities during the Middle Ages. These were establishments which served dishes such as pies, puddings, sauces, fish, and baked meats. Customers could either buy a ready-made meal or bring their own meat to be cooked. As only large private homes had the means for cooking, the inhabitants of European cities were significantly reliant on them. From the 16th century, establishments known as ordinaries (taverns or inns) served fixed-price meals in England.\nFrance in particular has a rich history with the development of various forms of inns and eateries, eventually to form many of the now-ubiquitous elements of the modern restaurant. As far back as the thirteenth century, French inns served a variety of food \u2014 bread, cheese, bacon, roasts, soups, and stews - usually eaten at a common table. Parisians could buy what was essentially take-out food from \"r\u00f4tisseurs\", who prepared roasted-meat dishes, and from pastry-cooks, who could prepare meat pies and often more elaborate dishes. Municipal statutes stated that the official prices per item were to be posted at the entrance; this was the first official mention of menus.\nTaverns also served food, as did cabarets. A cabaret, however, unlike a tavern, served food at tables with tablecloths, provided drinks with the meal, and charged by the customers' choice of dish, rather than by the pot. Cabarets were reputed to serve better food than taverns and a few, such as the , became well-known. A few cabarets had musicians or singing, but most, until the late-19th century, were simply convivial eating-places. The first caf\u00e9 opened in Paris in 1672 at the Saint-Germain fair. By 1723 there were nearly four hundred caf\u00e9s in Paris, but their menu was limited to simpler dishes or confectionaries, such as coffee, tea, chocolate (the drink; chocolate in solid state was invented only in the 19th century), ice creams, pastries, and liqueurs.\nAt the end of the 16th century, the guild of cook-caterers (later known as ) gained its own legal status. The dominated sophisticated food-service, delivering or preparing meals for the wealthy at their residences. Taverns and cabarets were limited to serving little more than roast or grilled meats. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, both inns and then began to offer \"host's tables\" (), where one paid a set price to sit at a large table with other guests and eat a fixed menu meal.\nModern format.\nThe earliest modern-format \"restaurants\" to use that word in Paris were the establishments which served bouillon, a broth made of meat and egg which was said to restore health and vigour. The first restaurant of this kind was opened in 1765 or 1766 by Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau on rue des Poulies, now part of the Rue de Louvre. The name of the owner is sometimes given as Boulanger. Unlike earlier eating places, it was elegantly decorated, and besides meat broth offered a menu of several other \"restorative\" dishes, including macaroni. Chantoiseau and other chefs took the title \"traiteurs-restaurateurs\". While not the first establishment where one could order food, or even soups, it is thought to be the first to offer a menu of available choices.\nIn the Western world, the concept of a restaurant as a public venue where waiting staff serve patrons food from a fixed menu is a relatively recent one, dating from the late 18th century.\nIn June 1786, the Provost of Paris issued a decree giving the new kind of eating establishment official status, authorising \"restaurateurs\" to receive clients and to offer them meals until eleven in the evening in winter and midnight in summer. Ambitious cooks from noble households began to open more elaborate eating places. The first luxury restaurant in Paris, the La Grande Taverne de Londres, was opened at the Palais-Royal at the beginning of 1786 by Antoine Beauvilliers, the former chef of the Count of Provence. It had mahogany tables, linen tablecloths, chandeliers, well-dressed and trained waiters, a long wine list and an extensive menu of elaborately prepared and presented dishes. Dishes on its menu included partridge with cabbage, veal chops grilled in buttered paper, and duck with turnips. This is considered to have been the \"first real restaurant\". According to Brillat-Savarin, the restaurant was \"the first to combine the four essentials of an elegant room, smart waiters, a choice cellar, and superior cooking\".\nThe aftermath of the French Revolution saw the number of restaurants skyrocket. Due to the mass emigration of nobles from the country, many cooks from aristocratic households who were left unemployed went on to found new restaurants. One restaurant was started in 1791 by M\u00e9ot, the former chef of the Duke of Orleans, which offered a wine list with twenty-two choices of red wine and twenty-seven of white wine. By the end of the century there were a collection of luxury restaurants at the Grand-Palais: Hur\u00e9, the Couvert espagnol; F\u00e9vrier; the Grotte flamande; V\u00e9ry, Masse and the Caf\u00e9 de Chartres (still open, now Le Grand V\u00e9four).\nIn 1802 the term was applied to an establishment where restorative foods, such as bouillon, a meat broth, were served (\"\u00e9tablissement de restaurateur\"). The closure of culinary guilds and societal changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution contributed significantly to the increased prevalence of restaurants in Europe.\nTypes of restaurants.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s the restaurant industry was revolutionized by entrepreneurs, including Terence Conran, Alan Yau, and Oliver Peyton. Today restaurants are classified or distinguished in many different ways. The primary factor is usually the food itself e.g. vegetarianism, seafood, or steak. The origin of the cuisine may be also used to categorize restaurants e.g. Italian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Mexican, or Thai. The style of offering has become an important distinguishing factor in the restaurant industry e.g. tapas, sushi, buffet, or yum cha. Beyond this, restaurants may differentiate themselves on factors including speed of service e.g. fast food. Theme restaurants and automated restaurant have become big players in the restaurant industry and may include fine dining, casual dining, contemporary casual, family style, fast casual, coffeehouse, concession stands, food trucks, pop-up restaurants, and ghost restaurants.\nRestaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices, to expensive establishments serving refined food and fine wines in a formal setting. In the former case, customers usually wear casual clothing. In the latter case, depending on culture and local traditions, customers might wear semi-casual, semi-formal or formal wear. Typically, at mid- to high-priced restaurants, customers sit at tables, their orders are taken by a waiter, who brings the food when it is ready. After eating, the customers then pay the bill. In some restaurants, such as those in workplaces, there are usually no waiters; the customers use trays, on which they place cold items that they select from a refrigerated container and hot items which they request from cooks, and then they pay a cashier before they sit down. Another restaurant approach which uses few waiters is the buffet restaurant. Customers serve food onto their own plates and then pay at the end of the meal. Buffet restaurants typically still have waiters to serve drinks and alcoholic beverages. Fast food establishments are also considered to be restaurants. In addition, food trucks are another popular option for people who want quick food service.\nTourists around the world can enjoy dining services on railway dining cars and cruise ship dining rooms, in some cities a restaurant tram is operated, which are essentially travelling restaurants. Most cruise ships provide a variety of dining experiences including a main restaurant, satellite restaurants, room service, speciality restaurants, cafes, bars and buffets to name a few. Some restaurants on these cruise ships require table reservations and operate specific dress codes. The railway dining services also cater to the needs of travellers by providing railway refreshment rooms at railway stations.\nRestaurant staff.\nA restaurant's proprietor is called a \"restaurateur\", this derives from the French verb \"restaurer\", meaning \"to restore\". Professional cooks are called chefs, with there being various finer distinctions (e.g. sous-chef, chef de partie). Most restaurants (other than fast food restaurants and cafeterias) will have various waiting staff to serve food, beverages and alcoholic drinks, including busboys who remove used dishes and cutlery. In finer restaurants, this may include a host or hostess, a ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel to welcome customers and seat them, and a sommelier or wine waiter to help patrons select wines. A new route to becoming a restaurateur, rather than working one's way up through the stages, is to operate a food truck. Once a sufficient following has been obtained, a permanent restaurant site can be opened. This trend has become common in the UK and the US.\nChef's table.\nA chef's table is a table located in the kitchen of a restaurant, reserved for VIPs and special guests. Patrons may be served a themed tasting menu prepared and served by the head chef. Restaurants can require a minimum party and charge a higher flat fee.\nBy country.\nEurope.\nFrance.\nFrance has a long tradition with public eateries and modern restaurant culture emerged there. In the early 19th century, traiteurs and restaurateurs became known simply as \"restaurateurs\". The use of the term \"restaurant\" for the establishment itself only became common in the 19th century.\nAccording to the legend, the first mention to a restaurant dates back to 1765 in Paris. It was located on Rue des Poulies, now Rue du Louvre, and use to serve dishes known as \"restaurants\". The place was run by a man named Mr. Boulanger. However, according to the Larousse Gastronomique, La Grande Taverne de Londres which opened in 1782 is considered as the first Parisian restaurant.\nThe first restaurant guide, called \"Almanach des Gourmands\", written by Grimod de La Reyni\u00e9re, was published in 1804. During the French Restoration period, the most celebrated restaurant was the Rocher de Cancale, frequented by the characters of Balzac. In the middle of the century, Balzac's characters moved to the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, which in 1867 also hosted the famous Three Emperors Dinner hosted by Napoleon III in honor of Tsar Alexander II, Kaiser Wilhelm I and Otto von Bismarck during the Exposition Universelle in 1867\nOther restaurants that occupy a place in French history and literature include Maxim's and Fouquet's. The restaurant of Hotel Ritz Paris, opened in 1898, was made famous by its chef, Auguste Escoffier. The 19th century also saw the appearance of new kinds of more modest restaurants, including the bistrot. The brasserie featured beer and was made popular during the 1867 Paris Exposition.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, it was not until the late 18th century that establishments that provided meals without also providing lodging began to appear in major metropolitan areas in the form of coffee and oyster houses. The actual term \"restaurant\" did not enter into the common parlance until the following century. Prior to being referred to as \"restaurants\" these eating establishments assumed regional names such as \"eating house\" in New York City, \"restorator\" in Boston, or \"victualling house\" in other areas. Restaurants were typically located in populous urban areas during the 19th century and grew both in number and sophistication in the mid-century due to a more affluent middle class and to urbanization. The highest concentration of these restaurants were in the West, followed by industrial cities on the Eastern Seaboard.\nWhen Prohibition went into effect in 1920, restaurants offering fine dining had a hard time making ends meet because they had depended on profits from selling wine and alcoholic beverages. Replacing them were establishments offering simpler, more casual experiences such as cafeterias, roadside restaurants, and diners. When Prohibition ended in the 1930s, luxury restaurants slowly started to appear again as the economy recovered from the Great Depression.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation based on race, color, religion, or national origin in all public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce, including restaurants. \"Katzenbach v. McClung\", 379 U.S. 294 (1964), was a decision of the US Supreme Court which held that Congress acted within its power under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution in forbidding racial discrimination in restaurants as this was a burden to interstate commerce.\nIn the 1970s, there was one restaurant for every 7,500 persons. In 2016, there were 1,000,000 restaurants; one for every 310 people. The average person eats out five to six times weekly. 3.3% of the nation's workforce is composed of restaurant workers. According to a Gallup Poll in 2016, nearly 61% of Americans across the country eat out at a restaurant once a week or more, and this percent is only predicted to increase in future years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, The National Restaurant Association estimated restaurant sales of $899 billion in 2020. The association now projects that the pandemic will decrease that to $675 billion, a decline of $274 billion over their previous estimate.\nSouth America.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, restaurant varieties mirror the multitude of nationalities that arrived in the country: Japanese, Arab, German, Italian, Portuguese and many more.\nColombia.\nThe word \"piquete\" can be used to refer to a common Colombian type of meal that includes meat, yuca and potatoes, which is a type of meal served at a piqueteadero. The verb form of the word piquete, piquetear, means to participate in binging, liquor drinking, and leisure activities in popular areas or open spaces.\nPeru.\nIn Peru, many indigenous, Spanish, and Chinese dishes are frequently found. Because of recent immigration from places such as China, and Japan, there are many Chinese and Japanese restaurants around the country, especially in the capital city of Lima.\nGuides.\nRestaurant guides review restaurants, often ranking them or providing information to guide consumers (type of food, handicap accessibility, facilities, etc.). One of the most famous contemporary guides is the Michelin series of guides which accord one to three stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high culinary merit. Restaurants with stars in the Michelin guide are formal, expensive establishments; in general the more stars awarded, the higher the prices.\nThe main competitor to the Michelin guide in Europe is the guidebook series published by Gault Millau. Its ratings are on a scale of 1 to 20, with 20 being the highest.\nIn the United States, the Forbes Travel Guide (previously the Mobil travel guides) and the AAA rate restaurants on a similar 1 to 5 star (Forbes) or diamond (AAA) scale. Three, four, and five star/diamond ratings are roughly equivalent to the Michelin one, two, and three star ratings while one and two star ratings typically indicate more casual places to eat. In 2005, Michelin released a New York City guide, its first for the United States. The popular Zagat Survey compiles individuals' comments about restaurants but does not pass an \"official\" critical assessment.\nNearly all major American newspapers employ food critics and publish online dining guides for the cities they serve. Some news sources provide customary reviews of restaurants, while others may provide more of a general listings service.\nMore recently Internet sites have started up that publish both food critic reviews and popular reviews by the general public.\nEconomics.\nCanada.\nThere are 86,915 commercial food service units in Canada, or 26.4 units per 10,000 Canadians. By segment, there are:\nFully 63% of restaurants in Canada are independent brands. Chain restaurants account for the remaining 37%, and many of these are locally owned and operated franchises.\nEuropean Union.\nThe EU-27 has an estimated 1.6 million businesses involved in 'accommodation &amp; food services', more than 75% of which are small and medium enterprises.\nIndia.\nThe Indian restaurant industry is highly fragmented with more than 1.5 million outlets of which only around 3,000 of them are from the organised segment. The organised segment includes quick service restaurants; casual dining; cafes; fine dining; and pubs, bars, clubs and lounges.\nVietnam.\nThe restaurant industry in Vietnam is one of the important economic sectors, making a significant contribution to the national economy. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam, the number of restaurants in Vietnam has increased rapidly from 2000 to 2022. In 2000, there were about 20,000 restaurants nationwide, but by 2022, this number had increased to over 400,000 restaurants. The average annual growth rate is about 10%. The restaurant industry in Vietnam has also seen strong growth in recent years. According to a report by SSI Securities Corporation, the revenue of the restaurant industry in Vietnam reached VND610 trillion in 2022, up 16% from 2021. Of that, the out-of-home market accounted for VND333.69 trillion, up 19% from 2021.\nUnited States.\nAs of 2006, there are approximately 215,000 full-service restaurants in the United States, accounting for $298 billion in sales, and approximately 250,000 limited-service (fast food) restaurants, accounting for $260 billion. Starting in 2016, Americans spent more on restaurants than groceries.\nIn October 2017, \"The New York Times\" reported there are 620,000 eating and drinking places in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. They also reported that the number of restaurants are growing almost twice as fast as the population.\nOne study of new restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio found that 1 in 4 changed ownership or went out of business after one year, and 6 out of 10 did so after three years. (Not all changes in ownership are indicative of financial failure.) The three-year failure rate for franchises was nearly the same.\nRestaurants employed 912,100 cooks in 2013, earning an average $9.83 per hour. The waiting staff numbered 4,438,100 in 2012, earning an average $8.84 per hour.\nJiaxi Lu of the \"Washington Post\" reports in 2014 that, \"Americans are spending $683.4 billion a year dining out, and they are also demanding better food quality and greater variety from restaurants to make sure their money is well spent.\"\nDining in restaurants has become increasingly popular, with the proportion of meals consumed outside the home in restaurants or institutions rising from 25% in 1950 to 46% in 1990. This is caused by factors such as the growing numbers of older people, who are often unable or unwilling to cook their meals at home and the growing number of single-parent households. It is also caused by the convenience that restaurants can afford people; the growth of restaurant popularity is also correlated with the growing length of the work day in the US, as well as the growing number of single parent households. Eating in restaurants has also become more popular with the growth of higher income households. At the same time, less expensive establishments such as fast food establishments can be quite inexpensive, making restaurant eating accessible to many.\nEmployment.\nThe restaurant industry in the United States is large and quickly growing, with 10 million workers. 1 in every 12 U.S. residents work in the business, and during the 2008 recession, the industry was an anomaly in that it continued to grow. Restaurants are known for having low wages, which they claim are due to thin profit margins of 4-5%. For comparison, however, Walmart has a 1% profit margin.\nAs a result of these low wages, restaurant employees suffer from three times the poverty rate as other U.S. workers, and use food stamps twice as much.\nRestaurants are the largest employer of people of color, and rank as the second largest employer of immigrants. These workers statistically are concentrated in the lowest paying positions in the restaurant industry. In the restaurant industry, 39% of workers earn minimum wage or lower.\nRegulations.\nIn many countries, restaurants are subject to inspections by health inspectors to maintain standards for public health, such as maintaining proper hygiene and cleanliness. The most common kind of violations of inspection reports are those concerning the storage of cold food at appropriate temperatures, proper sanitation of equipment, regular hand washing and proper disposal of harmful chemicals. Simple steps can be taken to improve sanitation in restaurants. As sickness is easily spread through touch, restaurants are encouraged to regularly wipe down tables, door knobs and menus.\nDepending on local customs, legislation and the establishment, restaurants may or may not serve alcoholic beverages. Restaurants are often prohibited from selling alcoholic beverages without a meal by alcohol sale laws; such sale is considered to be an activity for bars, which are meant to have more severe restrictions. Some restaurants are licensed to serve alcohol (\"fully licensed\"), or permit customers to \"bring your own booze\" (BYO / BYOB). In some places restaurant licenses may restrict service to beer, or wine and beer.\nOccupational hazards.\nFood service regulations have historically been built around hygiene and protection of the consumer's health. However, restaurant workers face many health hazards such as long hours, low wages, minimal benefits, discrimination, high stress, and poor working conditions. Along with the COVID-19 pandemic, much attention has been drawn to the prevention of community transmission in restaurants and other public settings. To reduce airborne disease transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends reduced dining capacity, face masks, adequate ventilation, physical barrier instalments, disinfection, signage, and flexible leave policies for workers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Otto and Margarete then settled in Joensuu, where Otto taught physics, and there their four children were born: Frithiof (born 1894; also a mathematician), Rolf (born 1895), Anna (born 1896) and Erik (born 1901).\nEducation.\nNevanlinna began his formal education at the age of 7. Having already been taught to read and write by his parents, he went straight into the second grade but still found the work boring and soon refused to attend the school. He was then homeschooled before being sent to a grammar school in 1903 when the family moved to Helsinki, where his father took up a new post as a teacher at Helsinki High School. At the new school, Nevanlinna studied French and German in addition to the languages he already spoke: Finnish and Swedish. He also attended an orchestra school and had a love of music, which was encouraged by his mother:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Margarete was an excellent pianist and Frithiof and Rolf would lie under the piano and listen to her playing. At 13 they went to orchestra school and became accomplished musicians \u2013 Frithiof on the cello and Rolf on the violin. Through free tickets from the orchestra school they got to know and love the music of the great composers, Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin and Liszt, as well as the early symphonies of Sibelius. Rolf first met Sibelius's music in 1907, when he heard his Third Symphony. Although later he met Hilbert, Einstein, Thomas Mann and other famous people, Rolf said that none had had such a strong effect on him as Sibelius. The boys played trios with their mother and their love of music \u2013 in particular of chamber music \u2013 lasted all their lives.\nNevanlinna then progressed onto the Helsinki High School, where his main interests were classics and mathematics. He was taught by a number of teachers during this time but the best of them all was his own father, who taught him physics and mathematics. He graduated in 1913 having performed very well, although he was not the top student of his year. He then went beyond the school syllabus in the summer of 1913 when he read Ernst Leonard Lindel\u00f6f's \"Introduction to Higher Analysis\"; from that time on, Nevanlinna had an enthusiastic interest in mathematical analysis. (Lindel\u00f6f was also a cousin of Nevanlinna's father, and so a part of the Neovius-Nevanlinna mathematical family.)\nNevanlinna began his studies at the University of Helsinki in 1913, and received his Master of Philosophy in mathematics in 1917. Lindel\u00f6f taught at the university and Nevanlinna was further influenced by him. During his time at the University of Helsinki, World War I was underway and Nevanlinna wanted to join the 27th J\u00e4ger Battalion, but his parents convinced him to continue with his studies. He did however join the White Guard in the Finnish Civil War, but did not see active military action. In 1919, Nevanlinna presented his thesis, entitled \"\u00dcber beschr\u00e4nkte Funktionen die in gegebenen Punkten vorgeschriebene Werte annehmen\" (\"On limited functions prescribed values at given points\"), to Lindel\u00f6f, his doctoral advisor. The thesis, which was on complex analysis, was of high quality and Nevanlinna was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy on 2 June 1919.\nCareer.\nWhen Nevanlinna earned his doctorate in 1919, there were no university posts available so he became a school teacher. His brother, Frithiof, had received his doctorate in 1918 but likewise was unable to take up a post at a university, and instead began working as a mathematician for an insurance company. Frithiof recruited Rolf to the company, and Nevanlinna worked for the company and as a school teacher until he was appointed a Docent of Mathematics at the University of Helsinki in 1922. During this time, he had been contacted by Edmund Landau and requested to move to Germany to work at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, but did not accept.\nAfter his appointment as Docent of Mathematics, he gave up his insurance job but did not resign his position as school teacher until he received a newly created full professorship at the university in 1926. Despite this heavy workload, it was between the years of 1922\u201325 that he developed what would become to be known as Nevanlinna theory.\nFrom 1947 Nevanlinna had a chair in the University of Zurich, which he held on a half-time basis after receiving in 1948 a permanent position as one of the 12 salaried Academicians in the newly created Academy of Finland.\nRolf Nevanlinna's most important mathematical achievement is the \"value distribution theory\" of meromorphic functions. The roots of the theory go back to the result of \u00c9mile Picard in 1879, showing that a non-constant complex-valued function which is analytic in the entire complex plane assumes all complex values save at most one. In the early 1920s Rolf Nevanlinna, partly in collaboration with his brother Frithiof, extended the theory to cover meromorphic functions, i.e. functions analytic in the plane except for isolated points in which the Laurent series of the function has a finite number of terms with a negative power of the variable. Nevanlinna's value distribution theory or Nevanlinna theory is crystallised in its two \"Main Theorems\". Qualitatively, the first one states that if a value is assumed less frequently than average, then the function comes close to that value more often than average. The Second Main Theorem, more difficult than the first one, states roughly that there are relatively few values which the function assumes less often than average.\nRolf Nevanlinna's article \"Zur Theorie der meromorphen Funktionen\" which contains the Main Theorems was published in 1925 in the journal Acta Mathematica. Hermann Weyl has called it \"one of the few great mathematical events of the [twentieth] century.\" Nevanlinna gave a fuller account of the theory in the monographs \"Le th\u00e9oreme de Picard \u2013 Borel et la th\u00e9orie des fonctions m\u00e9romorphes\" (1929) and \"Eindeutige analytische Funktionen\" (1936).\nNevanlinna theory touches also on a class of functions called the Nevanlinna class, or functions of \"bounded type\".\nWhen the Winter War broke out (1939), Nevanlinna was invited to join the Finnish Army's Ballistics Office to assist in improving artillery firing tables. These tables had been based on a calculation technique developed by General Vilho Petter Nenonen, but Nevanlinna now came up with a new method which made them considerably faster to compile. In recognition of his work he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Liberty, Second Class, and throughout his life he held this honour in especial esteem.\nAmong Rolf Nevanlinna's later interests in mathematics were the theory of Riemann surfaces (the monograph \"Uniformisierung\" in 1953) and functional analysis (\"Absolute analysis\" in 1959, written in collaboration with his brother Frithiof). Nevanlinna also published in Finnish a book on the foundations of geometry and a semipopular account of the Theory of Relativity. His Finnish textbook on the elements of complex analysis, \"Funktioteoria\" (1963), written together with Veikko Paatero, has appeared in German, English and Russian translations.\nRolf Nevanlinna supervised at least 28 doctoral theses. His first and most famous doctoral student was Lars Ahlfors, one of the first two Fields Medal recipients. The research for which Ahlfors was awarded the prize (proving the Denjoy Conjecture, now known as the Denjoy\u2013Carleman\u2013Ahlfors theorem) was strongly based on Nevanlinna's work.\nNevanlinna's work was recognised in the form of honorary degrees which he held from several universities: the University of Heidelberg, the University of Bucharest, the University of Giessen, the Free University of Berlin, the University of Glasgow, the University of Uppsala, the University of Istanbul and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. He was an honorary member of several learned societies, among them the London Mathematical Society and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The 1679 Nevanlinna main belt asteroid is named after him.\nAdministrative activities.\nFrom 1954, Rolf Nevanlinna chaired the committee which set about the first computer project in Finland. \nRolf Nevanlinna served as President of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) from 1959 to 1963 and as President of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1962.\nIn 1964, Nevanlinna's connections with President Urho Kekkonen were instrumental in bringing about a total reorganization of the Academy of Finland.\nFrom 1965 to 1970 Nevanlinna was Chancellor of the University of Turku.\nPolitical activities.\nAlthough Nevanlinna did not participate actively in politics, he was known to sympathise with the right-wing Patriotic People's Movement and, partly because of his half-German parentage, was also sympathetic towards Nazi Germany; with many mathematics professors fired in the 1930s due to the Nuremberg Laws, mathematicians sympathetic to the Nazi policies were sought as replacements, and Nevanlinna accepted a position as professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1936 and 1937. His sympathy towards the Nazis led to his removal from his position as Rector of the University of Helsinki after Finland made peace with the Soviet Union in 1944.\nIn the spring of 1941, Finland contributed a Volunteer Battalion to the Waffen-SS. In 1942, a committee was established for the Volunteer Battalion to take care of the battalion's somewhat strained relations with its German commanders, and Nevanlinna was chosen to be the chairman of the committee, as he was a person respected in Germany but loyal to Finland. He stated in his autobiography that he accepted this role due to a \"sense of duty\".\nNevanlinna's collaboration with Nazi Germany did not prevent mathematical contacts with Allied countries; after World War II, the Soviet mathematical community was isolated from the Western mathematical community and the International Colloquium on Function Theory in Helsinki in 1957, directed by Nevanlinna, was one of the first post-war occasions when Soviet mathematicians could contact their Western colleagues in person. In 1965, Nevanlinna was an honorary guest at a function theory congress in Soviet Armenia.\nIMU Abacus Medal (formerly Nevanlinna Prize).\nWhen the IMU in 1981 decided to create a prize, similar to the Fields Medal, in theoretical computer science and the funding for the prize was secured from Finland, the Union decided to give Nevanlinna's name to the prize; the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize was awarded every four years at the ICM. In 2018, the General Assembly of the IMU approved a resolution to remove Nevanlinna's name from the prize. Starting in 2022 the prize has been called the IMU Abacus Medal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is with a tail, and it weighs between . It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.\nThe red panda was formally described in 1825. The two recognised subspecies, the Himalayan and the Chinese red panda, genetically diverged about 250,000 years ago. The red panda's place on the evolutionary tree has been debated, but modern genetic evidence places it in close affinity with raccoons, weasels, and skunks. It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a bear, though both possess elongated wrist bones or \"false thumbs\" used for grasping bamboo. The evolutionary lineage of the red panda (Ailuridae) stretches back around https:// 18, as indicated by extinct fossil relatives found in Eurasia and North America.\nThe red panda inhabits coniferous forests as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, favouring steep slopes with dense bamboo cover close to water sources. It is solitary and largely arboreal. It feeds mainly on bamboo shoots and leaves, but also on fruits and blossoms. Red pandas mate in early spring, with the females giving birth to litters of up to four cubs in summer. It is threatened by poaching as well as destruction and fragmentation of habitat due to deforestation. The species has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2015. It is protected in all range countries.\nCommunity-based conservation programmes have been initiated in Nepal, Bhutan and northeastern India; in China, it benefits from nature conservation projects. Regional captive breeding programmes for the red panda have been established in zoos around the world. It is featured in animated movies, video games, comic books and as the namesake of companies and music bands.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the name \"panda\" is uncertain, but one of the most likely theories is that it derived from the Nepali word \"ponya\". The word ' or ' means \"ball of the foot\" and \"claws\". The Nepali words \"nigalya ponya\" has been translated as \"bamboo-footed\" and is thought to be the red panda's Nepali name; in English, it was simply called \"panda\", and was the only animal known under this name for more than 40 years; it became known as the \"red panda\" or \"lesser panda\" to distinguish it from the giant panda, which was formally described and named in 1869.\nThe genus name \"Ailurus\" is adopted from the Ancient Greek word \u03b1\u1f34\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"\" meaning 'cat'. The specific epithet \"fulgens\" is Latin for 'shining, bright'.\nTaxonomy.\nThe red panda was described and named in 1825 by Frederic Cuvier, who gave it its scientific name \"Ailurus fulgens\". Cuvier's description was based on zoological specimens, including skin, paws, jawbones and teeth \"from the mountains north of India\", as well as an account by Alfred Duvaucel. The red panda was described earlier by Thomas Hardwicke in 1821, but his paper was only published in 1827. In 1902, Oldfield Thomas described a skull of a male red panda specimen under the name \"Ailurus fulgens styani\" in honour of Frederick William Styan who had collected this specimen in Sichuan.\nSubspecies and species.\nThe modern red panda is the only recognised species in the genus \"Ailurus\". It is traditionally divided into two subspecies: the Himalayan red panda (\"A.\u00a0f. fulgens\") and the Chinese red panda (\"A.\u00a0f. styani\"). The Himalayan subspecies has a straighter profile, a lighter coloured forehead and ochre-tipped hairs on the lower back and rump. The Chinese subspecies has a more curved forehead and sloping snout, a darker coat with a less white face and more contrast between the tail rings.\nIn 2020, results of a genetic analysis of red panda samples showed that the red panda populations in the Himalayas and China were separated about 250,000 years ago. The researchers suggested that the two subspecies should be treated as distinct species. Red pandas in southeastern Tibet and northern Myanmar were found to be part of \"styani\", while those of southern Tibet were of \"fulgens\" in the strict sense. DNA sequencing of 132 red panda faecal samples collected in Northeast India and China also showed two distinct clusters indicating that the Siang River constitutes the boundary between the Himalayan and Chinese red pandas. They probably diverged due to glaciation events on the southern Tibetan Plateau in the Pleistocene.\nPhylogeny.\nThe placement of the red panda on the evolutionary tree has been debated. In the early 20th century, various scientists placed it in the family Procyonidae with raccoons and their allies. At the time, most prominent biologists also considered the red panda to be related to the giant panda, which would eventually be found to be a bear. A 1982 study examined the similarities and differences in the skull between the red panda and the giant panda, other bears and procyonids, and placed the species in its own family Ailuridae. The author of the study considered the red panda to be more closely related to bears. A 1995 mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed that the red panda has close affinities with procyonids. Further genetic studies in 2005, 2018 and 2021 have placed the red panda within the clade Musteloidea, which also includes Procyonidae, Mustelidae (weasels and relatives) and Mephitidae (skunks and relatives).\nFossil record.\nThe family Ailuridae appears to have evolved in Europe in either the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene, about https:// 18. The earliest member \"Amphictis\" is known from its skull and may have been around the same size as the modern species. Its dentition consists of sharp premolars and carnassials (P4 and m1) and molars adapted for grinding (M1, M2 and m2), suggesting that it had a generalised carnivorous diet. Its placement within Ailuridae is based on the grooves on the side of its canine teeth. Other early or basal ailurids include \"Alopecocyon\" and \"Simocyon\", whose fossils have been found throughout Eurasia and North America dating from the Middle Miocene, the latter of which survived into the Early Pliocene. Both have similar teeth to \"Amphictis\" and thus had a similar diet. The puma-sized \"Simocyon\" was likely a tree-climber and shared a \"false thumb\"\u2014an extended wrist bone\u2014with the modern species, suggesting the appendage was an adaptation to arboreal locomotion and not to feed on bamboo.\nLater and more advanced ailurids are classified in the subfamily Ailurinae and are known as the \"true\" red pandas. These animals were smaller and more adapted for an omnivorous or herbivorous diet. The earliest known true panda is \"Magerictis\" from the Middle Miocene of Spain and known only from one tooth, a lower second molar. The tooth shows both ancestral and new characteristics having a relatively low and simple crown but also a lengthened crushing surface with developed tooth cusps like later species. Later ailurines include \"Pristinailurus bristoli\" which lived in eastern North America from the late Miocene to the Early Pliocene and species of the genus \"Parailurus\" which first appear in Early Pliocene Europe, spreading across Eurasia into North America. These animals are classified as a sister taxon to the lineage of the modern red panda. In contrast to the herbivorous modern species, these ancient pandas were likely omnivores, with highly cusped molars and sharp premolars.\nThe earliest fossil record of the modern genus \"Ailurus\" dates no earlier than the Pleistocene and appears to have been limited to Asia. The modern red panda's lineage became adapted for a specialised bamboo diet, having molar-like premolars and more elevated cusps. The false thumb would secondarily gain a function in feeding.\nGenomics.\nAnalysis of 53 red panda samples from Sichuan and Yunnan showed a high level of genetic diversity. The full genome of the red panda was sequenced in 2017. Researchers have compared it to the genome of the giant panda to learn the genetics of convergent evolution, as both species have false thumbs and are adapted for a specialised bamboo diet despite having the digestive system of a carnivore. Both pandas show modifications to certain limb development genes (DYNC2H1 and PCNT), which may play roles in the development of the thumbs. In switching from a carnivorous to a herbivorous diet, both species have reactivated taste receptor genes used for detecting bitterness, though the specific genes are different.\nDescription.\nThe red panda's coat is mainly red or orange-brown with a black belly and legs. The muzzle, cheeks, brows and inner ear margins are mostly white while the bushy tail has red and buff ring patterns and a dark brown tip. The colouration appears to serve as camouflage in habitat with red moss and white lichen-covered trees. The guard hairs are longer and rougher while the dense undercoat is fluffier with shorter hairs. The guard hairs on the back have a circular cross-section and are long. It has moderately long whiskers around the mouth, lower jaw and chin. The hair on the soles of the paws allows the animal to walk in snow.\nThe red panda has a relatively small head, though proportionally larger than in similarly sized raccoons, with a reduced snout and triangular ears, and nearly evenly lengthed limbs. It has a head-body length of with a tail. The Himalayan red panda is recorded to weigh , while the Chinese red panda weighs for females and for males. It has five curved digits on each foot, each with curved semi-retractile claws that aid in climbing. The pelvis and hindlimbs have flexible joints, adaptations for an arboreal quadrupedal lifestyle. While not prehensile, the tail helps the animal balance while climbing.\nThe forepaws possess a \"false thumb\", which is an extension of a wrist bone, the radial sesamoid found in many carnivorans. This thumb allows the animal to grip onto bamboo stalks and both the digits and wrist bones are highly flexible. The red panda shares this feature with the giant panda, which has a larger sesamoid that is more compressed at the sides. In addition, the red panda's sesamoid has a more sunken tip while the giant panda's curves in the middle. These features give the giant panda more developed dexterity.\nThe red panda's skull is wide, and its lower jaw is robust. However, because it eats leaves and stems, which are not as tough, it has smaller chewing muscles than the giant panda. The digestive system of the red panda is only 4.2 times its body length, with a simple stomach, no noticeable divide between the ileum and colon, and no caecum.\nBoth sexes have paired anal glands that emit a secretion consisting of long-chain fatty acids, cholesterol, squalene and 2-Piperidinone; the latter is the most odoriferous compound and is perceived by humans as having an ammoniacal or pepper-like odour.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe red panda inhabits Nepal, the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh in India, Bhutan, southern Tibet, northern Myanmar and China's Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The global potential habitat of the red panda has been estimated to comprise at most; this habitat is located in the temperate climate zone of the Himalayas with a mean annual temperature range of . Throughout this range, it has been recorded at elevations of .\nIn Nepal, it lives in six protected area complexes within the Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests ecoregion. The westernmost records to date were obtained in three community forests in Kalikot District in 2019. Panchthar and Ilam Districts represent its easternmost range in the country, where its habitat in forest patches is surrounded by villages, livestock pastures and roads. The metapopulation in protected areas and wildlife corridors in the Kangchenjunga landscape of Sikkim and northern West Bengal is partly connected through old-growth forests outside protected areas. Forests in this landscape are dominated by Himalayan oaks (\"Quercus lamellosa\" and \"Q. semecarpifolia\"), Himalayan birch, Himalayan fir, Himalayan maple with bamboo, \"Rhododendron\" and some black juniper shrub growing in the understoreys. Records in Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh's Pangchen Valley, West Kameng and Shi Yomi districts indicate that it frequents habitats with \"Yushania\" and \"Thamnocalamus\" bamboo, medium-sized \"Rhododendron\", whitebeam and chinquapin trees. In China, it inhabits the Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests and Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests in the Hengduan, Qionglai, Xiaoxiang, Daxiangling and Liangshan Mountains in Sichuan. In the adjacent Yunnan province, it was recorded only in the northwestern montane part.\nThe red panda prefers microhabitats within of water sources. Fallen logs and tree stumps are important habitat features, as they facilitate access to bamboo leaves. Red pandas have been recorded to use steep slopes of more than 20\u00b0 and stumps exceeding a diameter of . Red pandas observed in Phrumsengla National Park used foremost easterly and southerly slopes with a mean slope of 34\u00b0 and a canopy cover of 66 per cent that were overgrown with bamboo about in height. In Dafengding Nature Reserve, it prefers steep south-facing slopes in winter and inhabits forests with bamboo tall. In Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve, it inhabits mixed coniferous forest with a dense canopy cover of more than 75 per cent, steep slopes and a density of at least . In some parts of China, the red panda coexists with the giant panda. In Fengtongzhai and Yele National Nature Reserves, red panda microhabitat is characterised by steep slopes with lots of bamboo stems, shrubs, fallen logs and stumps, whereas the giant panda prefers gentler slopes with taller but lesser amounts of bamboo and less habitat features overall. Such niche separation lessens competition between the two bamboo-eating species.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nThe red panda is difficult to observe in the wild, and most studies on its behaviour have taken place in captivity. The red panda appears to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, sleeping intermittently at night. It typically rests or sleeps in trees or other elevated spaces, stretched out prone on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled up with its hindlimb over the face when it is cold. It is adapted for climbing and descends to the ground head-first with the hindfeet holding on to the middle of the tree trunk. It moves quickly on the ground by trotting or bounding.\nSocial spacing.\nAdult pandas are generally solitary and territorial. Individuals mark their home range or territorial boundaries with urine, faeces and secretions from the anal and surrounding glands. Scent-marking is usually done on the ground, with males marking more often and for longer periods. In China's Wolong National Nature Reserve, the home range of a radio-collared female was , while that of a male was . A one-year-long monitoring study of ten red pandas in eastern Nepal showed that the four males had median home ranges of and the six females of within a forest cover of at least . The females travelled per day and the males . In the mating season from January to March, adults travelled a mean of and subadults a mean of . They all had larger home ranges in areas with low forest cover and reduced their activity in areas that were disturbed by people, livestock and dogs.\nDiet and feeding.\nThe red panda is largely herbivorous and feeds primarily on bamboo, mainly the genera \"Phyllostachys\", \"Sinarundinaria\", \"Thamnocalamus\" and \"Chimonobambusa\". It also feeds on fruits, blossoms, acorns, eggs, birds and small mammals. Bamboo leaves may be the most abundant food item year-round and the only food they can access during winter. In Wolong National Nature Reserve, leaves of the bamboo species \"Bashania fangiana\" were found in nearly 94 per cent of analysed droppings, and its shoots were found in 59 per cent of the droppings found in June.\nThe diet of red pandas monitored at three sites in Singalila National Park for two years consisted of 40\u201383 per cent \"Yushania maling\" and 51\u201391.2 per cent \"Thamnocalamus spathiflorus\" bamboos supplemented by bamboo shoots, \"Actinidia strigosa\" fruits and seasonal berries. In this national park, red panda droppings also contained remains of silky rose and bramble fruit species in the summer season, \"Actinidia callosa\" in the post-monsoon season, and \"Merrilliopanax alpinus\", the whitebeam species \"Sorbus cuspidata\" and tree rhododendron in both seasons. Droppings were found with 23 plant species including the stone oak species \"Lithocarpus pachyphyllus\", Campbell's magnolia, the chinquapin species \"Castanopsis tribuloides\", Himalayan birch, \"Litsea sericea\" and the holly species \"Ilex fragilis\". In Nepal's Rara National Park, \"Thamnocalamus\" was found in all the droppings sampled, both before and after the monsoon. Its summer diet in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve also includes some lichens and barberries. In Bhutan's Jigme Dorji National Park, red panda faeces found in the fruiting season contained seeds of Himalayan ivy.\nThe red panda grabs food with one of its front paws and usually eats sitting down or standing. When foraging for bamboo, it grabs the plant by the stem and pulls it down towards its jaws. It bites the leaves with the side of the cheek teeth and then shears, chews and swallows. Smaller food like blossoms, berries and small leaves are eaten differently, being clipped by the incisors. Having the gastrointestinal tract of a carnivore, the red panda cannot properly digest bamboo, which passes through its gut in two to four hours. Hence, it must consume large amounts of the most nutritious plant matter. It eats over of fresh leaves or of fresh shoots in a day with crude proteins and fats being the most easily digested. Digestion is highest in summer and fall but lowest in winter, and is easier for shoots than leaves. The red panda's metabolic rate is comparable to other mammals of its size, despite its poor diet. The red panda digests almost a third of dry matter, which is more efficient than the giant panda digesting 17 per cent. Microbes in the gut may aid in its processing of bamboo; the microbiota community in the red panda is less diverse than in other mammals.\nCommunication.\nAt least seven different vocalisations have been recorded from the red panda, comprising growls, barks, squeals, hoots, bleats, grunts and twitters. Growling, barking, grunting and squealing are produced during fights and aggressive chasing. Hooting is made in response to being approached by another individual. Bleating is associated with scent-marking and sniffing. Males may bleat during mating, while females twitter. During both play fighting and aggressive fighting, individuals curve their backs and tails while slowly moving their heads up and down. They then turn their heads while jaw-clapping, move their heads laterally and lift a forepaw to strike. They stand on their hind legs, raise the forelimbs above the head and then pounce. Two red pandas may \"stare\" at each other from a distance.\nReproduction and parenting.\nRed pandas are long-day breeders, reproducing after the winter solstice as daylight grows longer. Mating thus takes place from January to March, with births occurring from May to August. Reproduction is delayed by six months for captive pandas in the southern hemisphere. Oestrous lasts a day, and females can enter oestrous multiple times a season, but it is not known how long the intervals between each cycle last.\nAs the reproductive season begins, males and females interact more, and will rest, move, and feed near each other. An oestrous female will spend more time marking and males will inspect her anogenital region. Receptive females make tail-flicks and position themselves in a lordosis pose, with the front lowered to the ground and the spine curved. Copulation involves the male mounting the female from behind and on top, though face-to-face matings as well as belly-to-back matings while lying on the sides also occur. The male will grab the female by the sides with his front paws instead of biting her neck. Intromission is 2\u201325 minutes long, and the couple groom each other between each bout.\nGestation lasts about 131 days. Prior to giving birth, the female selects a denning site, such as a tree, log or stump hollow or rock crevice, and builds a nest using material from nearby, such as twigs, sticks, branches, bark bits, leaves, grass and moss. Litters typically consist of one to four cubs that are born fully furred but blind. They are entirely dependent on their mother for the first three to four months until they first leave the nest. They nurse for their first five months. The bond between mother and offspring lasts until the next mating season. Cubs are fully grown at around 12 months and at around 18 months they reach sexual maturity. Two radio-collared cubs in eastern Nepal separated from their mothers at the age of 7\u20138 months and left their birth areas three weeks later. They reached new home ranges within 26\u201342 days and became residents after exploring them for 42\u201344 days.\nMortality and diseases.\nThe red panda's lifespan in captivity reaches 14 years. They have been recorded falling prey to leopards in the wild. Faecal samples of red panda collected in Nepal contained parasitic protozoa, amoebozoans, roundworms, trematodes and tapeworms. Roundworms, tapeworms and coccidia were also found in red panda scat collected in Rara and Langtang National Parks. Fourteen red pandas at the Knoxville Zoo suffered from severe ringworm, so the tails of two were amputated. Chagas disease was reported as the cause of death of a red panda kept in a Kansas zoo. \"Amdoparvovirus\" was detected in the scat of six red pandas in the Sacramento Zoo. Eight captive red pandas in a Chinese zoo suffered from shortness of breath and fever shortly before they died of pneumonia; autopsy revealed that they had antibodies to the protozoans \"Toxoplasma gondii\" and \"Sarcocystis\" species indicating that they were intermediate hosts. A captive red panda in the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding died of unknown reasons; an autopsy showed that its kidneys, liver and lungs were damaged by a bacterial infection caused by \"Escherichia coli\".\nThreats.\nThe red panda is primarily threatened by the destruction and fragmentation of its habitat, the causes of which include increasing human population, deforestation, the unlawful taking of non-wood forest material and disturbances by herders and livestock. Trampling by livestock inhibits bamboo growth, and clearcutting decreases the ability of some bamboo species to regenerate. The cut lumber stock in Sichuan alone reached in 1958\u20131960, and around of red panda habitat were logged between the mid-1970s and late 1990s. Throughout Nepal, the red panda habitat outside protected areas is negatively affected by solid waste, livestock trails and herding stations, and people collecting firewood and medicinal plants. Threats identified in Nepal's Lamjung District include grazing by livestock during seasonal transhumance, human-made forest fires and the collection of bamboo as cattle fodder in winter. Vehicular traffic is a significant barrier to red panda movement between habitat patches.\nPoaching is also a major threat. In Nepal, 121 red panda skins were confiscated between 2008 and 2018. Traps meant for other wildlife have been recorded killing red pandas. In Myanmar, the red panda is threatened by hunting using guns and traps; since roads to the border with China were built starting in the early 2000s, red panda skins and live animals have been traded and smuggled across the border. In southwestern China, the red panda is hunted for its fur, especially for the highly valued bushy tails, from which hats are produced. The red panda population in China has been reported to have decreased by 40 per cent over the last 50 years, and the population in western Himalayan areas are considered to be smaller. Between 2005 and 2017, 35 live and seven dead red pandas were confiscated in Sichuan, and several traders were sentenced to 3\u201312 years of imprisonment. A month-long survey of 65 shops in nine Chinese counties in the spring of 2017 revealed only one in Yunnan offered hats made of red panda skins, and red panda tails were offered in an online forum.\nConservation.\nThe red panda is listed in CITES Appendix I and protected in all range countries; hunting is illegal. It has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008 because the global population is estimated at 10,000 individuals, with a decreasing population trend. A large extent of its habitat is part of protected areas.\nA red panda anti-poaching unit and community-based monitoring have been established in Langtang National Park. Members of Community Forest User Groups also protect and monitor red panda habitats in other parts of Nepal. Community outreach programs have been initiated in eastern Nepal using information boards, radio broadcasting and the annual International Red Panda Day in September; several schools endorsed a red panda conservation manual as part of their curricula.\nSince 2010, community-based conservation programmes have been initiated in 10 districts in Nepal that aim to help villagers reduce their dependence on natural resources through improved herding and food processing practices and alternative income possibilities. The Nepali government ratified a five-year Red Panda Conservation Action Plan in 2019. From 2016 to 2019, of high-elevation rangeland in Merak, Bhutan, was restored and fenced in cooperation with 120 herder families to protect the red panda forest habitat and improve communal land. Villagers in Arunachal Pradesh established two community conservation areas to protect the red panda habitat from disturbance and exploitation of forest resources. China has initiated several projects to protect its environment and wildlife, including Grain for Green, The Natural Forest Protection Project and the National Wildlife/Natural Reserve Construction Project. For the last project, the red panda is not listed as a key species for protection but may benefit from the protection of the giant panda and golden snub-nosed monkey, with which it overlaps in range.\nIn captivity.\nThe London Zoo received two red pandas in 1869 and 1876, the first of which was caught in Darjeeling. The Calcutta Zoo received a live red panda in 1877, the Philadelphia Zoo in 1906, and Artis and Cologne Zoos in 1908. In 1908, the first captive red panda cubs were born in an Indian zoo. In 1940, the San Diego Zoo imported four red pandas from India that had been caught in Nepal; their first litter was born in 1941. Cubs that were born later were sent to other zoos; by 1969, about 250 red pandas had been exhibited in zoos. The Taronga Conservation Society started keeping red pandas in 1977.\nIn 1978, a breed registry, the \"International Red Panda Studbook\", was set up, followed by the Red Panda European Endangered Species Programme in 1985. Members of international zoos ratified a global master plan for the captive breeding of the red panda in 1993. By late 2015, 219 red pandas lived in 42 zoos in Japan. The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park participates in the Red Panda Species Survival Plan and kept about 25 red pandas by 2016. By the end of 2019, 182 European zoos kept 407 red pandas. Regional captive breeding programmes have also been established in North American, Australasian and South African zoos.\nCultural significance.\nThe red panda's role in the culture and folklore of local people is limited. A drawing of a red panda exists on a 13th-century Chinese scroll. In Nepal's Taplejung District, red panda claws are used for treating epilepsy; its skin is used in rituals for treating sick people, making hats, scarecrows and decorating houses. In western Nepal, Magar shamans use its skin and fur in their ritual dresses and believe that it protects against evil spirits. People in central Bhutan consider red pandas to be reincarnations of Buddhist monks. Some tribal people in northeast India and the Yi people believe that it brings good luck to wear red panda tails or hats made of its fur. In China, the fur is used for local cultural ceremonies. At weddings, the bridegroom traditionally carries the hide. Hats made of red panda tails are also used by local newlyweds as a \"good-luck charm\".\nThe red panda was recognised as the state animal of Sikkim in the early 1990s and was the mascot of the Darjeeling Tea Festival. It has been featured on stamps and coins issued by several red panda range states. Anthropomorphic red pandas feature in animated movies and TV series such as \"The White Snake Enchantress\", \"The Jungle Book: The Adventures of Mowgli\", \"Bamboo Bears\", \"Barbie as the Island Princess\", DreamWorks' \"Kung Fu Panda\" franchise, \"Aggretsuko\" and Disney/Pixar's \"Turning Red\", and in several video games and comic books. It is the namesake of the Firefox browser and has been used as the namesake of music bands and of companies. Its appearance has been used for plush toys, t-shirts, postcards and other items.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

'six trees') is a district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan, famous for the Roppongi Hills development area, an upscale commercial and residential complex, and night club scene. Several foreign embassies are located in or near Roppongi. The district is in central Tokyo, situated south of Akasaka and north of Azabu and is noted for its night life, attracting both local residents and visitors from abroad.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Roppongi\", which appears to have been coined around 1660, literally means \"six trees\". According to one account, the name comes from six very old and large zelkova trees that used to mark the area; the first three were cleared, and the last were destroyed during World War II. Another legend has it that the name comes from the fact that six \"daimy\u014ds\" lived nearby during the Edo period, each with the kanji character for \"tree\" or a kind of tree in their names. Roppongi was not extensively populated until after the Meiji Restoration, although the area was trafficked for centuries and served as the site of the cremation of Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Hidetada's wife in 1626.\nIn 1890, the Third Imperial Guard of the Imperial Japanese Army was moved to a site near Roppongi (now home to the Pacific bureau of \"Stars and Stripes\"). The influx of soldiers led to the area's rise as a nightlife district, briefly interrupted by the Great Kanto earthquake which flattened the area in 1923. Roppongi was administratively part of Azabu Ward from 1878 to 1947.\nAfter World War II, during which the area was again destroyed, this time by aerial bombing raids, the United States Army and Allied government officials occupied several facilities in the area, beginning Roppongi's reputation as a neighborhood with large numbers of non-Japanese. Several large US military installations were located in the nearby area, with Hardy Barracks probably the most significant (the US Embassy Housing Compound and Akasaka Press Center including Hardy Barracks Recreational Lodging, \"Stars and Stripes\" office and heliport are still there). Surrounding the military installations were many Japanese-owned restaurants, pool halls, bars, and brothels which catered to US military personnel but were also often frequented by Japanese customers.\nStarting in the late 1960s, Roppongi became popular among Japanese people and foreigners alike for its disco scene, which attracted many of Tokyo's entertainment elites. Contributing to the international scene was the location of several foreign embassies and foreign corporate offices in the Roppongi area. However, many dance clubs shut down in the recession following the market crash of 1989.\nThe Roppongi area received a major economic boost in 2002\u20132003 when the Izumi Garden Tower and the Roppongi Hills high-rise complexes were completed. These projects brought high-end office and condominium space to Roppongi for the first time. The Tokyo Midtown project in neighbouring Akasaka, which was completed in 2006, and includes the first Tokyo Ritz-Carlton Hotel, continued this trend.\nNightlife.\nThe area features numerous bars, nightclubs, strip clubs, restaurants, hostess clubs, cabarets, and other forms of entertainment. Among the expatriate community, the area tends to be favored by business people, students, and off-duty US military personnel. Overall, the neighborhood caters to a younger crowd.\nClubs can range from large, multi-level establishments, to smaller one-room clubs located in upper levels of buildings.\nIn more recent times some of the larger venues with known yakuza connections have closed.\n Around Roppongi crossing are a number of clubs which feature foreign performers. There are also a number of both foreign- and Japanese-operated bars catering to different crowds. Recently, Roppongi has enjoyed a growing reputation for its organized events such as art festivals, dart and billiard tournaments, pub crawls, robot exhibitions, beauty pageants, and so on.\nRestaurants in Roppongi vary from upscale Japanese fare to popular international restaurants.\nCulture.\nRoppongi is home to many important art galleries and museums in Tokyo, serving as a center hub for culture. This includes prestigious institutions such as the Mori Art Museum, Kotaro Nukaga, Galerie Perrotin, and The National Art Center, Tokyo.\nEconomy.\nMori Building Company and The Pok\u00e9mon Company have their headquarters in the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower.\nCompanies based in Roppongi include:\nEducation.\nPublic elementary and middle schools are operated by the Minato City (the Minato Ward) Board of Education. Roppongi Junior High School is located at Imoarai-Zaka, in Roppongi.\nRoppongi 1-ch\u014dme, 3-ch\u014dme, and 4-ch\u014dme, as well as 1-8 and 15-18 ban of 5-ch\u014dme, and 1-22 ban of 7-ch\u014dme, are zoned to Azabu Elementary School. 2-ch\u014dme is zoned to Akasaka Elementary School. 9-14 ban of 5-ch\u014dme and 6-ch\u014dme are zoned to Nanzan Elementary School. 23-ban of 7-ch\u014dme is zoned to K\u014dgai Elementary School.\nThe majority of Roppongi is zoned to Roppongi Junior High School. However, 2-ch\u014dme is instead zoned to Akasaka Junior High School. Roppongi 7-chome 23-ban is instead zoned to Koryo Junior High School.\nPublic high schools are operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education. Roppongi High School is located in Roppongi.\nToyo Eiwa Jogakuin is private girls school, also located at Torii-Zaka in the district.\nThe American School in Japan Early Learning Center is in Roppongi Hills.\nMinato City Library operates Azabu Library in Roppongi.\nControversies.\nIn the past, Roppongi had a reputation as an area with high yakuza presence, whether as customers at Roppongi establishments, conducting business, or managing or owning clubs and bars in the area. Although still exerting some influence in Roppongi, in recent times they appear to have shifted much of their presence to other districts in the Tokyo area.\nIn 2006, Nigerian immigrants to Japan began opening a number of bars and nightclubs in the area, following an earlier group of innovators who had been in business in Roppongi for many years. The Nigerians were noted for using visible, high-pressure tactics to draw customers to their bars. In 2009 and 2010 a series of drink-spiking incidents, in which customers reported being drugged and robbed, were linked to Nigerian-owned bars. The incidents resulted in the United States embassy in Japan warning US citizens to avoid certain bars and clubs in Roppongi. An investigation by \"The Japan Times\" in July 2011 found that though drink spiking occurred, most of the incidents did not involve criminal activity. Many customers claimed unusually severe hangovers after nights spent in Nigerian-run establishments. Similar complaints are often made about non-Nigerian bars in Roppongi that offer unlimited drink packages and often lace drinks with hard liquor to minimize customer consumption and increase profit.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26444", "revid": "19469213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26444", "title": "Robert Louis Stevenson", "text": "Scottish novelist and poet (1850\u20131894)\nRobert Louis Stevenson (born Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson; 13 November 1850 \u2013 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist, essayist, poet and travel writer. He is best known for the novels \"Treasure Island\" (1883), \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (1886), and \"Kidnapped\" (1893), and the poetry collection \"A Child's Garden of Verses\" (1885).\nBorn and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial trouble for much of his life but continued to write prolifically and travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from Sidney Colvin, Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse, Leslie Stephen and W.\u00a0E.\u00a0Henley, the last of whom may have provided the model for Long John Silver in \"Treasure Island\". In 1890 he settled in Samoa, where, alarmed at increasing European and American influence in the South Sea islands, his writing turned from romance and adventure fiction toward a darker realism. He died of a stroke in his island home in 1894 at age 44.\nA celebrity in his lifetime, Stevenson's critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, although today his works are held in general acclaim. In 2018 he was ranked just behind Charles Dickens as the 26th-most-translated author in the world.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nStevenson was born at 8 Howard Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, on 13 November 1850 to Thomas Stevenson (1818\u20131887), a leading lighthouse engineer, and his wife, Margaret Isabella (born Balfour, 1829\u20131897). He was christened Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of \"Lewis\" to \"Louis\", and he dropped \"Balfour\" in 1873.\nLighthouse design was the family's profession; Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the civil engineer Robert Stevenson, and Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David were in the same field. Thomas's maternal grandfather Thomas Smith had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were gentry, tracing their lineage back to Alexander Balfour, who had held the lands of Inchrye in Fife in the fifteenth century. His mother's father, Lewis Balfour (1777\u20131860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included the physician George William Balfour and the marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. \"Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister,\" Stevenson wrote. \"I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.\"\nLewis Balfour and his daughter both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when the family moved to a damp, chilly house at 1 Inverleith Terrace in 1851. The family moved again to the sunnier 17 Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was 11. Illness was a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Contemporaneous views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis or sarcoidosis. The family also summered in the spa town of Bridge of Allan, in North Berwick, and in Peebles for the sake of Stevenson's and his mother's health; \"Stevenson's cave\" in Bridge of Allan was reportedly the inspiration for the character Ben Gunn's cave dwelling in Stevenson's 1883 novel \"Treasure Island\".\nStevenson's parents were both devout Presbyterians, but the household was not strict in its adherence to Calvinist principles. His nurse Alison Cunningham (known as Cummy) was more fervently religious. Her mix of Calvinism and folk beliefs were an early source of nightmares for the child, and he showed a precocious concern for religion. But she also cared for him tenderly in illness, reading to him from John Bunyan and the Bible as he lay sick in bed and telling tales of the Covenanters. Stevenson recalled this time of sickness in \"The Land of Counterpane\" in \"A Child's Garden of Verses\" (1885), dedicating the book to his nurse.\nStevenson was an only child, both strange-looking and eccentric, and he found it hard to fit in when he was sent to a nearby school at age 6, a problem repeated at age 11 when he went on to the Edinburgh Academy, but he mixed well in lively games with his cousins in summer holidays at Colinton. His frequent illnesses often kept him away from his first school, so he was taught for long stretches by private tutors. He was a late reader, learning at age 7 or 8, but even before this he dictated stories to his mother and nurse, and he compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood. His father was proud of this interest; he had also written stories in his spare time until his own father had found them and had told him to \"give up such nonsense and mind your business.\" He paid for the printing of Robert's first publication at 16, entitled \"The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666\". It was an account of the Covenanters' rebellion and was published in 1866, the 200th anniversary of the event.\nEducation.\nIn September 1857, when he was six years old, Stevenson went to \"Mr Henderson's School\" in India Street, Edinburgh, but because of poor health stayed only a few weeks and did not return until October 1859, aged eight. During his many absences, he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, aged ten, he went to Edinburgh Academy, an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in Isleworth in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, the 13-year-old was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university. In November 1867, Stevenson entered the University of Edinburgh to study engineering. From the start he showed no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in The Speculative Society (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, Fleeming Jenkin, whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write. Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as \"Bob\"), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art.\nHolidays in Swanston.\nIn 1867 Stevenson's family took a lease on Swanston Cottage, in the village of Swanston at the foot of the Pentland Hills, for use as a summer holiday home. They held the lease until 1880. During their tenancy, the young Robert Louis made frequent use of the cottage, being attracted by the quiet country life and the feeling of remoteness. It is likely that the time he spent there influenced his later writing as well as his wider outlook on life, particularly his love of nature and of wild places. The house and its romantic location are thought to have inspired several of his works.\nLighthouse inspections.\nEach year during his university holidays, Stevenson also travelled to inspect the family's engineering works. In 1868 this took him to Anstruther and for a stay of six weeks in Wick, Caithness, where his family was building a sea wall and had previously built a lighthouse. He was to return to Wick several times over his lifetime and included it in his travel writings. He also accompanied his father on his official tour of Orkney and Shetland islands lighthouses in 1869 and spent three weeks on the island of Erraid in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of Walter Scott with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel \"The Pirate\". In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was \"wonderfully resigned\" to his son's choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read law (again at Edinburgh University) and be called to the Scottish bar. In his 1887 poetry collection \"Underwoods\", Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"An Apology for Idlers\".\nJustifying his rejection of an established profession, in 1877 Stevenson offered \"An Apology for Idlers\". \"A happy man or woman\", he reasoned, \"is a better thing to find than a five-pound note. He or she is a radiating focus of goodwill\" and a practical demonstration of \"the great Theorem of the Liveableness of Life\". So that if they cannot be happy in the \"handicap race for sixpenny pieces\", let them take their own \"by-road\".\nReligious views.\nIn other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more Bohemian; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress. Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels. More significantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist. \nIn January 1873, when he was 22, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began: \"Disregard everything our parents have taught us.\" Questioning his son about his beliefs, he discovered the truth. Stevenson no longer believed in God and had grown tired of pretending to be something he was not: \"am I to live my whole life as one falsehood?\" His father professed himself devastated: \"You have rendered my whole life a failure.\" His mother accounted the revelation \"the heaviest affliction\" to befall her. \"O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is\", Stevenson wrote to his friend Charles Baxter, \"to have just damned the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world.\"\nStevenson's declaration against his parents' faith did not appear to turn into lifelong atheism or agnosticism. In a conciliatory letter to his father in February 1878, the 27-year-old Stevenson wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Christianity is among other things, a very wise, noble and strange doctrine of life ... You see, I speak of it as a doctrine of life, and as a wisdom for this world ... I have a good heart, and believe in myself and my fellow-men and the God who made us all ... There is a fine text in the Bible, I don't know where, to the effect that all things work together for good for those who love the Lord. Strange as it may seem to you, everything has been, in one way or the other, bringing me nearer to what I think you would like me to be. 'Tis a strange world, indeed, but there is a manifest God for those who care to look for him.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGrant that we here before Thee may be set free from the fear of vicissitude and the fear of death, may finish what remains before us of our course without dishonour to ourselves or hurt to others, and, when the day comes, may die in peace. Deliver us from fear and favour: from mean hopes and cheap pleasures. Have mercy on each in his deficiency; let him be not cast down; support the stumbling on the way, and give at last rest to the weary.\nRobert Lewis Stevenson, Prayers Written at Vailima, \"For Grace\".\nStevenson did not resume attending church in Scotland but did teach Sunday School during his final years in Samoa, and wrote and led prayers that were published posthumously. Yet before he embarked on the voyage in 1888 that took him to Samoa, \"Scribner's Magazine\" published \"Pulvis et Umbra\" (the title a line from Horace: \"We are but dust and shadow\"). It is an essay in which Stevenson proposes that \"[o]ur religions and moralities have been trimmed to flatter us, ... and only please and weaken\" and observes that \"[t]he human race is a thing more ancient than the ten commandments\".\nOne critic, attempting to reconcile these conflicting indications of Stevenson's spiritual outlook, has suggested that the author was interested only in the language of religion and wished \"to evoke a sense of awe and importunity associated with [the King James Bible's] intense spirituality and great literary beauty.\"\nEarly writing and travels.\nLiterary and artistic connections.\nIn late 1873, when he was 23, Stevenson was visiting a cousin in England when he met two people who became very important to him: Fanny (Frances Jane) Sitwell and Sidney Colvin. Sitwell was a 34-year-old woman with a son, who was separated from her husband. She attracted the devotion of many who met her, including Colvin, who married her in 1901. Stevenson was also drawn to her, and they kept up a warm correspondence over several years in which he wavered between the role of a suitor and a son (he addressed her as \"Madonna\"). Colvin became Stevenson's literary adviser and was the first editor of his letters after his death. He placed Stevenson's first paid contribution in \"The Portfolio\", an essay titled \"Roads\".\nStevenson was soon active in London literary life, becoming acquainted with many of the writers of the time, including Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse and Leslie Stephen, the editor of \"The Cornhill Magazine\", who took an interest in Stevenson's work. Stephen took Stevenson to visit a patient at the Edinburgh Infirmary named William Ernest Henley, an energetic and talkative poet with a wooden leg. Henley became a close friend and occasional literary collaborator, until a quarrel broke up the friendship in 1888, and he is often considered to be the inspiration for Long John Silver in \"Treasure Island\".\nStevenson was sent to Menton on the French Riviera in November 1873 to recuperate after his health failed. He returned in better health in April 1874 and settled down to his studies, but he returned to France several times after that. He made long and frequent trips to the neighbourhood of the Forest of Fontainebleau, staying at Barbizon, Grez-sur-Loing and Nemours and becoming a member of the artists' colonies there. He also travelled to Paris to visit galleries and the theatres. He qualified for the Scottish bar in July 1875, aged 24, and his father added a brass plate to the Heriot Row house reading \"R.L. Stevenson, Advocate\". His law studies did influence his books, but he never practised law; all his energies were spent in travel and writing. One of his journeys was a canoe voyage in Belgium and France with Sir Walter Simpson, a friend from the Speculative Society, a frequent travel companion, and the author of \"The Art of Golf\" (1887). This trip was the basis of his first travel book \"An Inland Voyage\" (1878).\nStevenson had a long correspondence with his fellow Scot J.M. Barrie. He invited Barrie to visit him in Samoa, but the two never met.\nMarriage and California.\nThe canoe voyage with Simpson brought Stevenson to Grez-sur-Loing in September 1876, where he met Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne (1840\u20131914), born in Indianapolis in the United States. She had married at age 17 and moved to Nevada to rejoin her husband Samuel after his participation in the American Civil War. Their children were Isobel (or \"Belle\"), Lloyd and Hervey (who died in 1875). But anger over her husband's infidelities led to a number of separations. In 1875 she had taken her children to France, where she and Isobel studied art. By the time Stevenson met her, Fanny was herself a magazine short-story writer of recognised ability.\nStevenson returned to Britain shortly after this first meeting, but Fanny apparently remained in his thoughts, and he wrote the essay \"On falling in love\" for \"The Cornhill Magazine\". They met again early in 1877 and became lovers. Stevenson spent much of the following year with her and her children in France. In August 1878 she returned to San Francisco and Stevenson remained in Europe, making the walking trip that formed the basis for \"Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes\" (1879). He set off to join her in August 1879, aged 28, against the advice of his friends and without notifying his parents. He took a second-class passage on the steamship \"Devonia\", in part to save money but also to learn how others travelled and to increase the adventure of the journey. He then travelled overland by train from New York City to California. He later wrote about the experience in \"The Amateur Emigrant\". It was a good experience for his writing, but it broke his health.\nHe was near death when he arrived in Monterey, California, where some local ranchers nursed him back to health. He stayed for a time at the French Hotel located at 530 Houston Street, now a museum dedicated to his memory called the \"Stevenson House\". While there, he often dined \"on the cuff\", as he said, at a nearby restaurant run by a Frenchman named Jules Simoneau, which stood at what is now Simoneau Plaza; several years later, he sent Simoneau an inscribed copy of his novel \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (1886), writing that it would be a stranger case still if Robert Louis Stevenson ever forgot Jules Simoneau. While in Monterey, he wrote an evocative article about \"the Old Pacific Capital\" of Monterey.\nBy December 1879, aged 29, Stevenson had recovered his health enough to continue to San Francisco where he struggled \"all alone on forty-five cents a day, and sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts,\" in an effort to support himself through his writing. But by the end of the winter, his health was broken again and he found himself at death's door. Fanny was now divorced and recovered from her own illness, and she came to his bedside and nursed him to recovery. \"After a while,\" he wrote, \"my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success.\" When his father heard of his son's condition, he cabled him money to help him through this period.\nFanny and Robert were married in May 1880. She was 40; he was 29. He said that he was \"a mere complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom.\" He travelled with his new wife and her son Lloyd north of San Francisco to Napa Valley and spent a summer honeymoon at an abandoned mining camp on Mount Saint Helena (today designated Robert Louis Stevenson State Park). He wrote about this experience in \"The Silverado Squatters\". He met Charles Warren Stoddard, co-editor of the \"Overland Monthly\" and author of \"South Sea Idylls\", who urged Stevenson to travel to the South Pacific, an idea which returned to him many years later. In August 1880 he sailed with Fanny and Lloyd from New York to Britain and found his parents and his friend Sidney Colvin on the wharf at Liverpool, happy to see him return home. Gradually, his wife was able to patch up differences between father and son and make herself a part of the family through her charm and wit.\nEngland, and back to the United States.\nThe Stevensons shuttled back and forth between Scotland and the Continent (twice wintering in Davos) before finally, in 1884, settling in Westbourne in the English south-coast town of Bournemouth. Stevenson had moved there to benefit from its sea air. They lived in a house Stevenson named 'Skerryvore' after a Scottish lighthouse built by his uncle Alan.\nFrom April 1885, 34-year-old Stevenson had the company of the novelist Henry James. They had met previously in London and had recently exchanged views in journal articles on the \"art of fiction\" and thereafter in a correspondence in which they expressed their admiration for each other's work. After James had moved to Bournemouth to help support his invalid sister, Alice, he took up the invitation to pay daily visits to Skerryvore for conversation at the Stevensons' dinner table.\nLargely bedridden, Stevenson described himself as living \"like a weevil in a biscuit.\" Yet, despite ill health, during his three years in Westbourne, Stevenson wrote the bulk of his most popular work: \"Treasure Island\", \"Kidnapped\", \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (which established his wider reputation), \"A Child's Garden of Verses\" and \"Underwoods\".\nThomas Stevenson died in 1887, leaving his 36-year-old son feeling free to follow the advice of his physician to try a complete change of climate. Stevenson headed for Colorado with his widowed mother and family. But after landing in New York, they decided to spend the winter in the Adirondacks at a cure cottage now known as Stevenson Cottage at Saranac Lake, New York. During the intensely cold winter, Stevenson wrote some of his best-known essays, including \"Pulvis et Umbra\". He also began \"The Master of Ballantrae\" and lightheartedly planned a cruise to the southern Pacific Ocean for the following summer.\nReflections on the art of writing.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Whenever I read a book or a passage that particularly pleased me, in which a thing was said or an effect rendered with propriety, in which there was either some conspicuous force or some happy distinction in the style, I must sit down at once and set myself to ape that quality. I was unsuccessful, and I knew it; and tried again, and was again unsuccessful and always unsuccessful; but at least in these vain bouts, I got some practice in rhythm, in harmony, in construction and the co-ordination of parts. I have thus played the sedulous ape to Hazlitt, to Lamb, to Wordsworth, to Sir Thomas Browne, to Defoe, to Hawthorne, to Montaigne, to Baudelaire and to Obermann.\nRobert Lewis Stevenson, \"Memories and Portraits\", Chapter IV, relating how he practiced writing in his youth\nStevenson's critical essays on literature contain \"few sustained analyses of style or content\". In \"A Penny Plain and Two-pence Coloured\" (1884) he suggests that his own approach owed much to the exaggerated and romantic world that, as a child, he had entered as proud owner of Skelt's Juvenile Drama\u2014a toy set of cardboard characters who were actors in melodramatic dramas. \"A Gossip on Romance\" (1882) and \"A Gossip on a Novel of Dumas's\" (1887) imply that it is better to entertain than to instruct.\nStevenson very much saw himself in the mould of Sir Walter Scott, a storyteller with an ability to transport his readers away from themselves and their circumstances. He took issue with what he saw as the tendency in French realism to dwell on sordidness and ugliness. In \"The Lantern-Bearer\" (1888) he appears to take Emile Zola to task for failing to seek out nobility in his protagonists.\nIn \"A Humble Remonstrance\", Stevenson answers Henry James's claim in \"The Art of Fiction\" (1884) that the novel competes with life. Stevenson protests that no novel can ever hope to match life's complexity; it merely abstracts from life to produce a harmonious pattern of its own.Man's one method, whether he reasons or creates, is to half-shut his eyes against the dazzle and confusion of reality...Life is monstrous, infinite, illogical, abrupt and poignant; a work of art, in comparison, is neat, finite, self-contained, rational, flowing, and emasculate...The novel, which is a work of art, exists, not by its resemblances to life, which are forced and material ... but by its immeasurable difference from life, which is designed and significant. It is not clear, however, that in this there was any real basis for disagreement with James. Stevenson had presented James with a copy of \"Kidnapped\", but it was \"Treasure Island\" that James favoured. Written as a story for boys, Stevenson had thought it in \"no need of psychology or fine writing\", but its success is credited with liberating children's writing from the \"chains of Victorian didacticism\".\nPolitical and social commentary.\nDuring his college years, Stevenson briefly identified himself as a \"red-hot socialist\". But already by age 26 he was writing of looking back on this time \"with something like regret. ... Now I know that in thus turning Conservative with years, I am going through the normal cycle of change and travelling in the common orbit of men's opinions.\" His cousin and biographer Sir Graham Balfour claimed that Stevenson \"probably throughout life would, if compelled to vote, have always supported the Conservative candidate.\" In 1866 the 15-year-old Stevenson did vote for Benjamin Disraeli, the Tory democrat and future British prime minister, for the Lord Rectorship of the University of Edinburgh. But this was against a markedly illiberal challenger, the historian Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle was notorious for his anti-democratic and pro-slavery views.\nIn \"The Day After Tomorrow\", appearing in \"The Contemporary Review\" (April 1887), Stevenson suggested: \"we are all becoming Socialists without knowing it\". Legislation \"grows authoritative, grows philanthropical, bristles with new duties and new penalties, and casts a spawn of inspectors, who now begin, note-book in hand, to darken the face of England\". He is referring to the steady growth in social legislation in Britain since the first of the Conservative-sponsored Factory Acts (which, in 1833, established a professional Factory Inspectorate). Stevenson cautioned that this \"new waggon-load of laws\" points to a future in which our grandchildren might \"taste the pleasures of existence in something far liker an ant-heap than any previous human polity\". Yet in reproducing the essay his latter-day libertarian admirers omit his express understanding for the abandonment of Whiggish, classical-liberal notions of laissez faire. \"Liberty\", Stevenson wrote, \"has served us a long while\" but like all other virtues \"she has taken wages\". [Liberty] has dutifully served Mammon; so that many things we were accustomed to admire as the benefits of freedom and common to all, were truly benefits of wealth, and took their value from our neighbour's poverty...Freedom to be desirable, involves kindness, wisdom, and all the virtues of the free; but the free man as we have seen him in action has been, as of yore, only the master of many helots; and the slaves are still ill-fed, ill-clad, ill-taught, ill-housed, insolently entreated, and driven to their mines and workshops by the lash of famine.\nIn January 1888, aged 37, in response to American press coverage of the Land War in Ireland, Stevenson penned a political essay (rejected by \"Scribner's\" magazine and never published in his lifetime) that advanced a broadly conservative theme: the necessity of \"staying internal violence by rigid law\". Notwithstanding his title, \"Confessions of a Unionist\", Stevenson defends neither the union with Britain (she had \"majestically demonstrated her incapacity to rule Ireland\") nor \"landlordism\" (scarcely more defensible in Ireland than, as he had witnessed it, in the goldfields of California). Rather he protests the readiness to pass \"lightly\" over crimes\u2014\"unmanly murders and the harshest extremes of boycotting\"\u2014where these are deemed \"political\". This he argues is to \"defeat law\" (which is ever a \"compromise\") and to invite \"anarchy\": it is \"the sentimentalist preparing the pathway for the brute\".\nFinal years in the Pacific.\nPacific voyages.\nIn June 1888 Stevenson chartered the yacht \"Casco\" from Samuel Merritt and set sail with his family from San Francisco. The vessel \"plowed her path of snow across the empty deep, far from all track of commerce, far from any hand of help.\" The sea air and thrill of adventure for a time restored his health, and for nearly three years he wandered the eastern and central Pacific, stopping for extended stays at the Hawaiian Islands, where he became a good friend of King Kal\u0101kaua. He befriended the king's niece Princess Victoria Kaiulani, who also had Scottish heritage. He spent time at the Gilbert Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand and the Samoan Islands. During this period he completed \"The Master of Ballantrae\", composed two ballads based on the legends of the islanders, and wrote \"The Bottle Imp\". He preserved the experience of these years in his various letters and in his \"In the South Seas\" (which was published posthumously). He made a voyage in 1889 with Lloyd on the trading schooner \"Equator\", visiting Butaritari, Mariki, Apaiang and Abemama in the Gilbert Islands. They spent several months on Abemama with tyrant-chief Tem Binoka, whom Stevenson described in \"In the South Seas\".\nIn 1889, Stevenson visited the leper colony on Moloka\u02bbi, Hawaii, where leper girls were cared for by Sisters of Saint Francis, led by Mother Marianne Cope. He brought a croquet set and taught the girls to play croquet. He spent a week there, and after his departure, he had a piano shipped to them from Honolulu.\nStevenson left Sydney, Australia, on the \"Janet Nicoll\" in April 1890 for his third and final voyage among the South Seas islands. He intended to produce another book of travel writing to follow his earlier book \"In the South Seas\", but it was his wife who eventually published her journal of their third voyage. (Fanny misnames the ship in her account \"The Cruise of the Janet Nichol\".) A fellow passenger was Jack Buckland, whose stories of life as an island trader became the inspiration for the character of Tommy Hadden in \"The Wrecker\" (1892), which Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne wrote together. Buckland visited the Stevensons at Vailima in 1894.\nPolitical engagement in Samoa.\nIn December 1889, 39-year-old Stevenson and his extended family arrived at the port of Apia in the Samoan islands and there he and Fanny decided to settle. In January 1890 they purchased at Vailima, some miles inland from Apia the capital, on which they built the islands' first two-storey house. Fanny's sister, Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez, wrote that \"it was in Samoa that the word 'home' first began to have a real meaning for these gypsy wanderers\". In May 1891, they were joined by Stevenson's mother, Margaret. While his wife set about managing and working the estate, 40-year-old Stevenson took the native name Tusitala (Samoan for \"Teller of Tales\"), and began collecting local stories. Often he would exchange these for his own tales. The first work of literature in Samoan was his translation of \"The Bottle Imp (1891)\", which presents a Pacific-wide community as the setting for a moral fable.\nImmersing himself in the islands' culture occasioned a \"political awakening\": it placed Stevenson \"at an angle\" to the rival great powers, Britain, Germany and the United States whose warships were common sights in Samoan harbours. He understood that, as in the Scottish Highlands (comparisons with his homeland \"came readily\"), an indigenous clan society was unprepared for the arrival of foreigners who played upon its existing rivalries and divisions. As the external pressures upon Samoan society grew, tensions soon descended into several inter-clan wars.\nNo longer content to be a \"romancer\", Stevenson became a reporter and an agitator, firing off letters to \"The Times\" which \"rehearsed with an ironic twist that surely owed something to his Edinburgh legal training\", a tale of European and American misconduct. His concern for the Polynesians is also found in the \"South Sea Letters\", published in magazines in 1891 (and then in book form as \"In the South Seas\" in 1896). In an effort he feared might result in his own deportation, Stevenson helped secure the recall of two European officials. \"\" (1892) was a detailed chronicle of the intersection of rivalries between the great powers and the first Samoan Civil War.\nAs much as he said he disdained politics\u2014\"I used to think meanly of the plumber\", he wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin, \"but how he shines beside the politician!\"\u2014Stevenson felt himself obliged to take sides. He openly allied himself with chief Mataafa, whose rival Malietoa was backed by the Germans whose firms were beginning to monopolise copra and cocoa bean processing.\nStevenson was alarmed above all by what he perceived as the Samoans' economic innocence\u2014their failure to secure their claim to proprietorship of the land (in a Lockean sense) through improving management and labour. In 1894 just months before his death, he addressed the island chiefs:There is but one way to defend Samoa. Hear it before it is too late. It is to make roads, and gardens, and care for your trees, and sell their produce wisely, and, in one word, to occupy and use your country... if you do not occupy and use your country, others will. It will not continue to be yours or your children's, if you occupy it for nothing. You and your children will, in that case, be cast out into outer darkness\". He had \"seen these judgments of God\", not only in Hawaii where abandoned native churches stood like tombstones \"over a grave, in the midst of the white men's sugar fields\", but also in Ireland and \"in the mountains of my own country Scotland\".These were a fine people in the past brave, gay, faithful, and very much like Samoans, except in one particular, that they were much wiser and better at that business of fighting of which you think so much. But the time came to them as it now comes to you, and it did not find them ready...\nFive years after Stevenson's death, the Samoan Islands were partitioned between Germany and the United States.\nLast works.\nStevenson wrote an estimated 700,000 words during his years on Samoa. He completed \"The Beach of Fales\u00e1\", the first-person tale of a Scottish copra trader on a South Sea island, a man unheroic in his actions or his own soul. Rather he is a man of limited understanding and imagination, comfortable with his own prejudices: where, he wonders, can he find \"whites\" for his \"half caste\" daughters. The villains are white, their behaviour towards the islanders ruthlessly duplicitous.\nStevenson saw \"The Beach of Fales\u00e1\" as the ground-breaking work in his turn away from romance to realism. Stevenson wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The Ebb-Tide\" (1894), the misadventures of three deadbeats marooned in the Tahitian port of Papeete, has been described as presenting \"a microcosm of imperialist society, directed by greedy but incompetent whites, the labour supplied by long-suffering natives who fulfil their duties without orders and are true to the missionary faith which the Europeans make no pretence of respecting\". It confirmed the new Realistic turn in Stevenson's writing away from romance and adolescent adventure. The first sentence reads: \"Throughout the island world of the Pacific, scattered men of many European races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and disseminate disease\". No longer was Stevenson writing about human nature \"in terms of a contest between Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\": \"the edges of moral responsibility and the margins of moral judgement were too blurred\". As with \"The Beach of Fales\u00e0\", in \"The Ebb Tide\" contemporary reviewers find parallels with several of Conrad's works: \"Almayer's Folly\", \"An Outcast of the Islands\", \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus\"\", \"Heart of Darkness\" and \"Lord Jim\".\nWith his imagination still residing in Scotland and returning to earlier form, Stevenson also wrote \"Catriona\" (1893), a sequel to his earlier novel \"Kidnapped\" (1886), continuing the adventures of its hero David Balfour.\nAlthough he felt, as a writer, that \"there was never any man had so many irons in the fire\". by the end of 1893 Stevenson feared that he had \"overworked\" and exhausted his creative vein. His writing was partly driven by the need to meet the expenses of Vailima. But in a last burst of energy he began work on \"Weir of Hermiston\". \"It's so good that it frightens me,\" he is reported to have exclaimed. He felt that this was the best work he had done. Set in eighteenth century Scotland, it is a story of a society that (however different), like Samoa is witnessing a breakdown of social rules and structures leading to growing moral ambivalence.\nDeath.\nOn 3 December 1894 Stevenson was talking to his wife and straining to open a bottle of wine when he suddenly exclaimed, \"What's that?\", then asked his wife, \"Does my face look strange?\", and collapsed. (Some sources have stated that he was, instead, attempting to make mayonnaise when he collapsed.) He died within a few hours, at the age of 44, possibly as the result of a brain haemorrhage. According to research published in 2000, Stevenson might have suffered from hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber Syndrome). This would explain his chronic respiratory complaints, recurrent episodes of pulmonary haemorrhage, and his early death. It might also explain his mother's hitherto unreported but apparent stroke, at age 38 years.\nAfter his death, the Samoans insisted on surrounding his body with a watch-guard during the night and on bearing him on their shoulders to nearby Mount Vaea, where they buried him on a spot overlooking the sea on land donated by British Acting Vice Consul Thomas Trood. Based on Stevenson's poem \"Requiem\", the following epitaph is inscribed on his tomb:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStevenson was loved by the Samoans, and his tombstone epitaph was translated to a Samoan song of grief. The requiem appears on the eastern side of the grave. On the western side the biblical passage of Ruth 1:16\u201317 is inscribed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe ensign flag draped over his coffin in Samoa was returned to Edinburgh and now resides in a glass case over the fireplace of rooms in Edinburgh University's Old College owned by The Speculative Society, of which he was a member.\nArtistic reception.\nHalf of Stevenson's original manuscripts are lost, including those of \"Treasure Island\", \"The Black Arrow\" and \"The Master of Ballantrae\". His heirs sold his papers during the First World War, and many of his documents were auctioned off in 1918.\nStevenson was a celebrity in his own time, being admired by many other writers, including Marcel Proust, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, J. M. Barrie, Rudyard Kipling and Emilio Salgari, and later Cesare Pavese, Bertolt Brecht, Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, Vladimir Nabokov and G. K. Chesterton, who said that Stevenson \"seemed to pick the right word up on the point of his pen, like a man playing spillikins\".\nStevenson was seen for much of the 20th century as a second-class writer. He became relegated to children's literature and horror genres, condemned by literary figures such as Virginia Woolf (daughter of his early mentor Leslie Stephen) and her husband Leonard Woolf, and he was gradually excluded from the canon of literature taught in schools. His exclusion reached its nadir in the 1973 2,000-page \"Oxford Anthology of English Literature\" where he was entirely unmentioned, and \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature\" excluded him from 1968 to 2000 (1st\u20137th editions), including him only in the eighth edition (2006).\nThe late 20th century brought a re-evaluation of Stevenson as an artist of great range and insight, a literary theorist, an essayist and social critic, a witness to the colonial history of the Pacific Islands and a humanist. He was praised by Roger Lancelyn Green, one of the Oxford Inklings, as a writer of a consistently high level of \"literary skill or sheer imaginative power\" and a pioneer of the Age of the Story Tellers along with H. Rider Haggard. He is now evaluated as a peer of authors such as Joseph Conrad (whom Stevenson influenced with his South Seas fiction) and Henry James, with new scholarly studies and organisations devoted to him. Throughout the vicissitudes of his scholarly reception, Stevenson has remained popular worldwide. According to the Index Translationum, Stevenson is ranked the 26th-most-translated author in the world, ahead of Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe.\nOn the subject of Stevenson's modern reputation, the American film critic Roger Ebert wrote in 1996,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was talking to a friend the other day who said he'd never met a child who liked reading Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\".\nNeither have I, I said. And he'd never met a child who liked reading Stevenson's \"Kidnapped\". Me neither, I said. My early exposure to both books was via the Classics Illustrated comic books. But I did read the books later, when I was no longer a kid, and I enjoyed them enormously. Same goes for Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\".\nThe fact is, Stevenson is a splendid writer of stories for adults, and he should be put on the same shelf with Joseph Conrad and Jack London instead of in between Winnie the Pooh and Peter Pan.\nMonuments and commemoration.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Writers' Museum near Edinburgh's Royal Mile devotes a room to Stevenson, containing some of his personal possessions from childhood through to adulthood.\nA bronze relief memorial to Stevenson, designed by the American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1904, is mounted in the Moray Aisle of St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh. Saint-Gaudens' scaled-down version of this relief is in the collection of the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey. Another small version depicting Stevenson with a cigarette in his hand rather than the pen he holds in the St. Giles memorial is displayed in the Nichols House Museum in Beacon Hill, Boston.\nIn the West Princes Street Gardens below Edinburgh Castle a simple upright stone is inscribed: \"RLS \u2013 A Man of Letters 1850\u20131894\" by the sculptor Ian Hamilton Finlay in 1987. In 2013, a statue of Stevenson as a child with his dog was unveiled by the author Ian Rankin outside Colinton Parish Church. The sculptor of the statue was Alan Herriot, and the money to erect it was raised by the Colinton Community Conservation Trust.\nStevenson's house Skerryvore, at the head of Alum Chine, was severely damaged by bombs during a destructive and lethal raid in the Bournemouth Blitz. Despite a campaign to save it, the building was demolished. A garden was designed by the Bournemouth Corporation in 1957 as a memorial to Stevenson, on the site of his Westbourne house, \"Skerryvore\", which he occupied from 1885 to 1887. A statue of the Skerryvore lighthouse is present on the site. Robert Louis Stevenson Avenue in Westbourne is named after him.\nThe small hotel in Wick where Stevenson stayed in the summer of 1868 is now called Stevenson House and is marked by a plaque. The house is near the harbour, in the part of Wick known as Pultneytown.\nIn 1994, to mark the 100th anniversary of Stevenson's death, the Royal Bank of Scotland issued a series of commemorative \u00a31 notes which featured a quill pen and Stevenson's signature on the obverse, and Stevenson's face on the reverse side. Alongside Stevenson's portrait are scenes from some of his books and his house in Western Samoa. Two million notes were issued, each with a serial number beginning \"RLS\". The first note to be printed was sent to Samoa in time for their centenary celebrations on 3 December 1994.\nIn 2024 it was announced that a Jekyll and Hyde\u2013themed sculpture would be built near where Skerryvore once stood.\nUnited States.\nThe Stevenson House at 530 Houston Street in Monterey, California, formerly the French Hotel, memorialises Stevenson's 1879 stay in \"the Old Pacific Capital\", as he was crossing the United States to join his future wife, Fanny Osbourne. The Stevenson House museum features a bas-relief depicting the sickly author writing in bed.\nSpyglass Hill Golf Course, originally called Pebble Beach Pines Golf Club, was renamed \"Spyglass Hill\" by Samuel F. B. Morse (1885\u20131969), the founder of Pebble Beach Company, after a place in Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\". All the holes at Spyglass Hill are named after characters and places in the novel.\nThe Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in St. Helena, California, is home to over 11,000 objects and artifacts, the majority of which belonged to Stevenson. Opened in 1969, the museum houses such treasures as his childhood rocking chair, writing desk, toy soldiers and personal writings among many other items. The museum is free to the public and serves as an academic archive for students, writers and Stevenson enthusiasts.\nThe Robert Louis Stevenson Cottage is a small memorial museum to Stevenson, densely packed with both artifacts and information which provide an excellent introduction to the author and his works. It is located in Saranac Lake, NY, a few miles from Lake Placid.\nIn San Francisco there is an outdoor Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial in Portsmouth Square. In 2024, there was controversy about the San Francisco statue. Jenny Leung, executive director of the Chinese Culture Center, stated \"There were a lot of vocal opinions about how ... Robert Louis Stevenson had nothing to do with Chinatown.\"\nAt least six US public and private schools are named after Stevenson, including on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, in Fridley, Minnesota, in Burbank, California, in Grandview Heights, Ohio, in San Francisco, California, and in Merritt Island, Florida. There is an R. L. Stevenson middle school in Honolulu, Hawaii and in Saint Helena, California. Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, California, was established in 1952 and still exists as a college preparatory boarding school. Robert Louis Stevenson State Park near Calistoga, California, contains the location where he and Fanny spent their honeymoon in 1880.\nA street in Honolulu's Waikiki District, where Stevenson lived while in the Hawaiian Islands, was named after his Samoan moniker, Tusitala.\nSamoa.\nStevenson's former home in Vailima, Samoa, is now a museum dedicated to the later years of his life. The Robert Louis Stevenson Museum presents the house as it was at the time of his death along with two other buildings added to Stevenson's original one, tripling the museum in size. The path to Stevenson's grave at the top of Mount Vaea starts at the museum.\nFrance.\nThe Chemin de Stevenson (GR 70) is a popular long-distance footpath in France that approximately follows Stevenson's route as described in \"Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes\". There are numerous monuments and businesses named after him along the route, including a fountain in the town of Saint-Jean-du-Gard where Stevenson sold his donkey Modestine and took a stagecoach to Al\u00e8s.\nWorks.\nShort stories.\nThis is a chronological list of his short stories (omitting the collaborations with Fanny found in \"More New Arabian Nights: The Dynamiter\").\nIsland literature.\nAlthough not well known, his island fiction and non-fiction is among the most valuable and collected of the 19th century body of work that addresses the Pacific area.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBiographies of Stevenson"}

Although it is not necessarily limited to being an endeavor for amateurs, many topics in this field require no knowledge of advanced mathematics. Recreational mathematics involves mathematical puzzles and games, often appealing to children and untrained adults and inspiring their further study of the subject.\nThe Mathematical Association of America (MAA) includes recreational mathematics as one of its seventeen Special Interest Groups, commenting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Recreational mathematics is not easily defined because it is more than mathematics done as a diversion or playing games that involve mathematics. Recreational mathematics is inspired by deep ideas that are hidden in puzzles, games, and other forms of play. The aim of the SIGMAA on Recreational Mathematics (SIGMAA-Rec) is to bring together enthusiasts and researchers in the myriad of topics that fall under recreational math. We will share results and ideas from our work, show that real, deep mathematics is there awaiting those who look, and welcome those who wish to become involved in this branch of mathematics.\nMathematical competitions (such as those sponsored by mathematical associations) are also categorized under recreational mathematics.\nTopics.\nSome of the more well-known topics in recreational mathematics are Rubik's Cubes, magic squares, fractals, logic puzzles and mathematical chess problems, but this area of mathematics includes the aesthetics and culture of mathematics, peculiar or amusing stories and coincidences about mathematics, and the personal lives of mathematicians.\nMathematical games.\nMathematical games are multiplayer games whose rules, strategies, and outcomes can be studied and explained using mathematics. The players of the game may not need to use explicit mathematics in order to play mathematical games. For example, Mancala is studied in the mathematical field of combinatorial game theory, but no mathematics is necessary in order to play it.\nMathematical puzzles.\nMathematical puzzles require mathematics in order to solve them. They have specific rules, as do multiplayer games, but mathematical puzzles do not usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, in order to solve such a puzzle, the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions.\nLogic puzzles and classical ciphers are common examples of mathematical puzzles. Cellular automata and fractals are also considered mathematical puzzles, even though the solver only interacts with them by providing a set of initial conditions.\nAs they often include or require game-like features or thinking, mathematical puzzles are sometimes also called mathematical games.\nMathemagics.\nMagic tricks based on mathematical principles can produce self-working but surprising effects. For instance, a mathemagician might use the combinatorial properties of a deck of playing cards to guess a volunteer's selected card, or Hamming codes to identify whether a volunteer is lying.\nOther activities.\nOther curiosities and pastimes of non-trivial mathematical interest include:\nOnline blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels.\nThere are many blogs and audio or video series devoted to recreational mathematics.

{"id": "26447", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26447", "title": "Resurrection", "text": "Concept of coming back to life\nResurrection or anastasis is the concept of coming back to life after death. This is quite different from reincarnation, a process involving a person or deity returning to life in a different body. The disappearance of a body is another similar but distinct belief in some religions.\nWith the advent of written records, the earliest known recurrent theme of resurrection was in Egyptian and Canaanite religions, which had cults of dying-and-rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Ancient Greek religion generally emphasised immortality, but in the mythos, a number of individuals were made physically immortal as they were resurrected from the dead.\nThe universal resurrection of the dead at the end of the world is a standard eschatological belief in the Abrahamic religions. As a religious concept, resurrection is used in two distinct respects:\nThe death and resurrection of Jesus are a central focus of Christianity. While most Christians believe Jesus's resurrection from the dead and ascension to Heaven was in a material body, some think it was only spiritual.\nLike some forms of the Abrahamic religions, the Dharmic religions also include belief in resurrection and/or reincarnation. There are stories in Buddhism wherein the power of resurrection was allegedly demonstrated in the Chan or Zen tradition. In Hinduism, the core belief in resurrection and/or reincarnation is known as \"sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\".\nAside from religious belief, cryonics and other speculative resurrection technologies are practiced, but the resurrection of long-dead bodies is not considered possible at the current level of scientific knowledge.\nEtymology.\nResurrection, from the Latin noun \"resurrectio -onis\", from the verb \"rego\", \"to make straight, rule\" + preposition \"sub\", \"under\", altered to \"subrigo\" and contracted to \"surgo, surrexi, surrectum\" (\"to rise\", \"get up\", \"stand up\") + preposition \"re-\", \"again\", thus literally \"a straightening from under again\".\nReligion.\nAncient religions in the Near East.\nThe concept of resurrection is found in the writings of some ancient non-Abrahamic religions in the Middle East. A few extant Egyptian and Canaanite writings allude to dying-and-rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Sir James Frazer, in his book \"The Golden Bough\", relates to these dying-and-rising gods, but many of his examples, according to various scholars, distort the sources. Taking a more positive position, Tryggve Mettinger argues in his book that the category of \"rise and return to life\" is significant for Ugaritic Baal, Melqart, Adonis, Eshmun, Osiris and Dumuzi.\nAncient Greek religion.\nIn ancient Greek religion, a number of men and women have been interpreted as being resurrected and made immortal. Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother, Thetis, and brought to an immortal existence in Leuce, the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes are also among the figures interpreted to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus's \"Histories\", the seventh-century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. He would reappear alive years later. However, Greek attitudes toward resurrection were generally negative, and resurrection was considered neither desirable nor possible. For example, Asclepius was killed by Zeus for using herbs to resurrect the dead, but, by his father Apollo's request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.\nMany other figures, like a great part of those who fought in the Trojan War and Theban War, Menelaus, and the historical prizefighter Cleomedes of Astupalaea, were also believed to have been made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. Alcestis undergoes something akin to a resurrection in her escape from the underworld,\nbut without achieving immortality.\nWriting his \"Lives of Illustrious Men\" (Parallel Lives) in the first century, the Middle Platonic philosopher Plutarch in his chapter on Romulus gave an account of the king's mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification, comparing it to Greek tales such as the physical immortalization of Alcmene and Aristeas the Proconnesian, \"for they say Aristeas died in a fuller's work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton\". Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in ancient Greek religion, writing, \"many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal.\" Likewise, he writes that while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens \"only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled.\"\nThe parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later belief in the resurrection of Jesus was not lost on the early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: \"When we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus.\" (\"1 Apol.\" 21).\nBuddhism.\nThere are stories in Buddhism where the power of resurrection was allegedly demonstrated in Chan or Zen tradition. One is the legend of Bodhidharma, the Indian master who brought the Ekayana school of India that subsequently became Chan Buddhism to China.\nThe other is the passing of Chinese Chan master Puhua (Japanese: Jinshu Fuke), recounted in the Record of Linji (Japanese: Rinzai Gigen). Puhua was known for his unusual behavior and teaching style. Hence, it is no wonder that he is associated with an event that breaks the usual prohibition on displaying such powers. Here is the account from Irmgard Schloegl's \"The Zen Teaching of Rinzai.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give him a robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The master [Linji] made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to him: \"There, I had this robe made for you.\" Fuke shouldered the coffin, and went back to the street market, calling loudly: \"Rinzai had this robe made for me! I am off to the East Gate to enter transformation\" (to die).\" The people of the market crowded after him, eager to look. Fuke said: \"No, not today. Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation.\" And so for three days. Nobody believed it any longer. On the fourth day, and now without any spectators, Fuke went alone outside the city walls, and laid himself into the coffin. He asked a traveler who chanced by to nail down the lid.\nThe news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell.\nChristianity.\nIn Christianity, resurrection most importantly concerns the resurrection of Jesus but also includes the resurrection of Judgment Day, known as the resurrection of the dead by those Christians who subscribe to the Nicene Creed (which is the majority of mainstream Christianity), as well as the resurrection miracles done by Jesus and the prophets of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible).\nResurrection miracles.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus is said to have raised several persons from death. These resurrections included the daughter of Jairus shortly after death, a young man in the midst of his own funeral procession, and Lazarus of Bethany, who had been buried for four days.\nDuring the Ministry of Jesus on earth, before his death, Jesus commissioned his Twelve Apostles to, among other things, raise the dead.\nSimilar resurrections are credited to the apostles and Catholic saints. In the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Peter raised a woman named Dorcas (also called Tabitha), and Paul the Apostle revived a man named Eutychus who had fallen asleep and fell from a window to his death. According to the Gospel of Matthew, after Jesus's resurrection, many of those previously dead came out of their tombs and entered Jerusalem, where they appeared to many. Following the Apostolic Age, many saints were said to resurrect the dead, as recorded in Orthodox Christian hagiographies. St. Columba supposedly raised a boy from the dead in the land of Picts and St. Nicholas is said to have resurrected pickled children from a brine barrel during a famine by making the sign of the cross.\nResurrection of Jesus.\nChristians regard the resurrection of Jesus as the central doctrine in Christianity. Others take the incarnation of Jesus to be more central; however, it is the miracles\u00a0\u2013 and particularly his resurrection\u00a0\u2013 which provide validation of his incarnation. According to Paul the Apostle, the entire Christian faith hinges upon the centrality of the resurrection of Jesus and the hope for life after death. Paul wrote in his first letter to the Corinthians:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.\nResurrection of the dead.\nChristianity started as a religious movement within 1st-century Judaism (late Second Temple Judaism), and it retains what the New Testament itself claims was the Pharisaic belief in the afterlife and resurrection of the dead. Whereas this belief was only one of many beliefs held about the world to come in Second Temple Judaism, it was notably rejected by the Sadducees but accepted by the Pharisees (Acts 23:6\u20138). Belief in the resurrection became dominant within Early Christianity, and already in the Gospels of Luke and John included an insistence on the resurrection of the flesh. Most modern Christian churches continue to uphold the belief that there will be a final resurrection of the dead and world to come.\nBelief in the resurrection of the dead, and Jesus's role as judge, is codified in the Apostles' Creed, the fundamental creed of Christian baptismal faith. The Book of Revelation also makes many references about the Judgment Day, when the dead will be raised.\nHinduism.\nThere are folklore, stories, and extractions from Hindu holy texts that refer to resurrections. One major legend is that of Savitri saving her husband's life from Yamraj. In the Ramayana, after Ravana was slain by Rama in a great battle between good and evil, Rama requests the king of Devas, Indra, to restore the lives of all the monkeys who died in the great battle Mahavatar Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya are also believed to have resurrected themselves.\nIslam.\nBelief in the Day of Resurrection (\"yawm al-qiy\u0101mah\") is also crucial for Muslims. They believe the time of \"Qiy\u0101mah\" is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and tribulations preceding and during the \"Qiy\u0101mah\" are described in the Quran and the hadith, and also in the commentaries of scholars. The Quran emphasizes bodily resurrection, a break from the pre-Islamic Arabian understanding of death.\nAccording to Nasir Khusraw (d. after 1070), an Ismaili thinker of the Fatimid era, the Resurrection (\"Qiy\u0101ma\") will be ushered by the Lord of the Resurrection (\"Q\u0101\u02beim al-Qiy\u0101ma\"), an individual symbolizing the purpose and pinnacle of creation from among the progeny of Muhammad and his Imams. Through this individual, the world will come out of darkness and ignorance and \"into the light of her Lord\" (Quran 39:69). His era, unlike that of the enunciators of the divine revelation (\"n\u0101\u1e6diqs\") before him, is not one where God prescribes the people to work but instead one where God rewards them. Preceding the Lord of the Resurrection (\"Q\u0101\u02beim\") is his proof (\"\u1e25ujjat\"). The Qur'anic verse stating that \"the night of power (\"laylat al-qadr\") is better than a thousand months\" (Quran 97:3) is said to refer to this proof, whose knowledge is superior to that of a thousand Imams, though their rank, collectively, is one. Hakim Nasir also recognizes the successors of the Lord of the Resurrection to be his deputies (\"khulaf\u0101\u02be\").\nDescription of the occurrence of the incidence of the day of Judgement appeared at many places in the holy Quran and believing in the occurrence and coming of that Day is among the Six Pillars of Faith. Allah SWT made a wise and prudent question on those who doubt the resurrection of the dead in Suratul Qiyamah; verse 3-4 by saying \"Does the human thinks that We shall not gather his bones (and bring him back to life) - Nay, (We) are capable of regenerating his fingertip\".\nJudaism.\nThere are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:\nAccording to Herbert C. Brichto, writing in Reform Judaism's \"Hebrew Union College Annual\", the family tomb is the central concept in understanding biblical views of the afterlife. Brichto states that it is \"not mere sentimental respect for the physical remains that is...the motivation for the practice, but rather an assumed connection between proper sepulture and the condition of happiness of the deceased in the afterlife\".\nAccording to Brichto, the early Israelites apparently believed that the graves of family, or tribe, united into one, and that this unified collectivity is to what the Biblical Hebrew term Sheol refers, the common grave of humans. Although not well defined in the Tanakh, Sheol in this view was a subterranean underworld where the souls of the dead went after the body died. The Babylonians had a similar underworld called Aralu, and the ancient Greeks had one known as Hades. According to Brichto, other biblical names for Sheol were Abaddon \"ruin\", found in Psalm 88:11, Job 28:22 and Proverbs 15:11; Bor \"pit\", found in Isaiah 14:15, 24:22, Ezekiel 26:20; and Shakhat \"corruption\", found in Isaiah 38:17, Ezekiel 28:8.\nDuring the Second Temple period, there developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through re-creation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical Book of Enoch, 2 Baruch, and 2 Esdras. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is \"little or no clear reference ... either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead\" in the texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls. C.D. Elledge, however, argues that some form of resurrection may be referred to in the Dead Sea texts 4Q521, Pseudo-Ezekiel, and 4QInstruction. Too, there is the Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones in the Book of Ezekiel, and the Book of Daniel, which mentions resurrection. As Professor Devorah Dimant notes on \"TheTorah.com\", \"Originally an allegorical vision about the future return of Judeans to their land, Ezekiel's vision (ch. 37) becomes one of the cornerstones for the Jewish belief in the resurrection of the dead. ... The only biblical passage that \"unambiguously\" refers to resurrection is found in the final chapter of the book of Daniel[.]\" \nBoth Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife, but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will \"pass into other bodies,\" while \"the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.\" Paul the Apostle, who also was a Pharisee, said that at the resurrection what is \"sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body.\" The Book of Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.\nPhilosophy.\nAnastasis or Ana-stasis is a concept in contemporary philosophy emerging from the works of Jean-Luc Nancy, Divya Dwivedi and Shaj Mohan. Nancy developed the concept through his interpretation of paintings depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Dwivedi and Mohan, referring to Nancy, defined Ana-stasis as coming over stasis, which is a method for philosophy to overcome its end as Martin Heidegger defined. This concept is noted to be linked in the works of Nancy, Dwivedi and Mohan to have a relation to Heidegger's https://. Kohan and Dwivdei that this \"overcoming\" would construct a new dimension in philosophy.\nJohn Hick argues that the \"replica theory\" makes the religious doctrine of bodily resurrection somewhat plausible. For example, if a man disappears or dies in London and an exact \"replica\" suddenly re-appears in New York, both entities should be regarded as the same, especially if they share physical and psychological characteristics. Hick extends this theory to parallel universes, which occupy a different space to our own. He also distinguishes the theory from reincarnation, where a person lives in several successive bodies.\nOther scholars reivse the replica theory with the \"counterpart theory\", where it is believed that God creates a resurrection counterpart to one's current body, which is new and improved. Although it is defined by one's soul and history, it is not identical to the current body, which remains destroyed after death. A useful analogy is to imagine a soul as a programme, a body as a computer and the \"series of states\" that a soul undergoes as a person's biography. They believe the theory has precedent in scriptures like the New Testament. In addition, it incentivizes people to care about their future.\nTechnological resurrection.\nCryonics.\nCryonics is the low-temperature freezing (usually at ) of a human corpse or severed head, with the hope that resurrection may be possible in the future. Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community. It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience, and has been characterized as quackery.\nDigital ghosts.\nIn his 1988 book \"Mind Children\", roboticist Hans Moravec proposed that a future supercomputer might be able to resurrect long-dead minds from the information that still survived. For example, such can include information in the form of memories, filmstrips, social media interactions, modeled personality traits, personal favourite things,&lt;ref name=\"10.1007/s42438-018-0007-6\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; personal notes and tasks, medical records, and genetic information.\nRay Kurzweil, American inventor and futurist, believes that when his concept of singularity comes to pass, it will be possible to resurrect the dead by digital recreation. Such is one approach in the concept of digital immortality, which could be described as resurrecting deceased as \"digital ghosts\" or \"digital avatars\". In the context of knowledge management, \"virtual persona\" could \"aid in knowledge capture, retention, distribution, access and use\" and continue to learn. Issues include post-mortem privacy, and potential use of personalised digital twins and associated systems by big data firms and advertisers.\nRelated alternative approaches of digital immortality include gradually \"replacing\" neurons in the brain with advanced medical technology (such as nanobiotechnology) as a form of mind uploading (see also: wetware computer).\nDe-extinction.\nDe-extinction, enabling an organism that either resembles or is an extinct species, is also known as \"resurrection biology\" and often described as working on \"resurrecting\" dead species.\nMedical resuscitation.\nModern medicine can, in some cases, revive patients who \"died\" by some definitions of death, or were declared dead. However, under most definitions of death (brain death), this would mean that the patient wasn't truly dead.\nMost advanced versions of such capabilities may include a method/system under development reported in 2019, 'BrainEx', that could partially revive (pig) brains hours after death (to the degree of brain circulation and cellular functions). It showed that \"the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process and that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed\". A similar organ perfusion system under development, 'OrganEx', can restore \u2013 i.e. on the cellular level \u2013 multiple vital (pig) organs one hour after death (during which the body had prolonged warm ischaemia). It could be used to preserve donor organs but may also be developed to be useful for revival in medical emergencies by buying \"more time for doctors to treat people whose bodies were starved of oxygen, such as those who died from drowning or heart attacks\".\nThere is research into what happens during and after death as well as how and to what extent patients could be revived by the use of science and technology. For example, one study showed that in the hours after humans die, \"certain cells in the human brain are still active\". However, it is thought that at least \"without\" any life-support-like systems, death is permanent and irreversible after several hours \u2013 not days \u2013 even in cases when revival was still possible shortly after death.\nA 2010 study notes that physicians are determining death \"test only for the permanent cessation of circulation and respiration because they know that irreversible cessation follows rapidly and inevitably once circulation no longer will restore itself spontaneously and will not be restored medically\". Development of advanced live support measures \"including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and positive pressure ventilation (PPV)\" brought the interdependence of cessation of brain function and loss of respiration and circulation and \"the traditional definition of death into question\" and further developments upend more \"definitions of mortality\".\nHypothetical speculations without existing technologies.\nRussian cosmist Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov advocated resurrection of the dead using scientific methods. Fedorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research of the possibility of restoring life and making it infinite. His first project is connected with collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on \"knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world\". The second method described by Fedorov is genetic-hereditary. The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a genetic twin of the dead person. For the traditional definition of resurrection, a restoration of the deceased's personality, or their brain, would be necessary. Fedorov speculates about the idea of \"radial images\" that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fedorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, Man will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.\nIn his 1994 book \"The Physics of Immortality\", American physicist Frank J. Tipler, an expert on the general theory of relativity, presented his Omega Point Theory which outlines how a resurrection of the dead could take place at the end of the cosmos. He posits that humans will evolve into robots which will turn the entire cosmos into a supercomputer which will, shortly before the Big Crunch, perform the resurrection within its cyberspace, reconstructing formerly dead humans (from information captured by the supercomputer from the past light cone of the cosmos) as avatars within its metaverse.\nDavid Deutsch, British physicist and pioneer in the field of quantum computing, formerly agreed with Tipler's Omega Point cosmology and the idea of resurrecting deceased people with the help of quantum computers but he is critical of Tipler's theological views.\nItalian physicist and computer scientist Giulio Prisco presented the idea of \"quantum archaeology\", \"reconstructing the life, thoughts, memories, and feelings of any person in the past, up to any desired level of detail, and thus resurrecting the original person via 'copying to the future'\".\nIn their science fiction novel \"The Light of Other Days\", Sir Arthur Clarke and Stephen Baxter imagine a future civilization resurrecting the dead of past ages by reaching into the past, through micro wormholes and with nanorobots, to download full snapshots of brain states and memories.\nIn religions.\nBoth the Church of Perpetual Life and the Terasem Movement consider themselves transreligions and advocate for the use of technology to indefinitely extend the human lifespan.\nZombies.\nA zombie (Haitian French: \"\", ) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a human corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from Haitian folklore, where a \"zombie\" is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic.\nDisappearances (as distinct from resurrection).\nAs knowledge of different religions has grown, so have claims of bodily disappearance of some religious and mythological figures. In ancient Greek religion, this was a way the gods made some physically immortal, including such figures as Cleitus, Ganymede, Menelaus, and Tithonus. After his death, Cycnus was changed into a swan and vanished. In his chapter on Romulus from Parallel Lives, Plutarch criticises the continuous belief in such disappearances, referring to the allegedly miraculous disappearance of the historical figures Romulus, Cleomedes of Astypalaea, and Croesus. In ancient times, Greek and Roman pagan similarities were explained by the early Christian writers, such as Justin Martyr, as the work of demons, with the intention of leading Christians astray.\nIn the Buddhist Epic of King Gesar, also spelled as Geser or Kesar, at the end, chants on a mountain top and his clothes fall empty to the ground. The body of the first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev, is said to have disappeared and flowers left in place of his dead body.\nLord Raglan's Hero Pattern lists many religious figures whose bodies disappear, or have more than one sepulchre. B. Traven, author of \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", wrote that the Inca Virococha arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where he walked across the water and vanished. It has been thought that teachings regarding the purity and incorruptibility of the hero's human body are linked to this phenomenon. Perhaps, this is also to deter the practice of disturbing and collecting the hero's remains. They are safely protected if they have disappeared.\nThe first such case mentioned in the Bible is that of Enoch (son of Jared, great-grandfather of Noah, and father of Methuselah). Enoch is said to have lived a life where he \"walked with God\", after which \"he was not, for God took him\" (Genesis 5:1\u201318). In Deuteronomy (34:6) Moses is secretly buried. Elijah vanishes in a whirlwind 2 Kings (2:11). In the Synoptic Gospels, after hundreds of years these two earlier Biblical heroes suddenly reappear, and are reportedly seen walking with Jesus, then again vanish. In the Gospel of Luke, the last time Jesus is seen (24:51) he leaves his disciples by ascending into the sky. This ascension of Jesus was a \"disappearance\" of sorts as recorded by Luke but was after the physical resurrection occurring several days before.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

B. degree \"magna cum laude\" from Brown University in 1942, and then entered the University of Minnesota, receiving a Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1947. He joined the faculty at Minnesota upon receiving his Ph.D. and remained there one year. In 1948 he moved to the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, becoming a full professor in 1957. In 1962 he moved to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and in 1974 to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received appointment to an endowed professorship in 1990 and where he last taught.\nAchievements and awards.\nWorking with DuPont chemist Rudolph Pariser, Parr developed a method of computing approximate molecular orbitals for pi electron systems, published in 1953. Since an identical procedure was derived by John A. Pople the same year, it is generally referred to as the Pariser\u2013Parr\u2013Pople method or PPP method. The PPP method differed from existing structural chemistry thinking (which advocated \"maximum overlap principle\") by advancing the concept of \"zero differential overlap approximation\".\nBy 1978 Parr had realized that density functional theory (DFT) would be extremely useful in quantitative calculations of chemical and biological systems, especially those with high molecular weights. In 1988 Parr, Weitao Yang and Chengteh Lee produced an improved DFT method which could approximate the correlation energy of systems. The LYP (for Lee\u2013Yang\u2013Parr) functional theory is now one of the most cited papers in the chemical literature.\nIn 1963 Parr published \"Quantum Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure\", one of the first books to apply quantum theory to chemical systems.\nIn 1989 he and Yang published \"Density Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules\", now considered the basic textbook on DFT.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If the underlying field is the real numbers, the two are isometrically isomorphic; if the underlying field is the complex numbers, the two are isometrically anti-isomorphic. The (anti-) isomorphism is a particular natural isomorphism.\nPreliminaries and notation.\nLet formula_1 be a Hilbert space over a field formula_2 where formula_3 is either the real numbers formula_4 or the complex numbers formula_5 If formula_6 (resp. if formula_7) then formula_1 is called a complex Hilbert space (resp. a real Hilbert space). Every real Hilbert space can be extended to be a dense subset of a unique (up to bijective isometry) complex Hilbert space, called its complexification, which is why Hilbert spaces are often automatically assumed to be complex. Real and complex Hilbert spaces have in common many, but by no means all, properties and results/theorems. \nThis article is intended for both mathematicians and physicists and will describe the theorem for both. \nIn both mathematics and physics, if a Hilbert space is assumed to be real (that is, if formula_7) then this will usually be made clear. Often in mathematics, and especially in physics, unless indicated otherwise, \"Hilbert space\" is usually automatically assumed to mean \"complex Hilbert space.\" Depending on the author, in mathematics, \"Hilbert space\" usually means either (1) a complex Hilbert space, or (2) a real or complex Hilbert space. \nLinear and antilinear maps.\nBy definition, an antilinear map (also called a conjugate-linear map) formula_10 is a map between vector spaces that is additive:\nformula_11\nand antilinear (also called conjugate-linear or conjugate-homogeneous):\nformula_12\nwhere formula_13 is the conjugate of the complex number formula_14, given by formula_15.\nIn contrast, a map formula_10 is linear if it is additive and homogeneous: \nformula_17\nEvery constant formula_18 map is always both linear and antilinear. If formula_7 then the definitions of linear maps and antilinear maps are completely identical. A linear map from a Hilbert space into a Banach space (or more generally, from any Banach space into any topological vector space) is continuous if and only if it is bounded; the same is true of antilinear maps. The inverse of any antilinear (resp. linear) bijection is again an antilinear (resp. linear) bijection. The composition of two antilinear maps is a linear map. \nContinuous dual and anti-dual spaces\nA functional on formula_1 is a function formula_21 whose codomain is the underlying scalar field formula_22 \nDenote by formula_23 (resp. by formula_24 the set of all continuous linear (resp. continuous antilinear) functionals on formula_25 which is called the (continuous) dual space (resp. the (continuous) anti-dual space) of formula_26 \nIf formula_7 then linear functionals on formula_1 are the same as antilinear functionals and consequently, the same is true for such continuous maps: that is, formula_29 \nOne-to-one correspondence between linear and antilinear functionals\nGiven any functional formula_30 the conjugate of formula_31 is the functional \nformula_32\nThis assignment is most useful when formula_6 because if formula_7 then formula_35 and the assignment formula_36 reduces down to the identity map. \nThe assignment formula_36 defines an antilinear bijective correspondence from the set of \nall functionals (resp. all linear functionals, all continuous linear functionals formula_23) on formula_25 \nonto the set of \nall functionals (resp. all antilinear functionals, all continuous antilinear functionals formula_40) on formula_26\nMathematics vs. physics notations and definitions of inner product.\nThe Hilbert space formula_1 has an associated inner product formula_43 valued in formula_1's underlying scalar field formula_3 that is linear in one coordinate and antilinear in the other (as specified below).\nIf formula_1 is a complex Hilbert space (formula_6), then there is a crucial difference between the notations prevailing in mathematics versus physics, regarding which of the two variables is linear.\nHowever, for real Hilbert spaces (formula_7), the inner product is a symmetric map that is linear in each coordinate (bilinear), so there can be no such confusion. \nIn mathematics, the inner product on a Hilbert space formula_1 is often denoted by formula_50 or formula_51 while in physics, the bra\u2013ket notation formula_52 or formula_53 is typically used. In this article, these two notations will be related by the equality:\nformula_54These have the following properties:\nIn computations, one must consistently use either the mathematics notation formula_50, which is (linear, antilinear); or the physics notation formula_52, which is (antilinear | linear).\nCanonical norm and inner product on the dual space and anti-dual space.\nIf formula_57 then formula_58 is a non-negative real number and the map\nformula_59 \ndefines a canonical norm on formula_1 that makes formula_1 into a normed space. \nAs with all normed spaces, the (continuous) dual space formula_23 carries a canonical norm, called the dual norm, that is defined by\nformula_63 \nThe canonical norm on the (continuous) anti-dual space formula_64 denoted by formula_65 is defined by using this same equation: \nformula_66 \nThis canonical norm on formula_23 satisfies the parallelogram law, which means that the polarization identity can be used to define a canonical inner product on formula_68 which this article will denote by the notations \nformula_69 \nwhere this inner product turns formula_23 into a Hilbert space. There are now two ways of defining a norm on formula_71 the norm induced by this inner product (that is, the norm defined by formula_72) and the usual dual norm (defined as the supremum over the closed unit ball). These norms are the same; explicitly, this means that the following holds for every formula_73\nformula_74 \nAs will be described later, the Riesz representation theorem can be used to give an equivalent definition of the canonical norm and the canonical inner product on formula_75 \nThe same equations that were used above can also be used to define a norm and inner product on formula_1's anti-dual space formula_77 \nCanonical isometry between the dual and antidual\nThe complex conjugate formula_78 of a functional formula_79 which was defined above, satisfies \nformula_80\nfor every formula_81 and every formula_82 \nThis says exactly that the canonical antilinear bijection defined by\nformula_83\nas well as its inverse formula_84 are antilinear isometries and consequently also homeomorphisms. \nThe inner products on the dual space formula_23 and the anti-dual space formula_64 denoted respectively by formula_87 and formula_88 are related by\nformula_89\nand\nformula_90\nIf formula_7 then formula_92 and this canonical map formula_93 reduces down to the identity map.\nRiesz representation theorem.\nTwo vectors formula_94 and formula_95 are orthogonal if formula_96 which happens if and only if formula_97 for all scalars formula_98 The orthogonal complement of a subset formula_99 is \nformula_100\nwhich is always a closed vector subspace of formula_26 \nThe Hilbert projection theorem guarantees that for any nonempty closed convex subset formula_102 of a Hilbert space there exists a unique vector formula_103 such that formula_104 that is, formula_103 is the (unique) global minimum point of the function formula_106 defined by formula_107\nStatement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Riesz representation theorem\u2014\nLet formula_1 be a Hilbert space whose inner product formula_109 is linear in its first argument and antilinear in its second argument and let formula_110 be the corresponding physics notation. For every continuous linear functional formula_111 there exists a unique vector formula_112 called the such that\nformula_113\nImportantly for complex Hilbert spaces, formula_114 is always located in the antilinear coordinate of the inner product.\nFurthermore, the length of the representation vector is equal to the norm of the functional:\n&lt;math display=block&gt;\\left\\\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCorollary\u2014 The canonical map from formula_1 into its dual formula_23 is the injective antilinear operator isometry \nformula_117 has norm formula_118 and satisfies formula_119 \nformula_120\nIt can now be deduced that formula_121 is formula_122-dimensional when formula_123 \nLet formula_124 be any non-zero vector. Replacing formula_125 with formula_126 in the proof above shows that the vector formula_127 satisfies formula_128 for every formula_129 The uniqueness of the (non-zero) vector formula_114 representing formula_131 implies that formula_132 which in turn implies that formula_133 and formula_134 Thus every vector in formula_121 is a scalar multiple of formula_136 formula_120\nThe formulas for the inner products follow from the polarization identity. \nObservations.\nIf formula_138 then \nformula_139 \nSo in particular, formula_140 is always real and furthermore, formula_141 if and only if formula_142 if and only if formula_143 \nLinear functionals as affine hyperplanes\nA non-trivial continuous linear functional formula_131 is often interpreted geometrically by identifying it with the affine hyperplane formula_145 (the kernel formula_146 is also often visualized alongside formula_145 although knowing formula_148 is enough to reconstruct formula_149 because if formula_150 then formula_151 and otherwise formula_152). In particular, the norm of formula_131 should somehow be interpretable as the \"norm of the hyperplane formula_148\". When formula_155 then the Riesz representation theorem provides such an interpretation of formula_156 in terms of the affine hyperplane \nformula_145 as follows: using the notation from the theorem's statement, from formula_158 it follows that formula_159 and so formula_160 implies formula_161 and thus formula_162 \nThis can also be seen by applying the Hilbert projection theorem to formula_148 and concluding that the global minimum point of the map formula_164 defined by formula_165 is formula_166 \nThe formulas \nformula_167\nprovide the promised interpretation of the linear functional's norm formula_156 entirely in terms of its associated affine hyperplane formula_169 (because with this formula, knowing only the set formula_148 is enough to describe the norm of its associated linear functional). Defining formula_171 the infimum formula \nformula_172\nwill also hold when formula_143 \nWhen the supremum is taken in formula_4 (as is typically assumed), then the supremum of the empty set is formula_175 but if the supremum is taken in the non-negative reals formula_176 (which is the image/range of the norm formula_177 when formula_178) then this supremum is instead formula_179 in which case the supremum formula formula_180 will also hold when formula_181 (although the atypical equality formula_182 is usually unexpected and so risks causing confusion).\nConstructions of the representing vector.\nUsing the notation from the theorem above, several ways of constructing formula_114 from formula_138 are now described. \nIf formula_181 then formula_186; in other words, \nformula_187\nThis special case of formula_181 is henceforth assumed to be known, which is why some of the constructions given below start by assuming formula_123 \nOrthogonal complement of kernel\nIf formula_155 then for any formula_191 \nformula_192\nIf formula_193 is a unit vector (meaning formula_118) then \nformula_195\n(this is true even if formula_181 because in this case formula_197). \nIf formula_198 is a unit vector satisfying the above condition then the same is true of formula_199 which is also a unit vector in formula_200 However, formula_201 so both these vectors result in the same formula_136\nOrthogonal projection onto kernel\nIf formula_203 is such that formula_204 and if formula_205 is the orthogonal projection of formula_94 onto formula_207 then\nformula_208\nOrthonormal basis\nGiven an orthonormal basis formula_209 of formula_1 and a continuous linear functional formula_111 the vector formula_212 can be constructed uniquely by \nformula_213 \nwhere all but at most countably many formula_214 will be equal to formula_18 and where the value of formula_114 does not actually depend on choice of orthonormal basis (that is, using any other orthonormal basis for formula_1 will result in the same vector). \nIf formula_218 is written as formula_219 then \nformula_220\nand\nformula_221\nIf the orthonormal basis formula_222 is a sequence then this becomes \nformula_223 \nand if formula_218 is written as formula_225 then \nformula_226\nExample in finite dimensions using matrix transformations.\nConsider the special case of formula_227 (where formula_228 is an integer) with the standard inner product \nformula_229 \nwhere formula_230 are represented as column matrices formula_231 and formula_232 with respect to the standard orthonormal basis formula_233 on formula_1 (here, formula_235 is formula_122 at its formula_237th coordinate and formula_18 everywhere else; as usual, formula_23 will now be associated with the dual basis) and where formula_240 denotes the conjugate transpose of formula_241 \nLet formula_138 be any linear functional and let formula_243 be the unique scalars such that \nformula_244 \nwhere it can be shown that formula_245 for all formula_246 \nThen the Riesz representation of formula_131 is the vector \nformula_248\nTo see why, identify every vector formula_249 in formula_1 with the column matrix \nformula_231 \nso that formula_114 is identified with formula_253 \nAs usual, also identify the linear functional formula_131 with its transformation matrix, which is the row matrix formula_255 so that formula_256 and the function formula_131 is the assignment formula_258 where the right hand side is matrix multiplication. Then for all formula_259\nformula_260\nwhich shows that formula_114 satisfies the defining condition of the Riesz representation of formula_262 \nThe bijective antilinear isometry formula_263 defined in the corollary to the Riesz representation theorem is the assignment that sends formula_264 to the linear functional formula_265 on formula_1 defined by \nformula_267 \nwhere under the identification of vectors in formula_1 with column matrices and vector in formula_23 with row matrices, formula_270 is just the assignment \nformula_271 \nAs described in the corollary, formula_270's inverse formula_273 is the antilinear isometry formula_274 which was just shown above to be: \nformula_275 \nwhere in terms of matrices, formula_276 is the assignment \nformula_277 \nThus in terms of matrices, each of formula_263 and formula_273 is just the operation of conjugate transposition formula_280 (although between different spaces of matrices: if formula_1 is identified with the space of all column (respectively, row) matrices then formula_23 is identified with the space of all row (respectively, column matrices). \nThis example used the standard inner product, which is the map formula_283 but if a different inner product is used, such as formula_284 where formula_285 is any Hermitian positive-definite matrix, or if a different orthonormal basis is used then the transformation matrices, and thus also the above formulas, will be different.\nRelationship with the associated real Hilbert space.\nAssume that formula_1 is a complex Hilbert space with inner product formula_287 \nWhen the Hilbert space formula_1 is reinterpreted as a real Hilbert space then it will be denoted by formula_289 where the (real) inner-product on formula_290 is the real part of formula_1's inner product; that is: \nformula_292 \nThe norm on formula_290 induced by formula_294 is equal to the original norm on formula_1 and the continuous dual space of formula_290 is the set of all real-valued bounded formula_4-linear functionals on formula_290 (see the article about the polarization identity for additional details about this relationship). \nLet formula_299 and formula_300 denote the real and imaginary parts of a linear functional formula_301 so that formula_302 \nThe formula expressing a linear functional in terms of its real part is\nformula_303\nwhere formula_304 for all formula_129 \nIt follows that formula_306 and that formula_307 if and only if formula_308 \nIt can also be shown that formula_309 where formula_310 and formula_311 are the usual operator norms. \nIn particular, a linear functional formula_312 is bounded if and only if its real part formula_313 is bounded. \nRepresenting a functional and its real part\nThe Riesz representation of a continuous linear function formula_131 on a complex Hilbert space is equal to the Riesz representation of its real part formula_315 on its associated real Hilbert space. \nExplicitly, let formula_138 and as above, let formula_317 be the Riesz representation of formula_131 obtained in formula_319 so it is the unique vector that satisfies formula_320 for all formula_321 \nThe real part of formula_131 is a continuous real linear functional on formula_290 and so the Riesz representation theorem may be applied to formula_324 and the associated real Hilbert space formula_325 to produce its Riesz representation, which will be denoted by formula_326 \nThat is, formula_327 is the unique vector in formula_290 that satisfies formula_329 for all formula_321 \nThe conclusion is formula_331 \nThis follows from the main theorem because formula_332 and if formula_203 then \nformula_334 \nand consequently, if formula_335 then formula_336 which shows that formula_337 \nMoreover, formula_338 being a real number implies that formula_339\nIn other words, in the theorem and constructions above, if formula_1 is replaced with its real Hilbert space counterpart formula_290 and if formula_131 is replaced with formula_315 then formula_344 This means that vector formula_114 obtained by using formula_325 and the real linear functional formula_315 is the equal to the vector obtained by using the origin complex Hilbert space formula_348 and original complex linear functional formula_131 (with identical norm values as well). \nFurthermore, if formula_155 then formula_114 is perpendicular to formula_352 with respect to formula_353 where the kernel of formula_131 is be a \"proper\" subspace of the kernel of its real part formula_355 Assume now that formula_123 \nThen formula_357 because formula_358 and formula_207 is a proper subset of formula_360 The vector subspace formula_149 has real codimension formula_122 in formula_363 while formula_352 has real codimension formula_122 in formula_289 and formula_367 That is, formula_114 is perpendicular to formula_352 with respect to formula_370\nCanonical injections into the dual and anti-dual.\nInduced linear map into anti-dual\nThe map defined by placing formula_95 into the linear coordinate of the inner product and letting the variable formula_372 vary over the antilinear coordinate results in an antilinear functional:\nformula_373\nThis map is an element of formula_64 which is the continuous anti-dual space of formula_26 \nThe canonical map from formula_1 into its anti-dual formula_40 is the linear operator \nformula_378\nwhich is also an injective isometry. \nThe Fundamental theorem of Hilbert spaces, which is related to Riesz representation theorem, states that this map is surjective (and thus bijective). Consequently, every antilinear functional on formula_1 can be written (uniquely) in this form. \nIf formula_93 is the canonical antilinear bijective isometry formula_36 that was defined above, then the following equality holds:\nformula_382\nExtending the bra\u2013ket notation to bras and kets.\nLet formula_383 be a Hilbert space and as before, let formula_384 \nLet \nformula_385\nwhich is a bijective antilinear isometry that satisfies\nformula_386\nBras\nGiven a vector formula_387 let formula_388 denote the continuous linear functional formula_389; that is, \nformula_390 \nso that this functional formula_388 is defined by formula_392 This map was denoted by formula_393 earlier in this article. \nThe assignment formula_394 is just the isometric antilinear isomorphism formula_395 which is why formula_396 holds for all formula_397 and all scalars formula_398 \nThe result of plugging some given formula_399 into the functional formula_388 is the scalar formula_401 which may be denoted by formula_402 \nBra of a linear functional\nGiven a continuous linear functional formula_403 let formula_404 denote the vector formula_405; that is, \nformula_406 \nThe assignment formula_407 is just the isometric antilinear isomorphism formula_408 which is why formula_409 holds for all formula_410 and all scalars formula_398 \nThe defining condition of the vector formula_412 is the technically correct but unsightly equality\nformula_413\nwhich is why the notation formula_414 is used in place of formula_415 With this notation, the defining condition becomes\nformula_416\nKets\nFor any given vector formula_417 the notation formula_418 is used to denote formula_419; that is, \nformula_420 \nThe assignment formula_421 is just the identity map formula_422 which is why formula_423 holds for all formula_397 and all scalars formula_398 \nThe notation formula_426 and formula_427 is used in place of formula_428 and formula_429 respectively. As expected, formula_430 and formula_431 really is just the scalar formula_432\nAdjoints and transposes.\nLet formula_433 be a continuous linear operator between Hilbert spaces formula_434 and formula_435 As before, let formula_436 and formula_437 \nDenote by\nformula_438\nthe usual bijective antilinear isometries that satisfy:\nformula_439\nDefinition of the adjoint.\nFor every formula_440 the scalar-valued map formula_441 on formula_1 defined by \nformula_443 \nis a continuous linear functional on formula_1 and so by the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique vector in formula_25 denoted by formula_446 such that formula_447 or equivalently, such that \nformula_448 \nThe assignment formula_449 thus induces a function formula_450 called the adjoint of formula_433 whose defining condition is \nformula_452 \nThe adjoint formula_450 is necessarily a continuous (equivalently, a bounded) linear operator. \nIf formula_1 is finite dimensional with the standard inner product and if formula_285 is the transformation matrix of formula_148 with respect to the standard orthonormal basis then formula_285's conjugate transpose formula_458 is the transformation matrix of the adjoint formula_459 \nAdjoints are transposes.\nIt is also possible to define the transpose or algebraic adjoint of formula_460 which is the map formula_461 defined by sending a continuous linear functionals formula_462 to \nformula_463 \nwhere the composition formula_464 is always a continuous linear functional on formula_1 and it satisfies formula_466 (this is true more generally, when formula_1 and formula_468 are merely normed spaces). \nSo for example, if formula_469 then formula_470 sends the continuous linear functional formula_471 (defined on formula_468 by formula_473) to the continuous linear functional formula_474 (defined on formula_1 by formula_476); \nusing bra-ket notation, this can be written as formula_477 where the juxtaposition of formula_478 with formula_148 on the right hand side denotes function composition: formula_480 \nThe adjoint formula_450 is actually just to the transpose formula_461 when the Riesz representation theorem is used to identify formula_468 with formula_484 and formula_1 with formula_75 \nExplicitly, the relationship between the adjoint and transpose is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhich can be rewritten as:\nformula_487\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\nTo show that formula_488 fix formula_489 \nThe definition of formula_470 implies formula_491 so it remains to show that formula_492 If formula_372 then formula_494 as desired. formula_120\nAlternatively, the value of the left and right hand sides of (Adjoint-transpose) at any given formula_469 can be rewritten in terms of the inner products as: \nformula_497\nso that formula_498 holds if and only if formula_499 holds; but the equality on the right holds by definition of formula_500 \nThe defining condition of formula_501 can also be written\nformula_502 \nif bra-ket notation is used.\nDescriptions of self-adjoint, normal, and unitary operators.\nAssume formula_503 and let formula_504 \nLet formula_505 be a continuous (that is, bounded) linear operator. \nWhether or not formula_505 is self-adjoint, normal, or unitary depends entirely on whether or not formula_148 satisfies certain defining conditions related to its adjoint, which was shown by (Adjoint-transpose) to essentially be just the transpose formula_508 \nBecause the transpose of formula_148 is a map between continuous linear functionals, these defining conditions can consequently be re-expressed entirely in terms of linear functionals, as the remainder of subsection will now describe in detail. \nThe linear functionals that are involved are the simplest possible continuous linear functionals on formula_1 that can be defined entirely in terms of formula_511 the inner product formula_512 on formula_25 and some given vector formula_129 \nSpecifically, these are formula_515 and formula_516 where \nformula_517 \nSelf-adjoint operators\nA continuous linear operator formula_505 is called self-adjoint if it is equal to its own adjoint; that is, if formula_519 Using (Adjoint-transpose), this happens if and only if:\nformula_520\nwhere this equality can be rewritten in the following two equivalent forms:\nformula_521\nUnraveling notation and definitions produces the following characterization of self-adjoint operators in terms of the aforementioned continuous linear functionals: formula_148 is self-adjoint if and only if for all formula_523 the linear functional formula_524 is equal to the linear functional formula_525; that is, if and only if\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere if bra-ket notation is used, this is\nformula_526 \nNormal operators\nA continuous linear operator formula_505 is called normal if formula_528 which happens if and only if for all formula_529 \nformula_530 \nUsing (Adjoint-transpose) and unraveling notation and definitions produces the following characterization of normal operators in terms of inner products of continuous linear functionals: formula_148 is a normal operator if and only if \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere the left hand side is also equal to formula_532 \nThe left hand side of this characterization involves \"only\" linear functionals of the form formula_533 while the right hand side involves \"only\" linear functions of the form formula_534 (defined as above). \nSo in plain English, characterization (Normality functionals) says that an operator is \"normal\" when the inner product of any two linear functions of the first form is equal to the inner product of their second form (using the same vectors formula_535 for both forms).\nIn other words, if it happens to be the case (and when formula_148 is injective or self-adjoint, it is) that the assignment of linear functionals formula_537 is well-defined (or alternatively, if formula_538 is well-defined) where formula_539 ranges over formula_25 then formula_148 is a normal operator if and only if this assignment preserves the inner product on formula_75 \nThe fact that every self-adjoint bounded linear operator is normal follows readily by direct substitution of formula_543 into either side of formula_544 \nThis same fact also follows immediately from the direct substitution of the equalities (Self-adjointness functionals) into either side of (Normality functionals). \nAlternatively, for a complex Hilbert space, the continuous linear operator formula_148 is a normal operator if and only if formula_546 for every formula_523 which happens if and only if \nformula_548\nUnitary operators\nAn invertible bounded linear operator formula_505 is said to be unitary if its inverse is its adjoint: formula_550 \nBy using (Adjoint-transpose), this is seen to be equivalent to formula_551 \nUnraveling notation and definitions, it follows that formula_148 is unitary if and only if \nformula_553\nThe fact that a bounded invertible linear operator formula_505 is unitary if and only if formula_555 (or equivalently, formula_556) produces another (well-known) characterization: an invertible bounded linear map formula_148 is unitary if and only if\nformula_558\nBecause formula_505 is invertible (and so in particular a bijection), this is also true of the transpose formula_508 This fact also allows the vector formula_561 in the above characterizations to be replaced with formula_562 or formula_563 thereby producing many more equalities. Similarly, formula_564 can be replaced with formula_565 or formula_566\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProofs\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the 1940s he opened an Animation Studio in Venice in which he produced his first works: some commercials, a short titled \"E poi venne il diluvio\" and another one titled \"La piccola fiammiferaia\" (1953, based on Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Match Girl\"), distributed in Italy together with Robert Aldrich's \"Attack!\" (1956).\nRight after that he stopped working in animation for a while and dedicated wholly to creating Disney comics. When in 1956 Italian editors had no more new Floyd Gottfredson's stories to reprint, he was given the responsibility to continue Gottfredson's stories about Mickey Mouse. Also influenced by Carl Barks in the late 1950s and up to about 1963 he wrote and penciled stories like \"Topolino e la collana Chirikawa\" (1960) or \"The Flying Scot\" (1957) that have, later, been translated in many different languages throughout the world. Many of these stories have their backgrounds in movies, for example \"Topolino nel favoloso regno di Shan Grill\u00e0\" (1961) is based upon Frank Capra's \"Lost Horizon\" (1937); not to talk about all the stories starring Snow White or the Seven Dwarfs, obviously based on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937). Sometimes the exact opposite happened; the Italian movie \"Riusciranno i nostri eroi a ritrovare l'amico misteriosamente scomparso in Africa?\" (1968) is based on Scarpa's story \"Topolino e il Pippotarzan\" (1957).\nAround 1963, Scarpa stopped writing for 6 or 7 years. In the 1970s, he moved to Spain and started working for a different publisher. Among the last things he made while he was still in Italy, at the end of the 1980s and at beginning of the 1990s, there are the so-called \"Paperolimpiadi\" (a long story about the 1988 Seoul Olympic games) and some strip stories, the same kind of stories that he loved when he was a child. One of these, \"Topolino e l'enigma di Brigaboom\" (1989) was partially based on \"Brigadoon\" (1954).\nIn the meanwhile he has had time enough for some more animation, so we have \"Aihnoo degli Icebergs\" (1972), \"The Fourth King\" (1977) and a new TV series, \"The Adventures of Marco and Gina\" (\"Sopra i tetti di Venezia\") (2001).\nScarpa mainly worked on Disney comics, but he was also able to work on non-Disney material once in a while, so he did one (Rolf Kauka's) \"Lupo\" story and one (Hanna and Barbera's) \"Yogi Bear\" story. In the 1950s he also drew some \"Angelino\" stories, and Italian character.\nSince 1988 some of his comic stories have been published in the US by Gladstone Publishing; it was the first time that this happened to an Italian Disney author. Later, when Disney Comics took Gladstone's place; they published some more of his stories, and in 2003, the same happened with Gemstone Publishing. He has influenced many younger creators (Giorgio Cavazzano was his inker during the Sixties) and many have attempted to imitate his style.\nDisney characters created by Romano Scarpa.\nIn his career Scarpa created many Disney characters that are now accepted by some as part of the Disney Universe. Those include, but are not limited to:\nReprints.\nIn 2017 Fantagraphics Books published a collection containing four stories of Scarpa's Snow White comics, titled \"The Return of Snow-White and the Seven Dwarfs\", .\nIn 2018 Fantagraphics Books began publishing a hardcover series titled \"Disney Masters\", in which Romano Scarpa has to date (December 2024) had five volumes dedicated to his Disney works.\nIndex of comics books published in the United States.\nThis is an index of all Romano Scarpa comics published in the US.

She is best known for her refusal to move from her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in defiance of Jim Crow racial segregation laws, in 1955, which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. She is sometimes known as the \"mother of the civil rights movement\".\nBorn in Tuskegee, Alabama, Parks grew up under Jim Crow segregation. She later moved to Montgomery and joined the city's chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1943, serving as the organization's secretary. Despite policies designed to disenfranchise Black citizens, Parks successfully registered to vote after three separate attempts between 1943 and 1945. She investigated cases and organized campaigns around cases of racial and sexual violence in her capacity as NAACP secretary, including those of Recy Taylor and Jeremiah Reeves, laying the groundwork for future civil rights campaigns.\nCustom in Montgomery required Black passengers to surrender their seats in the front of the bus to accommodate white riders. The rows in the back were designated for Black riders. Prior to Parks's refusal to move, several Black Montgomerians had refused to do so, leading to arrests. When Parks was arrested in 1955, local leaders were searching for a person who would be a good legal test case against segregation. She was deemed a suitable candidate, and the Women's Political Council (WPC) organized a one-day bus boycott on the day of her trial. The boycott was widespread. Many Black Montgomerians refused to ride the buses that day. After Parks was found guilty of violating state law, the boycott was extended indefinitely, the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) organizing its own community transportation network to sustain it. Parks and other boycott leaders faced harassment, ostracization, and legal obstacles. The boycott lasted for 381 days, finally concluding after segregation on buses was deemed unconstitutional in the court case \"Browder v. Gayle\".\nParks faced both financial hardship and health problems as a result of her participation in the boycott, and in 1957, she relocated to Detroit, Michigan. She continued to advocate for civil rights, providing support for individuals such as John Conyers, Joanne Little, Gary Tyler, Angela Davis, Joe Madison, and Nelson Mandela. She was also a supporter of the Black power movement and an anti-apartheid activist, participating in protests and conferences as part of the Free South Africa Movement. In 1987, she co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development with Elaine Eason Steele. After Parks's death in 2005, she was honored with public viewings and memorial services in three cities: in Montgomery; in Washington, D.C., where she lay in state at the United States Capitol rotunda; and in Detroit, where she was ultimately interred at Woodlawn Cemetery. Parks received many awards and honors, both throughout her life and posthumously. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a Congressional Gold Medal, and was also the first Black American to be memorialized in the National Statuary Hall.\nEarly life.\nRosa Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. Her mother, Leona (n\u00e9e\u00a0Edwards), was a teacher from Pine Level, Alabama. Her father, James McCauley, was a carpenter and mason from Abbeville, Alabama. Her name was a portmanteau of her maternal and paternal grandmothers' names: Rose and Louisa. In addition to her African ancestry, one of her great-grandfathers was of Scotch-Irish descent, and one of her great-grandmothers was of partial Native American ancestry. Her maternal grandfather, Sylvester Edwards, was the child of an enslaved woman and a plantation owner's son.\nWhen she was an infant, Parks moved from Tuskegee to live with her father's family in Abbeville. When Parks and her parents arrived, the house became too crowded, and Parks's father was seldom home because of the itinerant nature of his job. As a result, Parks's mother left Abbeville with her, and the two relocated to Pine Level to live with Parks's mother's family. In Pine Level, Parks attended the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, a century-old independent Black denomination founded by free Blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early nineteenth century. Baptized at age two, she remained a member of the church throughout her life. Her mother worked as a teacher in the nearby community of Spring Hill, where she lived during the week. While her mother was away, Parks lived with her grandparents on their family farm, where they grew fruit, pecan, and walnut trees and raised chickens and cows. At the age of six or seven, she began working on the plantation of Moses Hudson, who paid Black children 50 cents a day to pick cotton. Parks also learned quilting and sewing from her mother, completing her first quilt at the age of 10 and her first dress at 11. \nGrowing up in Alabama, Parks faced a society characterized by racial segregation and violence. Alabama and other southern states began implementing segregationist policies during the 1870s and 1880s, shortly after the end of the American Civil War in 1865, culminating in a 1901 state constitutional convention that formally codified Jim Crow segregation into law. This system enforced racial separation in nearly all aspects of life, including financial institutions, healthcare, religious facilities, burial grounds, and public transportation. Acts of racist violence were also widespread, with the Ku Klux Klan intensifying its activity both in Pine Level and across the United States after the end of World War I. Parks later recalled that she \"heard of a lot of black people being found dead\" under mysterious circumstances during her childhood.\nParks initially attended a one-room schoolhouse at the local Mount Zion AME church. When she was eleven or twelve, she began attending the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls, where she received vocational training. After the school closed in 1928, she transferred to Booker T. Washington Junior High School. She then attended a laboratory school set up by the Alabama State Teachers College for Negroes, but dropped out to care for her ailing grandmother and mother.\nAfter leaving school, Parks worked on her family's farm and as a domestic worker in white households. Black women in Alabama who worked as domestic workers often experienced sexual violence. During the 1950s or 60s, Parks wrote an account of an incident where a white man named \"Mr. Charlie\" attempted to sexually assault her. In her account, she claims that she verbally resisted Mr. Charlie's advances and denounced his racism. The account concludes with her attempting to ignore him while reading a newspaper. Though the account may have been partially or entirely fictionalized, biographer Jeanne Theoharis notes that many of the elements of the account \"correspond to Parks's life\", speculating that Parks \"wrote [the account] as an allegory to suggest larger themes of domination and resistance\", or that, \"given that more than twenty-five years had passed before she wrote [the account] down, she augmented what she said to Charlie that evening with all the points that she had wished to make as she resisted his advances\".\nIn 1931, when she was 18, Rosa was introduced to her future husband, Raymond Parks, by a mutual friend. He was 28. She was initially \"[not] very interested in him\" because of \"some unhappy romantic experiences\" and because of his light skin. Raymond eventually persuaded Parks to ride with him in his car. At the time, automobile ownership was rare among Black men in Alabama. Parks described Raymond as the \"first real activist\" she had met, admiring his opposition to racial prejudice. The two married on December 18, 1932, at Rosa's mother's house. Soon after, they moved to a rooming house in the Centennial Hill neighborhood of Montgomery.\nEarly activism.\nAfter their marriage, Rosa and Raymond became involved in the Scottsboro Boys case, concerning a group of nine Black youths falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Paint Rock, Alabama. The nine faced trial in Scottsboro, Alabama, where they were sentenced to death by electrocution. To raise support for their defense, Rosa and Raymond hosted fundraising meetings and gatherings for Scottsboro legal defenders at their house. According to historian Robin Kelley, the couple also attended meetings of the Communist Party USA, which helped bring attention to the Scottsboro Boys case.\nIn 1933, Parks completed her high school education with encouragement from Raymond. At the time in Alabama, only 7% of Black people held a high school diploma. Subsequently, she worked as a nurse's aide at St. Margaret's Hospital, sewing to supplement her income. In 1941, she began working at Maxwell Air Force Base, a training facility for air force cadets. The base was fully integrated, and Parks was able to take public transit alongside her white coworkers on-base. However, when she returned home, she was required to use segregated buses, which frustrated her. According to Parks, her time at Maxwell \"opened her eyes up\", providing an \"alternative reality to the ugly racial policies of Jim Crow\".\nParks began attending meetings of the Montgomery chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1943 after seeing a picture of a former classmate of hers, Johnnie Carr, at a meeting. In December 1943, she was elected secretary of the chapter. Parks later explained that she accepted the role (which was considered a woman's position at the time) because \"I was the only woman there, and they needed a secretary, and I was too timid to say no\". She and Raymond were also members of the Voter's League, a local organization focused on increasing Black voter registration. There were several obstacles preventing Black people from registering to vote in Alabama during this period, including poll taxes, literacy tests, intrusive questions on voter registration applications, and retaliation by employers. As of 1940, less than 0.1% of Black Montgomerians were registered to vote. Encouraged by NAACP activist E. D. Nixon, Parks attempted to register three times beginning in 1943, finally succeeding in 1945.\nIn her capacity as secretary, Parks began investigating the gang rape of Recy Taylor, a Black woman from Abbeville, in 1944. After a grand jury declined to indict the perpetrators, Parks and other civil rights activists organized \"The Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor\", launching \"the strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade\", according to \"The Chicago Defender\". The campaign, which received nationwide attention, put pressure on Governor Chauncey Sparks to take steps to prosecute Taylor's assailants. Sparks ultimately promised to investigate the case. The state failed to secure indictments for the assailants after a second grand jury hearing in 1945. Despite this, historian Danielle L. McGuire describes the movement for justice in the Recy Taylor case as \"the largest and best organized of many efforts to draw attention to the ruthless heart of the racial caste system\", claiming that it \"brought the building blocks of the Montgomery bus boycott together a decade earlier and kept them in place\". Parks also organized support for Jeremiah Reeves, who was accused of raping a white woman in 1952. Reeves was ultimately executed in 1957.\nBeginning in 1954, Parks began working as a seamstress for Clifford and Virginia Durr, a white couple. Politically liberal and opposed to segregation, the Durrs became her friends. They encouraged, and eventually helped sponsor, Parks to attend the Highlander Folk School, an activist training center in Monteagle, Tennessee, in the summer of 1955. There, Parks was mentored by the veteran organizer Septima Clark. Parks enjoyed her time at Highlander, where Black and white people worked, cooked, and lived together as equals. She later remembered it as one of the rare moments in her life when she felt no racial hostility and the first time in her adult life that she could envision a \"unified society\", describing how \"people of all races and backgrounds\" interacted harmoniously. In August 1955, she attended a Montgomery meeting concerning the lynching of Emmett Till. According to Theoharis, Parks was \"heartened by the attention that people managed to get to the [Till] case\", since the custom was to \"keep things covered up\".\nArrest and bus boycott.\nMontgomery buses: law and prevailing customs.\nMontgomery passed a city ordinance segregating streetcar passengers by race in 1900, before state-wide segregation was implemented. Montgomery's Black residents conducted boycotts against segregated streetcars between 1900 and 1902, coinciding with similar boycotts and protests in other southern cities. The boycotts resulted in an amendment to the city ordinance, which stipulated that \"no rider had to surrender a seat unless another was available\". However, many drivers failed to follow the ordinance. Altercations between bus drivers and Black passengers were frequent. According to historian Cheryl Phibbs, \"bus drivers were given policeman-like authority to determine where racial divisions were enforced\". They were also generally armed.\nBlack people constituted a majority of bus riders in Montgomery. According to the Women's Political Council, a Montgomery-based advocacy group, \"three-fourths of the riders\" on Montgomery buses were Black. Despite this, the front rows on each Montgomery bus were reserved for white passengers, while the back rows were designated for Black passengers. Segregation in the middle rows was enforced at the driver's discretion. Although city ordinances did not require patrons to give up their seats, bus drivers frequently demanded Black passengers do so to accommodate white riders. Furthermore, Black passengers were sometimes required to pay their fares at the front of the bus, then exit and re-board through the back door.\nIn 1943, bus driver James F. Blake confronted Parks when she tried to take her seat from the front of the bus, insisting that she re-board in the back. Parks refused, telling Blake that she was \"already on the bus and didn't see the need of getting off and getting back on when people were standing in the stepwell\". After Blake grabbed her sleeve, Parks moved to the front of the bus, sitting in one of the rows reserved for white passengers, where she dropped her purse. Blake told her to \"get off [his] bus\", appearing poised to assault her. Parks admonished Blake, saying that he \"better not hit [her]\". She then exited the bus without re-boarding. Following this encounter, she typically avoided riding on Blake's bus.\nRefusal to move.\nBefore December 1955, several people were arrested for declining to give up their seats on Montgomery buses. Maxwell Air Force Base employee Viola White was arrested in 1944, and Mary Wingfield was arrested in 1949. Teenager Mary Louise Smith was arrested in October 1954. In March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a fifteen-year-old student at Booker T. Washington Magnet High School, was also arrested. Other arrests included Aurelia Browder on April 29, 1955, and Susie McDonald on October 21, 1955. Smith, Colvin, Browder, and McDonald were the plaintiffs in the 1956 lawsuit \"Browder v. Gayle\". Many Black riders rallied around the idea of a boycott in the aftermath of Colvin's arrest. Black activists, including members of the WPC and NAACP, considered both Colvin and Smith as test cases for a community bus boycott. The WPC was particularly focused on bus integration, partly because it was an issue that significantly affected Black women. Both the WPC and NAACP ultimately determined that Colvin and Smith were not suitable candidates for such a test case.\nAt 5:00p.m. on December 1, 1955, Parks left work and purchased several items from Lee's Cut-Rate Drug before walking to Court Square to wait for her bus. She boarded the bus at around 5:30. Lost in thought, she did not notice that James F. Blake was the driver. Parks later stated that if she had noticed Blake, she would not have boarded. She paid her fare and went to sit in the middle section of the bus, next to a Black man and across from two Black women. Her chronic bursitis was causing her significant discomfort, particularly in her shoulders.\nAs the bus traveled along its regular route, all the white-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several white passengers boarded. One man was forced to stand. Blake then demanded that Black passengers in the middle row yield their seats. Those seated near Parks complied, but Parks remained seated. According to Parks: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I felt that, if I did stand up, it meant that I approved of the way I was being treated, and I did not approve.\nWhen Blake asked if she intended to stand, Parks refused. Blake threatened her with arrest, to which Parks responded: \"You may do that.\" She considered physically resisting, but decided against it, as she \"didn't have any way of fighting back\". Blake then left the bus and called his supervisor from a nearby payphone. His supervisor advised him to call the police. Two officers arrived on the scene, and, at the insistence of Blake, arrested Parks for violating the Montgomery municipal code.\nAccording to biographer Douglas G. Brinkley, Parks's refusal to move was not premeditated. Parks's former classmate, Mary Fair Burks, also clarified that Parks was not acting on behalf of the NAACP, as she \"would have done so openly and demanded a group action on the part of the organization\". Parks said of her refusal to move: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people have an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.\nAfter her arrest, Parks was taken to Montgomery city hall, where she filled out her arrest forms. She was then taken to the city jail, where she was fingerprinted and photographed. After repeated requests, she was granted permission to call home, notifying her mother of her arrest and asking for Raymond to come. E. D. Nixon was also informed of Parks's arrest who then drove down to the jail with Clifford and Virginia Durr and paid Parks's bail.\nMontgomery bus boycott.\nAfter Parks's arrest, Nixon conferred with Clifford Durr about the possibility of adopting Parks's arrest as a test case. The two favored Parks because of her high standing in the Black community, her respectable manners, and her \"firm quiet spirit\", which, according to Durr, \"would be needed for the long battle ahead\". After being approached by Nixon to be a test case, Parks consulted with her family. Despite concerns about potential violent retaliation, she ultimately consented. Attorney Fred Gray agreed to represent Parks in court, and WPC president Jo Ann Robinson was notified of the case. The WPC began planning for a one-day boycott of Montgomery buses on December 5, 1955, the day of Parks's trial. Under the guise of grading exams, Robinson collaborated with two students at Alabama State College to produce 35,000 leaflets announcing the boycott using a mimeograph provided by the college's business chair, John Cannon.\nWPC members distributed the leaflets throughout the Black community, and Nixon enlisted the support of several members of the local Black clergy, including Martin Luther King Jr, who was the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. A planning meeting including members of the Black clergy was held at the church on December 2. While about half of the clergy in attendance left the meeting partway through, not wanting to be associated with politics, half stayed, and plans were drafted for alternative transportation during the boycott, including carpooling networks and collaboration with local taxi drivers. More leaflets were created at the meeting and, in the following days, were distributed by King and pastor Ralph Abernathy at bars and clubs. Many Black pastors announced the boycott in their churches on Sunday December 4. Extensive media coverage in the \"Montgomery Advertiser\" and on local television and radio further publicized the boycott.\nDespite attempts by Montgomery police officers to organize escorts for Black passengers, who they thought might fear retaliation from the Black community, bus ridership was low on the day of Parks's trial. Many Black residents walked or carpooled. The trial took place in the courtroom at Montgomery city hall, and almost 500 Black Montgomerians attended. Parks pleaded \"not guilty\" and, though she did not testify, two witnesses corroborated that there were seats available when she refused to move. The prosecution moved to indict Parks on state charges rather than municipal charges. The presiding judge permitted the change, and Parks was found guilty of violating state law. She was fined $10, plus $4 in court fees (). The trial took between five and thirty minutes. Gray immediately filed to appeal the ruling, while Nixon addressed the crowd assembled outside, urging them to remain nonviolent and vacate city hall.\nWhile Parks handled telephone communications at Gray's office, boycott organizers gathered at Mount Zion AME Zion Church that afternoon to discuss prolonging the boycott and plan a mass meeting at Holt Street Baptist Church scheduled for that evening. They formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) to oversee the boycott, electing King as leader. The evening meeting was attended by 15,000 people. Nixon and King both gave speeches, while Abernathy read the demands of the organizers to the crowd: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;# Courteous treatment on the buses;\nHe then asked them to stand if they supported a continued boycott. The crowd overwhelmingly did so. Parks, hailed by King as a \"heroine\", asked if she should address the crowd, who repeatedly called for her to speak. However, she was told by \"someone\" that she had \"said enough\" and did not speak that evening. The decision not to have Parks speak has been interpreted by some as reflecting gender inequalities in the civil rights movement. According to Theoharis, although Parks was celebrated as a heroine by the crowd at that moment, she was excluded from the movement's later strategic discussions.\nAt a December 6 press conference, King declared that the boycott would continue until all demands had been satisfied. At a meeting on December 8, city and bus company officials dismissed the MIA's demands. The MIA began developing a parallel transportation network for Black Montgomerians to support the boycott. Parks served temporarily as a dispatcher, coordinating transportation within the MIA's ride-sharing system. She was ostracized by her coworkers at Montgomery Fair, where she worked as a seamstress, and in January 1956, she was fired. A week later, Raymond was also fired from his job at Maxwell Air Force Base. That same month, Montgomery Police Commissioner Clyde Sellers initiated a \"Get Tough\" policy, harassing Black pedestrians and boycott participants. Boycott organizers, including Parks, received regular death threats. In February, a state grand jury declared the boycott illegal, indicting several of the boycott's leaders, including Parks, many of whom were arrested. Amid protests at the courthouse, the arrestees were released on bond. Ultimately, only King was tried after the indictment. The boycott continued.\nResponding to a plan by city officials to stall Parks's case in state circuit courts, Gray filed suit in federal court. Parks was initially included as a plaintiff in this case but was eventually removed to avoid federal dismissal on the grounds that her case was already being heard in Alabama's state court. In the end, the federal case (excluding Parks) was brought before the Supreme Court as \"Browder v. Gayle\", which ruled the statute mandating segregation of Montgomery buses unconstitutional. Later, before a district court, the Supreme Court's ruling was upheld. After rejecting appeals by the city of Montgomery and state of Alabama, the Supreme Court ordered the integration of Montgomery's buses on December 20, 1956. King called off the boycott that day, 381 days after it took effect.\nLater years.\nLate 1950s.\nAfter being fired from their jobs, Rosa and Raymond faced significant financial hardship, particularly after their landlord implemented a monthly rent increase of $10. In February 1956, King issued a memorandum requesting a $250-$300 disbursement for Parks from the MIA relief fund. The funds were authorized. Parks continued to struggle. She developed severe health problems, including chronic insomnia, stomach ulcers, and a heart condition. Despite this, she traveled throughout the year, including in March to Detroit, Michigan. While there, she visited her brother and addressed United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 600, in a departure from the mainstream NAACP, who opposed trade union affiliations.\nIn 1957, after the end of the boycott, Virginia Durr offered her a position at Highlander Folk School in hopes of organizing a Black voter registration campaign in Montgomery. Parks declined, citing the school's location in Tennessee and concerns about potential reprisals if she were to speak in Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana. She also disagreed with King and the emerging Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) regarding their impending airport desegregation campaign. Tensions between King and Nixon caused a rift in the MIA, with Parks taking Nixon's side. Tensions developed between Nixon and Parks as well, and her health further deteriorated. In August 1957, prompted by economic insecurity, threats to her safety, and divisions within the MIA leadership, she left Montgomery for Detroit, where her brother, Sylvester, and her cousins, Thomas Williamson and Annie Cruse, lived. The MIA, embarrassed by her decision to move, raised $500 for her as a \"going-away present\".\nUpon arriving in Detroit, Rosa, Raymond, and Rosa's mother lived with Rosa's cousin before renting an apartment on Euclid Avenue. For a brief period beginning in October 1957, Parks moved to Hampton, Virginia to work at a Holly Tree Inn as a hostess. She returned to Detroit in December. She and her family continued to struggle financially. They lost their apartment in 1959 and moved into a meeting hall for the Progressive Civic League (PCL), a local Black professional organization. Rosa managed the treasury at the PCL's credit union while Raymond served as the meeting hall's caretaker.\n1960s.\nIn early 1960, Parks's health further deteriorated, necessitating multiple surgeries. She and her family incurred significant debt due to unpaid medical bills. She received donations from the MIA and PCL, and the Black press began to write about her financial difficulties. In 1961, after her health improved and she found employment at Stockton Sewing Company, the family moved to Detroit's Virginia Park neighborhood. Raymond also secured employment at a local barber shop.\nThroughout the 1960s, Parks remained active in the civil rights movement. She was an honorary member of the SCLC, and periodically attended meetings, including the 1962 SCLC convention in Birmingham, Alabama. In August 1963, she traveled to Washington, D.C., to take part in the March on Washington. More than 250,000 people participated in the march, and Parks was honored alongside other prominent women in the civil rights struggle during the event's \"Tribute to Women\" segment. The march has been criticized for its lack of women's representation; no women were included in the delegation that was sent to meet with the Kennedy administration. Parks said of the event that it was \"a great occasion, but women were not allowed to play much of a role\".\nParks played a critical role in John Conyers's 1964 congressional campaign. She persuaded King, who was generally reluctant to endorse local candidates, to appear with Conyers, boosting the novice candidate's profile. When Conyers was elected, he hired her as a secretary and receptionist for his congressional office in Detroit. As part of her position, Parks engaged with Conyers's constituents, focusing on addressing socio-economic issues such as welfare, education, job discrimination, and affordable housing. Through regular visits to schools, hospitals, senior citizen facilities, and community gatherings, she ensured Conyers remained connected to grassroots concerns. Conyers later recalled of Parks that \"you treated her with deference because she was so quiet, so serene\u2014just a very special person\".\nParks attended the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, joined the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, and supported the Freedom Now Party. She was an admirer of Nation of Islam spokesman Malcolm X and \"armed self defense\" advocate Robert F. Williams, befriending Williams after his return from China, where he had been invited to visit by Chairman Mao Zedong. In a 1967 interview, she said that she \"[did not] believe in gradualism or that whatever should be done for the better should take forever to do\". In the wake of the 1967 Detroit riot, Parks spoke in support of rioters, comparing the \"burning and looting\" of the riot with her own actions during the Montgomery bus boycott. Later, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, she attended protests as part of the Memphis sanitation strike. She also took part in the Black power movement, attending the Philadelphia Black power conference in 1968.\n1970s.\nParks continued to support the Black power movement throughout the 1970s, attending the National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana in 1972. She also advocated for political prisoners, playing a key role in the establishment of the Detroit chapter of the Joanne Little Defense Committee. Little, who was incarcerated, was charged with killing her jailer, Clarence Alligood, while he was sexually assaulting her. After national outcry around her case, Little was acquitted in July 1975. Parks also organized on behalf of Gary Tyler, who was wrongfully convicted of shooting of a 13-year-old white boy while being attacked by a group of white segregationists. Tyler was ultimately freed in 2016, after 41 years in prison. Parks also advocated for the Wilmington 10 and Imari Obadele of the Republic of New Africa (RNA) and spoke in support of Angela Davis, introducing her to a crowd of 12,000 as a \"dear sister who has endured significant persecution\" after Davis's acquittal in the kidnapping and murder case of Judge Harold Haley.\nParks continued to experience health problems throughout the 1970s and was injured several times after falling on ice. She also experienced personal losses, with Raymond dying of throat cancer in 1977 and her brother Sylvester dying of stomach cancer soon after. These personal struggles caused her to gradually withdraw from the civil rights movement. She learned of the death of Fannie Lou Hamer, once a close friend, from a newspaper, lamenting that Hamer was \"dead quite before [she] knew of it\", and that \"no one mentioned it to [her]\". Without support from her husband and unable to afford a nurse, Parks relocated her elderly mother, first to a retirement facility, then to a senior living apartment, where they lived together until her mother's death in 1979.\nDuring the 1979/1980 academic year, Parks visited the Black Panther school in Oakland, California. As part of her visit, she attended a student play dramatizing her refusal to move in 1955, staying after to answer the students' questions. According to the school's director, Ericka Huggins, Parks \"loved\" the visit, praising the school's instructors and the Black Panther Party for their work. Huggins later said of Parks's visit: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I consider Rosa Parks a radical woman, a revolutionary woman, showing up in real time at an elementary school run by the Black Panther Party.\n1980s.\nDuring the 1980s, Parks continued to take part in social and political causes. In 1981, she wrote to attorney Chokwe Lumumba in support of arrested activists from the Black Liberation Army, the May 19th Communist Organization, the RNA, and Weather Underground. She also participated in the Free South Africa Movement, which opposed apartheid in South Africa. Working with the movement, Parks participated in anti-apartheid demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and Berkeley, California, and in the National Conference Against Apartheid, which took place at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. She supported Jesse Jackson's 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns. Speaking on his behalf at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, Parks said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At some point we should step aside and let the younger ones take over. But we first must take care of our young people to make sure that they have the rights of first-class citizens... And when we see so little done by so many, we just will not give up.\nParks also worked extensively with radio host and NAACP activist Joe Madison during the 1980s. After a proposed ordinance that would ban non-residents from using parks in Dearborn, Michigan, which Madison believed would lead to racial discrimination, she and Madison planned a city-wide boycott. The ordinance was ultimately overturned by a Wayne County Circuit Judge, who ruled that it was racially discriminatory. Madison and Parks also unsuccessfully ran for president and vice president of the NAACP's Detroit chapter in 1985.\nIn 1987, Parks co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development with Elaine Eason Steele. The purpose of the institute is to develop youth leaders' capabilities in advancing civil rights initiatives. The institute also offers \"Pathways to Freedom\" bus tours, which introduce young people to important civil rights and Underground Railroad sites throughout the country. Parks also served on the Board of Advocates for Planned Parenthood. Unrelated to her activism, she donated several quilts made by members of her family to the Detroit Historical Museum.\n1990s.\nParks continued to be politically active into the 1990s. In 1990, at a Washington, D.C., gala celebrating her birthday, Parks gave a speech calling for the release of anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. She also attended the 1994 meeting of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America in Detroit alongside Jesse Jackson and Queen Mother Moore. In 1995, at the invitation of Louis Farrakhan, she participated in the Million Man March alongside Moore, Betty Shabazz, Dorothy Height, and Maya Angelou. During the 1990s, Parks authored several autobiographical works, including \"Rosa Parks: My Story\" in 1992, \"Quiet Strength\" in 1994, and \"Dear Mrs. Parks\" in 1997.\nParks was robbed and attacked in her home on August 30, 1994, at age 81. The assailant, Joseph Skipper, broke down her back door, falsely claiming to have deterred an intruder and demanding a reward of $3. After Parks complied, he demanded more money and assaulted her, punching her in the face. Eventually, Parks agreed to give Skipper all of the money she had: $103. Parks then called Steele, co-founder of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, who called the police.\nAccording to United States Representative Edward Vaughn, after reports of Skipper's conduct circulated, vigilantes proceeded to search for and assault him. Skipper was arrested on August 31. Many commentators saw Parks's assault as evidence of the moral decline of Black youth, but Parks cautioned against \"read[ing] too much into the attack\" and expressed compassion for Skipper, acknowledging \"the conditions that made him this way\". After the assault, Parks moved from downtown Detroit to a gated community. Learning of Parks's move, Little Caesars owner Mike Ilitch offered to pay for her housing expenses indefinitely. According to judge Damon Keith, funds from Ilitch were regularly deposited into a trust on Parks's behalf.\n2000s.\nFollowing the September 11 attacks in 2001, Parks joined actor Danny Glover and activists Harry Belafonte and Gloria Steinem in signing an open letter that cautioned against a \"military response\" and advocated for international collaboration. Later, in 2002, Parks received an eviction notice from her $1,800 per month () apartment for non-payment of rent. Parks was incapable of managing her own financial affairs by this time due to age-related physical and mental decline. Her rent was paid from a collection taken by Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. When her rent became delinquent and her impending eviction was publicized in 2004, her landlord announced they had forgiven the back rent and would allow Parks, by then 91 and in extremely poor health, to live rent-free in the building for the remainder of her life. Steele, co-founder of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, defended Parks's care and stated that the eviction notices were sent in error. Several of Parks's family members alleged that her financial affairs had been mismanaged.\nDeath and funeral.\nParks died of natural causes in her home on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92. City officials in Detroit and Montgomery announced that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons and fabric in honor of Parks until her funeral, with Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick placing down a ribbon on October 27. Her remains were flown to Montgomery for a public viewing and funeral service. Among the attendees was United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who remarked that \"without Mrs. Parks, I probably would not be standing here today as Secretary of State\". Her remains were then flown to Washington, D.C., the plane circling twice over Montgomery while the pilot sang \"We Shall Overcome\".\nRepresentative Conyers introduced Concurrent Resolution 61, which received approval on October 29, 2005, allowing Parks's remains to lie in state at the United States Capitol rotunda from October 30 to October 31. Her remains were transported to the rotunda by the United States National Guard. 40,000 mourners came to pay their respects. President George W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush laid a wreath on her coffin. Parks was the 31st individual, and the second private citizen, to be laid in state. A public memorial was also held at the Metropolitan AME Church before her remains were returned to Detroit.\nIn Detroit, Parks's casket was displayed at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. A memorial service was held at the Greater Grace Temple on November 2. Attendees included Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. An honor guard accompanied Parks's casket via horse-drawn carriage to the service, where soul singer Aretha Franklin performed. After the service, a white hearse conveyed Parks's remains to Woodlawn Cemetery, where she was interred in a mausoleum alongside Raymond and her mother. The chapel was renamed the Rosa L. Parks Freedom Chapel in her honor\nLegacy and honors.\nIn the American school curriculum, Rosa Parks's story is taught as a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. Initiatives like the Zinn Education Project have developed modern educational materials to help teachers present a more complete and radical picture of Parks's life to students.\nAwards.\nParks received several awards as a result of her contributions to the civil rights movement. The SCLC established the Rosa Parks Freedom Award in 1963, though Parks herself did not receive it until 1972. In 1965, she received the \"Dignity Overdue\" award from the Afro-American Broadcasting Company and was honored at a ceremony held at the Ford Auditorium in Detroit. The Capitol Press Club presented her with the Martin Luther King Jr. Award in 1968. In 1979, the NAACP awarded her the Spingarn Medal, citing her \"quiet courage and determination\" in refusing to relinquish her seat. The NAACP further recognized her with their own Martin Luther King Jr. Award in 1980. In 1983, she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame. She also received the Candace Award in 1984 from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women.\nIn 1992, Parks received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a civilian can receive from the United States executive branch, from Bill Clinton in 1996. Later, in 1999, Parks was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal with unanimous Senate approval despite opposition in the House from Representative Ron Paul. Also in 1999, she was honored with the Windsor\u2013Detroit International Freedom Festival Freedom Award, and \"Time\" named her one of the 20 most influential figures of the 20th century. In 2000, Parks received both the Alabama Governor's Medal of Honor and the Alabama Academy Award. In 2003, she received the International Institute Heritage Hall of Fame Award.\nMemorialization.\nMany locations and institutions have been named in honor of Parks. At the behest of her friend Louise Tappes, Detroit's 12th street was renamed \"Rosa Parks Boulevard\" in 1976. A bronze sculpture of Parks was displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in 1991. Michigan designated February 4 as Rosa Parks Day in 1997. In 2000, at the cost of $10 million, Troy University opened the Rosa Parks Library and Museum at the site of Parks's arrest. Parks's apartment in Montgomery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The bus on which Parks refused to move was restored with funding from the Save America's Treasures program and placed on display at The Henry Ford museum in 2003.\nAfter Parks's death in 2005, President Bush signed H.R. 4145, which authorized a statue of Parks to be placed in the National Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol. Parks was the first Black American to receive this honor. After a competition including entries from 150 artists, a statue sculpted by Eugene Daub and Rob Firmin, which depicted Parks on the day of her arrest, was selected to be placed in the hall. The statue was unveiled in 2013, with President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner in attendance.\nIn 2006, Nassau County, New York County Executive Tom Suozzi, announced that the Hempstead Transit Center would be renamed the Rosa Parks Hempstead Transit Center in Parks's honor. The Portland Boulevard station of the Los Angeles County MetroRail system was also officially named Rosa Parks Station in 2009. Also in 2009, the Rosa Parks Transit Center opened in downtown Detroit at the intersection of Cass and Michigan avenues. The asteroid 284996 Rosaparks, discovered in 2010 by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, was named in Parks's memory.\nOn February 1, Obama proclaimed February 4, 2013, as the \"100th Anniversary of the Birth of Rosa Parks\", calling \"upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate service, community, and education programs to honor Rosa Parks's enduring legacy\". The Henry Ford Museum designated February 4, 2013, as a \"National Day of Courage\". Also on February 4, the United States Postal Service unveiled a postage stamp in Parks's honor.\nIn 2014, a statue of Parks was dedicated at the Essex Government Complex in Newark, New Jersey. Rosa Parks station opened in Paris, France in 2015. In 2016, Parks's former residence in Detroit was threatened with demolition. A Berlin-based American artist, Ryan Mendoza, arranged to have the house disassembled, moved to his garden in Germany, and partly restored and converted into a museum honoring Parks. In 2018, the house was moved back to the United States. Brown University was initially planning to exhibit the house, but the display was cancelled. The house was eventually exhibited at the WaterFire Arts Center in Providence, Rhode Island. Also in 2018, \"Continuing the Conversation\", a public sculpture of Parks, was unveiled on the main campus of Georgia Tech. Another statue of Parks was unveiled in Montgomery in 2019. In 2021, a bust of Rosa Parks was added to the Oval Office when Joe Biden began his presidency. A statue of Parks was approved for the Alabama State Capitol grounds in 2023.\nHistoriography.\nMany popular narratives surrounding Parks portray her as a heroine. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist states that Parks's refusal to move was \"not an intentional attempt to change a nation, but a singular act aimed at restoring the dignity of the individual\". Writing in the \"Florida State University Law Review\", civil rights advocate A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. describes Parks as a \"heroine\" who exemplified both \"raw courage\" and \"genteelness\". Academic Kenan \u0130li characterizes Parks as an \"icon of leadership\", emphasizing her \"quiet strength\" and \"feminine dignity\". He argues that Parks's actions, driven by \"values and integrity\", served as a powerful catalyst for change, inspiring both Montgomery and the broader United States to confront their systemic injustices.\nTheoharis, in her 2015 biography \"The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks\", argues that the popular narrative of Rosa Parks as a \"quiet\" and \"accidental\" figure in the civil rights movement obscures her lifelong radical activism and political philosophy, as well as the \"variety of struggles\" that she took part in. She describes the \"quiet\" portrayal of Parks as a \"gendered caricature\", contending that interviewers misinterpreted her words in an attempt to form their own narratives around Parks. Academic Rich\u00e9 Richardson similarly critiques the \"uses, abuses, and appropriations\" of Parks's legacy in contemporary political discourse, particularly the ways her image has been manipulated to serve political agendas.\nAcademic Dennis Carlson argues that the popular conception of Rosa Parks transforms her into a \"monumentalist hero\", a figure used to reinforce conservative narratives of American history and morality. According to Carlson, this portrayal isolates her act of defiance, framing it as an individual, legally-focused moment of courage that both ignited and calmed a potentially violent Black community. Biographer Darryl Mace speculates that Parks's passive and quiet public image was shaped both by the gendered norms of the 1950s and the male-dominated leadership of the civil rights movement. He contends that Parks was relegated to gendered roles in the movement, and that her refusal to move was framed by civil rights organizers within a narrative of female vulnerability.\nScholars have also examined Parks's actions in relation to other, earlier instances of civil disobedience. Sociologist Barry Schwartz posits that although Parks became the celebrated symbol of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, many other individuals\u2014including Browder, Colvin, Smith, and McDonald\u2014played equally important and even more active roles in the struggle against segregation. Colvin herself felt a mix of emotions regarding Parks: glad that an adult had \"stood up to the system\" but also abandoned because the community had not supported her similar actions months before. Browder's son maintained that Parks's prominence had overshadowed his mother's contributions, leaving her role largely unrecognized. Schwartz argues that accounts emphasizing the exceptional nature of Parks's refusal to move necessarily simplify the civil rights movement, creating a more accessible and symbolically compelling narrative at the cost of \"forgetting\" other important figures.\nIn popular culture.\nFilm and television.\nIn 1999, Parks filmed a cameo appearance for the television series \"Touched by an Angel\". She was played by Iris Little-Thomas in the 2001 film \"Boycott\", directed by Clark Johnson, and by Angela Bassett in the 2002 biopic \"The Rosa Parks Story\", directed by Julie Dash. She was also the subject of the short documentary film \"\", which was nominated for Best Documentary Short Film at the 75th Academy Awards.\nThe 2002 film \"Barbershop\", directed by Tim Story, garnered controversy due to its inclusion of a scene discussing Parks's actions. In the scene, Eddie, played by Cedric the Entertainer, downplays Rosa Parks's role in the civil rights movement, arguing that her actions were simply those of a tired person and that many others had performed similar acts of defiance without receiving recognition. He attributes her fame to her NAACP connections and association with King. Jesse Jackson and activist Al Sharpton criticized the movie, and Sharpton called for a boycott of the film. NAACP president Kweisi Mfume stated he thought the controversy was \"overblown\". Parks herself boycotted the 2003 NAACP Image Awards ceremony, which Cedric hosted.\nThe 2018 episode \"Rosa\", of the science-fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", centers on Parks, as portrayed by Vinette Robinson. The episode was received positively, with many online commenters determining that \"the writers hadn't undermined the legacy of Rosa Parks\", according to commentary from the BBC. In 2022, the documentary \"The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks\", the first full-length documentary about Parks, was released on Peacock. The documentary, directed by Johanna Hamilton and Yoruba Richen, was inspired by Theoharis's biography of the same name.\nMusic.\nIn 1999, Parks filed a $5 billion lawsuit against American hip-hop duo Outkast and their record company claiming that the duo's song \"Rosa Parks\", released on their 1998 album \"Aquemini\", used her name without permission, harming her reputation. After a federal court dismissed the lawsuit, Parks filed another suit in 2004 against BMG Rights Management, Arista Records, and LaFace Records. In 2005, a settlement was reached, wherein Outkast and BMG without admitting liability agreed to pursue projects that would \"enlighten today's youth about the significant role Rosa Parks played in making America a better place for all races\". The role of Steele, co-founder of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, and Parks's attorney, Gregory Reed, in these legal proceedings was subject to scrutiny, with some accusing them of \"exploiting\" Parks for their own gain.\nRapper Nicki Minaj received backlash online for incorporating Parks into her 2020 song \"Yikes\", where she rapped, \"All you bitches Rosa Park, uh-oh, get your ass up\". Journalist Ernest Owens criticized the lyric for its inaccurate portrayal of Parks's actions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Y'all go remind Nicki Minaj that. Quick history lesson: She never got up, she stayed seated. The lyric makes no sense.\nOther.\nOne of the cards in the Supersisters trading card set, released in 1979, featured Parks's name and picture. She is card no. 27 in the set. In 2019, Mattel released a Barbie doll in Parks's likeness as part of their \"Inspiring Women\" series.\nOn January 4, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reviewed a lawsuit brought by the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development against American retail corporation Target. In the lawsuit, the institute alleged that Target infringed on Parks's rights to her name and likeness by selling merchandise using her name, contrary to a Michigan law safeguarding against the unauthorized use of a person's identity for commercial gain. The court's ruling, given by Judge Robin S. Rosenbaum, stated that \"the use of Rosa Parks's name and likeness in the books, movie, and plaque are necessary to chronicling and discussing the history of the Civil Rights Movement\u2014matters quintessentially embraced and protected by Michigan's qualified privilege\", permitting the sale of the items at Target.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26459", "revid": "3096637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26459", "title": "Ringworld (role-playing game)", "text": "Science fiction tabletop role-playing game\nThe Ringworld science fiction role-playing game was published by Chaosium in 1984, using the Basic Role-Playing system for its rules and Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" novels as a setting.\nSetting.\nThe setting is a distant future based on extrapolation of as much hard science as Niven had available. Specifically, it's the 29th century. \"Known Space\" (also the commonly used title for Larry Niven's future history science fiction series) is about 80 light years in diameter with 10,000 stars, including Human Space (40 light years diameter, 524 stars in 357 systems, 30 billion humans, two-thirds on Earth), as well as neighbouring Alien civilisations. Important Alien civilisations include the Puppeteers, paranoid pacifist herbivore centaurs, and the Kzinti, carnivorous warlike felines, who fought multiple wars over hundreds of years against the Humans, being defeated each time. Human allies include intelligent dolphins and orcas.\n\"Known Space\" only serves as a background for the game. The game is intended to be set on the Ringworld itself, an enormous single world discovered at the far reaches of Known Space, a ring around a sun at approximately the orbit of the Earth. It is wide, about 125 Earth-diameters. The total inner surface of the ring is equal to that of 3 million Earths. The ring is spun at a speed to provide 0.992 g of gravity on the innerside, while 20 giant shadow squares at about the orbit of Mercury occlude the Sun to provide night. It was constructed by the Pak Protectors, now mostly extinct, who had a common origin with humans. The Ringworld is home to some 30 trillion sentient inhabitants from up to 2000 hominid species. The world is described in a series of novels by Niven, \"Ringworld\", \"The Ringworld Engineers\", and, after the game's publication, \"The Ringworld Throne\" and \"Ringworld's Children\".\nInformation from the RPG, along with notes composed by RPG author Hewitt with Niven, were later used to form the \"Bible\" given to authors writing in the \"Man-Kzin Wars\" series. Niven himself recommended that Hewitt write one of the stories for the original two MKW books, although this never came to pass.\nGameplay.\nThe players initially play explorers from Known Space, sent as scouts to the Ringworld. They can be anthropologists, artists, doctors, police, or even zealots, who will explore the mysteries of this huge artificial world and its inhabitants. Basic characters can be humans from a dozen planets of Human Space, Puppeteers, or Kzin. Later play can see characters from Ringworld species, such as the (so-called) Ghouls, Vampires, Giants, Sea People, and others.\nThis Ringworld focus has been a criticism of the game. The \"Ringworld\" role-playing game is not a 'full' science fiction RPG, like \"Traveller\", including, for example, rules for starship construction, space combat, travel to different planets and systems, and so forth. Instead, the game and rules focused on parties of characters exploring the Ringworld itself, and, despite its vast size (with a surface area larger than that of all of Known Space's inhabited planets put together), many who bought the game felt limited by this one world setting.\nGame system.\nA character is initially defined by his species or world of origin, which affects characteristics (for example, by determining the gravity to which it is accustomed). Then the players roll randomly for a certain number of defects, character age, and characteristics. The system used is Chaosium's Basic Role-Playing, with eight basic characteristics: Strength, Constitution, Mass (equivalent to Size in other BRP games), Intelligence, Power, Dexterity, Appearance and Education determining secondary attributes such damage modifiers, hit points, and skill rolls.\nAt creation, each character gets to spend a number of points (based mainly on age, Education, and Intelligence) on skills determined by interests or career choice. Each of the three playable races has specific tables for the creation of characters. Character Skills are based on percentages. To succeed in a skill, the player must roll under the relevant skill with modifiers on percentile dice. \nAnother critique of the game system has been the large effect of character age on skills, usually considered the most important character attributes. In Niven's future world, the deterioration of age has been largely reversed, so humans live hundreds of years. Therefore, a 200-year-old character will have vastly more skill points than a 20-year-old, with little compensatory advantages for the younger one.\nPublications.\nOnly two publications were published, the \"Ringworld\" role-playing game box set itself, and the \"Ringworld Companion\", both in 1984 by Chaosium. The magazine \"Different Worlds\", issue 37, featured a \"Ringworld\" adventure, \"Louis Wu &amp; His Motley Crew.\" The article \"The Dolphins of Known Space: A new race for the Ringworld Game\" appeared in \"Dragon Magazine\" issue 95.\n\"Ringworld\" Box Set.\nThe \"Ringworld\" role-playing game box set was titled \"Larry Niven's Ringworld: Roleplaying Adventure Beneath the Great Arch\", referring to the way the Ringworld looked from its interior surface. The authors are credited as Greg Stafford, John Hewitt, Sherman Kahn, Lynn Willis, Sandy Petersen, Rudy Kraft, Charlie Krank, Ed Gore, and Jeff Okamoto. It came in a box set with four books: the Explorer Book, Technology Book, Gamemasters Book, and Creatures Book, a sheet of cardboard miniatures, reference and character sheets, and a set of dice: 2d20 (actually dice with two sets of digits 0 to 9), 1d8, and 2d6.\nExplorer Book.\nThis book begins with a character sheet. It introduces role-playing games, then covers character creation, skill use, and combat. It presents a detailed history of humanity between the 20th and 29th centuries. It then describes eleven human worlds: Belt (the asteroid belt), Canyon, Down, Gummidgy, Home, Jinx, Margrave, Plateau, Silvereyes, \"We Made It\" and Wunderland. Finally, it gives rules for non-human, Kzin or Puppeteer, player characters, and a glossary.\nGamemaster Book.\nThe Gamemaster Book begins with technical essays on the Ringworld, from physical construction, to life on the ring, with diagrams. There is a section on the \"City Builders\"\u2014a Ringworld race that dominated the Ringworld, built floating cities, and sent spaceships to explore other worlds, until a mysterious technological virus destroyed their empire. Another section lists unanswered questions about the Ringworld. There are suggestions for creating scenarios and campaigns, and information on technology of various humanoid species of the Ringworld, and additional rules, including gravity, Credit Rating, and psionics. There is also an introductory scenario (\"The Journey of the Catseye\") intended to begin a Ringworld campaign. The characters are hired by Captain Gregor Lopez, famous explorer, for a journey to the Ringworld that does not go completely as planned.\nTechnology Book.\nThe Technology Book gives rules and descriptions of the equipment employed by the explorers of the 29th century, categorized into generators, computers, medical equipment, tools, vehicles, weapons and defenses.\nCreature Book.\nThe Creature Book gives rules and descriptions for creatures, divided into Aliens, Humanoids, Animals and Plants. Many races get specialized hit location tables, characteristic maxima and minima, skills and traits.\n\"Ringworld Companion\".\nThe \"Ringworld Companion\" supplement was published not long after the box set. The authors are credited as Greg Stafford, John Hewitt, Sherman Kahn, Lynn Willis, Sandy Petersen, Rudy Kraft, and Charlie Krank.\nThe book starts with a diagram of the Ringworld and its star, EC-1752, new humanoids, aliens, plants and animals, technological objects, and original errata. There is some information on spaceships (Human and City Builder), hyperspace, a map of Human Space, and statistics for vehicles used on the Ringworld. Then there is a new race, the \"Agamans\", desert nomads, and a scenario involving them, \"The Sand Eaters\". Finally, there is a three part scenario named \"The Kaladians\", about the defense of travelling merchants. Both scenarios can be integrated into the campaign given in the basic set. None of these three additional races appear in any of the \"Ringworld\" novels.\nReception.\nPhil Masters reviewed \"Ringworld\" for \"White Dwarf\" #59, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that \"This game takes a superb background idea, applies a good system of mechanics to it, and comes back with a disappointing result.\"\nSteve Peterson reviewed \"Ringworld\" in \"Space Gamer\" No. 71. Peterson commented that \"Niven fans should buy it for the essays and background materials. Role-players should be prepared to do some work on scenarios; but if you do, you'll have some terrific roleplaying in a beautifully detailed world. Science-fiction gamers who want to use it for source material probably won't get their money's worth.\"\nIn Issue 4 of the French games magazine \"Casus Belli \", Jean Balcezak commented, \"Without being extremely complex, this game is nevertheless aimed at experienced players eager to discover new settings.\" Balcezak was quite taken with the game, writing, \"\"Ringworld\" is set to become a 'must' that every serious role player should have in their game library.\"\nJeff Seiken reviewed \"Ringworld\" for \"Different Worlds\" magazine and stated that \"the rulebooks contain numerous essays devoted to specific facets of \"Ringworld\" to assist the gamemaster in constructing a suitable (and viable) campaign. These essays are both well-written and invaluable. In fact, as befitting a product which owes its origins to a literary source, \"Ringworld\" stands out as an extremely literate role-playing game. Digesting the extensive amounts of factual information presented in the essays may demand a significant commitment of time and energy on the part of the gamemaster, but then the rewards of role-playing in the world of \"Ringworld\" will far outstrip the effort.\"\nSteve Nutt reviewed \"Ringworld\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that \"Altogether, Ringworld's advantages and disadvantages stem from its campaign setting. The actual mechanics of the game are top quality, yet background and atmosphere are what make or break a campaign, and in Ringworld this aspect could be somewhat daunting to the uninitiated.\"\nIn his 1990 book \"The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games\", game critic Rick Swan called this \"a terrific setting, but only a so-so game.\" Swan felt \"Though the game systems are adequate, they're nothing out of the ordinary.\" Swan also pointed out that although there was a lot of background material, \"there's not much help of any kind for the \"Ringworld\" referee; not only does he have his hands full managing a planet roughly the size of 3 million Earths, the game presumes he has a basic understanding of physics, embryology, and other sciences. And unless he is familiar with the original novel, it's unlikely that the referee will have a clue as to how to stage an adventure.\" Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4.\nJames Davis Nicoll in 2020 for \"Black Gate\" said \"Production values were very high, as was the price [...] Yes, that's a Ralph McQuarrie cover. \"LNRW: RABtGA\" was also doomed, because scarcely had the game come out before Niven made a lucrative media deal and yanked the rights back from Chaosium. \"LNRW: RABtGA\" is very much out of print.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

John Ross of Cumberland Games &amp; Diversions. \"Risus\" is available free on the web. It was first published online in 1993. Earlier versions of the game were titled GUCS: The Generic Universal Comedy System (a parody of \"GURPS\") and were distributed privately beginning in 1989.\nHistory.\n\"Risus\" (Latin for \u201claughter\u201d) is a comedy game (often described by its creator as a \"joke game\") and uses a clich\u00e9 (character class) system inspired by the broad \"career scale\" skills in Greg Gorden's \"DC Heroes RPG\" (Mayfair Games), and later influenced by Atlas Games' \"Over the Edge\". The core systems of \"Risus\" owe their largest debt to the \"Ghostbusters RPG\" published by West End Games, and to \"Tunnels and Trolls\" by Ken St. Andre. The game itself also cites \"GURPS\" as an influence, along with \"FUDGE\", another free RPG released to the web a year earlier. Several more recent games have been, in turn, influenced by \"Risus.\"\nDespite the game's small size and admittedly joking nature, there are more than 30 fan-authored websites devoted to \"Risus,\" some including several rules variants, simple worldbooks, and wholly rewritten adaptations of the game. \"Risus\" itself has been translated into Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

It has the Bayer designation \u03b2 Orionis, which is Latinized to Beta Orionis and abbreviated Beta Ori or \u03b2 Ori. Rigel is the brightest and most massive component\u00a0\u2013 and the eponym\u00a0\u2013 of a star system of at least four stars that appear as a single blue-white point of light to the naked eye. This system is located at a distance of approximately .\nA star of spectral type B8Ia, Rigel is calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times as massive, depending on the method and assumptions used. Its radius is more than seventy times that of the Sun, and its surface temperature is . Due to its stellar wind, Rigel's mass-loss is estimated to be ten million times that of the Sun. With an estimated age of seven to nine million years, Rigel has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded, and cooled to become a supergiant. It is expected to end its life as a typeII supernova, leaving a neutron star or a black hole as a final remnant, depending on the initial mass of the star.\nRigel varies slightly in brightness, its apparent magnitude ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. It is classified as an Alpha Cygni variable due to the amplitude and periodicity of its brightness variation, as well as its spectral type. Its intrinsic variability is caused by pulsations in its unstable atmosphere. Rigel is generally the seventh-brightest star in the night sky and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by Betelgeuse, which varies over a larger range.\nA triple-star system is separated from Rigel by an angle of . It has an apparent magnitude of 6.7, making it 1/400th as bright as Rigel. Two stars in the system can be seen by large telescopes, and the brighter of the two is a spectroscopic binary. These three stars are all blue-white main-sequence stars, each three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel and the triple system orbit a common center of gravity with a period estimated to be 24,000 years. The inner stars of the triple system orbit each other every 10 days, and the outer star orbits the inner pair every 63 years. A much fainter star, separated from Rigel and the others by nearly an arc minute, may be part of the same star system.\nNomenclature.\nIn 2016, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) included the name \"Rigel\" in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. According to the IAU, this proper name applies only to the primary component A of the Rigel system. The system is listed variously in historical astronomical catalogs as HII33, \u03a3668, \u03b2555, or ADS3823. For simplicity, Rigel's companions are referred to as Rigel B, C, and D; the IAU describes such names as \"useful nicknames\" that are \"unofficial\". In modern comprehensive catalogs, the whole multiple star system is known as WDS 05145-0812 or CCDM 05145\u20130812.\nThe designation of Rigel as \u03b2 Orionis (Beta Orionis) was made by Johann Bayer in 1603. The \"beta\" designation is commonly given to the second-brightest star in each constellation, but Rigel is almost always brighter than \u03b1 Orionis (Betelgeuse). Astronomer James B. Kaler has speculated that Rigel was designated by Bayer during a rare period when it was outshone by the variable star Betelgeuse, resulting in the latter star being designated \"alpha\" and Rigel designated \"beta\". Bayer did not strictly order the stars by brightness, instead grouping them by magnitude. Rigel and Betelgeuse were both considered to be of the first magnitude class, and in Orion the stars of each class are thought to have been ordered north to south. Rigel is included in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, but since it already has a Bayer designation it has no separate variable star designation.\nRigel has many other stellar designations taken from various catalogs, including the Flamsteed designation 19Orionis (19 Ori), the Bright Star Catalogue entry HR1713, and the Henry Draper Catalogue number HD34085. These designations frequently appear in the scientific literature, but rarely in popular writing.\nObservation.\nRigel is an intrinsic variable star with an apparent magnitude ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. It is typically the seventh-brightest star in the celestial sphere, excluding the Sun, although occasionally fainter than Betelgeuse. It is fainter than Capella, which may also vary slightly in brightness. Rigel appears slightly blue-white and has a B-V color index of \u22120.06. It contrasts strongly with reddish Betelgeuse.\nCulminating every year at midnight on 12 December, and at 9:00pm on 24 January, Rigel is visible on winter evenings in the Northern Hemisphere and on summer evenings in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, Rigel is the first bright star of Orion visible as the constellation rises. Correspondingly, it is also the first star of Orion to set in most of the Northern Hemisphere. The star is a vertex of the \"Winter Hexagon\", an asterism that includes Aldebaran, Capella, Pollux, Procyon, and Sirius. Rigel is a prominent equatorial navigation star, being easily located and readily visible in all the world's oceans (the exception is the area north of the 82nd parallel north).\nSpectroscopy.\nRigel's spectral type is a defining point of the classification sequence for supergiants. The overall spectrum is typical for a late B class star, with strong absorption lines of the hydrogen Balmer series as well as neutral helium lines and some of heavier elements such as oxygen, calcium, and magnesium. The luminosity class for B8 stars is estimated from the strength and narrowness of the hydrogen spectral lines, and Rigel is assigned to the bright supergiant class Ia. Variations in the spectrum have resulted in the assignment of different classes to Rigel, such as B8 Ia, B8 Iab, and B8 Iae.\nAs early as 1888, the heliocentric radial velocity of Rigel, as estimated from the Doppler shifts of its spectral lines, was seen to vary. This was confirmed and interpreted at the time as being due to a spectroscopic companion with a period of about 22 days. The radial velocity has since been measured to vary by about around a mean of .\nIn 1933, the H\u03b1 line in Rigel's spectrum was seen to be unusually weak and shifted towards shorter wavelengths, while there was a narrow emission spike about to the long wavelength side of the main absorption line. This is now known as a P Cygni profile after a star that shows this feature strongly in its spectrum. It is associated with mass loss where there is simultaneously emission from a dense wind close to the star and absorption from circumstellar material expanding away from the star.\nThe unusual H\u03b1 line profile is observed to vary unpredictably. It is a normal absorption line around a third of the time. About a quarter of the time, it is a double-peaked line, that is, an absorption line with an emission core or an emission line with an absorption core. About a quarter of the time it has a P Cygni profile; most of the rest of the time, the line has an inverse P Cygni profile, where the emission component is on the short wavelength side of the line. Rarely, there is a pure emission H\u03b1 line. The line profile changes are interpreted as variations in the quantity and velocity of material being expelled from the star. Occasional very high-velocity outflows have been inferred, and, more rarely, infalling material. The overall picture is one of large looping structures arising from the photosphere and driven by magnetic fields.\nVariability.\nRigel has been known to vary in brightness since at least 1930. The small amplitude of Rigel's brightness variation requires photoelectric or CCD photometry to be reliably detected. This brightness variation has no obvious period. Observations over 18 nights in 1984 showed variations at red, blue, and yellow wavelengths of up to 0.13 magnitudes on timescales of a few hours to several days, but again no clear period. Rigel's color index varies slightly, but this is not significantly correlated with its brightness variations.\nFrom analysis of \"Hipparcos\" satellite photometry, Rigel is identified as belonging to the Alpha Cygni class of variable stars, defined as \"non-radially pulsating supergiants of the Bep\u2013AepIa spectral types\". In those spectral types, the 'e' indicates that it displays emission lines in its spectrum, while the 'p' means it has an unspecified spectral peculiarity. Alpha Cygni type variables are generally considered to be irregular or have quasi-periods. Rigel was added to the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in the 74th name-list of variable stars on the basis of the Hipparcos photometry, which showed variations with a photographic amplitude of 0.039 magnitudes and a possible period of 2.075 days. Rigel was observed with the Canadian MOST satellite for nearly 28 days in 2009. Milli-magnitude variations were observed, and gradual changes in flux suggest the presence of long-period pulsation modes.\nMass loss.\nFrom observations of the variable H\u03b1 spectral line, Rigel's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind is estimated be solar masses per year (M\u2609/yr)\u2014about ten million times more than the mass-loss rate from the Sun. More detailed optical and Kband infrared spectroscopic observations, together with VLTI interferometry, were taken from 2006 to 2010. Analysis of the H\u03b1 and H\u03b3 line profiles, and measurement of the regions producing the lines, show that Rigel's stellar wind varies greatly in structure and strength. Loop and arm structures were also detected within the wind. Calculations of mass loss from the H\u03b3 line give in 2006-7 and in 2009\u201310. Calculations using the H\u03b1 line give lower results, around . The terminal wind velocity is . It is estimated that Rigel has lost about three solar masses (M\u2609) since beginning life as a star of seven to nine million years ago.\nDistance.\nRigel's distance from the Sun is somewhat uncertain, different estimates being obtained by different methods. Old estimates placed it 166 parsecs (or 541 light years) away from the Sun. The 2007 Hipparcos new reduction of Rigel's parallax is , giving a distance of with a margin of error of about 9%. Rigel B, usually considered to be physically associated with Rigel and at the same distance, has a Gaia Data Release 3 parallax of , suggesting a distance around . However, the measurements for this object may be unreliable.\nIndirect distance estimation methods have also been employed. For example, Rigel is believed to be in a region of nebulosity, its radiation illuminating several nearby clouds. Most notable of these is the 5\u00b0-long IC 2118 (Witch Head Nebula), located at an angular separation of 2.5\u00b0 from the star, or a projected distance of away. From measures of other nebula-embedded stars, IC2118's distance is estimated to be .\nRigel is an outlying member of the Orion OB1 association, which is located at a distance of up to from Earth. It is a member of the loosely defined Taurus-Orion R1 Association, somewhat closer at . Rigel is thought to be considerably closer than most of the members of Orion OB1 and the Orion Nebula. Betelgeuse and Saiph lie at a similar distance to Rigel, although Betelgeuse is a runaway star with a complex history and might have originally formed in the main body of the association.\nStellar system.\nHierarchical scheme for Rigel's components\nThe star system of which Rigel is a part has at least four components. Rigel (sometimes called Rigel A to distinguish from the other components) has a visual companion, which is likely a close triple-star system. A fainter star at a wider separation might be a fifth component of the Rigel system.\nWilliam Herschel discovered Rigel to be a visual double star on 1 October 1781, cataloguing it as star 33 in the \"second class of double stars\" in his Catalogue of Double Stars, usually abbreviated to HII33, or as H233 in the Washington Double Star Catalogue. Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve first measured the relative position of the companion in 1822, cataloguing the visual pair as \u03a3 668. The secondary star is often referred to as Rigel B or \u03b2 Orionis B. The angular separation of Rigel B from Rigel A is 9.5 arc seconds to its south along position angle 204\u00b0. Although not particularly faint at visual magnitude 6.7, the overall difference in brightness from Rigel A (about 6.6 magnitudes or 440 times fainter) makes it a challenging target for telescope apertures smaller than .\nAt Rigel's estimated distance, Rigel B's projected separation from Rigel A is over 2,200astronomical units (AU). Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share a similar common proper motion. The pair would have an estimated orbital period of 24,000years. Gaia Data Release 3(DR3) contains a probably unreliable parallax for Rigel B, placing it at about , further away than the Hipparcos distance for Rigel, but similar to the Taurus-Orion R1 association. There is no parallax for Rigel in Gaia DR3. The Gaia DR3 proper motions for Rigel B and the Hipparcos proper motions for Rigel are both small, although not quite the same.\nIn 1871, Sherburne Wesley Burnham suspected Rigel B to be a binary system, and in 1878, he resolved it into two components. This visual companion is designated as component C (Rigel C), with a measured separation from component B that varies from less than to around . In 2009, speckle interferometry showed the two almost identical components separated by , with visual magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.6, respectively. Their estimated orbital period is 63years. Burnham listed the Rigel multiple system as \u03b2555 in his double star catalog or BU555 in modern use.\nComponent B is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, which shows two sets of spectral lines combined within its single stellar spectrum. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, is likely a physical triple-star system, although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum, which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.\nIn 1878, Burnham found another possibly associated star of approximately 13th magnitude. He listed it as component D of \u03b2555, although it is unclear whether it is physically related or a coincidental alignment. Its 2017 separation from Rigel was , almost due north at a position angle of 1\u00b0. Gaia DR2 finds it to be a 12th magnitude sunlike star at approximately the same distance as Rigel. Likely a K-type main-sequence star, this star would have an orbital period of around 250,000 years, if it is part of the Rigel system.\nA spectroscopic companion to Rigel was reported on the basis of radial velocity variations, and its orbit was even calculated, but subsequent work suggests the star does not exist and that observed pulsations are intrinsic to Rigel itself.\nPhysical characteristics.\nRigel is a blue supergiant that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core, expanded and cooled as it moved away from the main sequence across the upper part of the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram. When it was on the main sequence, its effective temperature would have been around . Rigel's complex variability at visual wavelengths is caused by stellar pulsations similar to those of Deneb. Further observations of radial velocity variations indicate that it simultaneously oscillates in at least 19 non-radial modes with periods ranging from about 1.2 to 74 days.\nEstimation of many physical characteristics of blue supergiant stars, including Rigel, is challenging due to their rarity and uncertainty about how far they are from the Sun. As such, their characteristics are mainly estimated from theoretical stellar evolution models. Its effective temperature can be estimated from the spectral type and color to be around . A mass of at an age of million years has been estimated by comparing evolutionary tracks, while atmospheric modeling from the spectrum gives a mass of M\u2609.\nAlthough Rigel is often considered the most luminous star within 1,000 light-years of the Sun, its energy output is poorly known. Using the Hipparcos distance of , the estimated relative luminosity for Rigel is about 120,000 times that of the Sun (L\u2609), but another recently published distance of suggests an even higher luminosity of 219,000\u00a0L\u2609. Other calculations based on theoretical stellar evolutionary models of Rigel's atmosphere give luminosities anywhere between 83,000\u00a0L\u2609 and 363,000\u00a0L\u2609, while summing the spectral energy distribution from historical photometry with the Hipparcos distance suggests a luminosity as low as . A 2018 study using the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer measured the angular diameter as . After correcting for limb darkening, the angular diameter is found to be , yielding a radius of R\u2609. An older measurement of the angular diameter gives , equivalent to a radius of 78.9\u00a0R\u2609 at . These radii are calculated assuming the Hipparcos distance of ; adopting a distance of leads to a significantly larger size. Older distance estimates were mostly far lower than modern estimates, leading to lower radius estimates; a 1922 estimate by John Stanley Plaskett gave Rigel a diameter of 25 million miles, or approximately 28.9\u00a0R\u2609, smaller than its neighbor Aldebaran.\nDue to their closeness to each other and ambiguity of the spectrum, little is known about the intrinsic properties of the members of the Rigel BC triple system. All three stars seem to be near equally hot B-type main-sequence stars that are three to four times as massive as the Sun.\nEvolution.\nStellar evolution models suggest the pulsations of Rigel are powered by nuclear reactions in a hydrogen-burning shell that is at least partially non-convective. These pulsations are stronger and more numerous in stars that have evolved through a red supergiant phase and then increased in temperature to again become a blue supergiant. This is due to the decreased mass and increased levels of fusion products at the surface of the star.\nRigel is likely to be fusing helium in its core. Due to strong convection of helium produced in the core while Rigel was on the main sequence and in the hydrogen-burning shell since it became a supergiant, the fraction of helium at the surface has increased from 26.6% when the star formed to 32% now. The surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen seen in the spectrum are compatible with a post-red supergiant star only if its internal convection zones are modeled using non-homogeneous chemical conditions known as the Ledoux Criteria.\nRigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a type II supernova. It is one of the closest known potential supernova progenitors to Earth, and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets). The supernova would leave behind either a black hole or a neutron star.\nEtymology and cultural significance.\nThe earliest known recording of the name \"Rigel\" is in the \"Alfonsine tables\" of 1521. It is derived from the Arabic name ', \"the left leg (foot) of Jauzah\" (i.e. \"rijl\" meaning \"leg, foot\"), which can be traced to the 10th century. \"Jauzah\" was a proper name for Orion; an alternative Arabic name was ', \"the foot of the great one\", from which stems the rarely used variant names \"Algebar\" or \"Elgebar\". The \"Alphonsine tables\" saw its name split into \"Rigel\" and \"Algebar\", with the note, \"et dicitur Algebar. Nominatur etiam Rigel.\" Alternate spellings from the 17th century include \"Regel\" by Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli, \"Riglon\" by German astronomer Wilhelm Schickard, and \"Rigel Algeuze\" or \"Algibbar\" by English scholar Edmund Chilmead.\nWith the constellation representing the mythological Greek huntsman Orion, Rigel is his knee or (as its name suggests) foot; with the nearby star Beta Eridani marking Orion's footstool. Rigel is presumably the star known as \"Aurvandil's toe\" in Norse mythology. In the Caribbean, Rigel represented the severed leg of the folkloric figure \"Trois Rois\", himself represented by the three stars of Orion's Belt. The leg had been severed with a cutlass by the maiden \"B\u012fhi\" (Sirius). The Lacandon people of southern Mexico knew it as \"tunsel\" (\"little woodpecker\").\nRigel was known as \"Yerrerdet-kurrk\" to the Wotjobaluk koori of southeastern Australia, and held to be the mother-in-law of \"Totyerguil\" (Altair). The distance between them signified the taboo preventing a man from approaching his mother-in-law. The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria named Rigel as \"Collowgullouric Warepil\". The Wardaman people of northern Australia know Rigel as the Red Kangaroo Leader \"Unumburrgu\" and chief conductor of ceremonies in a songline when Orion is high in the sky. Eridanus, the river, marks a line of stars in the sky leading to it, and the other stars of Orion are his ceremonial tools and entourage. Betelgeuse is \"Ya-jungin\" \"Owl Eyes Flicking\", watching the ceremonies.\nThe M\u0101ori people of New Zealand named Rigel as \"Puanga\", said to be a daughter of \"Rehua\" (Antares), the chief of all-stars. Its heliacal rising presages the appearance of \"Matariki\" (the Pleiades) in the dawn sky, marking the M\u0101ori New Year in late May or early June. The Moriori people of the Chatham Islands, as well as some Maori groups in New Zealand, mark the start of their New Year with Rigel rather than the Pleiades. \"Puaka\" is a southern name variant used in the South Island.\nIn Japan, the Minamoto or Genji clan chose Rigel and its white color as its symbol, calling the star \"Genji-boshi\" (), while the Taira or Heike clan adopted Betelgeuse and its red color. The two powerful families fought the Genpei War; the stars were seen as facing off against each other and kept apart only by the three stars of Orion's Belt.\nIn modern culture.\nThe MS \"Rigel\" was originally a Norwegian ship, built in Copenhagen in 1924. It was requisitioned by the Germans during World War II and sunk in 1944 while being used to transport prisoners of war. Two US Navy ships have borne the name USS \"Rigel\". The SSM-N-6 Rigel was a cruise missile program for the US Navy that was cancelled in 1953 before reaching deployment.\nThe Rigel Skerries are a chain of small islands in Antarctica, renamed after originally being called Utskjera. They were given their current name as Rigel was used as an astrofix. Mount Rigel, elevation , is also in Antarctica.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rebelling, and subsequently governing Saqqawist (\"Saq\u0101w\u012bh\u0101\") forces under Habibull\u0101h Kalak\u0101ni fought against various opposing tribes and rival monarchs in the Kingdom of Afghanistan, among whom Mohammed N\u0101dir Kh\u0101n eventually achieved a preponderant role. Despite early successes, such as the capture of Kabul and defeat of Amanullah Khan on 17 January 1929 or the capture of Kandahar on 3 June, the Saqqawists were eventually deposed by anti-Saqqawist forces led by Nadir on 13 October 1929, leading to Nadir's ascension as King of Afghanistan. He ruled until his assassination on 3 November 1933.\nThe war began when the Shinwari tribe revolted, besieged Jalalabad, and drew up a manifesto of 10 grievances, 5 of which related to Amanullah's meddling with the status of women. Although this revolt was quelled by a force led by Ali Ahmad Khan, a concurrent Saqqawist uprising in the north managed to capture the besieged city of Jabal al-Siraj, before attacking Kabul on 14 December 1928. Although the first Saqqawist assault on Kabul was repulsed, the second Saqqawist assault succeeded at capturing Kabul on 17 January 1929. The government at that time was focused on social reforms, such as the expansion of women's rights and the adoption of a military draft, which had earlier led to the unsuccessful Alizai rebellion and Khost rebellion. Kalakani denounced his opponents as kuffar, while his forces committed acts of rape and looting.\nAfter capturing Kabul, the Saqqawists defeated a rival government in Jalalabad led by Ali Ahmad Khan on 9 February. Despite a setback in the Battle of Shaykhabad in early March, the Saqqawists managed to extend their control to Kandahar in June after a short siege. However, they were unable to defeat Nadir Khan in the Logar valley, who had entered the area together with Amanullah in March, although the latter left the country on 23 May. After a months-long stalemate, Nadir Khan eventually managed to force the Saqqawists to retreat into Kabul in October 1929, and subsequently into the Arg. The capture of the Arg on 13 October 1929 marked the end of the civil war, although Saqqawist activity continued until 1931, with the fall of their final holdout, Herat. The civil war was fought concurrently with a Soviet operation in northern Afghanistan to fight the Basmachi movement.\nBoth sides suffered around 7500 combat deaths during the civil war. During the anti-Saqqawist capture of Kabul, Nadir's forces sacked the city against his orders. After the civil war, Nadir did not cede control of the Afghan throne back to Amanullah, and this led to several rebellions, including the Shinwari rebellion, the Kuhistan rebellion, the Ghilzai rebellion, and Mazrak's revolt. During World War II, Amanullah would unsuccessfully try to regain the throne with Axis help.\nBackground.\nAm\u0101null\u0101h Kh\u0101n reigned in Afghanistan from 1919, achieving full independence from the British Empire shortly afterwards. Before the Treaty of Rawalpindi was concluded in 1921, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy, including diplomatic relations with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1919. During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries.\nThe second round of Anglo\u2013Afghan negotiations for final peace were inconclusive. Both sides were prepared to agree on Afghan independence in foreign affairs, as provided for in the previous agreement. The two nations disagreed, however, on the issue that had plagued Anglo-Afghan relations for decades and would continue to cause friction for many more \u2014 authority over Pashtun tribes on both sides of the Durand Line. The British refused to concede Afghan control over the tribes on the British side of the line while the Afghans insisted on it. The Afghans regarded the 1921 agreement as only an informal one.\nThe rivalry of the great powers in the region might have remained subdued had it not been for the dramatic change in government in Moscow brought about by the Russian Revolution of 1917. In their efforts to placate Muslims within their borders, the new Soviet leaders were eager to establish cordial relations with neighboring Muslim states. In the case of Afghanistan, the Soviets could achieve a dual purpose: by strengthening relations with the leadership in Kabul, they could also threaten Britain, which was one of the Western states supporting counter-revolution in the Soviet Union. In his attempts to end British control of Afghan foreign policy, Amanullah sent an emissary to Moscow in 1919; Vladimir Lenin received the envoy warmly and responded by sending a Soviet representative to Kabul to offer aid to Am\u0101null\u0101h's government.\nThroughout Am\u0101null\u0101h's reign, Soviet-Afghan relations fluctuated according to Afghanistan's value to the Soviet leadership at a given time; Afghanistan was either viewed as a tool for dealing with Soviet Muslim minorities or for threatening the British. Whereas the Soviets sought Amanullah's assistance in suppressing anti-Bolshevik elements in Central Asia in return for help against the British, the Afghans were more interested in regaining lands across the Amu Darya lost to Russia in the nineteenth century. Afghan attempts to regain the oases of Merv and Panjdeh were easily subdued by the Soviet Red Army.\nIn May 1921, the Afghans and the Soviets signed a Treaty of Friendship, Afghanistan's first international agreement since gaining full independence in 1919. The Soviets provided Amanullah with aid in the form of cash, technology and military equipment. Despite this, Amanullah grew increasingly disillusioned with the Soviets, especially as he witnessed the widening oppression of his fellow Muslims across the border.\nAnglo-Afghan relations soured over British fear of an Afghan-Soviet friendship, especially with the introduction of a few Soviet planes into Afghanistan. British unease increased when Amanullah maintained contacts with Indian nationalists and gave them asylum in Kabul, and also when he sought to stir up unrest among the Pashtun tribes across the border. The British responded by refusing to address Amanullah as \"Your Majesty,\" and imposing restrictions on the transit of goods through India.\nAm\u0101null\u0101h's domestic reforms were no less dramatic than his foreign policy initiatives, but those reforms could not match his achievement of complete, lasting independence. Mahmud Tarzi, Amanullah's father-in-law and Foreign Minister, encouraged the monarch's interest in social and political reform but urged that it be gradually built upon the basis of a strong central government, as had occurred in Turkey under Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. Socially, Amanullah enjoyed many of Mahmud Tarzi's thoughts at the time, such as giving women more rights and allowing freedom of press through publishing. Tarzi, being heavily influenced by the West, brought this influence to Afghanistan \u2013 Amanullah enjoyed Western dress and etiquette. His wife, Queen Soraya Tarzi, became the face of Amanullah Khan's reforms in regard to women.\nAm\u0101null\u0101h's reforms touched on many areas of Afghan life. In 1921 he established an air force, albeit with only a few Soviet planes and pilots; Afghan personnel later received training in France, Italy and Turkey. Although he came to power with army support, Amanullah alienated many army personnel by reducing both their pay and size of the forces and by altering recruiting patterns to prevent tribal leaders from controlling who joined the service. Amanullah's Turkish advisers suggested the king retire the older officers, men who were set in their ways and might resist the formation of a more professional army. Amanullah's minister of war, General Muhammad Nadir Khan, a member of the Musahiban branch of the royal family, opposed these changes, preferring instead to recognize tribal sensitivities. The king rejected Nadir Khan's advice and an anti-Turkish faction took root in the army; in 1924 Nadir Khan left the government to become ambassador to France.\nIf fully enacted, Am\u0101null\u0101h's reforms would have totally transformed Afghanistan. Most of his proposals, however, died with his abdication. His transforming social and educational reforms included: adopting the solar calendar, requiring Western dress in parts of Kabul and elsewhere, discouraging the veiling and seclusion of women, abolishing slavery and forced labor, introducing secular education (for girls as well as boys); adult-education classes and educating nomads. His economic reforms included restructuring, reorganizing and rationalizing the entire tax structure, anti-smuggling and anti-corruption campaigns, a livestock census for taxation purposes, the first budget (in 1922), implementing the metric system (which did not take hold), establishing the Bank-i-Melli (National Bank) in 1928, and introducing the Afghani as the new unit of currency in 1923. The political and judicial reforms Am\u0101null\u0101h proposed were equally radical for the time and included the creation of Afghanistan's first constitution (in 1923), the guarantee of civil rights (first by decree and later constitutionally), national registration and identity cards for the citizenry, the establishment of a legislative assembly, a court system to enforce new secular penal, civil and commercial codes, prohibition of blood money, and abolition of subsidies and privileges for tribal chiefs and the royal family.\nAlthough sharia (Islamic law) was to be the residual source of law, it regained prominence after the Khost rebellion of 1924\u201325. Religious leaders, who had gained influence under Habibullah Khan, were unhappy with Am\u0101null\u0101h's extensive religious reforms. Conventional wisdom holds that the tribal revolt that overthrew Amanullah grew out of opposition to his reform program, although those people most affected by his reforms were urban dwellers not universally opposed to his policies, rather than the tribes. Nevertheless, the king had managed to alienate religious leaders and army members.\nForeign involvement.\nBritish Empire.\nAccording to a later British ambassador in Afghanistan, William Kerr Fraser-Tytler, the British Empire, though officially neutral, was very concerned about the situation in Afghanistan and they \"made up a set of rules to govern the situation. It was unneutral to refuse an Afghan entry into Afghanistan, but once he was in he became a contestant, and it would be unneutral to allow him to recross the border, seeking a brief asylum before plunging again into the fray. And so in a mixture of the rules of cricket and football it was ordained that a player might go on the field once, and play for the crown. But if he was forced into touch, and recrossed the line, whether voluntarily or not, he was 'out' and the referee would not let him back into the game.\"\nNumerous commentators, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, claimed that British intelligence played a part in the fall of Amanullah; a theory which was prominent amongst Soviet historiography. According to \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;While it can not be dismissed out of hand, the fact remains that no evidence to support it can be found in the copious British Indian archives pertaining to this period. There can be no doubt, however, that behind the stance of official neutrality which the British maintained throughout the crisis of 1929 lay an unwillingness to help Am\u0101n-All\u0101h to reconquer his throne and a benevolence toward the moves of N\u0101der Khan. While the Soviet authorities favored Am\u0101n-All\u0101h (though reluctantly) and aided a foray on his behalf by \u1e20ol\u0101m Nab\u012b \u010car\u1e35\u012b in the Bal\u1e35 region, the British authorities allowed N\u0101der Khan to reenter Afghanistan through India and to obtain a decisive addition of strength through his recruitment of thousands of armed Waz\u012br and Mas\u02bf\u016bd frontier tribesmen. Also helpful was their decision to lift a restriction order, imposing residence at a fixed address in India, on Fa\u017cl \u02bfOmar Mojadded\u012b, who was to play an apparently decisive role in persuading the Naq\u0161band\u012b \"moll\u0101\"s of Afghanistan to change sides and later was to become N\u0101der Shah's first minister of justice. In short, while all the evidence indicates that Ba\u010d\u010da-ye Saqq\u0101 [Kalakani]'s rise was due solely to the internal disintegration of King Am\u0101n-All\u0101h's r\u00e9gime, there can be no doubt that British policy, tacit rather than explicit, helped to bring about Ba\u010d\u010da-ye Saqq\u0101's fall\".\nSoviet Union.\nAfter coming to power in Afghanistan, the Saqqawists allowed Basmachi insurgents to operate in northern Afghanistan, who then had established themselves in parts of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakshshan provinces by March 1929. Repeated Basmachi incursions into Soviet territory eventually prompted the start of a Soviet operation in Afghanistan.\nIran.\nThe Iranian military attache, Colonel Ali Khan, was under instruction by Reza Shah to protect the Shiite community of Afghanistan to the greatest possible extent that would not invite a Saqqawist attack on Iran.\nGermany.\nWhile Germany itself was uninvolved in the war, the Afghan-German Trading Company was requested by Kalakani to assassinate Amanullah Khan on 15 April 1929, and were promised a large reward if they did so. However, this assassination never materialized. Ultimately, DACOM was forced out of business due to economic difficulties relating to the 1928-1929 Afghan civil war.\nCourse of the war.\nWar begins (November \u2013 December 1928).\nShinwari revolt.\nThe unraveling began when Shinwari Pashtun tribesmen revolted and besieged Jalalabad on 14 November 1928, cutting telegraph wires and cutting the road to the capital, after which they drew a manifesto of ten grievances, five of which related to what they saw as Amanullah's unsupportable meddling with the status of women. However, during the Shinwari rebellion two years later, the Shinwari claimed that this revolt was \"not so much anti-Amanullah as against the local tax-collectors at Jelalabad\". The initial response of the government was to send a small contingent to relieve Jalalabad, which was halted at Nimla, west of Jalalabad, before that force found itself surrounded and destroyed shortly after. Thereafter, Amanullah sent two representatives to suppress the uprising \u2013 his foreign minister, Ghulam Siddiq Khan, and the head of the National Council, Shayr Ahmad Khan. However, In late November, they had a falling out, and according to Fayz Muhammad, were negotiating separately with the tribes. Ghulam Siddiq is said to have incited some of the Shinwari to attack Shayr Ahmad Khan, the main consequence of which was that the Shinwari burned the Emir's winter palace in Jalalabad to the ground.\nOn 3 December 1928, Amanullah then decided to send his brother-in-law, Ali Ahmad Khan Luynab, to deal with the problem, and sent him off with regular troops, militia levies, and a sizable treasury with which to conciliate the tribal leaders. Ghulam Siddiq and Shayr Ahmad were ordered back to Kabul.\nIn the meantime, calls had gone out for tribal levies to assist the regular army in dealing with the Shinwari uprising, and armed tribesmen from the east, south and west, which included Waziri, Wardak, Ghilzai and Tajik tribesmen, but also more recently the Mangal tribesmen (who recently were at war with Amanullah's government) trickled into the capital to help. These men had no particular loyalty to the government and saw the situation simply as an opportunity for enrichment. As it turned out, there was no need to send them to Jalalabad, Ali Ahmad managed to conciliate the Shinwari leaders and put an end to the uprising, but as it took a while for this news to spread through the countryside, the levy tribesmen continued to arrive in the capital.\nSiege of Jabal al-Siraj.\nAmanullah presumably welcomed the news of the reconciliation. However, any feeling of relief would have been very temporary \u2013 forces led by a Tajik leader, Habibullah Kalakani, were moving toward Kabul from the north. Kalakani was a native of Kalakan, a village thirty kilometers north of Kabul. In late November, they besieged Jabal al-Siraj, north of Kabul, and on either 11 or 12 December, after 18 days of siege, Ahmad Ali Lodi peacefully surrendered the citadel, handing over all government funds as well as 18 machine guns, and an unspecified number of heavy weapons and rifles.\nFirst Battle of Kabul.\nEmboldened by the victory, Kalakani attacked Kabul with 2000 men (only 200 of which were armed with rifles, and the rest armed with sticks and axes) on 14 December 1928. He and his forces entered the Murad Beg Fort on the northern slopes of the Kuh-i Kutal, nearby the village of Khayr Khanah. The rebels, feeling that deposing an emir would be against the shariah, performed a ritual and declared Kalakani the new emir, and then passed through the village of Dih-i Kupak at 3:00 PM. Around 3:15 PM, they reached the Bagh-i Bala park. They also occupied Bagh-i Bala palace, formerly the summer residence of Abdur Rahman Khan, which had now been turned into a military hospital for the Emir's personal guard and the residence of a Turkish physician, Bahjet Beg. After disarming and dismissing the guards and the embassy, they stationed their own guards, reassuring the employees of the embassy that they were guests of the nation and as such no harm would come to them.\nThe rebels also managed to enter the house and fortress tower of Shahr Ara, which was defended by Shawkat Beg, a Turkish officer who was the son of Muhammad Akbar Khan. His small force, as well as a group of cavalry officers, managed to prevent the Rebels from entering the old city.\nAs the battle continued, the whole city was filled the sounds of artillery and gunfire. However, only the cavalry of the Emir's personal guard and a few other loyal soldiers actually put up a fight against Kalakani's forces. The rest of the army was in a mutinous mood, as their officers had been appropriating the soldier's rations. Holding their commanders rather than the rebels to blame for the trouble, when ordered to shoot, the soldiers simply fired their weapons in the air. Tumult and confusion were now widespread. The emir was furious when he heard of the mutiny, and ordered all the weapons to be distributed to the residents of Kabul and to the tribesmen who had come into the city but had not yet left for Jalalabad to fight the Shinwari. However, the near-universal loathing of the Afghans for Amanullah led to the majority of them refusing to take up arms against Kalakani. To make matters worse for Amanullah, Some Waziri, Mangal and Ahmadzai tribesmen defected to Kalakani, took up positions on the Asmai Hill in the center of Kabul, and fired on the Emir's troops.\nGhulam Ghaws, Whose father, Malik Jahandad Ahmadzai, had been executed following a rebellion, headed towards his hometown costs, carrying with him more than 300 rifles, armed the people there, and rose up against the government. Other tribes acted similarly because there was no control over the distribution of weapons.\nThe battle took a drastic turn on 25 December, when Kalakani was wounded in the shoulder from an aerial bomb, causing him to retreat 20 kilometers north, to Murad Beg Fort, in the Kuhdaman region.\nFall of Amanullah's government (January 1929).\nSiege of Murad Beg Fort.\nKalakani's retreat gave Amanullah a chance to regroup. In late December, he began shelling Murad Beg Fort, and this shelling lasted until 13 January. However, the shelling failed to provide any results, and this disheartened the king. In the early morning of 14 January, Amanullah abdicated the throne to his oldest brother, Inayatullah Khan, who ruled for only three days before escaping into exile in British-India. Amanullah's efforts to recover power by leading a small, ill-equipped force toward Kabul failed. The deposed king crossed the border into British-India and went into exile in Italy and remained in Europe until his 1960 death in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. At the time of his abdication, Amanullah's troops were fighting in the Khayr Khanah (Khirskhanah) pass, north of Kabul.\nSecond Battle of Kabul.\nAfter ascending to the Afghan throne, Inayatullah Khan sent a peace envoy to Kalakani. The envoy informed Kalakani that Inayatullah's accession had been illegal in accordance to the shariah, since Kalakani had ascended the throne in the Islamic month of Rajab, and Inayatullah's accession had taken place in the Islamic month of Sha'ban. Rejoiced, Kalakani and 28 armed men, accompanied by a group of unarmed Kuhdamanis passed through the village of Dih-i Afghanan and attacked the capital, shouting \"ya chahar yar\" slogans and firing guns at the air. On the very first day of his reign, Inayatullah was forced to barricade himself in the Arg with several of his ministers.\nOn the 16th of January, while 80 Hazaras from Bihsud were defending the Qalah-i Buland Fortress, as well as the arsenal at Kulula Pasha, some officials declared their allegiance to Kalakani. These included Shayr Ahmad, head of the national council, Fayz Muhammad Khan, former minister of trade, Abd al-Hadi Khan, the minister of finance, and the sons of Abdur Rahman Khan: Mir Hashim, Sardar Amin Allah Khan, Muhammad Umar Khan, as well as a number of deputy ministers and heads of state bureaus.\nOn the 17th of January, Inayatullah, unnerved by the lack of support from the Kabulis, surrendered to Kalakani and abdicated the throne. Kalakani allowed him to peacefully leave Kabul with his family and 3000 rupees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My brother, Habib Allah! It is known to all that i have no wish to be padishah. After the death of my father, I never harbored any desire for the throne. I was compelled to accept it only at the insistence of the leaders who linked my accession to the throne with the prosperity of the people and the strengthening of Islam. But now, as I see the blood of Muslims being shed, I have decided to relinquish my claim to the Afghan Emirate and give you my oath of allegiance like other true-believing Muslims.\u2014\u200a\nKalakani rules Kabul, Saqqawist offensives (February \u2013 August 1929).\nHaving become King of Afghanistan, Kalakani appointed a number of people into office, including:\nOn 9 May, Kalakani passed a decree in Kabul which forbade citizens of Kabul from moving out of the city without permission, even into the government-controlled Bandar-i Arghandah, Charasya, Bini Hisar, Butkhak, Kutal-i Pay Manar, Kutal-i Khayr Khanah, Maydan, Jalriz, Logar, Khurd Kabul, Tangi Gharu or Dih Sabz.\nOn 31 May, Kalakani paid a visit to the shrine at Mazar-i Khwajah Musafir, which lies near the village of Chihil Tan above the village of Shaykh Muhammad Riza-yi Khurasani which lies in the Paghman District, west of Kabul\nKalakani versus Ali Ahmad Khan.\nFollowing his takeover, Kalakani, fearful of a counterattack by the Amanullah loyalists, swiftly moved the treasury to Kudhaman.\nThe first concerted opposition to Kalakani came from Ali Ahmad Khan, who was still stationed in Jalalabad after suppressing the Shinwari revolt. There, the locals proclaimed Ali as the new Emir upon receiving the news of Kalakani's accession. Ali then marched his troops on Samucha-i Mulla Omar, Tangi Khurd Kabul, and Chanri, and took up positions there. At the head of a 2,000 men strong army and a tribal militia, he marched to Jagdalak, where he waited for a force of Mohmands who had promised to join him. Over the course of 23 to 29 January, Ali sent out proclamations of his new emirate to Kabul, Logar, the Hazarahjat, the Southern province, and elsewhere, and called on people to join him.\nMalik Qays of the Khugyani tribe, who had initially allied himself with Ali, defected to Kalakani, captured Ali and brought Ali to Kalakani in exchange for 17,000 rupees and the rank of lieutenant general, ending Ali's reign on 9 February.\nKalakani versus anti-Saqqawist tribes.\nSometime before 13 March, the Battle of Shaykhabad took place, from Kabul and halfway across the Kabul-Ghazni road.\nIt was here where Karim Khan Wardak, who refused to pledge allegiance to Kalakani, had made defensive preparations. Around this time, Abd al-Wakil Khan, who had earlier been appointed field marshal by Kalakani, was dispatched to Ghazni and Qandahar with a force of 3,000 men. When Abd al-Wakil reached the village of Bini Badam and Qalah-i Durrani, from Kabul, he halted there to deal with Karim Khan Wardak's forces, only then to proceed. But Karim Khan, along with Wazir and Hazara leaders who had gathered in support of Aman Allah, sent a joint message to the field marshal that said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We, the peoples of the region of Wardak, consider ourselves subjects of Amir Habib Allah. However, since we have yet to send him our oaths of allegiance, we fear that if his army should come it might be to attack us and plunder our property. But if he shows forgiveness and agrees to these four conditions, we will not stand in the way of your victorious army. Our conditions are the following: \nOnce your army has passed through, we promise to go to Kabul and offer our oath of allegiance to the Amir with sincere hearts.\u2014\u200a\nAbd al-Wakil accepted this message at face value, and he sent the Model Battalion, which at the time numbered 1,800 men and was stationed at Qal ah-yi Durrani, to march on Shaykhabad along with 400 royal cavalry and 800 Kuhistani and Kuhdamani infantry militia which had halted near the village of Bini Badam. After an exhausting march through snow-covered hills, Abd al-Wakil's forces were ambushed near Zarani, at the edge of the Daht-i Tup waste land by Wardak tribesmen, who came thundering down the hills after a soldier's shot at a bird alerted them that Kalakani's troops were nearby. Many of Abd al-Wakil's troops were killed in the ambush; only 20 of 400 cavalrymen survived.\nThe people of Maydan, Jalriz and Sanglakh refused to offer allegiance to Kalakani, and formed an alliance with the Wardak and surrounded Kalakani's armies in Maydan, and defeated them in Qalah-i Durrani, before advancing to Arghandah, west of Kabul, where some Kalakani's forced decided to retreat toward Qalah-i Qazi, Chardihi and Kuhdaman.\nOn 5:30 on 22 March, Kalakani personally headed from Kabul to Arghandah to bolster the spirits of his soldiers and managed to convince the soldiers to advance on Kutal-i Shaykh, a small village near the intersection with the road west to the Unay Pass. They accepted, and the battle of Kutal-i Shaykh lasted until the evening with a victory for Kalakani.\nIn the morning of 23 March, Kalakani ordered 500 militiamen to be brought back to Kabul from Najrab, because they had been fighting against the Tagabis and Kalakani was worried that Najrab might defect. On 24 March, Kalakani ordered some Kuhdamanis, Kuhistanis, and people from the villages of Dih-i Nur, Maydan and Arghandah to cover the army rear which was then at Qalah-i Durrani and Pul-i Maydan and so deny those awaiting its defeat the chance to march on Chardihi and Kuhdaman. Later that same day, Kalakani's Field Marshall, Purdil Khan (who had since been named as Minister of Defense) shelled Maydan, which strengthened the resolve among the Maydan, Arghandah and Sanglakjh to fight Kalakani. On the 25th, Purdil Khan managed to capture Maydan, but the great casualties inflicted prevented him from advancing towards Wardak and Ghazni, and he withdrew to Arghandah and Qalah the following day.\nKalakani versus the returned Amanullah.\nAt this time, Amanullah had supposedly returned to Afghanistan and was marching from Qandahar with an army made of Durrani, Khattak, Ghilzai, and Hazara fighters. Four days after entering Afghanistan, Amanullah learnt of a Saqqawist uprising in Herat. On 27 March, Habibullah Kalakani ordered his brother, Hamid Allah Kalakani, to lead a force of Panjshiris backed by 14 siege guns, to Maydan. At Kutal-i Shaykh, this force won a major victory which allowed it to continue advancing towards Maydan, where it took 25 prisoners and destroyed several forts. On the night of the 28th, anti-Saqqawist tribesmen ambushed Hamid Allah's force, and while they were able to deal vast casualties and capture many field guns and rifles, they were unable to dislodge Hamid from his position. On the 30th, the anti-Saqqawist tribes renewed the battle, and this time they managed to almost completely expel Hamid Allah's forces from Maydan, except for a few detachments which were surrounded in the fortress known as Qalah-i Abd al-Ghani Khan Beg Samandi, about west of Shaykhabad. A large part of Hamid's defeated army retreated to Arghandah and Qalah-i Qazi.\nOn the 31st, Kalakani started another offensive on Maydan and made some progress. On 2 April, a force from Bihsuf occupied the Unay Pass and reached an agreement with the militias of the Surkh-i Parsa, Turkman, Bamyan, Balkhab and Shaykh Ali Hazarah for them to attack Kuhistan and Kuhdaman via the Ghurband Valley road while it simultaneously attacks Kabul via the road through Maydan. On 3 April, Kalakani's forces clashed in Shash Gaw, north of Ghazni. On 7 April they were defeated while advancing along the road not so far from Ghazni near Shiniz in Wardak. On 7 April, they clashed at Shiniz, and on the 9th they clashed in Shaykhabad and Jaghatu, northwest of Ghazni. Fayz Muhammed reports that Kalakani suffered a major defeat near Ghazni on 9 April and that his forces fled to Qalah-i Durrani, but historian Robert D. McChesney believes this to be false. By the 12th, there were rumours in Kabul that Ghazni was surrounded by anti-Saqqawist forces. In mid-March, Mohammed Nadir Shah, who had departed from France in January, arrived in Jalalabad to centralize the opposition to Kalakani. It was reported on 16 April that Ghazni had fallen to anti-Saqqawist forces, and that Kalakani's forces had been defeated at Shaykh Amir, near the Majid Pass. By the 20th, there were reports that anti-Saqqawist forces were on the doorstep of Paghman, just west of Kabul, and that Hazarah forces from Bihsud crossed the Unay pass and were heading on their way to Ghurband, while another force occupied positions there to prevent Kalakani from using it to cross to Hazarahjat. The force sent to Ghazni retreated to Shiniz-i Wardak. On the 21st, soldiers loyal to Kalakani left Kabul to reinforce Ghazni. At this time, Kalakani decided to reinforce the Qalah-i Durrani fort to prevent rebel tribes from advancing past it. On the 24th, Kalakani's forces were clashing in Shash Gaw, northwest of Ghazni. On the 26th, while laying siege to Ghazni, Amanullah had inexplicably given the order to retreat to Qandahar. On the 28th, it was reported that Kalakani's army had captured Ghazni. On 30 April, anti-Saqqawist forces re-entered Ghazni, renewing the battle. The same day, a large anti-Saqqawist offensive managed to dislodge Kalakani's forces from positions in Shaykhabad, Takiya and Shash Gaw, forcing some of them to retreat towards Daht-i Tup. On 1 May, anti-Saqqawist forces continued their offensive, clashing in Dasht-i Tup and Shaykhabad, and on 2 May fighting was taking place in Shaykhabad, Dasht-i Tup and Qalah-yi Durrani. On 7 May, units were sent from Kabul to Mahtab and Arghandah to prepare defenses there. On 8 May, while there was fighting in Dasht-i Tup and Bini Badam, Saqqawist forces under Purdil Khan departed for Charikar. One of Kalakani's generals, Muhammad Unar Khan, died on 14 May. The next day, Kalakani sent units to Kuh-i Asmai and Shayr Darwazah. On the 19th, Amanullah was rumoured to be besieged at Kalat, north of Qandahar. On the 23rd, Amanullah Khan fled Afghanistan into the British Raj, leaving his brother Inayatullah Khan in charge of anti-Saqqawist resistance. By that time, Kalakani held control of the entire Ghazni region, and the road south of Ghazni as open. By 1 June, anti-Saqqawist forces who at this time were at Qarabagh decided to retreat Qandahar, while Kalakani's armies were able to take Kalat and had surrounded the city of Qandahar, which duly fell on 3 June or 31 May.\nKalakani versus Nadir.\nOn 8 March, Nadir Khan crossed into Afghanistan just east of Matun in the Kurram Valley. On 16 March, Kalakani dispatched troops in two directions: along the route to Maydan through Qalah-i Mahtab Bagh, Qalah-i Durrani, Qalah-i Qazi, and Arghandah, and via Charasya and Musai to Logar. 129 troops were also dispatched by Kalakani to the Logar Valley, which were defeated at Waghjan Gorge (Between Kushi in Kulangar and Shikar Qalah), forcing them to retreat to Rishkhur, south of Kabul. On 23 March, heavy fighting was occurring in Najrab, north of Kabul. The next day, 500 of Kalakani's troops who were marching from Charasya to Kulangar were ambushed, with many killed or wounded.\nBy 31 March, there were some reversals for Kalakani on the Maydan front. On 23 March, 6000 Mangal tribesmen joined Nadir Khan at Khost. Four days later, he left for Urgun, which he reached on 5 April. A few days later, he took Baladah, and on the 15th he captured Gardez. On the 23rd, Nadir was residing in Safid Qalah, at the southern entrance of the Altamur (or Tirah) pass. On the 24th, he continued through the pass to Charkh, where he was confronted by a force sent by Kalakani. After initial success in capturing the village of Dabar in Charkh, he was ultimately forced to retreat to Sijinak, east of Gardiz on the 27th. On the 22nd, Kalakani sent troops to Logar to defend it against Nadir, whose forces captured Dubandi and the village of Kushi that same day. On the 23rd there were rumours in Kabul that Kalakani's armies had been defeated and forced to retreat to Qalah-i Durrani on the Maydan-Ghazni road. On the 23rd, Nadir reached the Waghjan Gorge. On the 24th, there were rumours in Kabul that Nadir's forces had entered the village of Aghujan, south of Kabul. On the 25th, Nadir reached Hisarak in the Logar valley, and on that same day it was rumoured that he had suffered a defeat in a battle at Tirah Pass. On 1 May, while a battle in the Southern province had been going on for three days, Kalakani's forces carried out a raid on Khushi in Logar and plundered its inhabitants. By 3 May, Nadir had established a fort at Surkhab and was harassing Kalakani's troops to prevent Kalakani from advancing into the Southern province. On the sixth, Kalakani sent new troops to Charikar. On the 11th there were rumours that Nadir arrived in Charkh in Logar. Robert D. McChesney believes this to be false, and says this was just wishful thinking. On 8 May, Hashim (Nadir Khan's brother) persuaded tribes of the Eastern province to unite against Kalakani, who agreed to raise 40,000 troops who would advance in three formations through Tagab, Tangi Gharu, Ghakari and Lataband to attack Kuhdaman, Kuhistan and Kabul. That same day, Nadir's forces reached the region of Pul-i Hashim Khayl in Gandamak and at Tagab made plans to continue further down the road. On 11 May pro-Nadir tribes moved on Kabul but were stopped by Saqqawist Shinwari at Surkhrud. On 12 May there were rumours that Nadir had inflicted a defeat upon Kalakani at Bidak. On 15 May Nadir crossed the Tirah Pass and began an incursion into the Logar valley, which continued the 16th, when Nadir pursued the local Saqqawist forces as far as Kulangar, Kutti Khayl and Muhammad Aghah, and was fighting over control of the Ghurband Valley. Also on the 16th, Nadir reached Khak-i Jabbar via the road through Hisarak. On the 23rd, when peace negotiations were ongoing, Kalakani sent a force of 300 men to Logar. On 26 June, Kalakani's forces recaptured Gardiz.\nOn 14 July, Nadir Khan's forces entered the Logar valley, won a victory at Padkhwab-i Rughani and from there, advanced on Surkhab where they surrounded and besieged one of Kalakani's forces at Kariz-i Darwish, which surrendered the next day. On 18 July, Kalakani's forces fought a battle with the Khugyani near Khurd Kabul. In order to get the upper hand in the battle, Kalakani confiscated all automobiles and horse carriages in Kabul, so that reinforcements could arrive more quickly. This plan worked, and on 19 July the situation was stabilized. On 18 August, Nadir moved his headquarters to Ali Khayl with the Jaji tribe, which had assured him of their unswerving loyalty.\nThe Tagab Front.\nSometime before 17 March, anti-Saqqawist tribes from Tagab launched a surprise attack on Sarubi and Gugamandan, opening what Robert D. McChesney labels \"The Tagab Front\". This attack took the local garrisons by surprise and allowed the Tagabis to capture two cannons, weaponry and other military supplies. After this success, the Tagabis planned a northward assault on Jamal Afgha in Kuhistan, which was successfully undertaken on the 18th. On 23 March, people of Durnama, Sujnan and Bulaghin attacked the Tagabis, defeated them, and occupied their positions, which stabilized the Tagab Front. On 1 April, prisoners arrived from Tagab.\nOn 2 August, the Tagab front was re-opened following a local uprising. On 12 August, after days of skirmishes, Kalakani's forces launched a large counteroffensive and forced the Tagabis to surrender the next day. This ended the Tagab front.\nThe Ghurband Front.\nOn 2 April, there were rumours in Kabul that anti-Saqqawist Hazaras had occupied positions in Balkh, while others were able to march on Aqchah, Andkhuy, Maymanah and Mazar-i Sharif. On the 7th, anti-Saqqawist forces arrived in Siyahgird in Ghurband. On the 17th, Sayyid Hussayn had left for Charikar. anti-Saqqawist forces closed the road in the Ghurband valley leading to Kuhistan and Kuhdaman, and on the 18th they had reportedly reached Ghurband. On the 19th, a counteroffensive by Ghulam Rasul Khan against the Hazaras was called off by Kalakani, who wanted instead to focus on Charikar, which was reportedly under attack by local anti-Saqqawist partisans. On the 20th, Sayyid Husayn left for Charikar, where he ambushed and killed Ata Muhammed, whose fianc\u00e9e Sayyid had taken as a wife in the years prior, for which Ata Muhammed had sworn to kill him. On the 26th, word spread in Kabul that Hazara units had reached Katan mountain, west of Shakar Dara, and from there captured the Khudamani villages of Shakar Darra, Farza, Ghaza, Saray Khwajah, and Charikar. On the 27th, anti-Saqqawist Hazaras reportedly attacked Farza, Shakar Darra and Istalif (towns in Kuhdaman). That same day, in response to Hazara advances, Kalakani sent Hamid Allah on a counteroffensive which succeeded forcing the Hazaras to pull back. However, the situation remained dire for Kalakani and on 3 May he withdrew troops and munitions from other fronts to reinforce the Ghurband front. On 4 May, on the same day which Amanullah withdrew from Wardak, there were rumours in Kabul that Sayyid Husayn, one of Kalakani's generals, had made a breakthrough in Ghurband, and on the next day he reportedly was marching on Mazar-i Sharif via the road through Qunduz. Before this march on Mazar-i Sharif, the city had earlier been the site of a mutiny by Kuhistani and Kuhdamani forces, which began in January after Kalakani captured Kabul, and was ended on 30 April by anti-Saqqawist forces. It's after this point that sources disagree \u2013 Faiz Mohammad records the mutineers of Mazar-i Sharif retreating to Herat and capturing it sometime before 15 May, while Ademec says that Herat was captured sometime after Saqqawist forces captured Mazar-i Sharif in June, after Amanullah left Afghanistan for the British Raj, and then gradually extended their control to Maymanah and then Herat.\nOn 10 May, word had spread in Kabul that Ghulam Jalani Khan had occupied Andarab and Khanabad in Qataghan and the governor of Qataghan-Badakhshan Province, Mir Baba Sahib Charikari had been killed. On 9 or 10 May, Sayyid Husayn suffered a severe setback in the Battle of Shibar Pass, where his 12,000-man strong army was routed by a local Hazara militia which sought revenge for destruction of cattle, which ended Sayyid's hopes of taking Mazar-i Sharif. On May 12, Sayyid found himself besieged in Kuhistan and was reportedly wounded. On that same day, one of Kalakani's generals, Abd Al-Wakil Khan captured Fayzabad in Badakhshan while some of his units reached Farjaghan (at the head of the Alishang Valley near Tagab and Najrab). Also on 12 May anti-Saqqawist forces won a victory in a battle near Pul-i Matak after marching on Tagab. On 13 May 900 men from Kalakani's army were captured in Ghurband after a brief battle. On the 14th, another 2000 Saqqawist soldiers were defeated and their weapons, materiel and ammunition was seized.\nOn the 15th, Sayyid Husayn began another offensive against anti-Saqqawist forces, but after taking the Pansjir Valley on the 15th he was stopped at the Khawak Pass on the 16th. On the 19th, there were rumours in Kabul that Sayyid Husayn had died and that anti-Saqqawist forces had marched on Charikar, which Robert D. McChesney believes to be either highly exaggerated or completely false. On the 26th, Sayyid Husayn returned to Kabul alive and well, dispelling rumours about his death, and by the beginning of June, the routes via the Ghurband Valley and the Salang and Khawak Passes were firmly in the hands of Kalakani. On 29 May, 2300 men were sent north to reinforce the Ghurband front. On 31 May, Kalakani's army, which had advanced as far as Bamyan en route to Mazar-i Sharif had been routed and forced to retreat to Jabal al-Siraj. On 11 April, Nadir arrived in Khushi in the Logar valley. On 20 April, the son of Abd Allah Khan Tukhi, whose brother, Ata Muhammad, had raised a rebellion in Mazar-i Sharif against Kalakani, was hanged in Kabul. On 7 May 12,000 anti-Saqqawist forces occupied the Unay Pass and the Safidkhak Pass, while others were positioned on the lower slopes of the Paghman and Shakar Darrah. At this time, various anti-Saqqawist tribes planned a coordinated assault on Kabul. However, ethnic differences and poor communications led the attack to never materialize. On 2 June, Kalakani sent troops to Sar-i Chashmah, where they were ordered not to fire on anyone who swears allegiance as long as they were unarmed. On 23 May, Amanullah left Afghanistan for a last time, never to return. That same day, Kalakani sent 6500 men to conquer the Hazarahjat. Sometime before 19 June, Kalakani's forces won a victory at Bamyan, where they at first found themselves encircled, before the commander of the besieging Hazara forces was bribed to retreat. As of 23 June, anti-Saqqawist forces continued to occupy the Unay pass. As of 27 June, anti-Saqqawist forces had advanced from the Unay Pass towards Sar-i Chashmah. On 28 June, Kalakani's forces fought an offensive battle against Hazara militias at Qalah-i Karim. After capturing the village and burning it to the ground, they were ambushed by Hazaras who were subsequently driven off with artillery fire and forced to retreat into the mountains. After this victory, Kalakani's forces took control of the Unay Pass. On 29 June, Kalakani's forces advanced on Qalah-i Yurt. On 30 June, Kalakani's forces advanced toward Qalah-i Yurt after getting as far as Jawqul. On 1 July, Kalakani's forces looted homes in Takana, Jalriz and Kuhnah Khumar. On 2 July, Kalakani's forces suffered a defeat at Jawqul and were forced to retreat to Sar-i Chashmah, and then to Chandawul through Bazar-i Sar-i Chawk, Baghban Kuchan and Chandawul. On 3 July, Hamid Allah renewed the offensive, but was beaten back after being surrounded by Hazara militias, and was then pursued on his retreat as far as Sar-i Chashmah. As of 8 July, the Hazaras continued to fight Kalakani's forces and attacked a 5,000-man regiment, forcing them to retreat to Jalriz. However, the Hazarahs did not follow up this victory with an attack on Kabul \u2013 Robert D. McChesney points out that politics in Afghanistan tend to be extremely local, and once the Hazarahs secured control of their own regions, they had little interest in fighting for more territory.\nOn 10 July, Umar Khan promised to Kalakani that he would take upon himself the task of either forcing the Hazara's submission or crushing them. Faiz Mohammad quotes him as saying \"Purdil Khan has taken Ghazni and captured Qandahar; Major General Muhammad Siddiq and Abd al-Qayyum Ibrahim Khayl Paghmani have advanced toward the Southern Province; and Muhammad Umar General Sur-i Satranj has defeated the opposition in numerous battles. I don't want to lose ground to my peers here. I should be able to make short work of the Hazarahs and extract their submission.\" He set off for Jalriz and linked up with soldiers who had been recently been skirmishing with Hazaras, won a victory at Sar-i Chasmah and conducted operations as far as Takana. However, success soon stalled, and after being wounded in the leg, Umar was forced to retreat, leaving the Hazaras to re-occupy all lost territory.\nOn 17 July, Hazara militias attacked Saqqawist forces in the Unay Pass and Qalah-i Safid, routing them and pursuing them to Takana and Jalriz. From 25 to 29 July, fighting took place in Jalriz, however on 30 July the Hazaras withdrew from Jalriz back to the Hazarahjat after they heard that Nadir suffered setbacks in the eastern province, which, for the time being, ended the Hazara's hopes of joining Nadir in a multi-pronged offensive toward Kabul. On 1 August the Hazaras began another offensive, attacking Qalah-i Majid (near Siyah Baghal) and Qalah-i Safid, a fort in the Unay Pass, chasing Kalakani's forces as far as Jalriz once again. On 3 August, Kalakani's forces were reportedly defeated at Jalriz once again. On 15 August, Hazara militias launched an offensive against Turkmen tribes who had pledged allegiance to Kalakani on 31 July, occupying positions in Darrah-i Suf, Kuh-i Shadyan and Marmal, and besieged fort Dih Dadi (a garrison village midway between the site of ancient balkh and Mazar-i Sharif).\nSaqqawist collapse, end of the Civil War (August \u2013 October 1929).\nOn 18 August, an anti-Saqqawist uprising took place in Bamyan, Ghuri and Baghlan, blocking Kalakani's force's route to Turkistan and forcing them to retreat to Ghurband. On 21 August, the Sayyid of Shaykh Ali launched an offensive against Kalakani, advancing as far as Khanabad, Andarab and Ghurband. On 26 August, there were rumours in Kabul that Hazara settlers successfully attacked Mazar-i Sharif. In early September, the Saqqawists won their last victory by taking Jalalabad. On 23 September, a pro-Nadir uprising in Kandahar succeeded at driving out Kalakani's forces from the city. On 29 September, a pro-Nadir force under Shah Wali crossed the Durand Line and occupied Khushi. On the 30th, he sent a 1000-man force ahead to Tangi Waghjan, the gorge on the road to the Logar Valley. On 3 October, after an intense battle, anti-Saqqawist forces captured the town of Muhammad Aghah, placing themselves within striking distance of Kabul.\nKalakani himself took part in this battle, trying to lift his soldier's spirits, to no avail. anti-Saqqawist forces continued to slowly push towards Kabul, seizing Charasya, Chihil Tan and Chihil Sutun on 5 October. By 7 October, Kalakani's forces had retreated from almost all territory outside Kabul, and prepared for their last stand. On 9 October, after dozens of hours of street fighting in Kabul, the Arg was put under siege. On 13 October, after several days of bombardment, Nadir's forces entered the Arg, and after a short but fierce battle, captured it, ending the civil war. Upon hearing this news, a small contingent of Kalakani's army which was besieged at Jabal al-Siraj resolved to surrender that same day.\nAftermath.\nOn 15 October, Mohammed Nadir Shah arrived in Kabul after hearing word of Kalakani's defeat. On the 16th, Nadir entered the Dilkusha Palace, expressing his gratitude to those who had backed him. He acknowledged Amanullah Khan\u2019s contributions to the country and, citing his own poor health, made it clear that he had no personal ambition for the throne. Instead, he pledged to support whoever the national Jerga (tribal council) selected as the next ruler. However, the assembled tribal leaders were adamant that Nader himself should take the crown. Raising their rifles, they warned that if he refused, they would abandon Kabul. Faced with their unwavering insistence, Nader Khan ultimately accepted the responsibility and became the king of Afghanistan.\nNadir considered pardoning Kalakani, but pressure from loyal tribes led him to execute Kalakani on 1 November 1929. Kalakani, his brother, and 9 others were lined up against the west wall of the Arg and shot. During the reign of Nadir, the Saqqawists attempted another uprising, the Kuhistan rebellion (July 1930), which was crushed within a week. Saqqawist activity continued until 1931, when Nadir led a campaign to conquer their final holdout, Herat.\nAs king, Nadir realized that his earlier opposition to Amanullah's reforms had been vindicated by the civil war. Instead of reinstating the reforms that Kalakani had repealed, Nadir worked to complete the abolition of Amanullah's reforms, strengthening the power of tribal leaders and clerics.\nPro-Amanullah factions in Afghanistan felt betrayed by Nadir's assumption of power, having fought the Saqqawists under the presumption that Amanullah would retake the throne upon their victory. Nadir's strengthening of Anglo-Afghan ties (which included support for British sovereignty over Pashtuns east of the Durand line, and lack of support for the Afridi Redshirt Rebellion) was also a sore point for Afghanistan's Amanites. Hafizullah Emadi (2010) describes the Amanullah loyalists as nationalist and progressive forces. They led several rebellions: The first of these, the Shinwari rebellion and the Kuhistan rebellion (February\u2013April 1930), occurred in 1930. In 1938, there was also the Ghilzai rebellion.\nIn the 1940s, Mohammed Zahir Shah faced several tribal revolts, and the leader of the Zadran revolt, Mazrak Zadran, sought to restore Amanullah. During World War II, western press reported that Amanullah Khan was working as an agent for Nazi Germany in Berlin. It is believed he was involved in plans to regain his throne with Axis help.\nAccording to \"Resort to war: a data guide to inter-state, extra-state, intra-state, and non-state wars, 1816\u20132007\", both sides suffered 7500 combat deaths during the civil war.\nHuman rights abuses.\nBy the Saqqawists.\nDuring the Afghan Civil War, there were incidents of rape and looting among Saqqawist troops. One such incident took place on 28 June 1929, when Saqqawists attacked the Hazara settlement of Qalah-i Karim, looting anything movable and driving off livestock. Another incident, which took place on 23 July 1929, was described by contemporary Afghan historian Fayz Muhammad as follows:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Today, the Shiite sayyid Abu'l-Qasim, who had a house and plot of land in Takanah, prepared loaves of bread made from one and a half Kabuli seers of flour, a skin of fresh buttermilk, some oil, and a roasted sheep he had slaughtered at midday. He set off with the food to offer it to Habib Allah and his bandits who were hungry and thirsty. When the sayyid approached the leader of the thieves, he was asked who he was and where he came from. A Sunni Tajik from Jalriz, blinded by a savage, fanatical hatred for all Shiites, said he was a Shiite sayyid as well as a partisan who the night before had given shelter in his fort to a Hazarah, the son of Shah Nur. When he heard this, Habib Allah was enraged. Without thinking, he fired seven shots from his pistol into the sayyid although what he should have done was thank him for the desperately needed bread, meat, oil and buttermilk he had brought. Habib Allah then ordered his home burned to the ground and his belongings confiscated. He handed his two wives and his betrothed daughter over to the Kuhdamanis. Hamid Allah, the tyrant's younger brother, came running from the battlefield to participate in torching the fort, ransacking the sayyid's belongings, and seizing his wives and children. Tearing an eight-month old son from its mother, he grabbed the baby by the feet and threw him to the ground with all his might, killing the infant. The Tajiks of Jalriz and Takanah dragged off everything from the sayyid's house. Since he had been quite well off, each Tajik made off with a substantial amount.\u2014\u200a\nBy the anti-Saqqawists.\nFollowing the anti-Saqqawist capture of Kabul in October 1929, Kabul was sacked by Nadir's forces. Some sources state that this sacking had been authorized by Nadir, but this is contested by historian Vartan Gregorian.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By all evidence, there is no justification for such an assertion (and that evidence includes the testimony of Andr\u00e9e Viollis, the only foreign correspondent in Kabul at the time). It appears rather than the plundering took place during the five days preceding Nadir's entry into the city, and that it was not officially condoned. Indeed, Nadir had issued a manifesto specifically ordering the tribesmen, under penalty of death, to respect the lives and property of foreigners. His orders were simply ignored.\u2014\u200a\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If the function is total, it is also called a total recursive function (sometimes shortened to recursive function). In computability theory, it is shown that the \u03bc-recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by Turing machines (this is one of the theorems that supports the Church\u2013Turing thesis). The \u03bc-recursive functions are closely related to primitive recursive functions, and their inductive definition (below) builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions. However, not every total recursive function is a primitive recursive function\u2014the most famous example is the Ackermann function.\nOther equivalent classes of functions are the functions of lambda calculus and the functions that can be computed by Markov algorithms.\nThe subset of all \"total\" recursive functions with values in {0,1} is known in computational complexity theory as the complexity class R.\nDefinition.\nThe \u03bc-recursive functions (or general recursive functions) are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number. They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the initial functions and is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and the minimization operator \u03bc.\nThe smallest class of functions including the initial functions and closed under composition and primitive recursion (i.e. without minimisation) is the class of primitive recursive functions. While all primitive recursive functions are total, this is not true of partial recursive functions; for example, the minimisation of the successor function is undefined. The primitive recursive functions are a subset of the total recursive functions, which are a subset of the partial recursive functions. For example, the Ackermann function can be proven to be total recursive, and to be non-primitive.\nPrimitive or \"basic\" functions:\nOperators (the domain of a function defined by an operator is the set of the values of the arguments such that every function application that must be done during the computation provides a well-defined result):\nIntuitively, minimisation seeks\u2014beginning the search from 0 and proceeding upwards\u2014the smallest argument that causes the function to return zero; if there is no such argument, or if one encounters an argument for which f is not defined, then the search never terminates, and formula_24 is not defined for the argument formula_25\nWhile some textbooks use the \u03bc-operator as defined here, others demand that the \u03bc-operator is applied to \"total\" functions f only. Although this restricts the \u03bc-operator as compared to the definition given here, the class of \u03bc-recursive functions remains the same, which follows from Kleene's Normal Form Theorem (see below). The only difference is, that it becomes undecidable whether a specific function definition defines a \u03bc-recursive function, as it is undecidable whether a computable (i.e. \u03bc-recursive) function is total.\nThe \"strong equality\" relation formula_26 can be used to compare partial \u03bc-recursive functions. This is defined for all partial functions \"f\" and \"g\" so that\nformula_27 \nholds if and only if for any choice of arguments either both functions are defined and their values are equal or both functions are undefined.\nExamples.\nExamples not involving the minimization operator can be found at Primitive recursive function#Examples.\nThe following examples are intended just to demonstrate the use of the minimization operator; they could also be defined without it, albeit in a more complicated way, since they are all primitive recursive.\nThe following examples define general recursive functions that are not primitive recursive; hence they cannot avoid using the minimization operator.\nTotal recursive function.\nA general recursive function is called total recursive function if it is defined for every input, or, equivalently, if it can be computed by a total Turing machine. There is no way to computably tell if a given general recursive function is total - see \"Halting problem\".\nEquivalence with other models of computability.\nIn the equivalence of models of computability, a parallel is drawn between Turing machines that do not terminate for certain inputs and an undefined result for that input in the corresponding partial recursive function.\nThe unbounded search operator is not definable by the rules of primitive recursion as those do not provide a mechanism for \"infinite loops\" (undefined values).\nNormal form theorem.\nA normal form theorem due to Kleene says that for each \"k\" there are primitive recursive functions formula_28 and formula_29 such that for any \u03bc-recursive function formula_30 with \"k\" free variables there is an \"e\" such that\nformula_31.\nThe number \"e\" is called an \"index\" or \"G\u00f6del number\" for the function \"f\". A consequence of this result is that any \u03bc-recursive function can be defined using a single instance of the \u03bc operator applied to a (total) primitive recursive function.\nMinsky observes the formula_32 defined above is in essence the \u03bc-recursive equivalent of the universal Turing machine:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To construct U is to write down the definition of a general-recursive function U(n, x) that correctly interprets the number n and computes the appropriate function of x. to construct U directly would involve essentially the same amount of effort, \"and essentially the same ideas\", as we have invested in constructing the universal Turing machine\nSymbolism.\nA number of different symbolisms are used in the literature. An advantage to using the symbolism is a derivation of a function by \"nesting\" of the operators one inside the other is easier to write in a compact form. In the following the string of parameters formula_33 is abbreviated as formula_34:\n e.g. formula_37\n e.g. formula_38\n formula_41, where\n formula_42,\n formula_43, etc.\n formula_49 \n e.g. formula_50\nIf we are given\n formula_59\n then\n formula_60\nIn a similar manner, but without the sub- and superscripts, B-B-J write: \n formula_61\n* base step: formula_64\n* induction step: formula_65\n Example: primitive recursion definition of formula_66\n* base step: formula_67U(a)\n* induction step:formula_68\n formula_69\n formula_70\n\"Example\": Kleene gives an example of how to perform the recursive derivation of formula_71 (notice reversal of variables formula_72 and formula_73).

Director Erich von Stroheim once called him \"the world's greatest director\".\nEarly life.\nBorn 15 January 1893 in 58 Grosvenor Square, Rathmines, Dublin, Ireland, (where a plaque commemorates his birth), Ingram was educated at Saint Columba's College, near Rathfarnham, County Dublin. He spent much of his adolescence living in the Old Rectory, Kinnitty, Birr, County Offaly, where his father, Reverend Francis Hitchcock, was the Church of Ireland rector. Ingram emigrated to the United States in 1911.\nHis brother Francis joined the British Army and fought during World War I, during which he was awarded the Military Cross.\nCareer.\nIngram studied sculpture at the Yale University School of Art, where he contributed to campus humour magazine \"The Yale Record\". He soon moved into film, first taking acting work in 1913 and then writing, producing and directing. His first work as producer-director was in 1916 on the romantic drama \"The Great Problem\". He worked for Edison Studios, Fox Film Corporation, Vitagraph Studios, and then MGM, directing mainly action or supernatural films.\nHe moved to Metro in 1920, where he was under the supervision of executive June Mathis. Mathis and Ingram would go on to make four films together: \"Hearts Are Trumps\", \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\", \"The Conquering Power\", and \"Turn to the Right\". It is believed the two were romantically involved. Ingram and Mathis had begun to grow distant when her new find, Rudolph Valentino, began to overshadow Ingram's own fame. Their relationship ended when Ingram eloped with Alice Terry in 1921.\nIngram married twice, first to actress Doris Pawn in 1917; this ended in divorce in 1920. He then married Alice Terry in 1921, with whom he remained for the rest of his life. Both marriages were childless. He and Terry relocated to the French Riviera in 1923. They formed a small studio in Nice and made several films on location in North Africa, Spain, and Italy, for MGM and others.\nAmong those who worked for Ingram at MGM on the Riviera during this period was the young Michael Powell, who later directed (with Emeric Pressburger) \"The Red Shoes\" and other classics, and technician Leonti Planskoy. By Powell's own account, Ingram was a major influence on him, especially in regard to the themes of illusion, dreaming, magic and the surreal. David Lean said he was indebted to Ingram. MGM studio chief Dore Schary listed the top creative people in Hollywood as D. W. Griffith, Ingram, Cecil B. DeMille and Erich von Stroheim (in declining order of importance).\nCarlos Clarens writes: \"As Rex Ingram's films became more esoteric, his career declined. The coming of sound forced him to relinquish his studios in Nice. Rather than equip them for talking pictures, he chose instead to travel and pursue a writing career.\"\nIngram made only one sound film: \"Baroud\", filmed for Gaumont British Pictures in Morocco. The film was not a commercial success; he then left the movie business, returning to Los Angeles to work as a sculptor and writer.\nIngram converted to Islam in 1933, having held an interested in the religion as early as 1927.\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1651 Vine Street.\nDeath.\nIngram died of a cerebral hemorrhage in North Hollywood on 21 July 1950, aged 58. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\nLegacy.\nCritic Carlos Clarens wrote of Ingram: \"A full-blown Irishman fascinated by the bizarre and the grotesque (he once employed a dwarf as a valet), Ingram was also a writer of some talent. Frequently pedestrian and pretentious, Ingram's films nevertheless contain splendid flashes of macabre fantasy, such as the ride of the Four Horsemen in the Valentino epic, or the 'ghoul visions' that bring about the death of the miser in \"The Conquering Power\". His more or less mystical bent was apparent in \"Mare Nostrum\" and \"The Garden of Allah\", which he filmed in the Mediterranean and North Africa, respectively.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26471", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26471", "title": "Rat", "text": "Several genera of rodents\nRats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents. Species of rats are found throughout the order Rodentia, but stereotypical rats are found in the genus \"Rattus\". Other rat genera include \"Neotoma\" (pack rats), \"Bandicota\" (bandicoot rats) and \"Dipodomys\" (kangaroo rats).\nRats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Usually the common name of a large muroid rodent will include the word \"rat\", while a smaller muroid's name will include \"mouse\". The common terms \"rat\" and \"mouse\" are not taxonomically specific. There are 56 known species of rats in the world.\nSpecies and description.\nThe best-known rat species are the black rat (\"Rattus rattus\") and the brown rat (\"Rattus norvegicus\"). This group, generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, originated in Asia. Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over in the wild.\nThe term \"rat\" is also used in the names of other small mammals that are not true rats. Examples include the North American pack rats (also known as wood rats) and a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats. Rats such as the bandicoot rat (\"Bandicota bengalensis\") are murine rodents related to true rats but are not members of the genus \"Rattus\".\nMale rats are called \"bucks\"; unmated females, \"does\", pregnant or parent females, \"dams\"; and infants, \"kittens\" or \"pups\". A group of rats is referred to as a \"mischief\".\nThe common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans; therefore, they are known as commensals. They may cause substantial food losses, especially in developing countries. However, the widely distributed and problematic commensal species of rats are a minority in this diverse genus. Many species of rats are island endemics, some of which have become endangered due to habitat loss or competition with the brown, black, or Polynesian rat.\nWild rodents, including rats, can carry many different zoonotic pathogens, such as \"Leptospira\", \"Toxoplasma gondii\", and \"Campylobacter\". The Black Death is traditionally believed to have been caused by the microorganism \"Yersinia pestis\", carried by the tropical rat flea (\"Xenopsylla cheopis\"), which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is foot-and-mouth disease.\nRats become sexually mature at age 6 weeks, but reach social maturity at about 5 to 6 months of age. The average lifespan of rats varies by species, but many only live about a year due to predation.\nThe black and brown rats diverged from other Old World rats in the forests of Asia during the beginning of the Pleistocene.\nRat tails.\nThe characteristic long tail of most rodents is a feature that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response. Rodent tails\u2014particularly in rat models\u2014have been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the family Muridae, in contrast to the bushier tails of Sciuridae, the squirrel family. The tail is hairless and thin skinned but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient countercurrent heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae, facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three-dimensional environment. Murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed \"degloving\" that allows for escape from predation through the loss of the outermost integumentary layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that have been the subject of investigation.\nMultiple studies have explored the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to varying levels of physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails. One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen. This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, as well as its higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin. These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments. In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.\nOn the other hand, the tail's ability to function as a proprioceptive sensor and modulator has also been investigated. As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism. Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment. Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure. A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail. Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers. As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.\nThe characteristic tail of murids also displays a unique defense mechanism known as \"degloving\" in which the outer layer of the integument can be detached in order to facilitate the animal's escape from a predator. This evolutionary selective pressure has persisted despite a multitude of pathologies that can manifest upon shedding part of the tail and exposing more interior elements to the environment. Paramount among these are bacterial and viral infection, as the high density of vascular tissue within the tail becomes exposed upon avulsion or similar injury to the structure. The degloving response is a nocifensive response, meaning that it occurs when the animal is subjected to acute pain, such as when a predator snatches the organism by the tail.\nAs pets.\nDomesticated rats, selectively bred for specific traits, have been kept as pets since at least the late 19th century. Pet rats are most commonly domesticated variants of the brown rat (\"Rattus norvegicus\"), though other species, such as the black rat (\"Rattus rattus\") and the giant pouched rat (\"Cricetomys\" spp.), are also occasionally kept. Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they have been kept as pets. Pet rats do not pose any more of a risk of zoonotic diseases than pets such as cats or dogs. Tamed rats are generally friendly and can be taught to perform selected behaviors.\nSelective breeding has brought about different color and marking varieties in rats. Genetic mutations have also created different fur types, such as rex and hairless. Congenital malformation in selective breeding have created the dumbo rat, a popular pet choice due to their low, saucer-shaped ears. A breeding standard exists for rat fanciers wishing to breed and show their rat at a rat show.\nAs subjects for scientific research.\nIn 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, established a population of domestic albino brown rats to study the effects of diet and for other physiological studies. Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, adding to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for the health and wellbeing of humankind.\nThe aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system. Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, nonplanar curvature in the aortic branches. Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches. Despite existing anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.\nThe rat's larynx has been used in experimentations that involve inhalation toxicity, allograft rejection, and irradiation responses. One experiment described four features of the rat's larynx. The first being the location and attachments of the thyroarytenoid muscle, the alar cricoarytenoid muscle, and the superior cricoarytenoid muscle, the other of the newly named muscle that ran from the arytenoid to a midline tubercle on the cricoid. The newly named muscles were not seen in the human larynx. In addition, the location and configuration of the laryngeal alar cartilage was described. The second feature was that the way the newly named muscles appear to be familiar to those in the human larynx. The third feature was that a clear understanding of how MEPs are distributed in each of the laryngeal muscles was helpful in understanding the effects of botulinum toxin injection. The MEPs in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, lateral cricoarytenoid muscle, cricothyroid muscle, and superior cricoarytenoid muscle were focused mostly at the midbelly. In addition, the medial thyroarytenoid muscle were focused at the midbelly while the lateral thyroarytenoid muscle MEPs were focused at the anterior third of the belly. The fourth and final feature that was cleared up was how the MEPs were distributed in the thyroarytenoid muscle.\nLaboratory rats have also proved valuable in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes (Barnett 2002), as well as to understand group behavior and overcrowding (with the work of John B. Calhoun on behavioral sink). A 2007 study found rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only documented in humans and some primates.\nDomestic rats differ from wild rats in many ways. They are calmer and less likely to bite; they can tolerate greater crowding; they breed earlier and produce more offspring; and their brains, livers, kidneys, adrenal glands, and hearts are smaller (Barnett 2002).\nBrown rats are often used as model organisms for scientific research. Since the publication of the rat genome sequence, and other advances, such as the creation of a rat SNP chip, and the production of knockout rats, the laboratory rat has become a useful genetic tool, although not as popular as mice. Entirely new breeds or \"lines\" of brown rats, such as the Wistar rat, have been bred for use in laboratories. Much of the genome of \"Rattus norvegicus\" has been sequenced.\nWhen it comes to conducting tests related to intelligence, learning, and drug abuse, rats are a popular choice due to their high intelligence, ingenuity, aggressiveness, and adaptability. Their psychology seems in many ways similar to that of humans. Inspired by B. F. Skinner's famous box which dispensed food pellets when rats pushed a lever, photographer Augustin Lignier gave two rats periodic, unpredictable rewards for pressing a button. He likened their repeated button-pressing behaviors to people's fascinations with digital and social media.\nGeneral intelligence.\nEarly studies found evidence both for and against measurable intelligence using the \"\"g\" factor\" in rats. Part of the difficulty of understanding animal cognition, generally, is determining what to measure. One aspect of intelligence is the ability to learn, which can be measured using a maze like the T-maze. Experiments done in the 1920s showed that some rats performed better than others in maze tests, and if these rats were selectively bred, their offspring also performed better, suggesting that in rats an ability to learn was heritable in some way.\nAs food.\nRat meat is a food that, while taboo in some cultures, is a dietary staple in others.\nWorking rats.\nRats have been used as working animals. Tasks for working rats include the sniffing of gunpowder residue, demining, acting and animal-assisted therapy. Rats have a keen sense of smell and are easy to train. These characteristics have been employed, for example, by the Belgian non-governmental organization APOPO, which trains rats (specifically African giant pouched rats) to detect landmines and diagnose tuberculosis through smell.\nAs pests.\nRats have long been considered deadly pests. Once considered a modern myth, the rat flood in India occurs every 50 years, as armies of bamboo rats descend upon rural areas and devour everything in their path. Rats have long been held up as the chief villain in the spread of the Bubonic Plague; however, recent studies show that rats alone could not account for the rapid spread of the disease through Europe in the Middle Ages. Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does list nearly a dozen diseases directly linked to rats.\nMost urban areas battle rat infestations. A 2015 study by the American Housing Survey (AHS) found that 18% of homes in Philadelphia showed evidence of rodents. Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C., also demonstrated significant rodent infestations. Indeed, rats in New York City are famous for their size and prevalence. The urban legend that the rat population in Manhattan equals that of its human population was definitively refuted by Robert Sullivan in his book \"Rats\" but illustrates New Yorkers' awareness of the presence, and on occasion boldness and cleverness, of the rodents. New York has specific regulations for eradicating rats; multifamily residences and commercial businesses must use a specially trained and licensed rat-catcher.\nChicago was declared the \"rattiest city\" in the U.S. by the pest control company Orkin in 2020, for the sixth consecutive time. It is followed by Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. To help combat the problem, a Chicago animal shelter has placed more than 1000 feral cats (sterilized and vaccinated) outside of homes and businesses since 2012, where they hunt and catch rats while also providing a deterrent simply by their presence.\nRats have the ability to swim up sewer pipes into toilets. Rats will infest any area that provides shelter and easy access to sources of food and water, including under sinks, near garbage, and inside walls or cabinets.\nIn the spread of disease.\nRats can serve as zoonotic vectors for certain pathogens and thus spread disease, such as bubonic plague, Lassa fever, leptospirosis, and hantavirus infection. Researchers studying New York City wastewater have also cited rats as the potential source of \"cryptic\" SARS-CoV-2 lineages, due to unknown viral RNA fragments in sewage matching mutations previously shown to make SARS-CoV-2 more adept at rodent-based transmission.\nRats are also associated with human dermatitis because they are frequently infested with blood feeding rodent mites such as the tropical rat mite (\"Ornithonyssus bacoti\") and spiny rat mite (\"Laelaps echidnina\"), which will opportunistically bite and feed on humans, where the condition is known as rat mite dermatitis\".\"\nAs invasive species.\nWhen introduced into locations where rats previously did not exist, they can wreak an enormous degree of environmental degradation. \"Rattus rattus\", the black rat, is considered to be one of the world's worst invasive species. Also known as the ship rat, it has been carried worldwide as a stowaway on seagoing vessels for millennia and has usually accompanied men to any new area visited or settled by human beings by sea. Rats first got to countries such as America and Australia by stowing away on ships. The similar species \"Rattus norvegicus\", the brown rat or wharf rat, has also been carried worldwide by ships in recent centuries.\nThe ship or wharf rat has contributed to the extinction of many species of wildlife, including birds, small mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, especially on islands. True rats are omnivorous, capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods, and have a very high birth rate. When introduced to a new area, they quickly reproduce to take advantage of the new food supply. In particular, they prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, which on isolated islands often have no other predators and thus have no fear of predators. Some experts believe that rats are to blame for between forty percent and sixty percent of all seabird and reptile extinctions, with ninety percent of those occurring on islands. Thus man has indirectly caused the extinction of many species by accidentally introducing rats to new areas.\nRat-free areas.\nRats are found in nearly all areas of Earth which are inhabited by human beings. The only rat-free continent is Antarctica, which is too cold for rat survival outdoors, and its lack of human habitation does not provide buildings to shelter them from the weather. However, rats have been introduced to many of the islands near Antarctica, and because of their destructive effect on native flora and fauna, efforts to eradicate them are ongoing. In particular, Bird Island (just off rat-infested South Georgia Island), where breeding seabirds could be badly affected if rats were introduced, is subject to special measures and regularly monitored for rat invasions.\nIn January 2015, an international \"Rat Team\" (organized by the South Georgia Heritage Trust) set sail from the Falkland Islands for the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands on board a ship carrying three helicopters and 100 tons of rat poison with the objective of \"reclaiming the island for its seabirds\". Rats had wiped out more than 90% of the seabirds on South Georgia, and the sponsors hoped that once the rats were gone, it would regain its former status as home to the greatest concentration of seabirds in the world.\nAs part of island restoration, some islands' rat populations have been eradicated to protect or restore the ecology. Hawadax Island, Alaska was declared rat free after 229 years and Campbell Island, New Zealand after almost 200 years. Breaksea Island in New Zealand was declared rat free in 1988 after an eradication campaign based on a successful trial on the smaller Hawea Island nearby.\nAfter an eradication programme, Lundy in England was declared free of brown and black rats in 2006, allowing a subsequent recovery of the island's seabirds. In 2008, the Scottish island of Canna was declared free of its 10,000 rat population after a three-year programme of baiting and trapping.\nThe Canadian province of Alberta is notable for being the largest inhabited area on Earth which is free of true rats due to very aggressive government rat control policies. It has large numbers of native pack rats, also called bushy-tailed wood rats, but they are forest-dwelling vegetarians which are much less destructive than true rats.\nAlberta was settled by Europeans relatively late in North American history and only became a province in 1905. Black rats cannot survive in its climate at all, and brown rats must live near people and in their structures to survive the winters. There are numerous predators in Canada's vast natural areas which will eat non-native rats, so it took until 1950 for invading rats to make their way over land from Eastern Canada. Immediately upon their arrival at the eastern border with Saskatchewan, the Alberta government implemented an extremely aggressive rat control program to stop them from advancing further. A systematic detection and eradication system was used throughout a control zone about long and wide along the eastern border to eliminate rat infestations before the rats could spread further into the province. Shotguns, bulldozers, high explosives, poison gas, and incendiaries were used to destroy rats. Numerous farm buildings were destroyed in the process. Initially, tons of arsenic trioxide were spread around thousands of farm yards to poison rats, but soon after the program commenced the rodenticide and medical drug warfarin was introduced, which is much safer for people and more effective at killing rats than arsenic.\nForceful government control measures, strong public support and enthusiastic citizen participation continue to keep rat infestations to a minimum. The effectiveness has been aided by a similar but newer program in Saskatchewan which prevents rats from even reaching the Alberta border. Alberta still employs an armed rat patrol to control rats along Alberta's borders. About ten single rats are found and killed per year, and occasionally a large localized infestation has to be dug out with heavy machinery, but the number of permanent rat infestations is zero.\nIn culture.\nAncient Romans did not generally differentiate between rats and mice, instead referring to the former as \"mus maximus\" (big mouse) and the latter as \"mus minimus\" (little mouse).\nOn the Isle of Man, there is a taboo against the word \"rat\".\nAsian cultures.\nThe rat (sometimes referred to as a mouse) is the first of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac. People born in this year are expected to possess qualities associated with rats, including creativity, intelligence, honesty, generosity, ambition, a quick temper and wastefulness. People born in a year of the rat are said to get along well with \"monkeys\" and \"dragons\", and to get along poorly with \"horses\".\nIn Indian tradition, rats are seen as the vehicle of Ganesha, and a rat's statue is always found in a temple of Ganesh. In the northwestern Indian city of Deshnoke, the rats at the Karni Mata Temple are held to be destined for reincarnation as Sadhus (Hindu holy men). The attending priests feed milk and grain to the rats, of which the pilgrims also partake.\nEuropean cultures.\nEuropean associations with the rat are generally negative. For instance, \"Rats!\" is used as a substitute for various vulgar interjections in the English language. These associations do not draw, \"per se\", from any biological or behavioral trait of the rat, but possibly from the association of rats (and fleas) with the 14th-century medieval plague called the Black Death. Rats are seen as vicious, unclean, parasitic animals that steal food and spread disease. In 1522, the rats in Autun, France were charged and put on trial for destroying crops. However, some people in European cultures keep rats as pets and conversely find them to be tame, clean, intelligent, and playful.\nRats are often used in scientific experiments; animal rights activists allege the treatment of rats in this context is cruel. The term \"lab rat\" is used, typically in a self-effacing manner, to describe a person whose job function requires them to spend a majority of their work time engaged in bench-level research (such as postgraduate students in the sciences).\nTerminology.\nRats are frequently blamed for damaging food supplies and other goods, or spreading disease. Their reputation has carried into common parlance: in the English language, \"rat\" is often an insult or is generally used to signify an unscrupulous character; it is also used, as a synonym for the term \"nark\", to mean an individual who works as a police informant or who has turned state's evidence. Writer/director Preston Sturges created the humorous alias \"Ratskywatsky\" for a soldier who seduced, impregnated, and abandoned the heroine of his 1944 film, \"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\". It is a term (noun and verb) in criminal slang for an informant \u2013 \"to rat on someone\" is to betray them by informing the authorities of a crime or misdeed they committed. Describing a person as \"rat-like\" usually implies he or she is unattractive and suspicious.\nAmong trade unions, the word \"rat\" is also a term for nonunion employers or breakers of union contracts, and this is why unions use inflatable rats.\nFiction.\nDepictions of rats in fiction are historically inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings may be of actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon \u2013 they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.\nThe actual portrayals of rats vary from negative to positive with a majority in the negative and ambiguous. The rat plays a villain in several mouse societies; from Brian Jacques's \"Redwall\" and Robin Jarvis's \"The Deptford Mice\", to the roles of Disney's Professor Ratigan and Kate DiCamillo's Roscuro and Botticelli. They have often been used as a mechanism in horror; being the titular evil in stories like James Herbert's \"The Rats\" or H.P. Lovecraft's \"The Rats in the Walls\", in films like \"Willard\" and \"Ben\", or both Stephen King's \"Graveyard Shift\" and its film adaptation. Another terrifying use of rats is as a method of torture, for instance in Room 101 in George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" or \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by Edgar Allan Poe.\nSelfish helpfulness\u2014those willing to help for a price\u2014has also been attributed to fictional rats. Templeton, from E. B. White's \"Charlotte's Web\", repeatedly reminds the other characters that he is only involved because it means more food for him, and the cellar-rat of John Masefield's \"The Midnight Folk\" requires bribery to be of any assistance.\nBy contrast, the rats appearing in the Doctor Dolittle books tend to be highly positive and likeable characters, many of whom tell their remarkable life stories in the Mouse and Rat Club established by the animal-loving doctor. In \"The Underland Chronicles\" series, rats are both allies (such as Ripred) and enemies (such as Bane, and King Gorger). \nSome fictional works use rats as the main characters. Notable examples include the society created by O'Brien's \"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\", and others include \"Doctor Rat\", and Rizzo the Rat from The Muppets. Pixar's 2007 animated film \"Ratatouille\" is about a rat described by Roger Ebert as \"earnest... lovable, determined, [and] gifted\" who lives with a Parisian garbage-boy-turned-chef. \n\"Mon oncle d'Am\u00e9rique\" (\"My American Uncle\"), a 1980 French film, illustrates Henri Laborit's theories on evolutionary psychology and human behaviors by using short sequences in the storyline showing lab rat experiments.\nIn Harry Turtledove's science fiction novel \"Homeward Bound\", humans unintentionally introduce rats to the ecology at the home world of an alien race which previously invaded Earth and introduced some of its own fauna into its environment. A. Bertram Chandler pitted the space-bound protagonist of a long series of novels, Commodore Grimes, against giant, intelligent rats who took over several stellar systems and enslaved their human inhabitants. \"The Stainless Steel Rat\" is nickname of the (human) protagonist of a series of humorous science fiction novels written by Harry Harrison.\nWererats, therianthropic creatures able to take the shape of a rat, have appeared in the fantasy or horror genre since the 1970s. The term is a neologism coined in analogy to werewolf. The concept has since become common in role-playing games like \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and fantasy fiction like the \"\" series.\nThe Pied Piper.\nOne of the oldest and most historic stories about rats is \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\", in which a rat-catcher leads away an infestation with enchanted music. The piper is later refused payment, so he in turn leads away the town's children. This tale, traced to Germany around the late 13th century, has inspired adaptations in film, theatre, literature, and even opera. The subject of much research, some theories have intertwined the tale with events related to the Black Plague, in which black rats played an important role. Fictional works based on the tale that focus heavily on the rat aspect include Pratchett's \"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\", and Belgian graphic novel \"Le Bal du Rat Mort\" (\"The Ball of the Dead Rat\"). Furthermore, a linguistic phenomenon when a wh-expression drags with it an entire encompassing phrase to the front of the clause has been named pied-piping after \"Pied Piper of Hamlin\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26473", "revid": "30585864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26473", "title": "Replicant", "text": "Fictional bioengineered android from Blade Runner\nA replicant is a fictional bioengineered humanoid featured in the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\" and the 2017 sequel \"Blade Runner 2049\" which is physically indistinguishable from an adult human and often possesses superhuman strength and intelligence. A replicant can be detected by means of the fictional Voight-Kampff test in which emotional responses are provoked; a replicant's nonverbal responses differ from those of a human. Failing the test leads to execution, which is euphemistically referred to as \"retiring\".\nSeveral models of replicant were produced. The first seen model, the Nexus-6, has a four-year lifespan. The successor model, the Nexus-7, were limited experimental models with the ability to procreate. Nexus-8 and Nexus-9 replicants also have open-ended lifespans, but the Nexus-9 line was incapable of disobeying human orders.\nTerm origin.\nIn his novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (the inspiration for \"Blade Runner\"), Philip K. Dick used the term android (or \"andy\"), but director Ridley Scott wanted a new term to avoid audience preconceptions. As David Peoples was re-writing the screenplay, he consulted his daughter, who was involved in microbiology and biochemistry, who suggested the term \"replicating\", the biological process of a cell making a copy of itself. From that, either Peoples or Scott came up with \"replicant\", and it was inserted into Hampton Fancher's screenplay. \"Blade Runner\" media also used the terms \"skinjob\" and \"doll\" as pejoratives for replicants.\nFictional history.\n\"Blade Runner\".\nPrior to the events of the film, replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody off-world mutiny. Six replicants escaped the off-world colonies, killing 23 people and taking a shuttle to Earth; the film focuses on the pursuit of the replicants by Rick Deckard, a type of fictional police officer called a \"Blade Runner\", who investigates, tests, and executes replicants.\nEscaped replicants (all Nexus-6 models):\nOther replicants:\nWhile Deckard discusses Rachael with Tyrell, Tyrell states that to better control replicants he started to implant false memories to give them the years of experiences that humans take for granted, creating a \"cushion or pillow for their emotions.\"\nNexus-6 units were designed to have a four-year lifespan to avoid emotional development, and all attempts to increase a replicant's lifespan have resulted in death. According to Deckard, a normal replicant can usually be discovered using the Voight-Kampff test within 20\u201330 questions, though Rachael answers over one hundred questions before Deckard determines she is a replicant.\nThe second film further develops Rachael's origin, and gives significantly more details about her radical design. It revealed that she was an experimental model of replicant with a high percentage of human organs, including human reproductive organs, and that Rachael conceived a child with Deckard. As Rachael died during childbirth, her possible survival beyond the four years was undetermined.\n\"Blade Runner 2049\".\nThe sequel, \"Blade Runner 2049\", is set thirty years after the original. In the intervening 30 years, several new replicant lines were introduced.\nThe sequel retroactively establishes that Rachael was part of a short-lived prototype line of replicants designated Nexus-7, which was not only intended as a test to make replicants more mentally stable with implanted memories, but also to develop replicants capable of procreation. Rachael died in childbirth in 2021, and the child was hidden by the replicant underground. Tyrell was killed during the events of the first film in November 2019, and the secret of producing replicants capable of procreation died with him. \nIn 2020, the Tyrell Corporation introduced the Nexus-8 replicant, whose lifespans were not limited to four years. The Nexus-8 went into mass production, but a new wave of replicant rebellions occurred, culminating in rogue Nexus-8 replicants detonating a nuclear weapon in orbit over the western United States to create an electromagnetic pulse. The pulse destroyed most records about replicants, making it difficult for humans to track them down on Earth, but the attack led to mass purges and complete shutdown of Nexus-8 production (though many existing units were able to go into hiding in the chaos). \nIn 2036, genetic engineer Niander Wallace designed a new line of Nexus-9 replicants. They also have an open lifespan, but were designed to be unable to resist orders given by a human. The demonstrated effectiveness of Nexus-9 programming, combined with the solving of a global food crisis, allowed for a successful push for the ban on replicant production to be lifted. \nBy 2049, Nexus-9 replicants are extensively used across Earth and the off-world colonies. Special police units are tasked with tracking down any that might go rogue, as well as any remaining Nexus-8s still in hiding (Nexus-7 was never mass-produced, and all the Nexus-6 models died of old age decades before). These police units are once again called Blade Runners, but are now composed of self-aware replicants with implanted memories, though they are fully aware that they are replicants and that their memories are artificial.\nAmbiguity over Deckard's humanity.\nA primary element of the Blade Runner film is the ambiguity over whether the protagonist, Deckard, is a human or a replicant. This ties into one of the central themes of the film: the nature of humanity. Ultimately, the important point is not whether Deckard is a replicant but that the ambiguity blurs the line between humans and replicants.\nCreator opinions.\nHarrison Ford, who played Deckard in the film, has said that he did not think Deckard is a replicant, and that he and director Ridley Scott had discussions that ended in the agreement that the character was human. Author Will Brooker has written that the unicorn dream may not be unique to Deckard and that it may be a personal touch added to some or all of the Nexus-6 replicants' brains. From this, one might also infer that Gaff is a replicant and shares the same embedded memory. \nAccording to several interviews with director Ridley Scott, Deckard is a replicant. When asked in October 2012 about the possibility of a \"Blade Runner\" sequel, Scott said, \"It's not a rumor\u2014it's happening. With Harrison Ford? I don't know yet. Is he too old? Well, he was a Nexus-6, so we don't know how long he can live. And that's all I'm going to say at this stage.\"\nPaul Sammon, author of \"Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner\", has suggested in interviews that Deckard may be a Nexus-7 model, which possesses no superhuman strength or intelligence but does have neurological features that complete the illusion of humanity. Sammon also suggests that Nexus-7 replicants may not have a set lifespan (i.e., they could be immortal, ruling out the lifespan as a determining trait). He goes on to propose that Scott thought it would be more provocative to imply that Deckard is a replicant.\nIn-universe evidence.\nIn \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", Deckard was subjected to the Voight-Kampff test and passed, marking as a human, though Rachael's near-passing the test casts doubt on its infallibility. He collects photographs, yet has no obvious family beyond a reference to his ex-wife (who called him a \"cold fish\"). The film's Supervising Editor Terry Rawlings remembers that Scott \"purposefully put Harrison in the background of the shot, and slightly out of focus, so that you'd only notice his eyes were glowing if you were paying attention\u2026 Ridley himself may have definitely felt that Deckard is a replicant, but still, by the end of the picture, he intended to leave it up to the viewer.\"\nThe sequel, \"Blade Runner 2049\", revisited the question while leaving the answer deliberately ambiguous. The film reveals that Deckard was able to conceive a child with Rachael, and this was possible because she was an experimental prototype (designated Nexus-7), the first and only attempt to design a replicant model capable of procreation. Niander Wallace, CEO of the company that produced replicants, captures Deckard and muses that his falling in love with Rachael seemed too perfect, suggesting that Deckard was designed to fall in love with Rachael as part of Tyrell's experiment to develop replicants that can procreate, but with Tyrell dead and the records destroyed, he will never know.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26474", "revid": "19011377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26474", "title": "Roman Jakobson", "text": "Russian linguist (1896\u20131982)\nRoman Osipovich Jakobson (, ; 11 October\u00a0[O.S. 29 September]\u00a01896\u00a0\u2013 18 July 1982) was a Russian linguist and literary theorist. A pioneer of structural linguistics, Jakobson was one of the most celebrated and influential linguists of the twentieth century. With Nikolai Trubetzkoy, he developed revolutionary new techniques for the analysis of linguistic sound systems, in effect founding the modern discipline of phonology. Jakobson went on to extend similar principles and techniques to the study of other aspects of language such as syntax, morphology and semantics. He made numerous contributions to Slavic linguistics, most notably two studies of Russian case and an analysis of the categories of the Russian verb. Drawing on insights from C. S. Peirce's semiotics, as well as from communication theory and cybernetics, he proposed methods for the investigation of poetry, music, and the visual arts including cinema.\nThrough his decisive influence on Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Roland Barthes, among others, Jakobson became a pivotal figure in the adaptation of structural analysis to disciplines beyond linguistics, including philosophy, anthropology and literary theory; his development of the approach pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, known as \"structuralism\", became a major post-war intellectual movement in Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, though the influence of structuralism declined during the 1970s, Jakobson's work has continued to receive attention in linguistic anthropology, especially through the ethnography of communication developed by Dell Hymes and the semiotics of culture developed by Jakobson's former student Michael Silverstein. Jakobson's concept of underlying linguistic universals, particularly his celebrated theory of distinctive features, decisively influenced the early thinking of Noam Chomsky, who became the dominant figure in theoretical linguistics during the second half of the twentieth century.\nLife and work.\nJakobson was born in Moscow on 11 October\u00a0[O.S. 29 September]\u00a01896 to well-to-do parents of Jewish descent, the industrialist Osip Jakobson and chemist Anna Volpert Jakobson, and he developed a fascination with language at a very young age. He studied at the Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages and then at the Historical-Philological Faculty of Moscow University. As a student he was a leading figure of the Moscow linguistic circle and took part in Moscow's active world of avant-garde art and poetry; he was especially interested in Russian Futurism, the Russian incarnation of Italian Futurism. Under the pseudonym 'Aliagrov', he published books of zaum poetry and befriended the Futurists Vladimir Mayakovsky, Kazimir Malevich, Aleksei Kruchyonykh and others. It was the poetry of his contemporaries that partly inspired him to become a linguist.\nThe linguistics of the time was overwhelmingly neogrammarian and insisted that the only scientific study of language was to study the history and development of words across time (the diachronic approach, in Saussure's terms). Jakobson, on the other hand, had come into contact with the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, and developed an approach focused on the way in which language's structure served its basic function (synchronic approach) \u2013 to communicate information between speakers. Jakobson was also well known for his critique of the emergence of sound in film. Jakobson received a master's degree from Moscow University in 1918.\nIn Czechoslovakia.\nAlthough he was initially an enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik revolution, Jakobson soon became disillusioned as his early hopes for an explosion of creativity in the arts fell victim to increasing state conservatism and hostility. He left Moscow for Prague in 1920, where he worked as a member of the Soviet diplomatic mission while continuing with his doctoral studies. Living in Czechoslovakia meant that Jakobson was physically close to the linguist who would be his most important collaborator during the 1920s and 1930s, Prince Nikolai Trubetzkoy, who fled Russia at the time of the Revolution and took up a chair at Vienna in 1922. In 1926 the Prague school of linguistic theory was established by the professor of English at Charles University, Vil\u00e9m Mathesius, with Jakobson as a founding member and a prime intellectual force (other members included Trubetzkoy, Ren\u00e9 Wellek and Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd). Jakobson immersed himself in both the academic and cultural life of pre-World War II Czechoslovakia and established close relationships with a number of Czech poets and literary figures. Jakobson received his Ph.D. from Charles University in 1930. He became a professor at Masaryk University in Brno in 1933. He also made an impression on Czech academics with his studies of Czech verse.\nRoman Jakobson proposed the Atlas Linguarum Europae in the late 1930s, but World War II disrupted this plan and it lay dormant until being revived by Mario Alinei in 1965.\nEscapes before the war.\nJakobson escaped from Prague in early March 1939 via Berlin for Denmark, where he was associated with the Copenhagen linguistic circle, and such intellectuals as Louis Hjelmslev. He fled to Norway on 1 September 1939, and in 1940 walked across the border to Sweden, where he continued his work at the Karolinska Hospital (with works on aphasia and language competence). When Swedish colleagues feared a possible German occupation, he managed to leave on a cargo ship, together with Ernst Cassirer (the former rector of Hamburg University) to New York City in 1941 to become part of the wider community of intellectual \u00e9migr\u00e9s who fled there.\nCareer in the United States and later life.\nIn New York, he began teaching at The New School, still closely associated with the Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 community during that period. At the \u00c9cole libre des hautes \u00e9tudes, a sort of Francophone university-in-exile, he met and collaborated with Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, who would also become a key exponent of structuralism. He also made the acquaintance of many American linguists and anthropologists, such as Franz Boas, Benjamin Whorf, and Leonard Bloomfield. When the American authorities considered \"repatriating\" him to Europe, it was Franz Boas who actually saved his life. After the war, he became a consultant to the International Auxiliary Language Association, which would present Interlingua in 1951.\nIn 1949 Jakobson moved to Harvard University, where he remained until his retirement in 1967. His universalizing structuralist theory of phonology, based on a markedness hierarchy of distinctive features, achieved its canonical exposition in a book published in the United States in 1951, jointly authored by Roman Jakobson, C. Gunnar Fant and Morris Halle. In the same year, Jakobson's theory of 'distinctive features' made a profound impression on the thinking of young Noam Chomsky, in this way also influencing generative linguistics. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960.\nIn his last decade, Jakobson maintained an office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was an honorary professor emeritus. In the early 1960s, Jakobson shifted his emphasis to a more comprehensive view of language and began writing about communication sciences as a whole. He converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity in 1975.\nJakobson died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 18 July 1982. His widow died in 1986. His first wife, who was born in 1908, died in 2000.\nIntellectual contributions.\nAccording to Jakobson's own personal reminiscences, the most decisive stage in the development of his thinking was the period of revolutionary anticipation and upheaval in Russia between 1912 and 1920, when, as a young student, he fell under the spell of the celebrated Russian futurist wordsmith and linguistic thinker Velimir Khlebnikov.\nOffering a slightly different picture, the preface to the second edition of \"The Sound Shape of Language\" argues that this book represents the fourth stage in \"Jakobson's quest to uncover the function and structure of sound in language.\" The first stage was roughly the 1920s to 1930s where he collaborated with Trubetzkoy, in which they developed the concept of the phoneme, and elucidated the structure of phonological systems. The second stage, from roughly the late 1930s to the 1940s, during which he developed the notion that \"binary distinctive features\" were the foundational element in language, and that such distinctiveness is \"mere otherness\" or differentiation. In the third stage in Jakobson's work, from the 1950s to the 1960s, he worked with the acoustician C. Gunnar Fant and Morris Halle (a student of Jakobson's) to consider the acoustic aspects of distinctive features.\nThe communication functions.\nInfluenced by the Organon-Model by Karl B\u00fchler, Jakobson distinguishes six communication functions, each associated with a dimension or factor of the communication process [n.b. \u2013 Elements from B\u00fchler's theory appear in the diagram below in yellow and pink, Jakobson's elaborations in blue]:\nOne of the six functions is always the dominant function in a text and usually related to the type of text. In poetry, the dominant function is the poetic function: the focus is on the message itself. The true hallmark of poetry is according to Jakobson \"the projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection to the axis of combination\". Very broadly speaking, it implies that poetry successfully combines and integrates form and function, that poetry turns the poetry of grammar into the grammar of poetry, so to speak. Jakobson's theory of communicative functions was first published in \"Closing Statements: Linguistics and Poetics\" (in Thomas A. Sebeok, \"Style in Language\", Cambridge Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1960, pp.\u00a0350\u2013377). Despite its wide adoption, the six-functions model has been criticized for lacking specific interest in the \"play function\" of language that, according to an early review by Georges Mounin, is \"not enough studied in general by linguistics researchers\".\nLegacy.\nJakobson's three principal ideas in linguistics play a major role in the field to this day: linguistic typology, markedness, and linguistic universals. The three concepts are tightly intertwined: typology is the classification of languages in terms of shared grammatical features (as opposed to shared origin), markedness is (very roughly) a study of how certain forms of grammatical organization are more \"optimized\" than others, and linguistic universals is the study of the general features of languages in the world. He also influenced Nicolas Ruwet's paradigmatic analysis.\nJakobson has also influenced Friedemann Schulz von Thun's four sides model, as well as Michael Silverstein's metapragmatics, Dell Hymes's ethnography of communication and ethnopoetics, the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan, and philosophy of Giorgio Agamben.\nJakobson's legacy among researchers specializing in Slavics, and especially Slavic linguistics in North America, has been enormous, for example, Olga Yokoyama.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26476", "revid": "50655346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26476", "title": "Rendezvous with Rama", "text": "1973 science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke\nRendezvous with Rama is a 1973 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. Set in the 2130s, the story involves a cylindrical alien starship that enters the Solar System. The story is told from the point of view of a group of human explorers who intercept the ship in an attempt to unlock its mysteries. The novel won the Hugo, Locus, and Nebula awards upon its release, and is regarded as one of the cornerstones in Clarke's bibliography. The concept was later extended with several sequels, written by Clarke and Gentry Lee.\nPlot.\nAn asteroid strikes Italy in 2077, prompting the creation of the Spaceguard system to track potentially hazardous objects in space. In 2131, Spaceguard detects an interstellar object entering the Solar System, designating it \"31/439\" before naming it Rama after the Hindu god. A space probe reveals that Rama is a perfectly smooth cylinder long and in diameter, indicating that it was constructed by intelligent beings.\n\"Endeavour\" is sent to study Rama, being the only ship close enough to do so. The crew navigates through a triple airlock system and descends one of three identical staircases. Inside Rama, they discover two plains that stretch across the interior circumference, divided by a frozen body of water they name the Cylindrical Sea. They identify several city-sized clusters of geometric structures, which they name after major cities on Earth. The United Planets follows their progress closely, and scientists are assembled to form a Rama Committee that considers theories and advises Commander Norton.\nAs Rama drifts closer to the sun, the Cylindrical Sea melts, the temperature shift causes a storm, and three massive lights activate on each plain to illuminate the world. Boris Rodrigo, a crewman who adheres to a space-inspired sect of Christianity, suggests that Rama is a new Noah's Ark that will change course to begin orbiting the sun. The crew floats across the Cylindrical Sea on a raft to reach an island they name New York, and a sample of the water reveals the presence of microorganisms. The structures in New York are positioned in patterns of three, without any openings, and their purpose is unidentifiable.\nThe crewman Jimmy Pak approaches Norton to admit that he smuggled a sky-bike onto their ship and offers to fly it above a cliff to reach the southern plain. He flies to the other end of Rama, which is defined by a large spike several kilometres in length and surrounded by smaller spikes. Pak realizes that a static field is building around the spikes, which then emits a concussion that knocks his sky-bike out of the air and destroys it, stranding him in the southern plain. As he recovers from the crash, a crab-like creature arrives to disassemble the sky-bike and dispose of its parts. Pak is unable to determine whether the creature is biological or robotic.\nPak explores the patchwork terrain of the southern plain while he waits for rescue. He finds a single alien flower, which he takes. A rescue crew arrives on the raft, and Pak jumps from the cliff into the Cylindrical Sea so they can pull him aboard. A course change by Rama triggers a series of large waves, but Sergeant Ruby Barnes navigates them to safety. They see a damaged starfish-like creature emerge from the sea, and shark-like creatures arrive to disassemble it.\nAfter returning to their camp, a spider-like creature with three eyes and three legs studies all of their equipment. More arrive, and one falls from a higher platform to its destruction. Surgeon-Commander Laura Ernst takes the opportunity to dissect the creature and finds that it is both biological and robotic, so they conclude that the creatures were designed by the Ramans and begin referring to them as biots. The government of Mercury, having decided that Rama is too dangerous, launches a nuclear weapon to destroy it. Rodrigo intercepts the missile and disarms it, taking advantage of the 12-minute time lag for radio communication between it and Mercury.\nThe crew prepares to evacuate as Rama gets too close to the sun. For their final expedition, they visit a city with a laser and cut a hole into the side of a structure. Inside they find a collection of holograms that provide details on various Raman artefacts, including a suit designed for a three-legged humanoid. As they leave, the biots return to the sea to be disassembled and the lights begin to dim. The crew boards \"Endeavour\" and leaves Rama. Rama changes course to move directly toward the sun and moves alongside it to gather energy. It then activates a space drive to propel itself out of the Solar System in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud. After Rama leaves, a member of the Rama Committee considers that the Ramans do everything in threes.\nReception.\nJohn Leonard of \"The New York Times\", while finding Clarke \"benignly indifferent to the niceties of characterization\", praised the novel for conveying \"that chilling touch of the alien, the not-quite-knowable, that distinguishes sci-fi at its most technically imaginative\". Other reviewers have also commented on Clarke's lack of character development and overemphasis on realism.\nAwards and nominations.\nThe novel received the following awards:\nDesign and geography of Rama.\nThe interior of Rama is essentially a large cylindrical landscape, dubbed \"The Central Plain\" by the crew, 16 kilometres in diameter and nearly 50 long, with artificial gravity provided by its 0.25 rpm spin. It is split into the \"northern\" and \"southern\" plains, divided in the middle by a 10-km-wide expanse of water the astronauts dub the \"Cylindrical Sea\". In the centre of the Cylindrical Sea is an island of unknown purpose covered in tall, skyscraper-like structures, which the astronauts name \"New York\" due to an imagined similarity to Manhattan. At each end of the ship are North and South \"Poles\". The North Pole is effectively the bow and the South Pole the stern, as Rama accelerates in the direction of the north pole and its drive system is at the South Pole.\nThe North Pole contains Rama's airlocks, and is where the \"Endeavour\" lands. The airlocks open into the hub of the massive bowl shaped cap at the North Pole, with three 8-kilometre-long stair systems, called Alpha, Beta, and Gamma by the crew, leading to the plain.\nThe Northern plain contains several small \"towns\" interconnected by roads, dubbed London, Paris, Peking, Tokyo, Rome, and Moscow. The South Pole has a giant cone-shaped protrusion (\"Big Horn\") surrounded by six smaller ones (\"Little Horns\"), which are thought to be part of Rama's reactionless space drive.\nBoth ends of Rama are lit by giant trenches (three in the northern plain and three in the south), equidistantly placed around the cylinder, effectively functioning as giant strip lighting.\nBooks in the series.\nClarke paired up with Gentry Lee for the remainder of the series. Lee wrote while Clarke read and made editing suggestions. The focus and style of the last three novels are quite different from those of the original with an increased emphasis on characterisation and clearly-portrayed heroes and villains, rather than Clarke's dedicated professionals. These later books did not receive the same critical acclaim and awards as the original.\nGentry Lee also wrote two further novels set in the same \"Rama\" Universe.\nAdaptations.\nVideo games.\nA graphic adventure computer game of the same name with a text parser based on the book was made in 1984 by Trillium and ported to other systems such as the Apple II and Commodore 64. Despite its primitive graphics, it had highly detailed descriptions, and it followed the book very closely along with having puzzles to solve during the game.\nIn Spain there was an official adaptation for the 2nd generation MSX computers called \"Cita con Rama\" that took advantage of the MSX's ability to produce (at the time) high-quality graphics. It was adapted from the Clarke novel in 1983 by Ron Martinez, who went on to design the massively multiplayer online game \"10Six\", also known as \"Project Visitor\".\nSierra Entertainment created \"Rama\" in 1996 as a point and click adventure game in the style of \"Myst\". Along with highly detailed graphics, Arthur C. Clarke also appeared in the game as the guide for the player. This game featured characters from the sequel book \"Rama II\".\nRadio adaptation.\nIn 2009, BBC Radio 4 produced a two-part radio adaptation of the book as part of a science-fiction season. It was adapted by Mike Walker, and was broadcast on 1 March 2009 (Part 1) and 8 March 2009 (Part 2).\nFilm.\nIn the early 2000s, actor Morgan Freeman expressed his desire to produce a film based on \"Rendezvous with Rama.\" The film has been stuck in \"development hell\" for many years. In 2003, after initial problems procuring funding, it appeared the project would go into production. The film was to be produced by Freeman's production company, Revelations Entertainment. David Fincher, touted on Revelations' \"Rama\" web page as far back as 2001, stated in a late 2007 interview that he was still attached to helm.\nBy late 2008, David Fincher stated the movie was unlikely to be made. \"It looks like it's not going to happen. There's no script and as you know, Morgan Freeman's not in the best of health right now. We've been trying to do it but it's probably not going to happen.\"\nIn 2010, Freeman stated in an interview that he was still planning to make the project but that it has been difficult to find the right script. He also stated that it should be made in 3D. In January 2011, Fincher stated in an interview with MTV that he was still planning to make the film after he had completed work on his planned remake of \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\" (which was scheduled to begin production in 2012 but has since been scrapped). He also reiterated Freeman's concerns about the difficulty of finding the right script.\nIn an interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson in February 2012, Freeman indicated an interest in playing the role of Commander Norton for the film, stating that \"my fantasy of commanding a starship is commanding Endeavour\". Tyson then asked, \"So is this a pitch to be ... that person if they ever make that movie?\" to which Freeman reaffirmed, \"We \"are\" going to make that movie.\" In response to a plea to \"make that come out sooner rather than later\", Freeman reiterated that difficulty in authoring a high quality script is the primary barrier for the film, stating \"... the only task you have that's really really hard in making movies, harder than getting money, is getting a script ... a good script\".\nIn December 2021, it was announced that the film was in development at Alcon Entertainment with Denis Villeneuve set to direct. Morgan Freeman and Lori McCreary are on the production team because their Revelations Entertainment previously owned the rights. Alcon co-CEOs Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove will produce. As of February 2024, Villeneuve was in the process of writing the script.\nNon-fictional aspects.\nClarke created the space study program which detects Rama, Project Spaceguard, as a method of identifying near-Earth objects on Earth-impact trajectories; in the novel it was initiated in 2077. A real project named Spaceguard was initiated in 1992, named after Clarke's fictional project and \"with the permission and encouragement of Clarke\". After interest in the dangers of asteroid strikes was heightened by a series of Hollywood disaster films, the United States Congress gave NASA authorisation and funding to support Spaceguard. By 2017, there were a number of different efforts to detect potentially dangerous asteroids.\nOn 19 October 2017 an incoming interstellar object was discovered by Pan-STARRS, a system similar to Spaceguard. Like Rama, the object had an unusually elongated shape. Before the official Hawaiian name \u02bbOumuamua was selected by the International Astronomical Union, a popular choice was \"Rama\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26477", "revid": "49272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26477", "title": "Rust", "text": "Type of iron oxide\nRust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture. Rust consists of hydrous iron(III) oxides (Fe2O3\u00b7nH2O) and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)3), and is typically associated with the corrosion of refined iron.\nGiven sufficient time, any iron mass in the presence of water and oxygen, will form rust and could eventually convert entirely to rust. Surface rust is commonly flaky and friable, and provides no passivational protection to the underlying iron unlike other metals such as aluminum, copper, and tin which form stable oxide layers. \"Rusting\" is the common term for corrosion of elemental iron and its alloys such as steel. Many other metals undergo similar corrosion, but the resulting oxides are not commonly called \"rust\".\nSeveral forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Other forms of rust include the result of reactions between iron and chloride in an environment deprived of oxygen. Rebar used in underwater concrete pillars, which generates green rust, is an example. Although rusting is generally a negative aspect of iron, a particular form of rusting, known as \"stable rust\", causes the object to have a thin coating of rust over the top; this results from reaction with atmospheric oxygen. If kept free of moisture, it makes the \"stable\" layer protective to the iron below, albeit not to the extent of other oxides such as aluminium oxide on aluminium.\nChemical reactions.\nRust is a general name for a complex of oxides and hydroxides of iron, which occur when iron or some alloys that contain iron are exposed to oxygen and moisture for a long period of time. Over time, the oxygen combines with the metal, forming new compounds collectively called rust, in a process called rusting. Rusting is an oxidation reaction specifically occurring with iron. Other metals also corrode via similar oxidation, but such corrosion is not called rusting.\nThe main catalyst for the rusting process is water. Iron or steel structures might appear to be solid, but water molecules can penetrate the microscopic pits and cracks in any exposed metal. The hydrogen atoms present in water molecules can combine with other elements to form acids, which will eventually cause more metal to be exposed. If chloride ions are present, as is the case with saltwater, the corrosion is likely to occur more quickly. Meanwhile, the oxygen atoms combine with metallic atoms to form the destructive oxide compound. These iron compounds are brittle and crumbly and replace strong metallic iron, reducing the strength of the object.\nOxidation of iron.\nWhen iron is in contact with water and oxygen, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of chemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating ferrous oxide layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water.\nOther degrading solutions are sulfur dioxide in water and carbon dioxide in water. Under these corrosive conditions, iron hydroxide species are formed. Unlike ferrous oxides, the hydroxides do not adhere to the bulk metal. As they form and flake off from the surface, fresh iron is exposed, and the corrosion process continues until either all of the iron is consumed or all of the oxygen, water, carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide in the system are removed or consumed.\nWhen iron rusts, the oxides take up more volume than the original metal; this expansion can generate enormous forces, damaging structures made with iron. See \"economic effect\" for more details.\nAssociated reactions.\nThe rusting of iron is an electrochemical process that begins with the transfer of electrons from iron to oxygen. The iron is the reducing agent (gives up electrons) while the oxygen is the oxidizing agent (gains electrons). The rate of corrosion is affected by water and accelerated by electrolytes, as illustrated by the effects of road salt on the corrosion of automobiles. The key reaction is the reduction of oxygen:\nO2 + 4\u00a0\u200a\"e\"\u2212 + 2\u00a0 \u2192 4\u00a0\u200aOH\u2212\nBecause it forms hydroxide ions, this process is strongly affected by the presence of acid. Likewise, the corrosion of most metals by oxygen is accelerated at low pH. Providing the electrons for the above reaction is the oxidation of iron that may be described as follows:\nFe \u2192 Fe2+ + 2\u00a0\u200a\"e\"\u2212\nThe following redox reaction also occurs in the presence of water and is crucial to the formation of rust:\n4\u00a0Fe2+ + O2 \u2192 4\u00a0Fe3+ + 2\u00a0O2\u2212\nIn addition, the following multistep acid\u2013base reactions affect the course of rust formation:\nFe2+ + 2\u00a0\u200aH2O \u21cc Fe(OH)2 + 2\u00a0\u200aH+\nFe3+ + 3\u00a0\u200aH2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3\u00a0\u200aH+\nas do the following dehydration equilibria:\nFe(OH)2 \u21cc FeO + \nFe(OH)3 \u21cc FeO(OH) + \n2\u00a0FeO(OH) \u21cc Fe2O3 + \nFrom the above equations, it is also seen that the corrosion products are dictated by the availability of water and oxygen. With limited dissolved oxygen, iron(II)-containing materials are favoured, including FeO and black lodestone or magnetite (Fe3O4). High oxygen concentrations favour ferric materials with the nominal formulae Fe(OH)3\u2212\"x\"O&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;\"x\"\u20442. The nature of rust changes with time, reflecting the slow rates of the reactions of solids.\nFurthermore, these complex processes are affected by the presence of other ions, such as Ca2+, which serve as electrolytes which accelerate rust formation, or combine with the hydroxides and oxides of iron to precipitate a variety of Ca, Fe, O, OH species.\nThe onset of rusting can also be detected in the laboratory with the use of ferroxyl indicator solution. The solution detects both Fe2+ ions and hydroxyl ions. Formation of Fe2+ ions and hydroxyl ions are indicated by blue and pink patches respectively.\nPrevention.\nBecause of the widespread use and importance of iron and steel products, and because rusting severely compromises the strength, functionality and the appearance of such products, the prevention and control of rust is the basis of major economic activities in a number of specialized technologies. A brief overview of methods is presented here; for detailed coverage, see the cross-referenced articles.\nRust is permeable to air and water, therefore the interior metallic iron beneath a rust layer continues to corrode. Rust prevention thus requires coatings that preclude rust formation.\nRust-resistant alloys.\nStainless steel forms a passivation layer of chromium(III) oxide. Similar passivation behavior occurs with magnesium, titanium, zinc, zinc oxides, aluminium, polyaniline, and other electroactive conductive polymers.\nSpecial \"weathering steel\" alloys such as Cor-Ten rust at a much slower rate than normal, because the rust adheres to the surface of the metal in a protective layer. Designs using this material must include measures that avoid worst-case exposures since the material still continues to rust slowly even under near-ideal conditions.\nGalvanization.\nGalvanization consists of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic zinc by either hot-dip galvanizing or electroplating. Zinc is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the zinc layer. In more corrosive environments (such as salt water), cadmium plating is preferred instead of the underlying protected metal. The protective zinc layer is consumed by this action, and thus galvanization provides protection only for a limited period of time.\nMore modern coatings add aluminium to the coating as \"zinc-alume\"; aluminium will migrate to cover scratches and thus provide protection for a longer period. These approaches rely on the aluminium and zinc oxides protecting a once-scratched surface, rather than oxidizing as a sacrificial anode as in traditional galvanized coatings. In some cases, such as very aggressive environments or long design life, both zinc and a coating are applied to provide enhanced corrosion protection.\nTypical galvanization of steel products that are to be subjected to normal day-to-day weathering in an outside environment consists of a hot-dipped 85\u00a0\u03bcm zinc coating. Under normal weather conditions, this will deteriorate at a rate of 1\u00a0\u03bcm per year, giving approximately 85 years of protection.\nCathodic protection.\nCathodic protection is a technique used to inhibit corrosion on buried or immersed structures by supplying an electrical charge that suppresses the electrochemical reaction. If correctly applied, corrosion can be stopped completely. In its simplest form, it is achieved by attaching a sacrificial anode, thereby making the iron or steel the cathode in the cell formed. The sacrificial anode must be made from something with a more negative electrode potential than the iron or steel, commonly zinc, aluminium, or magnesium. The sacrificial anode will eventually corrode away, ceasing its protective action unless it is replaced in a timely manner.\nCathodic protection can also be provided by using an applied electrical current. This would then be known as ICCP Impressed Current Cathodic Protection.\nCoatings and painting.\nRust formation can be controlled with coatings, such as paint, lacquer, varnish, or wax tapes that isolate the iron from the environment. Large structures with enclosed box sections, such as ships and modern automobiles, often have a wax-based product (technically a \"slushing oil\") injected into these sections. Such treatments usually also contain rust inhibitors. Covering steel with concrete can provide some protection to steel because of the alkaline pH environment at the steel\u2013concrete interface. However, rusting of steel in concrete can still be a problem, as expanding rust can fracture concrete from within.\nAs a closely related example, iron clamps were used to join marble blocks during a restoration attempt of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, in 1898, but caused extensive damage to the marble by the rusting and swelling of unprotected iron. The ancient Greek builders had used a similar fastening system for the marble blocks during construction, however, they also poured molten lead over the iron joints for protection from seismic shocks as well as from corrosion. This method was successful for the 2500-year-old structure, but in less than a century the crude repairs were in imminent danger of collapse.\nWhen only temporary protection is needed for storage or transport, a thin layer of oil, grease or a special mixture such as Cosmoline can be applied to an iron surface. Such treatments are extensively used when \"mothballing\" a steel ship, automobile, or other equipment for long-term storage.\nSpecial anti-seize lubricant mixtures are available and are applied to metallic threads and other precision machined surfaces to protect them from rust. These compounds usually contain grease mixed with copper, zinc, or aluminium powder, and other proprietary ingredients.\nBluing.\nBluing is a technique that can provide limited resistance to rusting for small steel items, such as firearms; for it to be successful, a water-displacing oil is rubbed onto the blued steel and other steel.\nInhibitors.\nCorrosion inhibitors, such as gas-phase or volatile inhibitors, can be used to prevent corrosion inside sealed systems. They are not effective when air circulation disperses them, and brings in fresh oxygen and moisture.\nHumidity control.\nRust can be avoided by controlling the moisture in the atmosphere. An example of this is the use of silica gel packets to control humidity in equipment shipped by sea.\nTreatment.\nRust removal from small iron or steel objects by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket filled with an electrolyte consisting of washing soda dissolved in tap water, a length of rebar suspended vertically in the solution to act as an anode, another laid across the top of the bucket to act as a support for suspending the object, baling wire to suspend the object in the solution from the horizontal rebar, and a battery charger as a power source in which the positive terminal is clamped to the anode and the negative terminal is clamped to the object to be treated which becomes the cathode. Hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced at the cathode and anode respectively. This mixture is flammable/explosive. Care should also be taken to avoid hydrogen embrittlement. Overvoltage also produces small amounts of ozone, which is highly toxic, so a low voltage phone charger is a far safer source of DC current. The effects of hydrogen on global warming have also recently come under scrutiny.\nRust may be treated with commercial products known as rust converter which contain tannic acid or phosphoric acid which combines with rust; removed with organic acids like citric acid and vinegar or removed with chelating agents as in some commercial formulations or even a solution of molasses.\nEconomic effect.\nRust is associated with the degradation of iron-based tools and structures. As rust has a much higher volume than the originating mass of iron, its buildup can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts phenomenon sometimes known as \"rust packing\". It was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus river bridge in 1983, when the bearings rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support.\nSilver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia, when a steel suspension bridge collapsed in less than a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time. The Kinzua Bridge in Pennsylvania was blown down by a tornado in 2003, largely because the central base bolts holding the structure to the ground had rusted away, leaving the bridge anchored by gravity alone.\nReinforced concrete is also vulnerable to rust damage. Internal pressure caused by expanding corrosion of concrete-covered steel and iron can cause the concrete to spall, creating severe structural problems. It is one of the most common failure modes of reinforced concrete bridges and buildings.\nCultural symbolism.\nRust is a commonly used metaphor for slow decay due to neglect, since it gradually converts robust iron and steel metal into a soft crumbling powder. A wide section of the industrialized American Midwest and American Northeast, once dominated by steel foundries, the automotive industry, and other manufacturers, has experienced harsh economic cutbacks that have caused the region to be dubbed the \"Rust Belt\".\nIn music, literature, and art, rust is associated with images of faded glory, neglect, decay, and ruin.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some particular properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies include convergence, limits, continuity, smoothness, differentiability and integrability.\nReal analysis is distinguished from complex analysis, which deals with the study of complex numbers and their functions.\nScope.\nConstruction of the real numbers.\nThe theorems of real analysis rely on the properties of the (established) real number system. The real number system consists of an uncountable set (formula_1), together with two binary operations denoted + and formula_2, and a total order denoted \u2264. The operations make the real numbers a field, and, along with the order, an ordered field. The real number system is the unique \"complete ordered field\", in the sense that any other complete ordered field is isomorphic to it. Intuitively, completeness means that there are no 'gaps' (or 'holes') in the real numbers. This property distinguishes the real numbers from other ordered fields (e.g., the rational numbers formula_3) and is critical to the proof of several key properties of functions of the real numbers. The completeness of the reals is often conveniently expressed as the \"least upper bound property\" (see below).\nOrder properties of the real numbers.\nThe real numbers have various lattice-theoretic properties that are absent in the complex numbers. Also, the real numbers form an ordered field, in which sums and products of positive numbers are also positive. Moreover, the ordering of the real numbers is total, and the real numbers have the least upper bound property: \"Every nonempty subset of formula_1 that has an upper bound has a least upper bound that is also a real number.\" These order-theoretic properties lead to a number of fundamental results in real analysis, such as the monotone convergence theorem, the intermediate value theorem and the mean value theorem.\nHowever, while the results in real analysis are stated for real numbers, many of these results can be generalized to other mathematical objects. In particular, many ideas in functional analysis and operator theory generalize properties of the real numbers \u2013 such generalizations include the theories of Riesz spaces and positive operators. Also, mathematicians consider real and imaginary parts of complex sequences, or by pointwise evaluation of operator sequences.\nTopological properties of the real numbers.\nMany of the theorems of real analysis are consequences of the topological properties of the real number line. The order properties of the real numbers described above are closely related to these topological properties. As a topological space, the real numbers has a \"standard topology\", which is the order topology induced by order formula_5. Alternatively, by defining the \"metric\" or \"distance function\" formula_6 using the absolute value function as x - y the real numbers become the prototypical example of a metric space. The topology induced by metric formula_7 turns out to be identical to the standard topology induced by order formula_5. Theorems like the intermediate value theorem that are essentially topological in nature can often be proved in the more general setting of metric or topological spaces rather than in formula_1 only. Often, such proofs tend to be shorter or simpler compared to classical proofs that apply direct methods.\nSequences.\nA sequence is a function whose domain is a countable, totally ordered set. The domain is usually taken to be the natural numbers, although it is occasionally convenient to also consider bidirectional sequences indexed by the set of all integers, including negative indices.\nOf interest in real analysis, a real-valued sequence, here indexed by the natural numbers, is a map formula_10. Each formula_11 is referred to as a term (or, less commonly, an element) of the sequence. A sequence is rarely denoted explicitly as a function; instead, by convention, it is almost always notated as if it were an ordered \u221e-tuple, with individual terms or a general term enclosed in parentheses:\nformula_12\nA sequence that tends to a limit (i.e., formula_13 exists) is said to be convergent; otherwise it is divergent. (\"See the section on limits and convergence for details.\") A real-valued sequence formula_14 is bounded if there exists formula_15 such that formula_16 for all formula_17. A real-valued sequence formula_14 is monotonically increasing or decreasing if\nformula_19\nor\nformula_20\nholds, respectively. If either holds, the sequence is said to be monotonic. The monotonicity is strict if the chained inequalities still hold with formula_21 or formula_22 replaced by &lt; or &gt;.\nGiven a sequence formula_14, another sequence formula_24 is a subsequence of formula_14 if formula_26 for all positive integers formula_27 and formula_28 is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers.\nLimits and convergence.\nRoughly speaking, a limit is the value that a function or a sequence \"approaches\" as the input or index approaches some value. (This value can include the symbols formula_29 when addressing the behavior of a function or sequence as the variable increases or decreases without bound.) The idea of a limit is fundamental to calculus (and mathematical analysis in general) and its formal definition is used in turn to define notions like continuity, derivatives, and integrals. (In fact, the study of limiting behavior has been used as a characteristic that distinguishes calculus and mathematical analysis from other branches of mathematics.)\nThe concept of limit was informally introduced for functions by Newton and Leibniz, at the end of the 17th century, for building infinitesimal calculus. For sequences, the concept was introduced by Cauchy, and made rigorous, at the end of the 19th century by Bolzano and Weierstrass, who gave the modern \u03b5-\u03b4 definition, which follows.\nDefinition. Let formula_30 be a real-valued function defined on formula_31. We say that formula_32 tends to formula_33 as formula_34 approaches formula_35, or that the limit of formula_32 as formula_34 approaches formula_35 is formula_33 if, for any formula_40, there exists formula_41 such that for all formula_42, formula_43 implies that formula_44. We write this symbolically as\nformula_45 or as formula_46\nIntuitively, this definition can be thought of in the following way: We say that formula_47 as formula_48, when, given any positive number formula_49, no matter how small, we can always find a formula_50, such that we can guarantee that formula_32 and formula_33 are less than formula_49 apart, as long as formula_34 (in the domain of formula_30) is a real number that is less than formula_50 away from formula_35 but distinct from formula_35. The purpose of the last stipulation, which corresponds to the condition formula_59 in the definition, is to ensure that formula_60 does not imply anything about the value of formula_61 itself. Actually, formula_35 does not even need to be in the domain of formula_30 in order for formula_64 to exist.\nIn a slightly different but related context, the concept of a limit applies to the behavior of a sequence formula_14 when formula_66 becomes large.\nDefinition. Let formula_14 be a real-valued sequence. We say that formula_14 converges to formula_69 if, for any formula_70, there exists a natural number formula_71 such that formula_72 implies that formula_73. We write this symbolically as\nformula_74or asformula_75\nif formula_14 fails to converge, we say that formula_14 diverges.\nGeneralizing to a real-valued function of a real variable, a slight modification of this definition (replacement of sequence formula_14 and term formula_79 by function formula_30 and value formula_32 and natural numbers formula_71 and formula_66 by real numbers formula_84 and formula_34, respectively) yields the definition of the limit of formula_32 as formula_34 increases without bound, notated formula_88. Reversing the inequality formula_89 to formula_90 gives the corresponding definition of the limit of formula_32 as formula_34 \"decreases\" \"without bound\", \nSometimes, it is useful to conclude that a sequence converges, even though the value to which it converges is unknown or irrelevant. In these cases, the concept of a Cauchy sequence is useful.\nDefinition. Let formula_14 be a real-valued sequence. We say that formula_14 is a Cauchy sequence if, for any formula_70, there exists a natural number formula_71 such that formula_97 implies that formula_98.\nIt can be shown that a real-valued sequence is Cauchy if and only if it is convergent. This property of the real numbers is expressed by saying that the real numbers endowed with the standard metric, formula_99, is a complete metric space. In a general metric space, however, a Cauchy sequence need not converge.\nIn addition, for real-valued sequences that are monotonic, it can be shown that the sequence is bounded if and only if it is convergent.\nUniform and pointwise convergence for sequences of functions.\nIn addition to sequences of numbers, one may also speak of \"sequences of functions\" \"on\" formula_100, that is, infinite, ordered families of functions formula_101, denoted formula_102, and their convergence properties. However, in the case of sequences of functions, there are two kinds of convergence, known as \"pointwise convergence\" and \"uniform convergence\", that need to be distinguished.\nRoughly speaking, pointwise convergence of functions formula_103 to a limiting function formula_104, denoted formula_105, simply means that given any formula_42, formula_107 as formula_108. In contrast, uniform convergence is a stronger type of convergence, in the sense that a uniformly convergent sequence of functions also converges pointwise, but not conversely. Uniform convergence requires members of the family of functions, formula_103, to fall within some error formula_70 of formula_30 for \"every value of formula_42\", whenever formula_72, for some integer formula_71. For a family of functions to uniformly converge, sometimes denoted formula_115, such a value of formula_71 must exist for any formula_40 given, no matter how small. Intuitively, we can visualize this situation by imagining that, for a large enough formula_71, the functions formula_119 are all confined within a 'tube' of width formula_120 about formula_30 (that is, between formula_122 and formula_123) \"for every value in their domain\" formula_124.\nThe distinction between pointwise and uniform convergence is important when exchanging the order of two limiting operations (e.g., taking a limit, a derivative, or integral) is desired: in order for the exchange to be well-behaved, many theorems of real analysis call for uniform convergence. For example, a sequence of continuous functions (see below) is guaranteed to converge to a continuous limiting function if the convergence is uniform, while the limiting function may not be continuous if convergence is only pointwise. Karl Weierstrass is generally credited for clearly defining the concept of uniform convergence and fully investigating its implications.\nCompactness.\nCompactness is a concept from general topology that plays an important role in many of the theorems of real analysis. The property of compactness is a generalization of the notion of a set being \"closed\" and \"bounded\". (In the context of real analysis, these notions are equivalent: a set in Euclidean space is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.) Briefly, a closed set contains all of its boundary points, while a set is bounded if there exists a real number such that the distance between any two points of the set is less than that number. In formula_1, sets that are closed and bounded, and therefore compact, include the empty set, any finite number of points, closed intervals, and their finite unions. However, this list is not exhaustive; for instance, the set formula_126 is a compact set; the Cantor ternary set formula_127 is another example of a compact set. On the other hand, the set formula_128 is not compact because it is bounded but not closed, as the boundary point 0 is not a member of the set. The set formula_129 is also not compact because it is closed but not bounded.\nFor subsets of the real numbers, there are several equivalent definitions of compactness.\nDefinition. A set formula_31 is compact if it is closed and bounded.\nThis definition also holds for Euclidean space of any finite dimension, formula_131, but it is not valid for metric spaces in general. The equivalence of the definition with the definition of compactness based on subcovers, given later in this section, is known as the Heine-Borel theorem.\nA more general definition that applies to all metric spaces uses the notion of a subsequence (see above).\nDefinition. A set formula_124 in a metric space is compact if every sequence in formula_124 has a convergent subsequence.\nThis particular property is known as \"subsequential compactness\". In formula_1, a set is subsequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded, making this definition equivalent to the one given above. Subsequential compactness is equivalent to the definition of compactness based on subcovers for metric spaces, but not for topological spaces in general.\nThe most general definition of compactness relies on the notion of \"open covers\" and \"subcovers\", which is applicable to topological spaces (and thus to metric spaces and formula_1 as special cases). In brief, a collection of open sets formula_136 is said to be an \"open cover\" of set formula_137 if the union of these sets is a superset of formula_137. This open cover is said to have a \"finite subcover\" if a finite subcollection of the formula_136 could be found that also covers formula_137.\nDefinition. A set formula_137 in a topological space is compact if every open cover of formula_137 has a finite subcover.\nCompact sets are well-behaved with respect to properties like convergence and continuity. For instance, any Cauchy sequence in a compact metric space is convergent. As another example, the image of a compact metric space under a continuous map is also compact.\nContinuity.\nA function from the set of real numbers to the real numbers can be represented by a graph in the Cartesian plane; such a function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken curve with no \"holes\" or \"jumps\".\nThere are several ways to make this intuition mathematically rigorous. Several definitions of varying levels of generality can be given. In cases where two or more definitions are applicable, they are readily shown to be equivalent to one another, so the most convenient definition can be used to determine whether a given function is continuous or not. In the first definition given below, formula_143 is a function defined on a non-degenerate interval formula_144 of the set of real numbers as its domain. Some possibilities include formula_145, the whole set of real numbers, an open interval formula_146 or a closed interval formula_147 Here, formula_69 and formula_149 are distinct real numbers, and we exclude the case of formula_144 being empty or consisting of only one point, in particular.\nDefinition. If formula_151 is a non-degenerate interval, we say that formula_152 is continuous at formula_153 if formula_154. We say that formula_30 is a continuous map if formula_30 is continuous at every formula_153.\nIn contrast to the requirements for formula_30 to have a limit at a point formula_159, which do not constrain the behavior of formula_30 at formula_159 itself, the following two conditions, in addition to the existence of formula_162, must also hold in order for formula_30 to be continuous at formula_159: (i) formula_30 must be defined at formula_159, i.e., formula_159 is in the domain of formula_30; \"and\" (ii) formula_169 as formula_170. The definition above actually applies to any domain formula_124 that does not contain an isolated point, or equivalently, formula_124 where every formula_173 is a limit point of formula_124. A more general definition applying to formula_175 with a general domain formula_176 is the following:\nDefinition. If formula_137 is an arbitrary subset of formula_1, we say that formula_175 is continuous at formula_180 if, for any formula_40, there exists formula_41 such that for all formula_183, formula_184 implies that formula_185. We say that formula_30 is a continuous map if formula_30 is continuous at every formula_180.\nA consequence of this definition is that formula_30 is \"trivially continuous at any isolated point\" formula_180. This somewhat unintuitive treatment of isolated points is necessary to ensure that our definition of continuity for functions on the real line is consistent with the most general definition of continuity for maps between topological spaces (which includes metric spaces and formula_1 in particular as special cases). This definition, which extends beyond the scope of our discussion of real analysis, is given below for completeness.\nDefinition. If formula_137 and formula_193 are topological spaces, we say that formula_194 is continuous at formula_180 if formula_196 is a neighborhood of formula_159 in formula_137 for every neighborhood formula_199 of formula_200 in formula_193. We say that formula_30 is a continuous map if formula_203 is open in formula_137 for every formula_205 open in formula_193.\nUniform continuity.\nDefinition. If formula_137 is a subset of the real numbers, we say a function formula_175 is uniformly continuous on formula_137 if, for any formula_70, there exists a formula_41 such that for all formula_215, formula_216 implies that formula_217.\nExplicitly, when a function is uniformly continuous on formula_137, the choice of formula_50 needed to fulfill the definition must work for \"all of\" formula_137 for a given formula_49. In contrast, when a function is continuous at every point formula_180 (or said to be continuous on formula_137), the choice of formula_50 may depend on both formula_49 \"and\" formula_159. In contrast to simple continuity, uniform continuity is a property of a function that only makes sense with a specified domain; to speak of uniform continuity at a single point formula_159 is meaningless.\nOn a compact set, it is easily shown that all continuous functions are uniformly continuous. If formula_124 is a bounded noncompact subset of formula_1, then there exists formula_104 that is continuous but not uniformly continuous. As a simple example, consider formula_231 defined by formula_232. By choosing points close to 0, we can always make formula_233 for any single choice of formula_41, for a given formula_70.\nAbsolute continuity.\nDefinition. Let formula_236 be an interval on the real line. A function formula_237 is said to be absolutely continuous on formula_144 if for every positive number formula_49, there is a positive number formula_50 such that whenever a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals formula_241 of formula_144 satisfies\nformula_243\nthen\nformula_244\nAbsolutely continuous functions are continuous: consider the case \"n\" = 1 in this definition. The collection of all absolutely continuous functions on \"I\" is denoted AC(\"I\"). Absolute continuity is a fundamental concept in the Lebesgue theory of integration, allowing the formulation of a generalized version of the fundamental theorem of calculus that applies to the Lebesgue integral.\nDifferentiation.\nThe notion of the \"derivative\" of a function or \"differentiability\" originates from the concept of approximating a function near a given point using the \"best\" linear approximation. This approximation, if it exists, is unique and is given by the line that is tangent to the function at the given point formula_69, and the slope of the line is the derivative of the function at formula_69.\nA function formula_247 is differentiable at formula_69 if the limit\nformula_249\nexists. This limit is known as the derivative of formula_30 at formula_69, and the function formula_252, possibly defined on only a subset of formula_1, is the derivative (or derivative function) of formula_30. If the derivative exists everywhere, the function is said to be differentiable.\nAs a simple consequence of the definition, formula_30 is continuous at formula_69 if it is differentiable there. Differentiability is therefore a stronger regularity condition than continuity, and it is possible for a function to be continuous on the entire real line but not differentiable anywhere (see Weierstrass's nowhere differentiable continuous function). It is possible to discuss the existence of higher-order derivatives as well, by finding the derivative of a derivative function, and so on.\nOne can classify functions by their differentiability class. The class formula_257 (sometimes formula_258 to indicate the interval of applicability) consists of all continuous functions. The class formula_259 consists of all differentiable functions whose derivative is continuous; such functions are called continuously differentiable. Thus, a formula_259 function is exactly a function whose derivative exists and is of class formula_257. In general, the classes \"formula_262\" can be defined recursively by declaring formula_257 to be the set of all continuous functions and declaring \"formula_262\" for any positive integer formula_27 to be the set of all differentiable functions whose derivative is in formula_266. In particular, \"formula_262\" is contained in formula_266 for every formula_27, and there are examples to show that this containment is strict. Class formula_270 is the intersection of the sets \"formula_262\" as \"formula_27\" varies over the non-negative integers, and the members of this class are known as the smooth functions. Class formula_273 consists of all analytic functions, and is strictly contained in formula_270 (see bump function for a smooth function that is not analytic).\nSeries.\nA series formalizes the imprecise notion of taking the sum of an endless sequence of numbers. The idea that taking the sum of an \"infinite\" number of terms can lead to a finite result was counterintuitive to the ancient Greeks and led to the formulation of a number of paradoxes by Zeno and other philosophers. The modern notion of assigning a value to a series avoids dealing with the ill-defined notion of adding an \"infinite\" number of terms. Instead, the finite sum of the first formula_66 terms of the sequence, known as a partial sum, is considered, and the concept of a limit is applied to the sequence of partial sums as formula_66 grows without bound. The series is assigned the value of this limit, if it exists.\nGiven an (infinite) sequence formula_14, we can define an associated series as the formal mathematical object sometimes simply written as formula_278. The partial sums of a series formula_278 are the numbers formula_280. A series formula_278 is said to be convergent if the sequence consisting of its partial sums, formula_282, is convergent; otherwise it is divergent. The sum of a convergent series is defined as the number \nThe word \"sum\" is used here in a metaphorical sense as a shorthand for taking the limit of a sequence of partial sums and should not be interpreted as simply \"adding\" an infinite number of terms. For instance, in contrast to the behavior of finite sums, rearranging the terms of an infinite series may result in convergence to a different number (see the article on the \"Riemann rearrangement theorem\" for further discussion).\nAn example of a convergent series is a geometric series which forms the basis of one of Zeno's famous paradoxes:\nformula_283\nIn contrast, the harmonic series has been known since the Middle Ages to be a divergent series:\nformula_284\nA series formula_278 is said to converge absolutely if formula_287 is convergent. A convergent series formula_278 for which formula_287 diverges is said to converge non-absolutely. It is easily shown that absolute convergence of a series implies its convergence. On the other hand, an example of a series that converges non-absolutely is\nformula_290\nTaylor series.\nThe Taylor series of a real or complex-valued function \"\u0192\"(\"x\") that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number \"a\" is the power series\nformula_291\nwhich can be written in the more compact sigma notation as\nformula_292\nwhere \"n\"! denotes the factorial of \"n\" and \"\u0192\"\u00a0(\"n\")(\"a\") denotes the \"n\"th derivative of \"\u0192\" evaluated at the point \"a\". The derivative of order zero \"\u0192\" is defined to be \"\u0192\" itself and (\"x\" \u2212 \"a\")0 and 0! are both defined to be\u00a01. In the case that \"a\" \n 0, the series is also called a Maclaurin series.\nA Taylor series of \"f\" about point \"a\" may diverge, converge at only the point \"a\", converge for all \"x\" such that formula_293 (the largest such \"R\" for which convergence is guaranteed is called the \"radius of convergence\"), or converge on the entire real line. Even a converging Taylor series may converge to a value different from the value of the function at that point. If the Taylor series at a point has a nonzero radius of convergence, and sums to the function in the disc of convergence, then the function is analytic. The analytic functions have many fundamental properties. In particular, an analytic function of a real variable extends naturally to a function of a complex variable. It is in this way that the exponential function, the logarithm, the trigonometric functions and their inverses are extended to functions of a complex variable.\nFourier series.\nFourier series decomposes periodic functions or periodic signals into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or complex exponentials). The study of Fourier series typically occurs and is handled within the branch mathematics &gt; mathematical analysis &gt; Fourier analysis.\nIntegration.\nIntegration is a formalization of the problem of finding the area bound by a curve and the related problems of determining the length of a curve or volume enclosed by a surface. The basic strategy to solving problems of this type was known to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and was known as the \"method of exhaustion\". Generally speaking, the desired area is bounded from above and below, respectively, by increasingly accurate circumscribing and inscribing polygonal approximations whose exact areas can be computed. By considering approximations consisting of a larger and larger (\"infinite\") number of smaller and smaller (\"infinitesimal\") pieces, the area bound by the curve can be deduced, as the upper and lower bounds defined by the approximations converge around a common value.\nThe spirit of this basic strategy can easily be seen in the definition of the Riemann integral, in which the integral is said to exist if upper and lower Riemann (or Darboux) sums converge to a common value as thinner and thinner rectangular slices (\"refinements\") are considered. Though the machinery used to define it is much more elaborate compared to the Riemann integral, the Lebesgue integral was defined with similar basic ideas in mind. Compared to the Riemann integral, the more sophisticated Lebesgue integral allows area (or length, volume, etc.; termed a \"measure\" in general) to be defined and computed for much more complicated and irregular subsets of Euclidean space, although there still exist \"non-measurable\" subsets for which an area cannot be assigned.\nRiemann integration.\nThe Riemann integral is defined in terms of Riemann sums of functions with respect to tagged partitions of an interval. Let formula_294 be a closed interval of the real line; then a tagged partition formula_295 of formula_294 is a finite sequence\nformula_297\nThis partitions the interval formula_294 into formula_66 sub-intervals formula_300 indexed by formula_301, each of which is \"tagged\" with a distinguished point formula_302. For a function formula_30 bounded on formula_294, we define the Riemann sum of formula_30 with respect to tagged partition formula_295 as\nformula_307\nwhere formula_308 is the width of sub-interval formula_309. Thus, each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. The mesh of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, formula_310. We say that the Riemann integral of formula_30 on formula_294 is formula_313 if for any formula_40 there exists formula_41 such that, for any tagged partition formula_295 with mesh formula_317, we have\nformula_318\nThis is sometimes denoted formula_319. When the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum is known as the upper (respectively, lower) Darboux sum. A function is Darboux integrable if the upper and lower Darboux sums can be made to be arbitrarily close to each other for a sufficiently small mesh. Although this definition gives the Darboux integral the appearance of being a special case of the Riemann integral, they are, in fact, equivalent, in the sense that a function is Darboux integrable if and only if it is Riemann integrable, and the values of the integrals are equal. In fact, calculus and real analysis textbooks often conflate the two, introducing the definition of the Darboux integral as that of the Riemann integral, due to the slightly easier to apply definition of the former.\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus asserts that integration and differentiation are inverse operations in a certain sense.\nLebesgue integration and measure.\nLebesgue integration is a mathematical construction that extends the integral to a larger class of functions; it also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined. The concept of a measure, an abstraction of length, area, or volume, is central to Lebesgue integral probability theory.\nDistributions.\nDistributions (or generalized functions) are objects that generalize functions. Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. In particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative.\nRelation to complex analysis.\nReal analysis is an area of analysis that studies concepts such as sequences and their limits, continuity, differentiation, integration and sequences of functions. By definition, real analysis focuses on the real numbers, often including positive and negative infinity to form the extended real line. Real analysis is closely related to complex analysis, which studies broadly the same properties of complex numbers. In complex analysis, it is natural to define differentiation via holomorphic functions, which have a number of useful properties, such as repeated differentiability, expressibility as power series, and satisfying the Cauchy integral formula.\nIn real analysis, it is usually more natural to consider differentiable, smooth, or harmonic functions, which are more widely applicable, but may lack some more powerful properties of holomorphic functions. However, results such as the fundamental theorem of algebra are simpler when expressed in terms of complex numbers.\nTechniques from the theory of analytic functions of a complex variable are often used in real analysis \u2013 such as evaluation of real integrals by residue calculus.\nImportant results.\nImportant results include the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass and Heine\u2013Borel theorems, the intermediate value theorem and mean value theorem, Taylor's theorem, the fundamental theorem of calculus, the Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli theorem, the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, Fatou's lemma, and the monotone convergence and dominated convergence theorems.\nGeneralizations and related areas of mathematics.\nVarious ideas from real analysis can be generalized from the real line to broader or more abstract contexts. These generalizations link real analysis to other disciplines and subdisciplines. For instance, generalization of ideas like continuous functions and compactness from real analysis to metric spaces and topological spaces connects real analysis to the field of general topology, while generalization of finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to infinite-dimensional analogs led to the concepts of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces and, more generally to functional analysis. Georg Cantor's investigation of sets and sequence of real numbers, mappings between them, and the foundational issues of real analysis gave birth to naive set theory. The study of issues of convergence for sequences of functions eventually gave rise to Fourier analysis as a subdiscipline of mathematical analysis. Investigation of the consequences of generalizing differentiability from functions of a real variable to ones of a complex variable gave rise to the concept of holomorphic functions and the inception of complex analysis as another distinct subdiscipline of analysis. On the other hand, the generalization of integration from the Riemann sense to that of Lebesgue led to the formulation of the concept of abstract measure spaces, a fundamental concept in measure theory. Finally, the generalization of integration from the real line to curves and surfaces in higher dimensional space brought about the study of vector calculus, whose further generalization and formalization played an important role in the evolution of the concepts of differential forms and smooth (differentiable) manifolds in differential geometry and other closely related areas of geometry and topology.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Following his retirement from international cricket in 1964, Benaud became a highly regarded commentator on the game.\nBenaud was a Test cricket all-rounder, blending leg spin bowling with lower-order batting aggression. Along with fellow bowling all-rounder Alan Davidson, he helped restore Australia to the top of world cricket in the late 1950s and early 1960s after a slump in the early 1950s. In 1958, he became Australia's Test captain until his retirement in 1964. He became the first player to reach 200 wickets and 2,000 runs in Test cricket, reaching the milestone in 1963.\nGideon Haigh described him as \"perhaps the most influential cricketer and cricket personality since the Second World War.\" In his review of Benaud's autobiography \"Anything But\", Sri Lankan cricket writer Harold de Andrado wrote: \"Richie Benaud possibly next to Sir Don Bradman has been one of the greatest cricketing personalities as player, researcher, writer, critic, author, organiser, adviser and student of the game.\"\nEarly years.\nBenaud was born in Penrith, New South Wales, in 1930. He came from a cricket family, with his younger brother John Benaud also going on to become an Australian Test cricketer. His father Louis, a third-generation Australian of French Huguenot descent, was a leg spinner who played for Penrith District Cricket Club in Sydney Grade Cricket, gaining attention for taking all twenty wickets in a match against St. Marys for 65. Lou later moved to Parramatta region in western Sydney, and played for Cumberland. Benaud also used to live in Coraki, NSW.\nIt was here that Richie Benaud grew up, learning how to bowl leg breaks, googlies and topspinners under his father's watch. Educated at Parramatta High School, Benaud made his first grade debut for Cumberland at age 16, primarily as a batsman.\nIn November 1948, at the age of 18, Benaud was selected for the New South Wales Colts, the state youth team. He scored 47 not out and took 3/37 in an innings win over Queensland. As a specialist batsman, he made his first-class debut for New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground against Queensland in the New Year's match of the 1948\u201349 season. On a green pitch which was struck by a downpour on the opening day, Benaud's spin was not used by Arthur Morris, and he failed to make an impression with the bat in his only innings, scoring only two. New South Wales were the dominant state at the time, and vacancies in the team were scarce, particularly as there were no Tests that season and all of the national team players were available for the whole summer.\nRelegated to the Second XI after this match, he was struck in the head above the right eye by a ball from Jack Daniel while batting against Victoria in Melbourne, having missed an attempted hook. After 28 X-rays showed nothing, it was finally diagnosed that the crater in his forehead had resulted in a skull fracture and he was sidelined for the remainder of the season, since a second impact could have been fatal. He spent two weeks in hospital for the surgery. This was the only match he played for the second-string state team that summer.\nIn his early career, Benaud was a batting all-rounder, marked by a looping backlift which made him suspect against fast bowling but allowed him to have a wide attacking stroke range. At the start of the 1949\u201350 season, he was still in the Second XI, but when the Test players departed for a tour of South Africa soon afterwards, vacancies opened up. Benaud was recalled to the New South Wales First XI in late December for the Christmas and New Year's fixtures. With Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Ernie Toshack, three of Australia's leading four bowlers from the 1948 \"Invincibles\" tour of England unavailable, Benaud bowled heavily in some matches. However, he did not have much success in his five games, taking only five wickets at 54.00.\nHe took the wicket of Queensland batsman Bill Brown in his third match of the season. Benaud erroneously recalled in an autobiography that this was his maiden wicket\u2014it was, in fact, his fourth\u2014and described the ball as \"the worst I ever bowled\". He had more success with the bat, scoring 93 and narrowly missing a century against South Australia. He added another fifty and ended with 250 runs at 31.25.\nFor the next season, England toured Australia, and with the Test players back, Benaud was initially forced out of the team. He was recalled for a match against the Englishmen. He was attacked by the touring batsmen, taking 1/75 from 16.5 overs in his first outing against an international outfit. His only wicket was that of the all-rounder Trevor Bailey. He scored 20 not out and was not called on to bowl in the second innings.\nIn the next Shield match against Victoria, led by Australian captain Lindsay Hassett, Benaud came in for attack. Hassett was known for his prowess against spin bowling, being the only batsman to score centuries in a match against the leg-spin of Bill O'Reilly, regarded as the finest bowler of his age. Hassett struck 179 in four hours, and took 47 runs from Benaud's seven overs. The young leg spinner claimed Hassett in the second innings when a ball landed in a crack and skidded through onto his foot. He ended with 3/56, the first time he had taken three wickets in a match.\nIn the next match against South Australia, he made 48, took 4/93 and 1/29 and suffered three dropped catches by the wicketkeeper in successive balls. Benaud was cementing his position and was in the senior team for four consecutive matches even with the Test players available. He was selected for an Australian XI match against England, in what was effectively a trial for Test selection, but suffered a chipped bone in his thumb. This put him out of action until the last match of the season, leaving him with little opportunity to impress the national selectors for his rise to international cricket. Benaud returned and scored 37 and took a total of 2/68 in the final match, ending the season with 184 runs at 36.80 and 11 wickets at 34.63.\nEarly Test career.\nThe 1951\u201352 season saw a tour to Australia by the West Indies. Benaud was given a chance against the visiting team when New South Wales played them in Sydney after the First Test. On a green pitch, Benaud came in at 7/96 and featured in a century partnership in only an hour, making 43 himself. The Caribbeans were skittled for 134 in reply and went on to lose the match, although they attacked the young leg-spinner, who took 1/130 in total from 36 overs. Benaud scored his maiden first-class century, 117 against South Australia, in the next match, two years after falling short of the milestone by seven runs. In the next four matches, Benaud passed 15 only once, scoring a 34, and took only seven wickets. Up to this point, in seven matches for the season, the young all-rounder had only scored 307 runs at 27.90 and taken ten wickets at 64.80.\nDespite this, Benaud was chosen for his Test debut in the Fifth Test against the West Indies in 1951\u201352 in Sydney. At this point, Australia had already taken an unassailable 3\u20131 series lead and decided to try out some young players. Selected as a batsman, he scored 3 and 19. Hassett allowed him to bowl only in the second innings, when nine West Indian wickets had fallen and Australia were on the verge of an inevitable victory. Leading opposition batsman Everton Weekes edged Benaud in his first over, but Gil Langley dropped the catch. Benaud went on to dismiss tail-ender Alf Valentine for his first Test wicket, conceding 14 runs from 4.3 overs. Benaud ended his season with 97 and a total of 3/39 in an innings win over South Australia.\nFor the following Australian season in 1952\u201353, Benaud started modestly; and, in the five first-class matches before the Tests, he scored 208 runs at 26.00, including a 63 and 69, and 14 wickets at 38.64. This included figures of 2/70 and 4/90 against the touring\nSouth Africa. However, this was not enough to ensure his selection in the First Test, where he was made 12th man. After scoring 60 and 37 and taking 1/60 in an Australian XI against the South Africans following the Test, he was selected for the Second Test. He suffered a smashed gum and a severely cut top lip when a square cut by John Waite in the Third Test against South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground hit him in the face while he was fielding at short gully.\nDoctors told him he was lucky: it could have broken his cheekbones, jaw or removed his eyesight if it had hit any of the surrounding areas. It could have killed him if it had struck him where his skull was previously fractured. He married after the match and had to mumble his wedding vows through a swathe of bandages. Benaud went on to play in the final four Tests. He made 124 runs at 20.66, making double figures in four of seven innings, but was unable to capitalise on his starts, with a top score of 45. His leg spin yielded ten wickets at 30.60, with a best of 4/118 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide when he was given a heavy workload, totalling 58 overs, when Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller broke down during the match. In another match for New South Wales against the touring team, he took a total of 5/95.\nUp to this point, his first-class batting average was below 30 and his bowling average close to 40, and he had never taken more than four wickets in an innings or six in a match.\nThe selectors persisted in Benaud despite his unproductive Test performances, selecting him for the squad for the 1953 Ashes tour of England. He had been seventh and eighth in the domestic run-scoring and wicket-taking aggregates for the season, but was yet to convert this into international performance. He justified their decision prior to the team's departure, scoring 167 not out and taking match figures of 7/137 for the touring team against a Tasmania Combined XI, his wickets including Test batsmen Miller, Ian Craig and Neil Harvey. He also put on 167 in a partnership with Alan Davidson, the first collaboration between the pair, who would later go on to lead Australia's bowling in the last five years of their career. Benaud struck an unbeaten 100 and totalled 1/64 in the next match against Western Australia before the Australians departed for England.\nOn arrival in the British Isles, Benaud quickly made an impression with both bat and ball. After scoring 44 and taking 2/66 in the opening first-class match against Worcestershire, the all-rounder starred in his next match, against Yorkshire. He scored 97 in Australia's only innings and then took 7/46 in the hosts' first innings as the Australians took an innings win. Although his form with the willow dropped off in his remaining six matches before the Tests\u2014a 35 was his only score beyond 20 in seven attempts\u2014Benaud continued to strike regularly with the ball. He took 18 wickets in these matches, including 3/20 and 3/37 against Oxford University, 5/13 against Minor Counties and 4/38 against Hampshire. This was enough for him to gain selection for the start of the Tests.\nHe managed only eight runs in four innings in the first two Tests, and having taken only two wickets for 136 runs was dropped for the Third. This was part of a month-long run in which he made only 123 runs in eight innings and took only seven wickets in four matches. He was recalled immediately for the Fourth Test, but was dropped for the Fifth after managing seven runs in his only innings and going wicketless. He ended the Test series with 15 runs at 3.00 and two wickets at 87.00. It was thought that the surface at the Oval would favour pacemen, but Australia's selection proved to be a blunder as England's spinners took them to the only win of the series, allowing them to regain the Ashes.\nHe also showed his hitting ability in a tour match against T.N. Pearce's XI at Scarborough. Opening the batting, he struck 135 in 110 minutes in the second innings, including an Australian record of eleven sixes, four of them in one over. In eight first-class matches after his Test campaign was over, Benaud added a further half-century in addition to the century against Pearce's XI, and took 22 more wickets, including 4/20 against the Gentlemen of England.\nConsolidation.\nAfter returning home from his first overseas tour, Benaud was prolific during the 1953\u201354 Australian season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team. He contributed significantly with both bat and ball in New South Wales' Sheffield Shield triumph, the first of nine consecutive titles. In the opening match of the season, he struck 158 and took 5/88 and 1/65 against Queensland. He made another century in the return match, striking 144 not out and taking a total of 2/55. Midway through the season, he played in Morris's XI in a testimonial match for Hassett, who captained the other team. Benaud scored 78 and 68 and took a total of 5/238, his dismissals being Davidson and frontline Test batsmen in a 121-run win. He then finished the summer strongly, and ended the season with 811 runs at 62.38 and 35 wickets at 30.54. Benaud was the only bowler selected for all five Tests of the 1954\u201355 series when England visited Australia. He secured his place after scoring 125 against Queensland at the start of the season, although his lead-up form in two matches against England for his state and an Australian XI was not encouraging.\nAt this stage of his career, he had played 13 Tests with mediocre results. Selected as a batsman who could bowl, he had totalled 309 runs at 15.45 without passing 50, and taken 23 wickets at 37.87 with only two four-wicket innings hauls. Even so, he was promoted to vice-captain above several senior players when Ian Johnson and Keith Miller missed the 2nd Test at Sydney through injury and Arthur Morris was made temporary captain. He also made 113 against the touring side for the Prime Minister's XI.\nAustralia's selectors persisted and selected him for the squad to tour the West Indies in 1954\u201355. Their faith was rewarded by an improvement in performances. Benaud contributed 46 and match figures of 2/73 in a First Test victory at Kingston. After a draw in the Second Test, he took three wickets in four balls to end with 4/15 in the first innings at Georgetown, Guyana, before scoring 68 (his first Test half century) as Australia moved to a 2\u20130 series lead. In the Fifth Test at Kingston, he struck a century in 78 minutes, despite taking 15 minutes to score his first run. He ended with 121 and took four wickets in the match as Australia won by an innings and took the series 3\u20130. Benaud had contributed 246 runs at 41 and taken wickets steadily to total 18 at 26.94.\nDuring the 1956 tour to England, he helped Australia to its only victory in the Lord's Test, when he scored a rapid 97 in the second innings in 143 minutes from only 113 balls. His fielding, in particular at gully and short leg, was consistently of a high standard, in particular his acrobatic catch to dismiss Colin Cowdrey. He was unable to maintain the standards he had set in the West Indies, contributing little apart from the Lord's Test. He ended the series with 200 runs at 25 and eight wickets at 42.5.\nBenaud's bowling reached a new level on the return leg of Australia's overseas tour, when they stopped in the Indian subcontinent in 1956\u201357 en route back to Australia. In a one-off Test against Pakistan in Karachi, he scored 56 and took 1/36 as Australia fell to defeat. He claimed his Test innings best of 7/72 in the first innings of the First Test in Madras, allowing Australia to build a large lead and win by an innings. It was his first five-wicket haul in a Test innings. After taking four wickets in the drawn Second Test in Bombay, Benaud bowled Australia to victory in the Third Test in Calcutta, sealing the series 2\u20130. He took 6/52 and 5/53, his best-ever match analysis, ending the series with 113 runs at 18.83 and 24 wickets at 17.66.\nIt was the first of his successes against India, against whom he took his wickets at an average of 18. This put him in a small group of spinners whose career averages were inferior to their performances against India, generally regarded as the best players of spin in the world. At this stage of his career, he had yet to perform consistently with bat and ball simultaneously, apart from his breakthrough series in the Caribbean. He had managed, in the 14 Tests since then, 559 runs at 27.95 and 67 wickets at 24.98.\nBenaud took part in Australia's tour of New Zealand from February to March 1957. The tour included seven first-class matches, three of which were unofficial Tests. Benaud was the top wicket-taker on the tour, with 32 wickets at 19.31, and Australia's top wicket-taker in the three matches against New Zealand, with 15 wickets at 21.73. Early in the tour, when the team visited Timaru to pay a minor match, Benaud went to a pharmacy to see if he could get something to soothe his spinning-fingers, which had been torn by his spinning action for many years. The pharmacist, Ivan James, suggested a treatment with calamine lotion and boracic acid. It worked at once, and Benaud used it thereafter. \"Meeting Ivan James was a remarkable piece of luck,\" he wrote later; \"walking into that chemist's shop in Timaru saved my bowling career.\"\nPeak years and captaincy.\nAfter a break in the international calendar of a year, the 1957\u201358 tour to South Africa heralded the start of a phase of three international seasons when Benaud was at his peak. The tour saw his bowling talents come to the fore when he took 106 wickets, surpassing the previous record of 104 by England's Sydney Barnes. He scored 817 runs including four centuries, two of them in Test matches. The first of these came in the First Test at Johannesburg, where after conceding 1/115, Benaud struck 122, his highest Test score, to see Australia reach a draw.\nIn the Second Test at Cape Town, Benaud took 4/95 and then 5/49 in the second innings to secure an innings victory after the home team were forced to follow on. He followed this with 5/114 in a drawn Third Test, before a match-winning all round performance in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg. Benaud struck exactly 100 in the first innings, before taking 4/70 in South Africa's reply. When South Africa followed on, Benaud took 5/84, which left Australia needing only one run to win. He took 5/82 in the second innings of the Fifth Test, the fourth consecutive match in which he had taken five wickets in an innings, as Australia took a 3\u20130 series win. He had been a major contributor to the series win, scoring 329 runs at 54.83 and taking 30 wickets at 21.93, establishing himself as one of the leading leg spinners of the modern era.\nWhen Ian Craig fell ill at the start of the 1958\u201359 season, Benaud was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice-captain Neil Harvey. Harvey and Benaud had been captains of their respective states until Harvey moved in the same season for employment purposes from Victoria to New South Wales and became Benaud's deputy. Benaud had little prior leadership experience, and faced the task of recovering the Ashes from an England team which had arrived in Australia as favourites. He led from the front with his bowling, taking match figures of 7/112 in his debut as captain as Australia claimed the First Test in Brisbane. Benaud's men won the Second Test, before he took 5/83 and 4/94 in the drawn Third Test. Benaud produced an all-round performance of 46, 5/91 and 4/82 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to take an unassailable 3\u20130 series lead and regain the Ashes, before scoring 64 and match figures of 5/57 to help take the Fifth Test and a 4\u20130 series result. Benaud contributed 132 runs at 26.4 and 31 wickets at the low average of 18.83, as well as his shrewd and innovative captaincy. According to Neil Harvey, he also was the first captain who started hosting team meetings, a procedure now followed by his successors after he retired.\nBenaud then led Australia on its first full tour of the Indian subcontinent, playing three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively. Benaud took 4/69 and 4/42 in the First Test in Dacca (now in Bangladesh), sealing Australia's first win in Pakistan. He took four wickets in a Second Test in Lahore that sealed the series 2\u20130, the last time Australia would win a Test in Pakistan until Mark Taylor's men in 1998, 37 years later. Six further wickets in the drawn Third Test saw Benaud end the series with 84 runs at 28 and 18 wickets at 21.11. Benaud made a strong start to the series against India, taking 3/0 in the first innings of the First Test in Delhi, before a 5/76-second innings haul secured an innings victory. Benaud had less of an impact on the next two Tests, which Australia lost and drew, totaling 6/244. He returned to form with 5/43 and 3/43 as India were defeated by an innings after being forced to follow on in the Fourth Test in Madras. A further seven wickets from the captain in the Fifth Test saw Australia secure a draw and the series 2\u20131.\nBenaud had contributed 91 runs at 15.16 and 29 wickets at 19.59. The first two seasons of the Benaud captaincy had been a resounding success, with Australia winning eight, drawing four and losing only one Test. Benaud's personal form was a major factor in this success. In the previous seasons when he and his team were at their peak, he had scored 636 runs at 31.8 with taken 108 wickets at 20.27 in eighteen Tests, averaging six wickets a match.\nLater career.\nBenaud took over when Australian cricket was in a low phase with a young team. His instinctive, aggressive captaincy and daring approach to cricket \u2013 and his charismatic nature and public relations ability \u2013 revitalised cricket interest in Australia. This was exhibited in the 1960\u201361 Test series against the visiting West Indians, in which the grounds were packed to greater levels than they are today despite Australia's population doubling since then.\nThe First Test in Brisbane ended in the first tie in Test history, which came about after Benaud and Alan Davidson, rather than settle for a draw, decided to risk defeat and play an attacking partnership, which took Australia to the brink of victory. Australia had fallen to 6/92 on the final day chasing a target of 233 with Benaud and Davidson at the crease. Australia's chances of winning looked remote when they reached tea at 6/109 with 124 runs still required with only the tailenders to follow. Despite this, Benaud told chairman of selectors Don Bradman that he would still be going for an improbable victory in accordance with his policy of aggression. With an attacking partnership, the pair took Australia to within sight of the target.\nBoth men were noted for their hitting ability and viewed attack as their most effective chance of survival. Regular boundaries and quickly-run singles took the score to 226, a seventh-wicket partnership of 134. Only seven runs were required with four wickets in hand as time was running short. Benaud hit a ball into the covers and the pair attempted a quick single when a direct hit from Joe Solomon saw Davidson run out. Australia needed six runs from the final over, in which Benaud was caught and the last two wickets fell to run outs while attempting the winning run.\nThe Test was tied when Solomon ran out Ian Meckiff with a direct hit. Benaud had an ineffective match with the ball, taking 1/162. He took 4/107 in a seven-wicket victory in Melbourne, before the West Indies levelled the series with a 22-run win in Sydney. Benaud had a heavy load in the match, taking 8/199 after Davidson tore a hamstring mid-match. In Adelaide, with Davidson absent, Benaud bowled long spells to take match figures of 7/207 in addition to a score of 77 in the first innings. With Davidson back, Australia won the final Test by two wickets, after a controversial incident in which Australian wicketkeeper Wally Grout was not given out hit wicket when a bail was dislodged and the umpires did not notice. Australia won the series 2\u20131, and although Benaud was below his best, scoring at 21.77 and taking 23 wickets at 33.87, the series was a success for cricket. The unprecedented public interest saw the Caribbean touring party farewelled with a ticker-tape parade by the Australian public. Along with the West Indian captain Frank Worrell, Benaud's bold leadership enlivened interest in Test cricket among a public who had increasingly regarded it as boring.\nOn his third and final tour to England in 1961, he was hampered by damaged tendons in his right shoulder, which forced him to miss the Second Test at Lord's known as the \"Battle of the Ridge\". In all he missed a third of the matches due to injury. Despite this impairment to his bowling shoulder, his team played with an aggressive strategy leading them to lose only one Test match and no other matches during the tour, honouring his pre-series pledge. The First Test at Edgbaston was drawn with Benaud taking three wickets. After Harvey led the team to victory at Lord's, Benaud had an unhappy return in the Third at Headingley scoring two runs in two innings and taking match figures of 2/108 as Australia lost within three days. With the series balanced at 1\u20131, the Fourth Test at Old Trafford initially brought no improvement, with Benaud scoring 2 and taking 0/80 in the first innings. He made 1 in the second before a last-wicket partnership between Davidson and Graham McKenzie of 98 yielded a defendable target.\nDuring England's chase on the final afternoon it became apparent that, with Ted Dexter scoring quickly, Australia would lose the Test unless England were bowled out. Benaud went around the wicket and bowled into the footmarks, having Dexter caught behind and then Peter May bowled around his legs. Benaud's 5/13 in 25 balls instigated an English collapse which saw Australia retain the Ashes. He finished the innings with 6/70. Benaud then took four wickets in the drawn Fifth Test to end the series 2\u20131. Benaud had a poor series with the bat, scoring 45 runs at 9, but was more successful with the ball, taking 15 wickets at 32.53. He finished the first-class tour with 627 runs and 61 wickets at 23.54. He was appointed an OBE in that year and in 1962 was named as one of the \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year.\nThe 1961\u201362 Australian season was purely a domestic one, with no touring international team. Benaud led New South Wales throughout a dominant season, winning the Sheffield Shield with 64 of the 80 possible points. Benaud was the leading wicket-taker of the season with 47 at 17.97. His aggressive tactical style brought large crowds throughout the season, with almost 18,000 watching one match against South Australia.\nIn another match against Victoria, he ordered his team to attempt to score 404 on the final day to take an unlikely victory in accordance with a promise to score at 400 per day. At one stage, New South Wales were six wickets down with less than 150 runs scored, but Benaud refused to attempt to defend for a draw. He made 140, in a seventh-wicket partnership of 255 in just 176 minutes, an Australian record that still stands.\nIn 1962\u201363 an English team under Dexter visited Australia. Fred Trueman with 216 Test wickets and Brian Statham with 229 were poised to overtake the record of 236 Test wickets set by the assistant-manager Alec Bedser. Benaud was another contender with 219 wickets, but it was Statham who broke the record (only to be overtaken by Trueman in New Zealand) and Benaud had to be content with breaking Ray Lindwall's Australian record of 228 Test wickets. In an early tour match Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18\u201310\u201318\u20137 for New South Wales against the MCC, which lost by an innings and 80 runs, the state's biggest win against the English team. Benaud started the series with seven wickets and a half century as the First Test in Brisbane was drawn. This was followed by three unproductive Tests which yielded only 5/360 and a win apiece. Benaud returned to form with match figures of 5/142 and 57 in the Fifth Test at Sydney, which ended in a draw when Benaud ordered Bill Lawry and Peter Burge to play out the last afternoon for a draw that would retain the Ashes. They were booed and heckled as they left the field and Benaud's reputation as a \"go ahead\" cricket captain was badly tarnished. The draw meant that the series was shared 1\u20131, the first time he had drawn a series after five successive wins. It was another lean series with the ball, Benaud's 17 wickets costing 40.47, the third consecutive series where his wickets cost more than 30. His batting was reliable, with 227 runs at 32.47.\nAt the start of the 1963\u201364 season, Benaud announced that it would be his last at first-class level. The first Test of the season, against the touring South Africans, saw high drama as Australia's left arm paceman Ian Meckiff was called for throwing by Colin Egar and removed from the attack by Benaud after one over. Benaud did not bowl Meckiff from the other end, and at the end of the match Meckiff announced his retirement. Benaud took 5/72 and scored 43 in the First Test, but then injured himself in a grade match, so Bob Simpson captained the team for the Second Test and won the match in Benaud's absence.\nUpon his return, Benaud advised the Australian Cricket Board that it would be in the better interests of the team if Simpson continued as captain for the remainder of the season. Benaud took 3/116 to complement scores of 43 and 90 on his return in the Third Test in Sydney. His final two Tests saw no fairytale finish, yielding only four wickets and 55 runs. His batting had been steady though with 231 runs at 33, but his bowling was less so, taking 12 wickets at 37.42.\nBenaud was awarded life membership by the New South Wales Cricket Association, but he returned it in protest in 1970 when his younger brother John was removed from the captaincy. In 1967\u201368 he captained a Commonwealth team against Pakistan, playing in his last five first-class fixtures.\nDuring Benaud's captaincy, Australia did not lose a series, and became the dominant team in world cricket. His success was based on his ability to attack, his tactical boldness and his ability to extract more performance from his players, in particular Davidson. He was known for his unbuttoned shirt, and raised eyebrows with his on-field exuberance. Benaud embraced his players when opposition wickets fell, something that was uncommon at the time. Benaud's bold leadership coupled with his charismatic nature and public relations ability enlivened interest in Test cricket among a public who had increasingly regarded it as boring.\nPlaying style.\nBenaud was not a large spinner of the ball, but he was known for his ability to extract substantial bounce from the surface. In addition to his accurate probing consistency, he possessed a well-disguised googly and topspinner which tricked many batsmen and yielded him many wickets. In his later career, he added the flipper, a combination of the googly and top spinner which was passed to him by Bruce Dooland. Coupled with his subtle variations in flight and angle of the delivery, he kept the batsman under constant pressure. Benaud had the tendency to bowl around the wicket at a time when he was one of the first players to do so; it had an influence on spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Ashley Giles. Benaud was regarded as one of the finest close-fielders of his era, either at gully or in a silly position. As a batsman, he was tall and lithe, known for his hitting power, in particular his lofted driving ability from the front foot.\nJohnnie Moyes said \"Certainly Benaud received a little help from the roughened patches, but he could do what the off-spinners could not do: he could turn the ball, mostly slowly, sometimes with more life. His control was admirable, and when Benaud gets a batsman in trouble he rarely if ever gives him a loose one. He keeps him pinned down, probing and probing until the victim is well and truly enmeshed.\"\nMedia career.\nAfter the 1956 Ashes tour, Benaud stayed behind in London to take a BBC presenter training course. He took up a journalism position with the \"News of the World\", beginning as a police roundsman before becoming a sports columnist. In 1960, he made his first radio commentary in the United Kingdom at the BBC, after which he moved into television.\nAfter retiring from playing in 1964, Benaud turned to full-time cricket journalism and commentary, dividing his time between Britain (where he worked for the BBC for many years before joining Channel 4 in 1999), and Australia (for the Nine Network). Overall he played in or commentated on approximately 500 Test matches, as he himself noted in one of his final interviews in Britain when asked if he would miss Test cricket.\nHe openly criticised the actions by the Chappell brothers (Trevor and Greg) in the post-match reaction to the underarm bowling incident of 1981. He vacated the commentary booth when New Zealand was about to clinch a Test victory at Lord's in 1999, allowing former New Zealand captain-turned-commentator Ian Smith to call the famous victory of his compatriots. Some of his other memorable moments he commentated on included Shane Warne's \"Ball of the Century\", Ian Botham's dominant all-round display during the 1981 Ashes, Dennis Lillee overtaking Benaud's record for most wickets, and subsequent 300th and 310th wickets, and Andrew Symonds' tackle on a streaker.\nThe idea for what became his trademark\u2014wearing a cream or white jacket during live commentary\u2014came from Channel 9 owner Kerry Packer, who suggested the look to help Benaud stand out from the rest of the commentary team.\nHe also helped to design a computer-based parody of himself available for download off Channel 4's website called \"Desktop Richie\". It was developed by the software company Turtlez Ltd. Having downloaded this, cricket fans would be treated to live Test match updates and weather reports from a cartoon version of Benaud with real voice samples such as \"Got 'im!\" and \"That's stumps\u00a0... and time for a glass of something chilled\". On Channel 4's live commentary, Benaud often made sarcastic comments regarding the advertisement of Desktop Richie.\nIn 2004, Benaud starred in a series of television advertisements for the Australian Tourism Commission, aimed at promoting Australia as a tourist destination. Benaud's ad featured him in various scenic locations uttering his signature comment, \"Marvellous!\". It was also emulated by New Zealand broadcaster John Campbell. He appeared in \"Richie Benaud's Greatest XI\", a video in which he chooses his own team.\nBenaud became a staunch advocate of cricket being available on free-to-view TV. He chose to end his British commentary career, which spanned more than 42 years, when the rights to broadcast live Test match cricket were lost by Channel 4 to the subscription broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting. Thus, the 2005 Ashes series was the last that Benaud commentated on in Britain. His final commentary came near the end of the final day of the Fifth Test at the Oval. His last goodbye was interrupted by Glenn McGrath taking Kevin Pietersen's wicket; Benaud simply wove his description of the dismissal into what he was already saying. Benaud stated he would spend the Northern Hemisphere summer in Britain writing, and would continue working for the Nine Network in Australia.\nBenaud commentated for the BBC TV highlights of the 2006\u201307 Ashes in Australia as part of his continuing commentary work for Australia's Nine Network.\nBenaud's distinctive speaking style has been frequently parodied on the Australian comedy series \"Comedy Inc.\" and \"The Twelfth Man\". In the case of the latter, comedian Billy Birmingham's impersonations of Benaud on The Twelfth Man comedy recordings have become very successful, spanning more than twenty years. Chris Barrie of \"Red Dwarf\" fame incorporated impressions of Benaud into his stand-up repertoire.\nOn 18 February 2009, during a radio interview, Benaud announced that he would be retiring from television commentary. Benaud said: \"I'll be doing Australian cricket next year\u20142010\u2014but I don't do any television at all anywhere else now and when I finish next year, then I'll be doing other things\u00a0... But that'll be no more television commentary\".\nIt was announced on 15 November 2009, that Benaud had signed a three-year contract with the Nine Network to continue being part of their cricket coverage until 2013, although his role would change from that of ball-by-ball commentary. Benaud said: \"I won't be doing live commentary any more.\" Someone asked me, \"Does that mean you'll never again go into the commentary box?\", \"Well, the answer to that\", Benaud replied, \"If there is, as there always can be, some emergency or a sensational happening on or off the field where it would be quite ridiculous not to go into the commentary box, of course I'll be in there doing my job and doing it as professionally as I can. But I won't be on the live commentary roster. But I will be doing all sorts of, what I regard as, interesting things for Channel Nine on the cricket\u2014special features on the cricket\u00a0...\". Benaud commentated regularly during the 2011\u201312 season and was part of Nine's commentating team/roster.\nPersonal life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"This is the greatest loss for cricket since the loss of Don Bradman and for that reason I'm pleased to have offered the Benaud family a state funeral. There would be very few Australians who have not passed a summer in the company of Richie Benaud. He was the accompaniment of an Australian summer, his voice was even more present than the chirping of the cicadas in our suburbs and towns, and that voice, tragically, is now still.\"\nBenaud married Marcia Lavender in 1953 and had two sons, Greg and Jeffery, from this marriage; he divorced Marcia in 1967. In 1967, he married his second wife, Daphne Surfleet, who had worked for the English cricket writer E. W. Swanton. Benaud and Daphne often stayed at their holiday home in Beaulieu-sur-Mer on the French Riviera.\nOn 29 October 2008, Benaud's mother, Irene, died, aged 104. He said of her, \"She improved my love of vegetables by introducing the phrase, 'You can't go out and play cricket until you have eaten all your vegetables.'\"\nIn October 2013, Benaud crashed his vintage 1965 Sunbeam Alpine into a wall while driving near his home in Coogee, a beachside suburb in Sydney's east. He sustained a cracked sternum and shoulder injuries. Slow recovery meant he was unable to commentate for Australia's Channel Nine during the 2013\u201314 Ashes series.\nBenaud had last handed \"Baggy green\" caps to Simon Katich and Mitchell Starc when they made their Test debuts. Benaud's own was lost early in his Test career, and former captain\u2014now commentator and the Director of Cricket Australia, Mark Taylor\u2014was to present a replacement cap to him at the semi-final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup between Australia and India at the SCG, but Benaud was too unwell to attend, and when the cap arrived at Channel 9 headquarters, it was the day before Benaud died. It was presented to his wife.\nDeath.\nIn November 2014, at age 84, Benaud announced that he had been diagnosed with skin cancer. He died in his sleep on 10 April 2015.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott offered his family a state funeral; his widow, Daphne, declined, respecting his wishes for a private funeral.\nBenaud was buried on 15 April, in a private funeral ceremony attended only by his immediate family. Later that same day, there was a commemoration service officiated by former teammate turned lay preacher Brian Booth; attendees included his family and close friends\u2014among them former players, including Ian Chappell and Shane Warne, and Australian Test captain Michael Clarke.\nRecognition.\nBenaud was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1961 for services to cricket. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999, he was awarded a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Sports Broadcaster.\nIn 2007, he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame at the Allan Border Medal award evening and in 2009 he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\nIn November 2015, Benaud became an honouree at Bradman Foundation, having been a long-serving patron in his life. After rain interrupted the 2016 SCG Test against West Indies, the second day unofficially became Richie Benaud Day as 501 Benaud impersonators stayed at the SCG, which is a day before the annual Jane McGrath Day for Breast Cancer awareness and fundraising, which was again rained out.\nIn 2017, the Australian Mint issued a 50-cent coin commemorating Benaud.\nIn October 2018, Benaud became the 40th Legend in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.\nBooks.\nBenaud wrote a number of books:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Several universities joined up and a headquarters was formed at the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. \nA particularly influential program of effects research was pursued in the Office of Radio Research (ORR) established by the Rockefeller Foundation under the auspices of Princeton University. Managed by Paul Lazarsfeld, Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 psychologist, the program was overseen by Hadley Cantril, Princeton psychologist, and Frank Stanton, director of research at CBS. The program was designed by Cantril and Stanton to determine why people listened to radio. Stanton, a psychological researcher who soon became CBS president, was naturally interested in what lured people to programs and to what extent a program and its ads boosted sales of products.\nAmong the subjects of the Project's first studies were soap operas, known as radio dramas at the time. Herta Herzog authored an article on this research, titled \"What Do We Really Know About Daytime Serial Listeners?\" It is considered a pioneering work of the uses-and-gratifications approach and the use of psychology research methods in media studies. Herta Herzog was formerly the Associate Director of the Office of Radio Research where she worked on consulting studies.\nThe Radio Project also conducted research on the Halloween broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds\" in 1938. Of the estimated six million people who heard this broadcast, they found that 25% accepted the program's reports of mass destruction. The majority of these did not think they were hearing a literal invasion from Mars, but rather an attack by Germany. The researchers determined that radio broadcasts from the Munich Crisis may have lent credence to this supposition. Pooley and Socolow (2013), however, contend that Cantril used inaccurate audience measurement methods which grossly overestimated the listening audience. Sensationalistic newspaper publicity following the broadcast also led to the myth of the terrorized audience that has continued well into the 21st century.\nA third research project was that of listening habits. Because of this, a new method was developed to survey an audience \u2013 this was dubbed the Little Annie Project. The official name was the Stanton-Lazarsfeld Program Analyzer. This allowed one not only to find out if a listener liked the performance, but how they felt at any individual moment, through a dial which they would turn to express their preference (positive or negative). This has since become an essential tool in focus group research.\nTheodor Adorno produced numerous reports on the effects of \"atomized listening\" which radio supported and of which he was highly critical. However, because of profound methodological disagreements with Lazarsfeld over the use of techniques such as listener surveys and \"Little Annie\" (Adorno thought both grossly simplified and ignored the degree to which expressed tastes were the result of commercial marketing), Adorno left the project in 1941.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26484", "revid": "41370779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26484", "title": "Religious pluralism", "text": "Stance of supporting peaceful coexistence and diversity of spiritual belief\nReligious pluralism is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of religious belief systems co-existing in society. It can indicate one or more of the following:\nDefinition and scopes.\nReligious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in \"Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism\", explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century United States. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called religious toleration: \"The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.\" In short, religious toleration is only the absence of religious persecution, and does not necessarily preclude religious discrimination. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the Thirteen Colonies, at least if one views the events from \"a late eighteenth-century perspective\". Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with \"something that is usually called religious liberty\". Mark Silka, in \"Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis\", states that religious pluralism \"enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a cultural construct that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.\"\nReligious pluralism can be defined as \"respecting the otherness of others\". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. Exclusivist religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some Protestant sects argue fiercely against Roman Catholicism, and fundamentalist Christians of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of Paganism and witchcraft are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the Enlightenment, and has informed governmental policy into the present day. For instance, Saudi Arabia has no protection for freedom of religion, and the country's non-Muslim population are at risk for discrimination and arrest on religious grounds. Of course, many religious communities have long been engaged in building peace, justice, and development themselves, and the emergence of the secular peacemaking field has led religious communities to systematize and institutionalize their own peacebuilding and interfaith work. The Catholic Church has worked in development and poverty reduction, human rights, solidarity, and peace, and after World War II, it began to develop specific tools and apply conflict transformation practices.\nGiving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the Lateran Treaty and Church of England. In the modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam for someone born into a Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into mosques, and forbid construction of churches, synagogues or temples in their countries.\nRelativism, the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of inclusivism. Likewise, syncretism, the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. Syncretism must not be confused with ecumenism, the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a schism.\nHistory.\nCultural and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in post-modernity.\nGerman philosophers of religion Ludwig Feuerbach and Ernst Troeltsch concluded that Asian religious traditions, in particular Hinduism and Buddhism, were the earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of freedom to the individuals to choose their own faith and develop a personal religious construct within it (see also Relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism); Jainism, another ancient Indian religion, as well as Daoism have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints. The Age of Enlightenment in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion after the French Revolution (liberalism, democracy, civil and political rights, freedom of thought, separation of Church and State, secularization), with rising acceptance of religious pluralism and decline of Christianity. According to Chad Meister, these pluralist trends in the Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism and religious tolerance.\nClassical civilization: Greek and Roman religions.\nFor the Romans, religion was part of the daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances; in the Imperial Era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to religious festivals and games (\"ludi)\". Women, slaves and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestal Virgins, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian persecution and domination.\nThe Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.\nMystery religions imported from the Near East (Ptolemaic Egypt, Persia and Mesopotamia), which offered initiates salvation through a personal God and eternal life after the death, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's family rites and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"magic\", conspiracy (), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the Senate's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC.\nAs the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them, since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.\nOne way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local Gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces (among them Cybele, Isis, Osiris, Serapis, Epona), and Gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one deity or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic religions. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict.\nChristianity.\nSome Christians have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept.\nMaximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Most Christians hold this idea to be logically impossible from the principle of contradiction. The two largest Christian branches, the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, both claim to be the \"one true church\" and that \"outside the true Church there is no salvation\"; Protestantism however, which has many different denominations, has no consistent doctrine in this regard, and has a variety of different positions regarding religious pluralism.\nOther Christians have held that there can be truth value and salvific value in other faith traditions. John Macquarrie, described in the \"Handbook of Anglican Theologians\" (1998) as \"unquestionably Anglicanism's most distinguished systematic theologian in the second half of the twentieth century\", wrote that \"there should be an end to proselytizing but that equally there should be no syncretism of the kind typified by the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed movement\" (p.\u00a02). In discussing nine founders of major faith traditions (Moses, Zoroaster, Lao-zu, Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad), which he called \"mediators between the human and the divine\", Macquarrie wrote that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also teaches a form of religious pluralism, that there is at least some truth in almost all religions and philosophies.\nClassical Christian views.\nBefore the Great Schism, mainstream Christianity confessed \"one holy catholic and apostolic church\", in the words of the Nicene Creed. Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Episcopalians and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the Catholic Church makes the claim that it alone is the one and only true Church founded by Jesus Christ, but the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.\nChurch unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of \"validity\" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the \"form\" of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as \"heterodox\" and \"schismatic\", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least secundum quid (see ecumenicism).\nModern Christian views.\nSome other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation. They continue to believe in \"one\" church, an \"invisible church\" which encompasses different types of Christians in different sects and denominations, believing in certain issues they deem fundamental, while disunited on a variety of doctrines they deem non-fundamental. Some evangelical Protestants are doubtful if Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox can possibly be members of this \"invisible church\", and usually they reject religious (typically restorationist) movements rooted in 19th-century American Christianity, such as Mormonism, Christian Science, or Jehovah's Witnesses as not distinctly Christian.\nThe Catholic Church, unlike some Protestant denominations, affirms \"developmental theology\", understood to mean that the \"Holy Spirit, in and through the evolving and often confused circumstances of concrete history, is gradually bringing the Church to an ever more mature understanding of the deposit of faith (the saving truths entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Apostles\u2014these as such cannot be changed or added to). The Church comes to recognize baptism of desire quite early in its history. Later, the Church realizes that Romans 2:14\u201316, for example, allows for the salvation of non-Christians who do not have unobstructed exposure to Christian teachings: \"When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires... They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts... Various forms of \"implicit faith\" come to hold standing, until at Vatican Council II, the Church declares: \"Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life\" (#16). Vatican Council II in its Declaration Nostra aetate addresses the non-Christian religions with respect and appreciation, affirming the goodness found in them. Since Vatican Council II, Catholic dialogists in particular are working out the implications of John Paul II's statement, in Redemptor hominis #6 that Christians should recognize \"the Holy Spirit operating outside the visible confines of the Mystical Body of Christ.\" Among these dialogists, Robert Magliola, an affiliate of the Italian community Vangelo e Zen (\"The Gospel and Zen\"), Desio and Milano, Italy, who taught in predominantly Buddhist cultures for years, and practiced Buddhist-Catholic dialogue there and in the West, and who is widely published in this dialogue, argues the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; If God has willed that all persons be saved (see Catechism of the Catholic Church #851, quoting 1 Tim. 2:4) but has not sent the opportunity of Christian conversion to all, how can we not conclude that God wills those good Buddhists in this latter category to live, flourish, and die as good Buddhists? That God in His providence\u2014at least for now\u2014wants Buddhism to be the setting for millions of good and noble people in the world? (This does not mean that Catholics should not witness to the Catholic faith or even\u2014on the proper occasions and in a courteous way\u2014consider it their duty to preach Catholicism to Buddhists, and to teach it mightily. But it does mean that Catholics would do well to remember that God alone sends the grace of conversion when and to whom He wills.)\nHinduism.\nHinduism is naturally pluralistic as it \"acknowledges different forms and representations of the divine, all understood in their relation to the supreme being, Brahman.\" Historians argue that the differentiations between the various Indic religions of the subcontinent were blurred before their specific codification and separation during British efforts to catalog different Indic philosophies. Moreover, Hinduism itself is the oldest major religion, explaining a relative lack of antipathy towards specifiable religious traditions \u2013 and so the Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. From a Vedantic perspective, Swami Bhaskarananda argues that Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not. In the 8th sutra of the Pratyabhij\u00f1ahrdyam, the Indian philosopher Ksemaraja says that all the siddhantas or theses of all the darsanas (schools of thought) are just the different aspects of the one Atman. It being all-pervading and all-inclusive, from matter to consciousness to nothingness, all are its aspects or its different roles. The Advaita Vedanta philosophy, a widely held view of many Hindus who follow Sanatana Dharma, encompasses pluralism. Other, lesser-known philosophers have strived to encompass Indic philosophies under traditions other than Advaita, including the Indian philosopher Vij\u00f1abhikshu. Thus, the culture of open boundaries and continuous interaction and synthesis between all schools of thought is a very important aspect in understanding Hinduism and its fundamental nature of plurality.\nIn several mantras, sutras, smriti, and shruti, the idea that there are many ways to approach Truth or an underlying Reality is emphasized.\nFor example, the Rig Veda states that the Truth can be known in different ways:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Truth is One, though the sages know it variously\u2014\u200a\nThe Rig Veda also envisions an ideal world where a diverse collective speaks together to focus upon an idea that pervades all:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Assemble, speak together: let your minds be all of one accord, as ancient Gods unanimous sit down to their appointed share.\nThe place is common, common the assembly, common the mind, so be their thought united.\nA common purpose do I lay before you, and worship with your general oblation.\nOne and the same be your resolve, and be your minds of one accord. United be the thoughts of all that all may happily agree.\u2014\u200a\nThe Uddhava Gita is explicit that those interested in spirituality should learn the perspectives of a diverse group of proficient practitioners rather than a singular one who espouses a specific doctrine:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Though the Absolute Truth is One, various sages and scriptures have described Him in many different ways. For this reason, an aspiring spiritual practitioner would do well to learn the perspectives of numerous spiritual masters, rather than just hearing from one.\u2014\u200a\nConversely, the Bhagavad Gita warns against exclusivism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But that which clings blindly to one idea as if it were all, without logic, truth or insight, that has its origin in Darkness.\u2014\u200a\nIt also affirms Truth in a variety of spiritual practices:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to Me.\u2014\u200a\nBuddhism.\nBuddhist doctrine, fundamentally based upon minimizing or negating the suffering which arises from attachment, like its sister Indic religions, opposes exclusivism and emphasizes pluralism. This is not only encapsulated in the life story of the Buddha, who sought many gurus himself before resolving to seek Enlightenment on his own, but also in Buddhist scripture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What one person, abiding by the (philosophical) views, saying, 'This is the most excellent,' considers the highest in the world, everything different from that he says is wretched, therefore he has not overcome dispute.\u2014\u200a\nThe Buddha also himself stated that truth is compromised when an individual is not open to entertaining a wide array of teachings. Moreover, without a pluralist understanding, the Buddha stated that truth cannot be discovered or ascertained such that it is truly known:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If a person has faith, Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, he preserves truth when he says: 'My faith is thus'; but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion: 'Only this is true, anything else is wrong.' In this way, Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, there is the preservation of truth; in this way he preserves truth; in this way we describe the preservation of truth. But as yet there is no discovery of truth.\u2014\u200a\nIn the Lankavatara Sutra, the Buddha gave a long treatise on the idea that various expressions of Truth may seem contradictory or boundless, yet they all speak of Truth itself \u2013 emphasizing that an Enlightened One both accepts pluralism in that there are many ways to referring to Truth, but rises above it through the understanding that Truth transcends all labels.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; In a political sense, the earliest references to Buddhist views on religious pluralism are found in the Edicts of Emperor Ashoka:\nAll religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb. 7 (S. Dhammika)\nContact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb. 12 (S. Dhammika)\nWhen asked, \"Don't all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?\" the Dalai Lama said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;People from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don't do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.\nIn the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something... That is not healthy.\nFor individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.\nI am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.\nIslam.\nFollowing a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of Medina (then known as \"Yathrib\"), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and pagans was declared by Muhammad in the Constitution of Medina. In early Muslim history (until mid 11th century), most Islamic scholars maintained a level of separation from the state which helped to establish some elements of institutional religious freedom. The Islamic Caliphate later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept \"dhimmi\" status and their adult males pay the \"jizya\" tax instead of the \"zakat\" paid by Muslim citizens. Though Dhimmis were not given the same political rights as Muslims, they nevertheless did enjoy equality under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.\nReligious pluralism existed in classical Islamic ethics and Sharia, as the religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system. In medieval Islamic societies, the \"qadi\" (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily choose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the \"dhimmi\" communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own \"Halakha\" courts.\nDhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous \"self-marriage\" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim (1292\u20131350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.\nDespite Dhimmis enjoying special statuses under the Caliphates, they were not considered equals, and sporadic persecutions of non-Muslim groups did occur in the history of the Caliphates. \nThe primary sources that guide Islam, namely Quran and Sunnahs, may be interpreted as promoting the fundamental right to practice an individual's belief. However, the acceptability of religious pluralism within Islam remains a topic of active debate, though the vast majority of Islamic scholars and historical evidences reveal Islam's commitment to no coercion in religion, supporting pluralism in the context of relative toleration. Hamed Kazemzadeh, a pluralist orientalist, argues that cultural absolutism of ours is, of course, today under heavy pressure, a double pressure of defining and semi-bankrupt imperialism and surprisingly strong counter assertive challenge that changed the mentality of Muslims to have a pluralist identity. Then he highlights the policy method of Islam Messenger in the early Islamic civilization toward other religions.\nIn Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the Jizya, a tax, with willing submission.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, nor comply with what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor embrace the religion of truth from among those who were given the Scripture, until they pay the tax, willingly submitting, fully humbled.\nSome people have concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These Ayat (Quranic verses) stress the necessity of fighting against the People of the Scripture, but under what conditions? We previously established the fact that the Islamic State is not permitted to attack non-Muslims who are not hostile to Islam, who do not oppress Muslims, or try to convert Muslims by force from their religion, or expel them from their lands, or wage war against them, or prepare for attacks against them. If any of these offenses occurs, however, Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and protect their religion. Muslims are not permitted to attack non-Muslims who signed peace pacts with them, or non-Muslims who live under the protection of the Islamic State.\u2014\u200a\nIn Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the apostates. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution or attack the Muslims.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;4:88 Why are you \u02f9believers\u02fa divided into two groups regarding the hypocrites while Allah allowed them to regress \u02f9to disbelief\u02fa because of their misdeeds? Do you wish to guide those left by Allah to stray? And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way.\n4:89 They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,\n4:90 except those who are allies of a people you are bound with in a treaty or those wholeheartedly opposed to fighting either you or their own people. If Allah had willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. So if they refrain from fighting you and offer you peace, then Allah does not permit you to harm them.\n4:91 You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation \u02f9of disbelief or hostility\u02fa. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.&lt;/poem&gt;\nSufism.\nSufis are practitioners of the mystical tradition of Islam. Sufis such as Rumi and Abu Sa'id Abu'l-Khayr have been associated with religious pluralism or tolerant views toward religious others. Not all Sufis hold pluralist or tolerant views of other religions; Gregory A. Lipton argues that Ibn Arabi held exclusivist views on Islam and other religions, against pluralist readers of Ibn Arabi such as Frithjof Schuon.\nAhmadiyya.\nAhmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: \"And there is a guide for every people\". Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, Muhammad states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize Buddha, Krishna, founders of Chinese religions to be divinely appointed individuals.\nThe Second Khalifatul Maish of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community writes:\n\"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America\u2014all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.\"\nMirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community wrote in his book \"A Message of Peace\":\n\"Our God has never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America.\"\nIn modern practice.\nReligious pluralism is a contested issue in modern Islamic countries. Twenty-three Islamic countries have laws, as of 2014, which make it a crime, punishable with death penalty or prison, for a Muslim, by birth or conversion, to leave Islam or convert to another religion. In Muslim countries such as Algeria, it is illegal to preach, persuade or attempt to convert a Muslim to another religion. Saudi Arabia and several Islamic nations have strict laws against the construction of Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas anywhere inside the country, by anyone including minorities working there. Brunei in southeast Asia adopted Sharia law in 2013 that prescribes a death penalty for any Muslim who converts from Islam to another religion. Other Islamic scholars state Sharia does not allow non-Muslim minorities to enjoy religious freedoms in a Muslim-majority nation, but other scholars disagree.\nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a multi-racial and multi-religious nation, where Muslims form the majority. Residents of Pakistan follow many of the major religions. Pakistan's diverse cultural and religious heritage is part of its multicultural history, but there is a lack of tolerance towards religious minorities in Pakistan. Minorities are facing exploitation by extremist groups, and some sections of the society show hatred towards them, religious minorities are not allowed to join the mainstream of the society because of their religion.\nJainism.\n\"Anek\u0101ntav\u0101da\", the principle of relative pluralism, is one of the basic principles of Jainism. In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth. Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the Kevalins\u2014the omniscient beings\u2014can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it. Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth\u2014only relative truths. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with \"andhgajnyaya \"or the \"maxim of the blind men and elephant\", wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective. For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims. Since absolute truth is many-sided, embracing any truth to the exclusion of others is to commit the error of \"ek\u0101nta\" (one-sidedness). Openness to the truths of others is one way in which Jainism embodies religious pluralism.\nSikhism.\nThe Sikh gurus have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the one God and ultimate salvation for all souls who treading on the path of righteousness. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the Lord, can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with Sufism as well as Hinduism, influenced them and was influenced by them.\nThe Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.\u2014\u200a\nAs well as:\nSome call the Lord \"Ram, Ram\", and some \"Khuda\". Some serve Him as \"Gusain\", others as \"Allah\". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer. Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran. Some wear blue robes, and some wear white. Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib, page 885) \nOne who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth. (SGGS Ang 142) \nThe seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. (Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)\nThe Guru Granth Sahib also says that Bhagat Namdev and Bhagat Kabir, who were both believed to be Hindus, both attained salvation though they were born before Sikhism took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that \"peoples of other faiths\" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.\nAdditionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:\nFirst, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1||\nAgain, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:\nNaam Dayv the printer, and Kabeer the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His Shabad (\"word\") lose their ego and class consciousness. (Guru Granth Sahib page 67) \nMost of the 15 Sikh Bhagats who are mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region.\nThe pluralistic dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming enlightened saying the words \"Na koi hindu na koi musalman\" \u2013 \"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\". He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.\nSikhs have been considered eager exponents of interfaith dialogue and not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others; the Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar, who on the pleas of a pandit of the Kashmiris, agreed to fight against a tyrannic Moghul Empire (that was forcing them to convert to Islam) in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion, which differed from his own.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nBah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, founder of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, a religion that developed in Persia, having roots in Islam, urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and religion has been progressively revealed over time through Manifestations of God, the founders of religion. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h taught that Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds must associate with peoples of all religions, whether this is reciprocated or not.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds refer to this concept as Progressive revelation, meaning that each religion brings a more advanced understanding of divinity and updated social laws as mankind matures. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h (the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith) among them. According to Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years.\nThere is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.\nReligious pluralism and human service professions.\nThe concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions. For example, psychologist Kenneth Pargament has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called \"rejectionist\", \"exclusivist\", \"constructivist\", and \"pluralist\". Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nImportantly, \"the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy\" (p.\u00a0168). The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as \"should religious issues be discussed in counseling?\", have also been presented in tabular form (p.\u00a0362, Table 12.1).\nThe profession of chaplaincy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg argues: \"With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative\" (p.\u00a0182).\nSkepticism.\nArgument from inconsistent revelations.\nThe argument from inconsistent revelations is an argument that aims to show that one cannot choose one religion over another since their revelations are inconsistent with each other and that any two religions cannot both be true. The argument appears, among other places, in Voltaire's \"Candide\" and \"Philosophical Dictionary\". It is also manifested in Denis Diderot's statement in response to Pascal's wager that, whatever proofs are offered for the existence of God in Christianity or any other religion, \"an Imam can reason the same way\". Also in response to Pascal's wager, J. L. Mackie said \"the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but perhaps that of the Anabaptists or the Mormons or the Muslim Sunnis or the worshippers of Kali or of Odin\".\nReligion and globalization in the digital age.\nThe 21st century has seen a profound transformation in the religious landscape due to globalization and digital technologies. These forces have intensified connections across geographic, cultural, and ideological boundaries, significantly reshaping religious identities, expressions, and institutions. Scholars have examined this evolving context through themes such as religious pluralism, digital religion, hybrid identities, migration, secular governance, and commodification of spirituality.\nGlobalization and religious pluralism.\nGlobalization has enabled religions and their practitioners to interact closely despite geographical distances. Advances in communication technologies and increased mobility have compressed the world into \u201ca single place,\u201d fostering awareness and accessibility of diverse faiths. This interconnectedness promotes human rights norms, such as religious freedom, empowering individuals to express their beliefs and allowing religious communities to engage more openly in public life.\nTransnational religious networks and diasporic communities flourish under globalization, enriching internal religious diversity and facilitating interfaith dialogue aimed at shared ethical frameworks. Yet, globalization also presents challenges. Secular consumerist values may erode traditional identities, prompting defensive fundamentalist movements and inter-religious tensions. Furthermore, increased visibility of multiple faiths in the public sphere can generate competition between religious groups in pluralistic societies.\nDigital religion.\nThe emergence of \u201cdigital religion\u201d refers to religious practice, identity, and community formation within digital environments. It encompasses both traditional institutions adapting to online platforms and new religious movements native to cyberspace. Originating in the mid-1990s, early studies examined online forums where users shared prayers and theological discussions. Scholars quickly debated whether digital expressions of religion represented authentic spirituality or superficial simulations.\nBy the early 2000s, research expanded to explore how digital spaces reshape rituals, authority, and religious identity. Communities emerged on websites and social media, offering interactive, immersive religious experiences. One notable example is the Church of Fools, launched in 2004, which enables users to participate in services through avatars. Such digital contexts allow for experimentation with religious roles and beliefs, particularly for those excluded from traditional hierarchies.\nDigital religion challenges conventional structures by decentralizing spiritual authority and encouraging peer-to-peer spiritual exchange. Participants can construct personalized expressions of belief through online profiles and interactions. However, debates persist regarding the theological legitimacy of exclusively online religious practices and their influence on offline traditions.\nHybrid religious identities.\nGlobalization has also facilitated the formation of hybrid religious identities. These identities combine elements from diverse traditions, enabled by the free circulation of beliefs through digital and global networks. New religious movements often originate on the margins of established religions, drawing on eclectic influences such as Eastern spirituality, New Age philosophy, and even scientific discourse.\nThis syncretism results in unique combinations\u2014e.g., blending Jewish Kabbalah with transcendental meditation or fusing shamanism with quantum theory. Such hybridity reflects a shift toward subjectivity, autonomy, and conceptual fluidity in spiritual meaning-making. These hybrid forms signify an adaptive response to the complexities of modern life, where the sacred and secular frequently intersect.\nMigration, religious pluralism, and the secular state.\nMigration is a key vector of religious pluralism in contemporary societies. As people move across borders, they bring diverse religious traditions that challenge and enrich host cultures. For instance, migration to Europe from Muslim-majority countries has expanded the region\u2019s religious diversity, prompting debates about cultural identity, secularism, and integration.\nDiasporic communities\u2014such as Sikhs in Canada or Hindus in the UK\u2014establish institutions that transform the cultural landscape, fostering new models of pluralism. In secular states, the coexistence of various faiths demands policy frameworks that balance civic unity with religious freedoms. Tensions often arise when public expressions of faith (e.g., religious attire) intersect with secular norms, illustrating the delicate negotiation required in pluralistic democracies.\nCommodification of religion and the New Age movement.\nGlobal consumer culture has extended into the realm of spirituality, giving rise to the commodification of religion. Traditional religious symbols, rituals, and philosophies are increasingly repackaged as products promising wellness, personal growth, and aesthetic pleasure. This trend reflects broader societal values centered on immediacy and self-optimization.\nThe New Age movement exemplifies this commodification. Practices such as energy healing, holistic retreats, and the use of \u201cpositive energy\u201d objects are often stripped from their spiritual roots and marketed for consumption. Scholars like Bernardo Nante argue that this process reduces profound spiritual traditions to superficial lifestyle accessories. The commercialization of spirituality raises concerns about authenticity and the dilution of religious meaning.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Various methods are known as the Knaus\u2013Ogino method and the rhythm method. The standard days method is also considered a calendar-based method, because when using it, a woman tracks the days of her menstrual cycle without observing her physical fertility signs. The standard days method is based on a fixed formula taking into consideration the timing of ovulation, the functional life of the sperm and the ovum, and the resulting likelihood of pregnancy on particular days of the menstrual cycle. These methods may be used to achieve pregnancy by timing unprotected intercourse for days identified as fertile, or to avoid pregnancy by avoiding unprotected intercourse during fertile days.\nThe first formalized calendar-based method was developed in 1930 by John Smulders, a Catholic physician from the Netherlands. It was based on knowledge of the menstrual cycle. This method was independently discovered by Hermann Knaus (Austria), and Kyusaku Ogino (Japan). This system was a main form of birth control available to Catholic couples for several decades, until the popularization of symptoms-based fertility awareness methods. A new development in calendar-based methods occurred in 2002, when Georgetown University introduced the Standard Days Method. The Standard Days Method is promoted in conjunction with a product called CycleBeads, a ring of colored beads which are meant to help the user keep track of her fertile and non-fertile days.\nTerminology.\nWhile the terms \"rhythm method\" and \"fertility awareness\" are not synonymous, some sources do treat them as such. However, fertility awareness is usually used as a broad term that includes tracking basal body temperature and cervical mucus as well as cycle length. The World Health Organization considers the rhythm method to be a specific type of calendar-based method, and calendar-based methods to be only one form of fertility awareness.\nMore effective than calendar-based methods, systems of fertility awareness that track basal body temperature, cervical mucus, or both, are known as symptoms-based methods. Teachers of symptoms-based methods take care to distance their systems from the poor reputation of the rhythm method. Many consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years, and some even exclude calendar-based methods from their definition of fertility awareness.\nSome sources may treat the terms \"rhythm method\" and \"natural family planning\" as synonymous. In the early 20th century, the calendar-based method known as the \"rhythm method\" was promoted by members of the Roman Catholic Church as the only morally acceptable form of family planning. Methods accepted by this church are referred to as natural family planning (NFP): so at one time, the term \"the rhythm method\" was synonymous with NFP. Today, NFP is an umbrella term that includes symptoms-based fertility awareness methods and the lactational amenorrhea method as well as calendar-based methods such as rhythm. This overlap between uses of the terms \"the rhythm method\" and \"natural family planning\" may contribute to confusion.\nThe first day of bleeding is considered day one of the menstrual cycle.\nHistory.\nEarly methods.\nIt is not known if historical cultures were aware of what part of the menstrual cycle is most fertile. In the year 388, Augustine of Hippo wrote of periodic abstinence. Addressing followers of Manichaeism, his former religion, he said, \"Is it not you who used to counsel us to observe as much as possible the time when a woman, after her purification, is most likely to conceive, and to abstain from cohabitation at that time...?\" If the Manichaieans practiced something like the Jewish observances of menstruation, then the \"time... after her purification\" would have indeed been when \"a woman... is most likely to conceive.\" Over a century previously, however, the influential Greek physician Soranus had written that \"the time directly before and after menstruation\" was the most fertile part of a woman's cycle; this inaccuracy was repeated in the 6th century by the Byzantine physician A\u00ebtius. Similarly, a Chinese sex manual written close to the year 600 stated that only the first five days following menstruation were fertile. Some historians believe that Augustine, too, incorrectly identified the days immediately after menstruation as the time of highest fertility.\nWritten references to a \"safe period\" do not appear again for over a thousand years. Scientific advances prompted a number of secular thinkers to advocate periodic abstinence to avoid pregnancy: in the 1840s it was discovered that many animals ovulate during estrus. Because some animals (such as dogs) have a bloody discharge during estrus, it was assumed that menstruation was the corresponding most fertile time for women. This inaccurate theory was popularized by physicians Bischoff, F\u00e9lix Archim\u00e8de Pouchet, and Adam Raciborski. In 1854, an English physician named George Drysdale correctly taught his patients that the days near menstruation are the \"least\" fertile, but this remained the minority view for the remainder of the 19th century.\nKnaus\u2013Ogino or rhythm method.\nIn 1905 Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde, a Dutch gynecologist, showed that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle. In the 1920s, Kyusaku Ogino, a Japanese gynecologist, and Hermann Knaus, from Austria, working independently, each made the discovery that ovulation occurs about fourteen days before the next menstrual period. Ogino used his discovery to develop a formula for use in aiding infertile women to time intercourse to achieve pregnancy.\nIn 1930, Johannes Smulders, a Roman Catholic physician from the Netherlands, used Knaus and Ogino's discoveries to create a method for \"avoiding\" pregnancy. Smulders published his work with the Dutch Roman Catholic medical association, and this was the official rhythm method promoted over the next several decades. In 1932 a Catholic physician, Dr. Leo J Latz, published a book titled \"The Rhythm of Sterility and Fertility in Women\" describing the method, and the 1930s also saw the first U.S. Rhythm Clinic (founded by John Rock) to teach the method to Catholic couples.\nLater 20th century to present.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, most users of the rhythm method were Catholic; they were following their church's teaching that all other methods of birth control were sinful. In 1968 the encyclical \"Humanae vitae\" included the statement, \"It is supremely desirable... that medical science should by the study of natural rhythms succeed in determining a sufficiently secure basis for the chaste limitation of offspring.\" This is interpreted as favoring the then-new, more reliable symptoms-based fertility awareness methods over the rhythm method. Currently, many fertility awareness teachers consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years.\nNew attention was drawn to calendar-based methods in 2002, when the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University introduced the Standard Days Method. Designed to be simpler to teach and use than the older rhythm method, the Standard Days Method was initially integrated piloted in 30 family planning programs worldwide. However, only 16 countries scaled up beyond pilots, with limited adoption since.\nTypes and effectiveness.\nMost menstrual cycles have several days at the beginning that are infertile (pre-ovulatory infertility), a period of fertility, and then several days just before the next menstruation that are infertile (post-ovulatory infertility). The first day of red bleeding is considered day one of the menstrual cycle. To use these methods, a woman is required to know the length of her menstrual cycles.\nImperfect use of calendar-based methods would consist of not correctly tracking the length of the woman's cycles, thus using the wrong numbers in the formula, or of having unprotected intercourse on an identified fertile day. The discipline required to keep accurate records of menstrual cycles, and to abstain from unprotected intercourse, makes imperfect use fairly common. The typical-use failure rate of calendar-based methods is 25% per year.\nRhythm method (Knaus\u2013Ogino method).\nTo find the estimated length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase, eighteen (18) is subtracted from the length of the woman's shortest cycle. To find the estimated start of the post-ovulatory infertile phase, eleven (11) is subtracted from the length of the woman's longest cycle. A woman whose menstrual cycles ranged in length from 30 to 36 days would be estimated to be infertile for the first 11 days of her cycle (30-19=11), to be fertile on days 12\u201325, and to resume infertility on day 26 (36-10=26). When used to avoid pregnancy, such fertility awareness-based methods have a typical-use failure rate of 25% per year.\nStandard days method.\nDeveloped at Georgetown University's Institute for Reproductive Health, the standard days method is a variation of the rhythm method that has a simpler rule set and is more effective than the Knaus\u2013Ogino method. A product called CycleBeads was developed alongside the method to help the user keep track of estimated high and low fertility points during her menstrual cycle. The standard days method is only effective for women whose cycles are consistently between 26 and 32 days in length; it is estimated that between 50% and 60% of women of reproductive age satisfy this condition. In this system:\nWhen used to avoid pregnancy, the standard days method has been estimated to have perfect-use efficacy of 95% and typical-use efficacy of 88%. These figures are based on a 2002 study in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines of women of reproductive age having menstrual cycles between 26 and 32 days, and on a 2014 study in Turkey. However, other researchers have criticized the methodology of the first study, have stated that the 95% figure has been presented to the public in misleading ways, and have argued that the true efficacy figures are likely to be much lower. Another meta study indicated that typical-use efficacy ranged between 90% and 82%, a bit lower than the 88% figure originally found.\nSoftware-based systems.\nSeveral web-based implementations of the cycle method exist, as well as mobile apps such as Natural Cycles.\nAdvantages.\nThe Standard Days method (SDM) was introduced as part of family planning programs in developing countries. The method is satisfactory for many women and men. The low cost of the method may also enable it to play a useful role in countries that lack funding to provide other methods of birth control.\nPotential concerns.\nFailure rate.\nOne concern related to the use of calendar-based methods is their relatively high failure rate, compared to other methods of birth control. Even when used perfectly, calendar-based methods, especially the rhythm method, result in a high pregnancy rate among couples intending to avoid pregnancy. Of commonly known methods of birth control, only the cervical cap and contraceptive sponge have comparably high failure rates. This lower level of reliability of calendar-based methods is because their formulas make several assumptions that are not always true.\nThe postovulatory (luteal) phase has a normal length of 12 to 16 days, and the rhythm method formula assumes all women have luteal phase lengths within this range. However, many women have shorter luteal phases, and a few have longer luteal phases. For these women, the rhythm method formula incorrectly identifies a few fertile days as being in the infertile period. Roughly 30-50% of women have phases outside this range.\nFinally, calendar-based methods assume that all bleeding is true menstruation. However, mid-cycle or anovulatory bleeding can be caused by a number of factors. Incorrectly identifying bleeding as menstruation will cause the method's calculations to be incorrect.\nEmbryonic health.\nIt has been suggested that pregnancies resulting from failures of periodic abstinence methods are at increased risk of miscarriage and birth defects due to aged gametes at the time of conception. Other research suggests that timing of conception has no effect on miscarriage rates, low birth weight, or preterm delivery.\nDestruction of fertilized eggs.\nPhilosopher Luc Bovens has suggested that the use of the rhythm method probably results in a large number of abortions, because unprotected intercourse in the infertile periods of the menstrual cycle may still result in conceptions but create zygotes incapable of implanting. Bovens's argument assumes that any and all destruction of fertilized eggs is abortion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the game, a player may choose to place a bet on a single number, various groupings of numbers, the color red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the number is high or low.\nTo determine the winning number, a croupier spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the outer edge of the wheel. The ball eventually loses momentum, passes through an area of deflectors, and falls onto the wheel and into one of the colored and numbered pockets on the wheel. The winnings are then paid to anyone who has placed a successful bet.\nHistory.\nThe first form of roulette was devised in 18th-century France. Many historians believe Blaise Pascal introduced a primitive form of roulette in the 17th century in his search for a perpetual motion machine. The roulette mechanism is a hybrid of a gaming wheel invented in 1720 and the Italian game Biribi. A primitive form of roulette, known as \"EO\" (Even/Odd), was played in England in the late 18th century using a gaming wheel similar to that used in roulette.\nThe game has been played in its present form since as early as 1796 in Paris. An early description of the roulette game in its current form is found in a French novel \"La Roulette, ou le Jour\" by Jaques Lablee, which describes a roulette wheel in the Palais Royal in Paris in 1796. The description included the house pockets: \"There are exactly two slots reserved for the bank, whence it derives its sole mathematical advantage.\" It then goes on to describe the layout with \"two betting spaces containing the bank's two numbers, zero and double zero\". The book was published in 1801. An even earlier reference to a game of this name was published in regulations for New France (Qu\u00e9bec) in 1758, which banned the games of \"dice, hoca, faro, and roulette\".\nThe roulette wheels used in the casinos of Paris in the late 1790s had red for the single zero and black for the double zero. To avoid confusion, the color green was selected for the zeros in roulette wheels starting in the 1800s.\nIn 1843, in the German spa casino town of Bad Homburg, fellow Frenchmen Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc introduced the single \"0\" style roulette wheel in order to compete against other casinos offering the traditional wheel with single and double zero house pockets.\nIn some forms of early American roulette wheels, there were numbers 1 to 28, plus a single zero, a double zero, and an American Eagle. The Eagle slot, which was a symbol of American liberty, was a house slot that brought the casino an extra edge. Soon, the tradition vanished and since then the wheel features only numbered slots. According to Hoyle \"the single 0, the double 0, and the eagle are never bars; but when the ball falls into either of them, the banker sweeps every thing upon the table, except what may happen to be bet on either one of them, when he pays twenty-seven for one, which is the amount paid for all sums bet upon any single figure\".\nIn the 19th century, roulette spread all over Europe and the US, becoming one of the most popular casino games. When the German government abolished gambling in the 1860s, the Blanc family moved to the last legal remaining casino operation in Europe at Monte Carlo, where they established a gambling mecca for the elite of Europe. It was here that the single zero roulette wheel became the premier game, and over the years was exported around the world, except in the United States where the double zero wheel remained dominant.\nIn the United States, the French double zero wheel made its way up the Mississippi from New Orleans, and then westward. It was here, because of rampant cheating by both operators and gamblers, that the wheel was eventually placed on top of the table to prevent devices from being hidden in the table or wheel, and the betting layout was simplified. This eventually evolved into the American-style roulette game. The American game was developed in the gambling dens across the new territories where makeshift games had been set up, whereas the French game evolved with style and leisure in Monte Carlo.\nDuring the first part of the 20th century, the only casino towns of note were Monte Carlo with the traditional single zero French wheel, and Las Vegas with the American double zero wheel. In the 1970s, casinos began to flourish around the world. In 1996 the first online casino, generally believed to be InterCasino, made it possible to play roulette online. By 2008, there were several hundred casinos worldwide offering roulette games. The double zero wheel is found in the United States, Canada, South America, and the Caribbean, while the single zero wheel is predominant elsewhere.\nRules of play against a casino.\nRoulette players have a variety of betting options. \"Inside\" bets involve selecting either the exact number on which the ball will land, or a small group of numbers adjacent to each other on the layout. \"Outside\" bets, by contrast, allow players to select a larger group of numbers based on properties such as their color or parity (odd/even). The payout odds for each type of bet are based on its probability.\nThe roulette table usually imposes minimum and maximum bets, and these rules usually apply separately for all of a player's inside and outside bets for each spin. For inside bets at roulette tables, some casinos may use separate roulette table chips of various colors to distinguish players at the table. Players can continue to place bets as the ball spins around the wheel until the dealer announces \"no more bets\" or \"rien ne va plus\".\nWhen a winning number and color is determined by the roulette wheel, the dealer will place a marker, also known as a \"dolly\", on that number on the roulette table layout. When the dolly is on the table, no players may place bets, collect bets or remove any bets from the table. The dealer will then sweep away all losing bets either by hand or by rake, and determine the payouts for the remaining inside and outside winning bets. When the dealer is finished making payouts, the dolly is removed from the board and players may collect their winnings and make new bets. Winning chips remain on the board until picked up by a player. \nCalifornia Roulette.\nIn 2004, California legalized a form of roulette known as California Roulette. By law, the game must use cards and not slots on the roulette wheel to pick the winning number.\nRoulette wheel number sequence.\nThe pockets of the roulette wheel are numbered from 0 to 36.\nIn number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28, odd numbers are red and even are black. In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36, odd numbers are black and even are red.\nThere is a green pocket numbered 0 (zero). In American roulette, there is a second green pocket marked 00. Pocket number order on the roulette wheel adheres to the following clockwise sequence in most casinos:\nRoulette table layout.\nThe cloth-covered betting area on a roulette table is known as the \"layout\". The layout is either single-zero or double-zero.\nThe European-style layout has a single zero, and the American style layout is usually a double-zero. The American-style roulette table with a wheel at one end is now used in most casinos because it has a higher house edge compared to a European layout.\nThe French style table with a wheel in the centre and a layout on either side is rarely found outside of Monte Carlo.\nTypes of bets.\nIn roulette, bets can be either \"inside\" or \"outside\".\nOutside bets.\nOutside bets typically have smaller payouts with better odds at winning. Except as noted, all of these bets lose if a 0 comes up.\nIn some casinos, the farthest outside bets (low/high, red/black, even/odd) result in the player losing only half of their bet if a zero comes up. This is known as the \"halfback\" or \"la partage\" rule. Others may use an \"imprisonment\" or \"en prison\" rule, wherein a loss on such an outside bet causes the player's money to be \"imprisoned\", and if the next spin would be a win for that bet, the player's wager is returned.\nBet odds table.\nThe expected value of a $1 bet (except for the special case of top line bets), for American and European roulette, can be calculated as\nformula_1\nwhere \"n\" is the number of pockets in the wheel.\nThe initial bet is returned in addition to the mentioned payout: it can be easily demonstrated that this payout formula would lead to a zero expected value of profit if there were only 36 numbers (that is, the casino would break even). Having 37 or more numbers gives the casino its edge.\nTop line (0, 00, 1, 2, 3) has a different expected value because of approximation of the correct &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6+1\u20445-to-1 payout obtained by the formula to 6-to-1.\nIf \"en prison\" rules are used, the house edge on the 1:1 bets is reduced to 1.35%-1.38% on a single-zero wheel, and to 2.63% on a double-zero wheel.\nHouse edge.\nThe \"house average\" or \"house edge\" or \"house advantage\" (also called the \"expected value\") is the amount the player loses relative to any bet made, on average. If a player bets on a single number in the American game there is a probability of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204438 that the player wins 35 times the bet, and a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;37\u204438 chance that the player loses their bet. The expected value is:\n \u22121 \u00d7 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;37\u204438 + 35 \u00d7 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204438 = \u22120.0526 (5.26% house edge)\nFor European roulette, a single number wins &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204437 and loses &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;36\u204437:\n \u22121 \u00d7 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;36\u204437 + 35 \u00d7 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204437 = \u22120.0270 (2.70% house edge)\nFor triple-zero wheels, a single number wins &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204439 and loses &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;38\u204439:\n \u22121 \u00d7 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;38\u204439 + 35 \u00d7 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204439 = \u22120.0769 (7.69% house edge)\nMathematical model.\nAs an example, the European roulette model, that is, roulette with only one zero, can be examined. Since this roulette has 37 cells with equal odds of hitting, this is a final model of field probability formula_2, where formula_3, formula_4 for all formula_5.\nCall the bet formula_6 a triple formula_7, where formula_8 is the set of chosen numbers, formula_9 is the size of the bet, and formula_10 determines the return of the bet.\nThe rules of European roulette have 10 types of bets. First the 'Straight Up' bet can be imagined. In this case, formula_11, for some formula_12, and formula_13 is determined by\n formula_14\nThe bet's expected net return, or profitability, is equal to\nformula_15\nWithout details, for a bet, black (or red), the rule is determined as\nformula_16\nand the profitability\nformula_17.\nFor similar reasons it is simple to see that the profitability is also equal for all remaining types of bets. formula_18.\nIn reality this means that, the more bets a player makes, the more they are going to lose independent of the strategies (combinations of bet types or size of bets) that they employ:\nformula_19\nHere, the profit margin for the roulette owner is equal to approximately 2.7%. Nevertheless, several roulette strategy systems have been developed despite the losing odds. These systems can not change the odds of the game in favor of the player.\nThe odds for the player in American roulette are even worse, as the bet profitability is at worst formula_20, and never better than formula_21.\nSimplified mathematical model.\nFor a roulette wheel with formula_22 green numbers and 36 other unique numbers, the chance of the ball landing on a given number is formula_23. For a betting option with formula_24 numbers defining a win, the chance of winning a bet is formula_25\nFor example, if a player bets on red, there are 18 red numbers, formula_26, so the chance of winning is formula_27.\nThe payout given by the casino for a win is based on the roulette wheel having 36 outcomes, and the payout for a bet is given by formula_28.\nFor example, betting on 1-12 there are 12 numbers that define a win, formula_29, the payout is formula_30, so the bettor wins 3 times their bet.\nThe average return on a player's bet is given by formula_31\nFor formula_32, the average return is always lower than 1, so on average a player will lose money.\nWith 1 green number, formula_33, the average return is formula_34, that is, after a bet the player will on average have formula_34 of their original bet returned to them. With 2 green numbers, formula_36, the average return is formula_37. With 3 green numbers, formula_38, the average return is formula_39.\nThis shows that the expected return is independent of the choice of bet.\nCalled (or call) bets or announced bets.\nAlthough most often named \"call bets\" technically these bets are more accurately referred to as \"announced bets\". The legal distinction between a \"call bet\" and an \"announced bet\" is that a \"call bet\" is a bet called by the player without placing any money on the table to cover the cost of the bet. In many jurisdictions (most notably the United Kingdom) this is considered gambling on credit and is illegal. An \"announced bet\" is a bet called by the player for which they immediately place enough money to cover the amount of the bet on the table, prior to the outcome of the spin or hand in progress being known.\nThere are different number series in roulette that have special names attached to them. Most commonly these bets are known as \"the French bets\" and each covers a section of the wheel. For the sake of accuracy, zero spiel, although explained below, is not a French bet, it is more accurately \"the German bet\". Players at a table may bet a set amount per series (or multiples of that amount). The series are based on the way certain numbers lie next to each other on the roulette wheel. Not all casinos offer these bets, and some may offer additional bets or variations on these.\nVoisins du z\u00e9ro (\"neighbors of zero\").\nThis is a name, more accurately \"grands voisins du z\u00e9ro\", for the 17 numbers that lie between 22 and 25 on the wheel, including 22 and 25 themselves. The series is 22-18-29-7-28-12-35-3-26-0-32-15-19-4-21-2-25 (on a single-zero wheel).\nNine chips or multiples thereof are bet. Two chips are placed on the 0-2-3 trio; one on the 4\u20137 split; one on 12\u201315; one on 18\u201321; one on 19\u201322; two on the 25-26-28-29 corner; and one on 32\u201335.\nJeu z\u00e9ro (\"zero game\").\nZero game, also known as zero spiel (\"Spiel\" is German for game or play), is the name for the numbers closest to zero. All numbers in the zero game are included in the voisins, but are placed differently. The numbers bet on are 12-35-3-26-0-32-15.\nThe bet consists of four chips or multiples thereof. Three chips are bet on splits and one chip straight-up: one chip on 0\u20133 split, one on 12\u201315 split, one on 32\u201335 split and one straight-up on number 26.\nThis type of bet is popular in Germany and many European casinos. It is also offered as a 5-chip bet in many Eastern European casinos. As a 5-chip bet, it is known as \"zero spiel naca\" and includes, in addition to the chips placed as noted above, a straight-up on number 19.\nLe tiers du cylindre (\"third of the wheel\").\nThis is the name for the 12 numbers that lie on the opposite side of the wheel between 27 and 33, including 27 and 33 themselves. On a single-zero wheel, the series is 27-13-36-11-30-8-23-10-5-24-16-33. The full name (although very rarely used, most players refer to it as \"tiers\") for this bet is \"le tiers du cylindre\" (translated from French into English meaning one third of the wheel) because it covers 12 numbers (placed as 6 splits), which is as close to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 of the wheel as one can get.\nVery popular in British casinos, tiers bets outnumber voisins and orphelins bets by a massive margin.\nSix chips or multiples thereof are bet. One chip is placed on each of the following splits: 5\u20138, 10\u201311, 13\u201316, 23\u201324, 27\u201330, and 33\u201336.\nThe tiers bet is also called the \"small series\" and in some casinos (most notably in South Africa) \"series 5-8\".\nA variant known as \"tiers 5-8-10-11\" has an additional chip placed straight up on 5, 8, 10, and 11 and so is a 10-piece bet. In some places the variant is called \"gioco Ferrari\" with a straight up on 8, 11, 23 and 30, the bet is marked with a red G on the racetrack.\nOrphelins (\"orphans\").\nThese numbers make up the two slices of the wheel outside the tiers and voisins. They contain a total of 8 numbers, comprising 17-34-6 and 1-20-14-31-9.\nFive chips or multiples thereof are bet on four splits and a straight-up: one chip is placed straight-up on 1 and one chip on each of the splits: 6\u20139, 14\u201317, 17\u201320, and 31\u201334.\n... and the neighbors.\nA number may be backed along with the two numbers on either side of it in a 5-chip bet. For example, \"0 and the neighbors\" is a 5-chip bet with one piece straight-up on 3, 26, 0, 32, and 15. Neighbors bets are often put on in combinations, for example \"1, 9, 14, and the neighbors\" is a 15-chip bet covering 18, 22, 33, 16 with one chip, 9, 31, 20, 1 with two chips and 14 with three chips.\nAny of the above bets may be combined; e.g. \"orphelins by 1 and zero and the neighbors by 1\". The \"...and the neighbors\" is often assumed by the croupier.\nFinal bets.\nAnother bet offered on the single-zero game is \"final\", \"finale\", or \"finals\".\nFinal 4, for example, is a 4-chip bet and consists of one chip placed on each of the numbers ending in 4, that is 4, 14, 24, and 34. Final 7 is a 3-chip bet, one chip each on 7, 17, and 27. Final bets from final 0 (zero) to final 6 cost four chips. Final bets 7, 8 and 9 cost three chips.\nSome casinos also offer split-final bets, for example final 5-8 would be a 4-chip bet, one chip each on the splits 5\u20138, 15\u201318, 25\u201328, and one on 35.\nFull completes/maximums.\nA complete bet places all of the inside bets on a certain number. Full complete bets are most often bet by high rollers as \"maximum bets\".\nThe maximum amount allowed to be wagered on a single bet in European roulette is based on a progressive betting model. If the casino allows a maximum bet of $1,000 on a 35-to-1 straight-up, then on each 17-to-1 split connected to that straight-up, $2,000 may be wagered. Each 8-to-1 corner that covers four numbers) may have $4,000 wagered on it. Each 11-to-1 street that covers three numbers may have $3,000 wagered on it. Each 5-to-1 six-line may have $6,000 wagered on it. Each $1,000 incremental bet would be represented by a marker that is used to specifically identify the player and the amount bet.\nFor instance, if a patron wished to place a full complete bet on 17, the player would call \"17 to the maximum\". This bet would require a total of 40 chips, or $40,000. To manually place the same wager, the player would need to bet:\nThe player calls their bet to the croupier (most often after the ball has been spun) and places enough chips to cover the bet on the table within reach of the croupier. The croupier will immediately announce the bet (repeat what the player has just said), ensure that the correct monetary amount has been given while simultaneously placing a matching marker on the number on the table and the amount wagered.\nThe payout for this bet if the chosen number wins is 392 chips, in the case of a $1000 straight-up maximum, $40,000 bet, a payout of $392,000. The player's wagered 40 chips, as with all winning bets in roulette, are still their property and in the absence of a request to the contrary are left up to possibly win again on the next spin.\nBased on the location of the numbers on the layout, the number of chips required to \"complete\" a number can be determined.\nMost typically (Mayfair casinos in London and other top-class European casinos) with these \"maximum\" or \"full complete\" bets, nothing (except the aforementioned maximum button) is ever placed on the layout even in the case of a win. Experienced gaming staff, and the type of customers playing such bets, are fully aware of the payouts and so the croupier simply makes up the correct payout, announces its value to the table inspector (floor person in the U.S.) and the customer, and then passes it to the customer, but only after a verbal authorization from the inspector has been received.\nAlso typically at this level of play (house rules allowing) the experienced croupier caters to the needs of the customer and will most often add the customer's winning bet to the payout, as the type of player playing these bets very rarely bets the same number two spins in succession. For example, the winning 40-chip / $40,000 bet on \"17 to the maximum\" pays 392 chips / $392,000. The experienced croupier would pay the player 432 chips / $432,000, that is 392 + 40, with the announcement that the payout \"is with your bet down\".\nThere are also several methods to determine the payout when a number adjacent to a chosen number is the winner, for example, player bets \"23 full complete\" and number 26 is the winning number. The most notable method is known as the \"station\" method. When paying in stations, the dealer counts the number of ways or stations that the winning number hits the complete bet. In the example above, 26 hits 4 stations - 2 different corners, 1 split and 1 six-line. The dealer takes the number 4, multiplies it by 36, making 144 with the players bet down. \nIn some casinos, a player may bet full complete for less than the table straight-up maximum, for example, \"number 17 full complete by $25\" would cost $1000, that is 40 chips each at $25 value.\nBetting strategies and tactics.\nOver the years, many people have tried to beat the casino, and turn roulette\u2014a game designed to turn a profit for the house\u2014into one on which the player expects to win. Most of the time this comes down to the use of betting systems, strategies which say that the house edge can be beaten by simply employing a special pattern of bets, often relying on the \"Gambler's fallacy\", the idea that past results are any guide to the future (for example, if a roulette wheel has come up 10 times in a row on red, that red on the next spin is any more or less likely than if the last spin was black).\nAll betting systems that rely on patterns, when employed on casino edge games will result, on average, in the player losing money. In practice, players employing betting systems may win, and may indeed win very large sums of money, but the losses (which, depending on the design of the betting system, may occur quite rarely) will outweigh the wins. Certain systems, such as the Martingale, described below, are extremely risky, because the worst-case scenario (which is mathematically certain to happen, at some point) may see the player chasing losses with ever-bigger bets until they run out of money.\nThe American mathematician Patrick Billingsley said that no betting system can convert a subfair game into a profitable enterprise. At least in the 1930s, some professional gamblers were able to consistently gain an edge in roulette by seeking out rigged wheels (not difficult to find at that time) and betting opposite the largest bets.\nPrediction methods.\nWhereas betting systems are essentially an attempt to beat the fact that a geometric series with initial value of 0.95 (American roulette) or 0.97 (European roulette) will inevitably over time tend to zero, engineers instead attempt to overcome the house edge through predicting the mechanical performance of the wheel, most notably by Joseph Jagger at Monte Carlo in 1873. These schemes work by determining that the ball is more likely to fall at certain numbers. If effective, they raise the return of the game above 100%, defeating the betting system problem.\nEdward O. Thorp (the developer of card counting and an early hedge-fund pioneer) and Claude Shannon (a mathematician and electronic engineer best known for his contributions to information theory) built the first wearable computer to predict the landing of the ball in 1961. This system worked by timing the ball and wheel, and using the information obtained to calculate the most likely octant where the ball would fall. Ironically, this technique works best with an unbiased wheel though it could still be countered quite easily by simply closing the table for betting before beginning the spin.\nIn 1982, several casinos in Britain began to lose large sums of money at their roulette tables to teams of gamblers from the US. Upon investigation by the police, it was discovered they were using a legal system of biased wheel-section betting. As a result of this, the British roulette wheel manufacturer John Huxley manufactured a roulette wheel to counteract the problem.\nThe new wheel, designed by George Melas, was called \"low profile\" because the pockets had been drastically reduced in depth, and various other design modifications caused the ball to descend in a gradual approach to the pocket area. In 1986, when a professional gambling team headed by Billy Walters won $3.8 million using the system on an old wheel at the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City, every casino in the world took notice, and within one year had switched to the new low-profile wheel.\nThomas Bass, in his book \"The Eudaemonic Pie\" (1985) (published as \"The Newtonian Casino\" in Britain), has claimed to be able to predict wheel performance in real time. The book describes the exploits of a group of University of California Santa Cruz students, who called themselves \"the Eudaemons\", who in the late 1970s used computers in their shoes to win at roulette. This is an updated and improved version of Edward O. Thorp's approach, where Newtonian laws of motion are applied to track the roulette ball's deceleration; hence the British title.\nTo defend against exploits like these, many casinos use tracking software, use wheels with new designs, rotate wheel heads, and randomly rotate pocket rings.\nAt the Ritz London casino in March 2004, two Serbs and a Hungarian used a laser scanner hidden inside a mobile phone linked to a computer to predict the sector of the wheel where the ball was most likely to drop. They netted \u00a31.3m in two nights. They were arrested and kept on police bail for nine months, but eventually released and allowed to keep their winnings as they had not interfered with the casino equipment.\nSpecific betting systems.\nThe numerous even-money bets in roulette have inspired many players over the years to attempt to beat the game by using one or more variations of a martingale betting strategy, wherein the gambler doubles the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses, plus win a profit equal to the original bet. The problem with this strategy is that, remembering that past results do not affect the future, it is possible for the player to lose so many times in a row, that the player, doubling and redoubling their bets, either runs out of money or hits the table limit. A large financial loss is almost certain in the long term if the player continues to employ this strategy. Another strategy is the Fibonacci system, where bets are calculated according to the Fibonacci sequence. Regardless of the specific progression, no such strategy can statistically overcome the casino's advantage, since the expected value of each allowed bet is negative.\nTypes of betting system.\nBetting systems in roulette can be divided in to two main categories:\n\"Negative progression\" systems involve increasing the size of one's bet when they lose. This is the most common type of betting system. The goal of this system is to recoup losses faster so that one can return to a winning position more quickly after a losing streak. The typical shape of these systems is small but consistent wins followed by occasional catastrophic losses. Examples of negative progression systems include the Martingale system, the Fibonacci system, the Labouch\u00e8re system, and the d'Alembert system.\n\"Positive progression\" systems involve increasing the size of one's bet when one wins. The goal of these systems is to either exacerbate the effects of winning streaks (e.g. the Paroli system) or to take advantage of changes in luck to recover more quickly from previous losses (e.g. Oscar's grind). The shape of these systems is typically small but consistent losses followed by occasional big wins. However, over the long run these wins do not compensate for the losses incurred in between.\nReverse Martingale system.\nThe Reverse Martingale system, also known as the Paroli system, follows the idea of the martingale betting strategy, but reversed. Instead of doubling a bet after a loss the gambler doubles the bet after every win. The system creates a false feeling of eliminating the risk of betting more when losing, but, in reality, it has the same problem as the martingale strategy. By doubling bets after every win, one keeps betting everything they have won until they either stop playing, or lose it all.\nLabouch\u00e8re system.\nThe Labouch\u00e8re System is a progression betting strategy like the martingale but does not require the gambler to risk their stake as quickly with dramatic double-ups. The Labouchere System involves using a series of numbers in a line to determine the bet amount, following a win or a loss. Typically, the player adds the numbers at the front and end of the line to determine the size of the next bet. If the player wins, they cross out numbers and continue working on the smaller line. If the player loses, then they add their previous bet to the end of the line and continue to work on the longer line. This is a much more flexible progression betting system and there is much room for the player to design their initial line to their own playing preference.\nThis system is one that is designed so that when the player has won over a third of their bets (less than the expected 18/38), they will win. Whereas the martingale will cause ruin in the event of a long sequence of successive losses, the Labouch\u00e8re system will cause bet size to grow quickly even where a losing sequence is broken by wins. This occurs because as the player loses, the average bet size in the line increases.\nAs with all other betting systems, the average value of this system is negative.\nD'Alembert system.\nThe system, also called (from French, meaning upwards and downwards), is often called a pyramid system. It is based on a mathematical equilibrium theory devised by a French mathematician of the same name. Like the martingale, this system is mainly applied to the even-money outside bets, and is favored by players who want to keep the amount of their bets and losses to a minimum. The betting progression is very simple: After each loss, one unit is added to the next bet, and after each win, one unit is deducted from the next bet. Starting with an initial bet of, say, 1 unit, a loss would raise the next bet to 2 units. If this is followed by a win, the next bet would be 1 units.\nThis betting system relies on the gambler's fallacy\u2014that the player is more likely to lose following a win, and more likely to win following a loss.\nOther systems.\nThere are numerous other betting systems that rely on this fallacy, or that attempt to follow 'streaks' (looking for patterns in randomness), varying bet size accordingly.\nMany betting systems are sold online and purport to enable the player to 'beat' the odds. One such system was advertised by Jason Gillon of Rotherham, UK, who claimed one could 'earn \u00a3200 daily' by following his betting system, described as a 'loophole'. As the system was advertised in the UK press, it was subject to Advertising Standards Authority regulation, and following a complaint, it was ruled by the ASA that Mr. Gillon had failed to support his claims, and that he had failed to show that there was any loophole.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26490", "revid": "612852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26490", "title": "Reference counting", "text": "Software resource tracking technique\nIn computer science, reference counting is a programming technique of storing the number of references, pointers, or handles to a resource, such as an object, a block of memory, disk space, and others.\nIn garbage collection algorithms, reference counts may be used to deallocate objects that are no longer needed.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nThe main advantage of the reference counting over tracing garbage collection is that objects are reclaimed \"as soon as\" they can no longer be referenced, and in an incremental fashion, without long pauses for collection cycles and with clearly defined lifetime of every object. In real-time applications or systems with limited memory, this is important to maintain responsiveness. Reference counting is also among the simplest forms of memory management to implement. It also allows for effective management of non-memory resources such as operating system objects, which are often much scarcer than memory (tracing garbage collection systems use finalizers for this, but the delayed reclamation may cause problems). Weighted reference counts are a good solution for garbage collecting a distributed system.\nTracing garbage collection cycles are triggered too often if the set of live objects fills most of the available memory; it requires extra space to be efficient. Reference counting performance does not deteriorate as the total amount of free space decreases.\nReference counts are also useful information to use as input to other runtime optimizations. For example, systems that depend heavily on immutable objects such as many functional programming languages can suffer an efficiency penalty due to frequent copies. However, if the compiler (or runtime system) knows that a particular object has only one reference (as most do in many systems), and that the reference is lost at the same time that a similar new object is created (as in the string append statement codice_1), it can replace the operation with a mutation on the original object.\nReference counting in naive form has three main disadvantages over the tracing garbage collection, both of which require additional mechanisms to ameliorate:\nIn addition to these, if the memory is allocated from a free list, reference counting suffers from poor locality. Reference counting alone cannot move objects to improve cache performance, so high performance collectors implement a tracing garbage collector as well. Most implementations (such as the ones in PHP and Objective-C) suffer from poor cache performance since they do not implement copying objects.\nGraph interpretation.\nWhen dealing with garbage collection schemes, it is often helpful to think of the reference graph, which is a directed graph where the vertices are objects and there is an edge from an object\u00a0A to an object\u00a0B if A holds a reference to\u00a0B. We also have a special vertex or vertices representing the local variables and references held by the runtime system, and no edges ever go to these nodes, although edges can go from them to other nodes.\nIn this context, the simple reference count of an object is the in-degree of its vertex. Deleting a vertex is like collecting an object. It can only be done when the vertex has no incoming edges, so it does not affect the out-degree of any other vertices, but it can affect the in-degree of other vertices, causing their corresponding objects to be collected as well if their in-degree also becomes 0 as a result.\nThe connected component containing the special vertex contains the objects that can't be collected, while other connected components of the graph only contain garbage. If a reference-counting garbage collection algorithm is implemented, then each of these garbage components must contain at least one cycle; otherwise, they would have been collected as soon as their reference count (i.e., the number of incoming edges) dropped to zero.\nDealing with inefficiency of updates.\nIncrementing and decrementing reference counts every time a reference is created or destroyed can significantly impede performance. Not only do the operations take time, but they damage cache performance and can lead to pipeline bubbles. Even read-only operations like calculating the length of a list require a large number of reads and writes for reference updates with naive reference counting.\nOne simple technique is for the compiler to combine a number of nearby reference updates into one. This is especially effective for references which are created and quickly destroyed. Care must be taken, however, to put the combined update at the right position so that a premature free can be avoided.\nThe Deutsch-Bobrow method of reference counting capitalizes on the fact that most reference count updates are in fact generated by references stored in local variables. It ignores these references, only counting references in data structures, but before an object with reference count zero can be deleted, the system must verify with a scan of the stack and registers that no other reference to it still exists.\nAnother technique devised by Henry Baker involves deferred increments, in which references which are stored in local variables do not immediately increment the corresponding reference count, but instead defer this until it is necessary. If such a reference is destroyed quickly, then there is no need to update the counter. This eliminates a large number of updates associated with short-lived references (such as the above list-length-counting example). However, if such a reference is copied into a data structure, then the deferred increment must be performed at that time. It is also critical to perform the deferred increment before the object's count drops to zero, to avoid a premature free.\nA dramatic decrease in the overhead on counter updates was obtained by Levanoni and Petrank. They introduce the update coalescing method which coalesces many of the redundant reference count updates. Consider a pointer that in a given interval of the execution is updated several times. It first points to an object codice_2, then to an object codice_3, and so forth until at the end of the interval it points to some object codice_4. A reference counting algorithm would typically execute codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, ..., codice_10. But most of these updates are redundant. In order to have the reference count properly evaluated at the end of the interval it is enough to perform codice_5 and codice_10. The rest of the updates are redundant.\nLevanoni and Petrank showed in 2001 how to use such update coalescing in a reference counting collector. When using update coalescing with an appropriate treatment of new objects, more than 99% of the counter updates are eliminated for typical Java benchmarks. \nInterestingly, update coalescing also eliminates the need to employ atomic operations during pointer updates in a concurrent setting, this solving reference counting issues in a concurrent setting. Therefore, update coalescing solves the third problem of naive reference counting (i.e., a costly overhead in a concurrent setting). Levanoni and Petrank presented an enhanced algorithm that may run concurrently with multithreaded applications employing only fine synchronization.\nBlackburn and McKinley's \"ulterior reference counting\" method in 2003 combines deferred reference counting with a copying nursery, observing that the majority of pointer mutations occur in young objects. This algorithm achieves throughput comparable with the fastest generational copying collectors with the low bounded pause times of reference counting.\nDealing with reference cycles.\nPerhaps the most obvious way to handle reference cycles is to design the system to avoid creating them. A system may explicitly forbid reference cycles; file systems with hard links often do this. Judicious use of \"weak\" (non-counted) references may also help avoid retain cycles; the Cocoa framework, for instance, recommends using \"strong\" references for parent-to-child relationships and \"weak\" references for child-to-parent relationships.\nSystems may also be designed to tolerate or correct the cycles they create in some way. Developers may design code to explicitly \"tear down\" the references in a data structure when it is no longer needed, though this has the cost of requiring them to manually track that data structure's lifetime. This technique can be automated by creating an \"owner\" object that does the tearing-down when it is destroyed; for instance, a Graph object's destructor could delete the edges of its GraphNodes, breaking the reference cycles in the graph. Cycles may even be ignored in systems with short lives and a small amount of cyclic garbage, particularly when the system was developed using a methodology of avoiding cyclic data structures wherever possible, typically at the expense of efficiency.\nComputer scientists have also discovered ways to detect and collect reference cycles automatically, without requiring changes in the data structure design. One simple solution is to periodically use a tracing garbage collector to reclaim cycles; since cycles typically constitute a relatively small amount of reclaimed space, the collector can be run much less often than with an ordinary tracing garbage collector.\nBacon describes a cycle-collection algorithm for reference counting with similarities to tracing collectors, including the same theoretical time bounds. It is based on the observation that a cycle can only be isolated when a reference count is decremented to a nonzero value. All objects which this occurs on are put on a \"roots\" list, and then periodically the program searches through the objects reachable from the roots for cycles. It knows it has found a cycle that can be collected when decrementing all the reference counts on a cycle of references brings them all down to zero. An enhanced version of this algorithm by Paz et al. is able to run concurrently with other operations and improve its efficiency by using the update coalescing method of Levanoni and Petrank.\nVariant forms.\nAlthough it is possible to augment simple reference counts in a variety of ways, often a better solution can be found by performing reference counting in a fundamentally different way. Here we describe some of the variants on reference counting and their benefits and drawbacks.\nWeighted reference counting.\nIn weighted reference counting, each reference is assigned a \"weight\", and each object tracks not the number of references referring to it, but the total weight of the references referring to it. The initial reference to a newly created object has a large weight, such as 216. Whenever this reference is copied, half of the weight goes to the new reference, and half of the weight stays with the old reference. Since the total weight does not change, the object's reference count does not need to be updated.\nDestroying a reference decrements the total weight by the weight of that reference. When the total weight becomes zero, all references have been destroyed. If an attempt is made to copy a reference with a weight of 1, the reference has to \"get more weight\" by adding to the total weight and then adding this new weight to the reference, and then splitting it. An alternative in this situation is to create an \"indirection\" reference object, the initial reference to which is created with a large weight which can then be split.\nThe property of not needing to access a reference count when a reference is copied is particularly helpful when the object's reference count is expensive to access, for example because it is in another process, on disk, or even across a network. It can also help increase concurrency by avoiding many threads locking a reference count to increase it. Thus, weighted reference counting is most useful in parallel, multiprocess, database, or distributed applications.\nThe primary problem with simple weighted reference counting is that destroying a reference still requires accessing the reference count, and if many references are destroyed, this can cause the same bottlenecks we seek to avoid. Some adaptations of weighted reference counting seek to avoid this by transferring weight from a dying reference to an active reference.\nWeighted reference counting was independently devised by Bevan and Watson &amp; Watson in 1987.\nIndirect reference counting.\nIn indirect reference counting, it is necessary to keep track of the reference's source. This means that two references are kept to the object: a direct one which is used for invocations; and an indirect one which forms part of a diffusion tree, such as in the Dijkstra\u2013Scholten algorithm, which allows a garbage collector to identify dead objects. This approach prevents an object from being discarded prematurely.\nExamples of use.\nGarbage collection.\nAs a collection algorithm, reference counting tracks, for each object, a count of the number of references to it held by other objects. If an object's reference count reaches zero, the object has become inaccessible, and can be destroyed.\nWhen an object is destroyed, any objects referenced by that object also have their reference counts decreased. Because of this, removing a single reference can potentially lead to a large number of objects being freed. A common modification allows reference counting to be made incremental: instead of destroying an object as soon as its reference count becomes zero, it is added to a list of unreferenced objects, and periodically (or as needed) one or more items from this list are destroyed.\nSimple reference counts require frequent updates. Whenever a reference is destroyed or overwritten, the reference count of the object it references is decremented, and whenever one is created or copied, the reference count of the object it references is incremented.\nReference counting is also used in file systems and distributed systems, where full non-incremental tracing garbage collection is too time-consuming because of the size of the object graph and slow access speed.\nComponent Object Model.\nMicrosoft's Component Object Model (COM) and WinRT makes pervasive use of reference counting. In fact, two of the three methods that all COM objects must provide (in the IUnknown interface) increment or decrement the reference count. Much of the Windows Shell and many Windows applications (including MS Internet Explorer, MS Office, and countless third-party products) are built on COM, demonstrating the viability of reference counting in large-scale systems.\nOne primary motivation for reference counting in COM is to enable interoperability across different programming languages and runtime systems. A client need only know how to invoke object methods in order to manage object life cycle; thus, the client is completely abstracted from whatever memory allocator the implementation of the COM object uses. As a typical example, a Visual Basic program using a COM object is agnostic towards whether that object was allocated (and must later be deallocated) by a C++ allocator or another Visual Basic component.\nC++.\nC++ does not perform reference-counting by default, fulfilling its philosophy of not adding functionality that might incur overheads where the user has not explicitly requested it. Objects that are shared but not owned can be accessed via a reference, raw pointer, or iterator (a conceptual generalisation of pointers).\nHowever, by the same token, C++ provides native ways for users to opt-into such functionality: C++11 provides reference counted smart pointers, via the class, enabling automatic shared memory-management of dynamically allocated objects. Programmers can use this in conjunction with weak pointers (via ) to break cyclic dependencies. Objects that are dynamically allocated but not intended to be shared can have their lifetime automatically managed using a .\nIn addition, C++11's move semantics further reduce the extent to which reference counts need to be modified by removing the deep copy normally used when a function returns an object, as it allows for a simple copy of the pointer of said object.\nCocoa (Objective-C).\nApple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks (and related frameworks, such as Core Foundation) use manual reference counting, much like COM. Traditionally this was accomplished by the programmer manually sending codice_13 and codice_14 messages to objects, but Automatic Reference Counting, a Clang compiler feature that automatically inserts these messages as needed, was added in iOS 5 and Mac OS X 10.7. Mac OS X 10.5 introduced a tracing garbage collector as an alternative to reference counting, but it was deprecated in OS X 10.8 and removed from the Objective-C runtime library in macOS Sierra. iOS has never supported a tracing garbage collector.\nDelphi.\nDelphi is mostly not a garbage collected language, in that user-defined types must still be manually allocated and deallocated; however, it does provide automatic collection using reference counting for a few built-in types, such as strings, dynamic arrays, and interfaces, for ease of use and to simplify the generic database functionality. It is up to the programmer to decide whether to use the built-in types; Delphi programmers have complete access to low-level memory management like in C/C++. So all potential cost of Delphi's reference counting can, if desired, be easily circumvented.\nSome of the reasons reference counting may have been preferred to other forms of garbage collection in Delphi include:\nGObject.\nThe GObject object-oriented programming framework implements reference counting on its base types, including weak references. Reference incrementing and decrementing uses atomic operations for thread safety. A significant amount of the work in writing bindings to GObject from high-level languages lies in adapting GObject reference counting to work with the language's own memory management system.\nThe Vala programming language uses GObject reference counting as its primary garbage collection system, along with copy-heavy string handling.\nPerl.\nPerl also uses reference counting, without any special handling of circular references, although (as in Cocoa and C++ above), Perl does support weak references, which allows programmers to avoid creating a cycle.\nPHP.\nPHP uses a reference counting mechanism for its internal variable management. Since PHP 5.3, it implements the algorithm from Bacon's above mentioned paper. PHP allows you to turn on and off the cycle collection with user-level functions. It also allows you to manually force the purging mechanism to be run.\n$a = \"new string\";\n$b = $a;\nxdebug_debug_zval(\"a\");\nThe above example will output:\n a: (refcount=2, is_ref=0)='new string'\nPython.\nPython also uses reference counting and offers cycle detection as well (and can reclaim reference cycles).\nRust.\nLike other low-level languages, Rust does not provide reference counting by default. Instead, any constructed type will be dropped when it falls out of scope. When a programmer needs to define the scope of a constructed type, they often use lifetimes. \nHowever, the language also offers various alternatives to complex forms of memory management. Reference counting functionality is provided by the codice_15 and codice_16 types, which are non-atomic and atomic respectively. \nFor example, the type codice_17 provides shared ownership of a value of type codice_18, allocated on the heap for multiple references to its data.\nuse std::rc::Rc;\nstruct Cat {\n color: String,\nfn main() {\n let cat = Cat { color: \"black\".to_string() };\n let cat = Rc::new(cat);\nUsing these constructs allows programmers to avoid lifetimes for a small runtime cost. Both reference counters keep track of the number of owners, as they must drop themselves when no owners remain. \nOne noteworthy facet of these types is related to their usage as a shared reference. In Rust, shared references cannot mutate their held data, so codice_15 often comes bundled with codice_20, and codice_16 with codice_22, in contexts where interior mutability is necessary. \nInterior mutability without codice_23 has performance costs, too, so, for maximum performance, some applications may call for additional complexity.\nSquirrel.\nSquirrel uses reference counting with cycle detection.\nThis tiny language is relatively unknown outside the video game industry; however, it is a concrete example of how reference counting can be practical and efficient (especially in realtime environments).\nSwift.\nSwift uses reference counting to track and manage the memory of class instances, and provides the codice_24 keyword for creating weak references. Instances of value types do not use reference counting.\nTcl.\nTcl 8 uses reference counting for memory management of values (Tcl Obj structs). Since Tcl's values are immutable, reference cycles are impossible to form and no cycle detection scheme is needed. Operations that would replace a value with a modified copy are generally optimized to instead modify the original when its reference count indicates that it is not shared. The references are counted at a data structure level, so the problems with very frequent updates discussed above do not arise.\nXojo.\nXojo also uses reference counting, without any special handling of circular references, although (as in Cocoa and C++ above), Xojo does support weak references, which allows programmers to avoid creating a cycle.\nFile systems.\nMany file systems maintain reference counts to any particular block or file, for example the inode \"link count\" on Unix-style file systems, which are usually known as hard links. When the count reaches zero, the file can be safely deallocated. While references can still be made from directories, some Unixes only allow references from live processes, and there can be files that exist outside the file system hierarchy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It occurs when using a photographic flash at low lighting or at night. When a flash passes through the eyes and rebounds at the back of the eye, it causes a red reflex in an image, turning the subject's eyes red. The hue is mostly caused by a high concentration of blood in the choroid. The effect can also be influenced by the near proximity of the flash and camera lens. In children, a different hue red reflex, such as white or yellow, may indicate an illness. In animals, a similar effect could cause their eyes to change colors in photographs.\nThe effect can be avoided physically by instructing the subject to look away from the lens, increasing the brightness of the photographic location, or moving the flash further away from the lens, or digitally by using the red-eye correction option on digital cameras or by removing the effect in editing software. Scholars have developed a number of red-eye detection techniques to improve digital red-eye removal.\nCauses.\nThe red-eye effect occurs in the eyes of humans when a photography flash is used in low light or at night. The flash travels through the eyes and rebounds at the rear of the eye, turning the eyes red (red reflex) in a photograph. The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid, which supports the back of the eye and lies behind the retina. Melanin also plays a role in the effect, as individuals with less melanin, such as albinos, reflect more light. The close distance of the flash to the camera lens can also have an impact, especially on cameras with built-in flash.\nThe effect could also infrequently occur in only one eye of persons with cataracts or tumors, or it may be exacerbated by photographing subjects that are drunk. In children, if the red reflex is white, it may indicate retinoblastoma malignancy, whereas yellow color may indicate Coats' disease. If the effect is asymmetrical, it may indicate strabismus. A similar reaction to the red-eye occurs in animals, turning their eyes different colors.\nPrevention.\nEither physical or digital manipulation of the effect is possible. The subject can turn away from the camera lens, the flash can be mounted on a hot shoe, or the lighting can be increased to make the subject's pupils more constricted. The effect could potentially be avoided by positioning the flash off the side of the camera or by pointing it away from the subject and toward a white solid surface to bounce the flash off of it. The subject could also be photographed near a bright light source or in sunlight. To lessen the effect, the photographer might alternatively employ the fill flash technique. The effect can be removed digitally by using red-eye correction.\nCure.\nDigital cameras with red-eye correction can eliminate the effect by using flash lighting that fires rapidly and repeatedly just before a photograph is taken, which causes the subject's pupils to contract. Editing software can also eliminate the effect.\nScholars have proposed a number of red-eye detection methods for digital red-eye correction. The red-eye detection algorithm developed by electronic engineers Seunghwan Yoo and Rae-Hong Park is composed of face detection, region-growing, and red-eye detection. Following the detection of the subject's face and eyes, the algorithm searches for red-eye regions, which are subsequently enlarged using the region-growing technique. They claim that pupil size calculation, pupil painting, and iris detection make up the red-eye correction that may then take place. Computer scientists Xiao-Ping Miao and Terence Sim have proposed their technique for detecting red-eye by fusing subjects' flash and non-flash photos. Scholars Tauseef Ali, Asif Khan, and Intaek Kim put forth an algorithm that, following facial recognition, grayscales the image before applying red-eye correction. On the contrary, researchers Richard Youmaran and Andy Adler presented a method for improving the quality of videos with the red-eye phenomenon. They have stated that their method consists of two frames, the first shot under standard illumination with no infrared light and the second one using infrared light.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In regard to the frequency, less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in RHS. It is traditionally defined as a triad of ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and vesicles close to the ear and auditory canal. Due to its proximity to the vestibulocochlear nerve, the virus can spread and cause hearing loss, tinnitus (hearing noises that are not caused by outside sounds), and vertigo. It is common for diagnoses to be overlooked or delayed, which can raise the likelihood of long-term consequences. It is more complicated than Bell's palsy. Therapy aims to shorten its overall length, while also providing pain relief and averting any consequences.\nSigns and symptoms.\nEarly symptoms include intense pain in one ear, the jaw on one side or the neck on one side which may precede the acute facial paralysis by a week or more.\nAcute symptoms include:\nBecause the vestibulocochlear nerve is in proximity to the geniculate ganglion, it may also be affected and patients may also experience:\nThe swallow reflex might also be affected.\nInvolvement of the trigeminal nerve can cause numbness of the face.\nPathophysiology.\nThe varicella zoster virus infects people and results in a distributed vesicular rash with fever, known as chickenpox. Respiratory droplets are the main method of virus transmission during the acute stage of the infection. After it subsides, it stays dormant in nerve cells in the body. It may reactivate under conditions of physiological stress or if the immune system is suppressed in any way (for example during an illness or undergoing chemotherapy), resulting in herpes zoster, also known as shingles or Ramsay Hunt syndrome when facial paralysis in involved. If the nerve cells affected lie within the facial nerves, it causes the symptoms described above.\nRamsay Hunt syndrome type 2 is estimated to account for 12% of all facial nerve paralysis. It occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals with immunocompromised patients often having more severe disease presentation. RHS may occur in any age group with cases reported in patients ranging in age from 3 months to 82 years.\nThe affected ganglion is responsible for the movements of facial muscles, the touch sensation of a part of ear and ear canal, the taste function of the frontal two-thirds of the tongue, and the moisturization of the eyes and the mouth. The syndrome specifically refers to the combination of this entity with weakness of the muscles activated by the facial nerve. In isolation, the latter is called Bell's palsy.\nHowever, as with shingles, the lack of lesions does not definitely exclude the existence of a herpes infection. Even before the eruption of vesicles, varicella zoster virus can be detected from the skin of the ear.\nDiagnosis.\nRamsay Hunt syndrome type 2 can be diagnosed based on clinical features; however, in ambiguous cases, PCR or direct immunofluorescent assay of vesicular fluid can help with the diagnosis. Laboratory studies such as WBC count, ESR and electrolytes can distinguish infectious versus inflammatory etiologies.\nClinical diagnosis.\nOn a physical exam, look for vesicular exanthema on the external auditory canal, concha and or pinna. Dry eyes with possible lower cornea epithelium damage due to incomplete closure of eyelids. It is possible to have Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 without an external rash present. This is called \"RHS sine herpete\" and may occur in up to 30% of patients.\nDiagnostic procedures.\nRamsay Hunt Syndrome type 2 can usually be diagnosed based on clinical features. However, for suspected cases with unclear presentation, varicella zoster virus can be isolated from vesicle fluid. Tear culture PCR can have positive varicella zoster virus. However, 25\u201335% of patients with Bell's palsy can have false positive varicella zoster virus detected in tears. If central nervous system complications such as meningitis, ventriculitis or meningoencephalitis are suspected, prompt lumbar puncture with spinal fluid analysis and imaging (CT head) are recommended.\nAn MRI with contrast may be ordered if the diagnosis is ambiguous so as to rule out other causes of acute facial paralysis such as a stroke, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, cancer or tumors. This test is most commonly ordered if the patient presents atypically with RHS sine herpete.\nPrevention.\nShingles is prevented by immunizing against the causal virus, varicella zoster, using a zoster vaccine. Vaccination is recommended for adults 50 and older. Two versions of the vaccine are available, the live attenuated Zostavax (now discontinued in the US, essentially a larger-dose chickenpox vaccine) and the protein subunit Shingrix.\nTreatment.\nTreatments for Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 are used to reduce further damage caused by the viral infection. Initial treatment with a corticosteroid such as prednisone and an antiviral drug such as acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir for 5 to 7 days is standard; however, some studies have shown later damage to the facial nerve and recommend 21 days of antivirals. Studies indicate that treatment started within 72 hours of the onset of facial paralysis improves the chances of the patient experiencing significant recovery. Chances of recovery appear to decrease when treatment is delayed. Delay of treatment may result in permanent facial nerve paralysis. However, some studies demonstrate that even when steroids are started promptly, only 22% of all patients achieve full recovery of facial paralysis. Treatment apparently has no effect on the recovery of hearing loss.\nMeclizine, benzodiazepines such as diazepam, and vestibular therapy are sometimes used to treat the vertigo.\nDuring the acute recovery phase, the eye on the affected side of the face may not blink completely or at all and may not close tightly or at all when sleeping. If the eye is dry or feels irritated, this is a strong indication that the eye is not properly blinking or closing completely. Using artificial tears every 5 to 20 minutes while awake and protecting the eye while asleep are very important to maintaining the health of the eye. While asleep, applying overnight eye gel and using sensitive skin medical tape or an eye patch to keep the eye closed or using a moisture chamber can protect the eye. Taking these precautions is extremely important to preserve the health and functionality of the eye and prevent corneal abrasions and corneal ulcers.\nNerve pain associated with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome may be extreme and centered in the ear, neck, cheek, jaw and face. This nerve pain may not respond well to standard pain treatments including NSAIDS and opioids. Medication specifically for nerve pain such as tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentin have been shown to be effective for the neuropathic pain and post-herpetic neuralgia common with RHS.\nPhysical therapy, excessive movement or electrical stimulation practiced during the first year of recovery greatly increase the chances of long term complications, including hyperactive muscles and synkinesis, both of which are permanent. The most common form of synkinesis for Ramsay Hunt Syndrome patients involves the eye being connected to the mouth (i.e. blinking while speaking, tearing while eating) and chin dimpling (chin dimples forming when speaking).

With the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century, differences in average test performance between racial groups have been observed, though these differences have fluctuated and in many cases steadily decreased over time. Complicating the issue, modern science has concluded that race is a socially constructed phenomenon rather than a biological reality, and there exist various conflicting definitions of intelligence. In particular, the validity of IQ testing as a metric for human intelligence is disputed. Today, the scientific consensus is that genetics does not explain differences in IQ test performance between groups, and that observed differences are environmental in origin. \nPseudoscientific claims of inherent differences in intelligence between races have played a central role in the history of scientific racism. The first tests showing differences in IQ scores between different population groups in the United States were those of United States Army recruits in World War I. In the 1920s, groups of eugenics lobbyists argued that these results demonstrated that African Americans and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to Anglo-Saxon white people, and that this was due to innate biological differences. In turn, they used such beliefs to justify policies of racial segregation. However, other studies soon appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socioeconomic and educational inequality between the groups. \nLater observations of phenomena such as the Flynn effect and disparities in access to prenatal care highlighted ways in which environmental factors affect group IQ differences. In recent decades, as understanding of human genetics has advanced, claims of inherent differences in intelligence between races have been broadly rejected by scientists on both theoretical and empirical grounds.\nHistory of the controversy.\nClaims of differences in intelligence between races have been used to justify colonialism, slavery, racism, social Darwinism, and racial eugenics. Claims of intellectual inferiority were used to justify British wars and colonial campaigns in Asia. Racial thinkers such as Arthur de Gobineau in France relied crucially on the assumption that black people were innately inferior to white people in developing their ideologies of white supremacy. Even Enlightenment thinkers such as Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, believed black people to be innately inferior to white people in physique and intellect. At the same time in the United States, prominent examples of African-American genius such the autodidact and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, the pioneering sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, and the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar stood as high-profile counterexamples to widespread stereotypes of black intellectual inferiority. In Britain, Japan's military victory over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War began to reverse negative stereotypes of \"oriental\" inferiority. \nEarly IQ testing.\nThe first practical intelligence test, the Binet-Simon Intelligence Test, was developed between 1905 and 1908 by Alfred Binet and Th\u00e9odore Simon in France for school placement of children. Binet warned that results from his test should not be assumed to measure innate intelligence or used to label individuals permanently. Binet's test was translated into English and revised in 1916 by Lewis Terman (who introduced IQ scoring for the test results) and published under the name Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales. In 1916 Terman wrote that Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and Native Americans have a mental \"dullness [that] seems to be racial, or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they come.\"\nThe US Army used a different set of tests developed by Robert Yerkes to evaluate draftees for World War I. Based on the Army's data, prominent psychologists and eugenicists such as Henry H. Goddard, Harry H. Laughlin, and Princeton professor Carl Brigham wrote that people from southern and eastern Europe were less intelligent than native-born Americans or immigrants from the Nordic countries, and that black Americans were less intelligent than white Americans. The results were widely publicized by a lobby of anti-immigration activists, including the conservationist and theorist of scientific racism Madison Grant, who considered the so-called Nordic race to be superior, but under threat because of immigration by \"inferior breeds.\" In his influential work, \"A Study of American Intelligence,\" psychologist Carl Brigham used the results of the Army tests to argue for a stricter immigration policy, limiting immigration to countries considered to belong to the \"Nordic race\".\nIn the 1920s, some US states enacted eugenic laws, such as Virginia's 1924 Racial Integrity Act, which established the one-drop rule (of 'racial purity') as law. Many scientists reacted negatively to eugenicist claims linking abilities and moral character to racial or genetic ancestry. They pointed to the contribution of environment (such as speaking English as a second language) to test results. By the mid-1930s, many psychologists in the US had adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors played a dominant role in IQ test results. The psychologist Carl Brigham repudiated his own earlier arguments, explaining that he had come to realize that the tests were not a measure of innate intelligence.\nDiscussions of the issue in the United States, especially in the writings of Madison Grant, influenced German Nazi claims that the \"Nordics\" were a \"master race\". As American public sentiment shifted against the Germans, claims of racial differences in intelligence increasingly came to be regarded as problematic. Anthropologists such as Franz Boas, Ruth Benedict, and Gene Weltfish did much to demonstrate that claims about racial hierarchies of intelligence were unscientific. Nonetheless, a powerful eugenics and segregation lobby funded largely by textile-magnate Wickliffe Draper continued to use intelligence studies as an argument for eugenics, segregation, and anti-immigration legislation.\nPioneer Fund and \"The Bell Curve\".\nAs the desegregation of the American South gained traction in the 1950s, debate about black intelligence resurfaced. Audrey Shuey, funded by Draper's Pioneer Fund, published a new analysis of Yerkes' tests, concluding that black people really were of inferior intellect to white people. This study was used by segregationists to argue that it was to the advantage of black children to be educated separately from the superior white children. In the 1960s, the debate was revived when William Shockley publicly defended the view that black children were innately unable to learn as well as white children. Arthur Jensen expressed similar opinions in his \"Harvard Educational Review\" article, \"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?,\" which questioned the value of compensatory education for African-American children. He suggested that poor educational performance in such cases reflected an underlying genetic cause rather than lack of stimulation at home or other environmental factors.\nAnother revival of public debate followed the appearance of \"The Bell Curve\" (1994), a book by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray that supported the general viewpoint of Jensen. Many of the references and sources used in the book were advocates for racial hygiene, whose research was funded by Pioneer Fund and published in its affiliated journal \"Mankind Quarterly\". A statement in support of Herrnstein and Murray titled \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence,\" was published in \"The Wall Street Journal\". \"The Bell Curve\" also led to critical responses in a statement titled \"\" of the American Psychological Association and in several books, including \"The Bell Curve Debate\" (1995), \"Inequality by Design\" (1996) and a second edition of \"The Mismeasure of Man\" (1996) by Stephen Jay Gould. \nSome of the authors proposing genetic explanations for group differences have received funding from the Pioneer Fund, which was headed by J. Philippe Rushton until his death in 2012. Arthur Jensen, who jointly with Rushton published a 2005 review article arguing that the difference in average IQs between blacks and whites is partly due to genetics, received $1.1 million in grants from the Pioneer Fund. According to Ashley Montagu, \"The University of California's Arthur Jensen, cited twenty-three times in \"The Bell Curve\"'s bibliography, is the book's principal authority on the intellectual inferiority of blacks.\"\nAdditional books by psychologist Pioneer Fund board member Richard Lynn and political scientist Tatu Vanhanen titled \"IQ and the Wealth of Nations\" and \"IQ and Global Inequality\", where they try to find a correlation between national IQ test scores and the size of a country's economy, also fueled the debate, with several researchers criticizing their conclusions.On July 27, 2020, the European Human Behavior and Evolution Association issued a formal statement opposing the utilization of Lynn's national IQ dataset, citing various methodological concerns. They concluded, \"Any conclusions drawn from analyses which use these data are therefore unsound, and no reliable evolutionary work should be using these data.\"\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Pioneer Fund as a hate group, citing the fund's history, its funding of race and intelligence research, and its connections with racist individuals. Other researchers have criticized the Pioneer Fund for promoting scientific racism, eugenics and white supremacy.\nConceptual issues.\nIntelligence and IQ.\nThe concept of intelligence and the degree to which intelligence is measurable are matters of debate. There is no consensus about how to define intelligence; nor is it universally accepted that it is something that can be meaningfully measured by a single figure. A recurring criticism is that different societies value and promote different kinds of skills and that the concept of intelligence is therefore culturally variable and cannot be measured by the same criteria in different societies. Consequently, some critics argue that it makes no sense to propose relationships between intelligence and other variables.\nCorrelations between scores on various types of IQ tests led English psychologist Charles Spearman to propose in 1904 the existence of an underlying factor, which he referred to as \"g\" or \"general intelligence\", a trait which is supposed to be innate. Another proponent of this view is Arthur Jensen. This view, however, has been contradicted by a number of studies showing that education and changes in environment can significantly improve IQ test results.\nOther psychometricians have argued that, whether or not there is such a thing as a general intelligence factor, performance on tests relies crucially on knowledge acquired through prior exposure to the types of tasks that such tests contain. This means that comparisons of test scores between persons with widely different life experiences and cognitive habits do not reveal their relative innate potentials.\nRace.\nThe consensus view among geneticists, biologists and anthropologists is that race is a sociopolitical phenomenon rather than a biological one, a view supported by considerable genetics research. Race is a social construct based on folk ideologies that differentiate groups based on social disparities and superficial physical characteristics. A 2023 consensus report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine stated: \"In humans, race is a socially constructed designation, a misleading and harmful surrogate for population genetic differences, and has a long history of being incorrectly identified as the major genetic reason for phenotypic differences between groups.\"\nThe concept of human \"races\" as natural and separate divisions within the human species has also been rejected by the American Anthropological Association. The official position of the AAA, adopted in 1998, is that advances in scientific knowledge have made it \"clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups\" and that \"any attempt to establish lines of division among biological populations [is] both arbitrary and subjective.\" A more recent statement from the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (2019) declares that \"Race does not provide an accurate representation of human biological variation. It was never accurate in the past, and it remains inaccurate when referencing contemporary human populations. Humans are not divided biologically into distinct continental types or racial genetic clusters.\"\nAnthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves, have argued that the cluster structure of genetic data is dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the influence of these hypotheses on the choice of populations to sample. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental, but if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. argue that the social construction of race derives not from any valid scientific basis but rather \"from people's desire to classify.\"\nIn studies of human intelligence, race is almost always determined using self-reports rather than analyses of genetic characteristics. According to psychologist David Rowe, self-report is the preferred method for racial classification in studies of racial differences because classification based on genetic markers alone ignore the \"cultural, behavioral, sociological, psychological, and epidemiological variables\" that distinguish racial groups. Hunt and Carlson disagreed, writing that \"Nevertheless, self-identification is a surprisingly reliable guide to genetic composition,\" citing a study by . Sternberg and Grigorenko disputed Hunt and Carlson's interpretation of Tang's results as supporting the view that racial divisions are biological; rather, \"Tang et al.'s point was that ancient geographic ancestry rather than current residence is associated with self-identification and not that such self-identification provides evidence for the existence of biological race.\"\nGroup differences.\nThe study of human intelligence is one of the most controversial topics in psychology, in part because of difficulty reaching agreement about the meaning of \"intelligence\" and objections to the assumption that intelligence can be meaningfully measured by IQ tests. Claims that there are innate differences in intelligence between racial and ethnic groups\u2014which go back at least to the 19th century\u2014have been criticized for relying on specious assumptions and research methods and for serving as an ideological framework for discrimination and racism.\nIn a 2012 study of tests of different components of intelligence, Hampshire et al. expressed disagreement with the view of Jensen and Rushton that genetic factors must play a role in IQ differences between races, stating that \"it remains unclear ... whether population differences in intelligence test scores are driven by heritable factors or by other correlated demographic variables such as socioeconomic status, education level, and motivation. More relevantly, it is questionable whether [population differences in intelligence test scores] relate to a unitary intelligence factor, as opposed to a bias in testing paradigms toward particular components of a more complex intelligence construct.\" According to Jackson and Weidman, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are a number of reasons why the genetic argument for race differences in intelligence has not won many adherents in the scientific community. First, even taken on its own terms, the case made by Jensen and his followers did not hold up to scrutiny. Second, the rise of population genetics undercut the claims for a genetic cause of intelligence. Third, the new understanding of institutional racism offered a better explanation for the existence of differences in IQ scores between the races.\nTest scores.\nIn the United States, Asians on average score higher than White people, who tend to score higher than Hispanics, who tend to score higher than African Americans. There is more variation in IQ scores within each racial group, such as when they are divided by income, than between different ethnic groups when compared as a whole against each other. A 2001 meta-analysis of the results of 6,246,729 participants tested for cognitive ability or aptitude found a difference in average scores between black people and white people of 1.1 standard deviations. Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (N = 2.4 million) and Graduate Record Examination (N = 2.3 million), as well as for tests of job applicants in corporate settings (N = 0.5 million) and in the military (N = 0.4 million).\nIn response to the controversial 1994 book \"The Bell Curve\", the American Psychological Association (APA) formed a task-force of eleven experts, which issued a report \"\" in 1996. Regarding group differences, the report reaffirmed the consensus that differences within groups are much wider than differences between groups, and that claims of ethnic differences in intelligence should be scrutinized carefully, as such claims had been used to justify racial discrimination. The report also acknowledged problems with the racial categories used, as these categories are neither consistently applied, nor homogeneous &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nIn the UK, some African groups have higher average educational attainment and standardized test scores than the overall population. In 2010\u20132011, white British pupils were 2.3% less likely to have gained 5 A*\u2013C grades at GCSE than the national average, whereas the likelihood was 21.8% above average for those of Nigerian origin, 5.5% above average for those of Ghanaian origin, and 1.4% above average for those of Sierra Leonian origin. For the two other African ethnic groups on which data was available, the likelihood was 23.7% below average for those of Somali origin and 35.3% below average for those of Congolese origin. In 2014, Black-African pupils of 11 language groups were more likely to pass Key Stage 2 Maths 4+ in England than the national average. Overall, the average pass rate by ethnicity was 86.5% for white British (N = 395,787), whereas it was 85.6% for Black-Africans (N = 18,497). Nevertheless, several Black-African language groups, including Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Akan, Ga, Swahili, Edo, Ewe, Amharic speakers, and English-speaking Africans, each had an average pass rate above the white British average (total N = 9,314), with the Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, and Amhara having averages above 90% (N = 2,071). In 2017\u20132018, the percentage of pupils getting a strong pass (grade 5 or above) in the English and maths GCSE (in Key Stage 4) was 42.7% for whites (N = 396,680) and 44.3% for Black-Africans (N = 18,358).\nFlynn effect and the closing gap.\nThe 'Flynn effect' \u2014 a term coined after researcher James R. Flynn \u2014 refers to the substantial rise in raw IQ test scores observed in many parts of the world during the 20th century. In the United States, the increase was continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to about 1998 when the gains stopped and some tests even showed decreasing test scores. For example, the average scores of black people on some IQ tests in 1995 were the same as the scores of white people in 1945. As one pair of academics phrased it, \"the typical African American today probably has a slightly higher IQ than the grandparents of today's average white American.\"\nFlynn himself argued that the dramatic changes having taken place between one just generation and the next pointed strongly at an environmental explanation, and that it is highly unlikely that genetic factors could have accounted for the increasing scores. The Flynn effect, along with Flynn's analysis, continues to hold significance in the context of the black/white IQ gap debate, demonstrating the potential for environmental factors to influence IQ test scores by as much as 1 standard deviation, a scale of change that had previously been doubted.\nA distinct but related observation has been the gradual narrowing of the American black-white IQ gap in the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black\u2013white IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults. Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of black people and white people closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002, a reduction of about one-third. In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished. Reviews by Flynn and Dickens, Mackintosh, and Nisbett \"et al.\" accept the gradual closing of the gap as a fact. Flynn and Dickens summarize this trend, stating, \"The constancy of the Black-White IQ gap is a myth and therefore cannot be cited as evidence that the racial IQ gap is genetic in origin.\"\nEnvironmental factors.\nHealth and nutrition.\nEnvironmental factors including childhood lead exposure, low rates of breast feeding, and poor nutrition are significantly correlated with poor cognitive development and functioning. For example, childhood exposure to associated with homes in poorer correlates with an average IQ drop of 7 points, and iodine deficiency causes a decline, on average, of 12 IQ points. Such impairments may sometimes be permanent, but in some cases they be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth. \nThe first two years of life are critical for malnutrition, the consequences of which are often irreversible and include poor cognitive development, educability, and future economic productivity. Mackintosh points out that, for American black people, infant mortality is about twice as high as for white people, and low birth weight is twice as prevalent. At the same time, white mothers are twice as likely to breastfeed their infants, and breastfeeding is directly correlated with IQ for low-birth-weight infants. In this way, a wide number of health-related factors which influence IQ are unequally distributed between the two groups.\nThe Copenhagen consensus in 2004 stated that lack of both iodine and iron has been implicated in impaired brain development, and this can affect enormous numbers of people: it is estimated that one-third of the total global population is affected by iodine deficiency. In developing countries, it is estimated that 40% of children aged four and under have anaemia because of insufficient iron in their diets.\nOther scholars have found that simply the standard of nutrition has a significant effect on population intelligence, and that the Flynn effect may be caused by increasing nutrition standards across the world. James Flynn has himself argued against this view.\nSome recent research has argued that the retardation caused in brain development by infectious diseases, many of which are more prevalent in non-white populations, may be an important factor in explaining the differences in IQ between different regions of the world. The findings of this research, showing the correlation between IQ, race and infectious diseases was also shown to apply to the IQ gap in the US, suggesting that this may be an important environmental factor.\nA 2013 meta-analysis by the World Health Organization found that, after controlling for maternal IQ, breastfeeding was associated with IQ gains of 2.19 points. The authors suggest that this relationship is causal but state that the practical significance of this gain is debatable; however, they highlight one study suggesting an association between breastfeeding and academic performance in Brazil, where \"breastfeeding duration does not present marked variability by socioeconomic position.\" Colen and Ramey (2014) similarly find that controlling for sibling comparisons within families, rather than between families, reduces the correlation between breastfeeding status and WISC IQ scores by nearly a third, but further find the relationship between breastfeeding duration and WISC IQ scores to be insignificant. They suggest that \"much of the beneficial long-term effects typically attributed to breastfeeding, per se, may primarily be due to selection pressures into infant feeding practices along key demographic characteristics such as race and socioeconomic status.\" Reichman estimates that no more than 3 to 4% of the black\u2013white IQ gap can be explained by black\u2013white disparities in low birth weight.\nEducation.\nSeveral studies have proposed that a large part of the gap in IQ test performance can be attributed to differences in quality of education. Racial discrimination in education has been proposed as one possible cause of differences in educational quality between races. According to a paper by Hala Elhoweris, Kagendo Mutua, Negmeldin Alsheikh and Pauline Holloway, teachers' referral decisions for students to participate in gifted and talented educational programs were influenced in part by the students' ethnicity.\nThe Abecedarian Early Intervention Project, an intensive early childhood education project, was also able to bring about an average IQ gain of 4.4 points at age 21 in the black children who participated in it compared to controls. Arthur Jensen agreed that the Abecedarian project demonstrated that education can have a significant effect on IQ, but also declared his view that no educational program thus far had been able to reduce the black\u2013white IQ gap by more than a third, and that differences in education are thus unlikely to be its only cause.\nA series of studies by Joseph Fagan and Cynthia Holland measured the effect of prior exposure to the kind of cognitive tasks posed in IQ tests on test performance. Assuming that the IQ gap was the result of lower exposure to tasks using the cognitive functions usually found in IQ tests among African American test takers, they prepared a group of African Americans in this type of tasks before taking an IQ test. The researchers found that there was no subsequent difference in performance between the African-Americans and white test takers. Daley and Onwuegbuzie conclude that Fagan and Holland demonstrate that \"differences in knowledge between black people and white people for intelligence test items can be erased when equal opportunity is provided for exposure to the information to be tested\". A similar argument is made by David Marks who argues that IQ differences correlate well with differences in literacy suggesting that developing literacy skills through education causes an increase in IQ test performance.\nA 2003 study found that two variables\u2014stereotype threat and the degree of educational attainment of children's fathers\u2014partially explained the black\u2013white gap in cognitive ability test scores, undermining the hereditarian view that they stemmed from immutable genetic factors.\nSocioeconomic environment.\nDifferent aspects of the socioeconomic environment in which children are raised have been shown to correlate with part of the IQ gap, but they do not account for the entire gap. According to a 2006 review, these factors account for slightly less than half of one standard deviation.\nOther research has focused on different causes of variation within low socioeconomic status (SES) and high SES groups.\nIn the US, among low SES groups, genetic differences account for a smaller proportion of the variance in IQ than among high SES populations. Such effects are predicted by the \"bioecological\" hypothesis\u2014that genotypes are transformed into phenotypes through nonadditive synergistic effects of the environment. suggest that high SES individuals are more likely to be able to develop their full biological potential, whereas low SES individuals are likely to be hindered in their development by adverse environmental conditions. The same review also points out that adoption studies generally are biased towards including only high and high middle SES adoptive families, meaning that they will tend to overestimate average genetic effects. They also note that studies of adoption from lower-class homes to middle-class homes have shown that such children experience a 12 to 18 point gain in IQ relative to children who remain in low SES homes. A 2015 study found that environmental factors (namely, family income, maternal education, maternal verbal ability/knowledge, learning materials in the home, parenting factors, child birth order, and child birth weight) accounted for the black\u2013white gap in cognitive ability test scores.\nTest bias.\nA number of studies have reached the conclusion that IQ tests may be biased against certain groups. The validity and reliability of IQ scores obtained from outside the United States and Europe have been questioned, in part because of the inherent difficulty of comparing IQ scores between cultures. Several researchers have argued that cultural differences limit the appropriateness of standard IQ tests in non-industrialized communities.\nA 1996 report by the American Psychological Association states that intelligence can be difficult to compare across cultures, and notes that differing familiarity with test materials can produce substantial differences in test results; it also says that tests are accurate predictors of future achievement for black and white Americans, and are in that sense unbiased. The view that tests accurately predict future educational attainment is reinforced by Nicholas Mackintosh in his 1998 book \"IQ and Human Intelligence\", and by a 1999 literature review by .\nJames R. Flynn, surveying studies on the topic, notes that the weight and presence of many test questions depends on what sorts of information and modes of thinking are culturally valued.\nStereotype threat and minority status.\nStereotype threat is the fear that one's behavior will confirm an existing stereotype of a group with which one identifies or by which one is defined; this fear may in turn lead to an impairment of performance. Testing situations that highlight the fact that intelligence is being measured tend to lower the scores of individuals from racial-ethnic groups who already score lower on average or are expected to score lower. Stereotype threat conditions cause larger than expected IQ differences among groups. Psychometrician Nicholas Mackintosh considers that there is little doubt that the effects of stereotype threat contribute to the IQ gap between black people and white people.\nA large number of studies have shown that systemically disadvantaged minorities, such as the African American minority of the United States, generally perform worse in the educational system and in intelligence tests than the majority groups or less disadvantaged minorities such as immigrant or \"voluntary\" minorities. The explanation of these findings may be that children of caste-like minorities, due to the systemic limitations of their prospects of social advancement, do not have \"effort optimism\", i.e. they do not have the confidence that acquiring the skills valued by majority society, such as those skills measured by IQ tests, is worthwhile. They may even deliberately reject certain behaviors that are seen as \"acting white.\" Research published in 1997 indicates that part of the black\u2013white gap in cognitive ability test scores is due to racial differences in test motivation.\nSome researchers have suggested that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-life performance gaps, and have raised the possibility of publication bias. Other critics have focused on correcting what they claim are misconceptions of early studies showing a large effect. However, numerous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown significant evidence for the effects of stereotype threat, though the phenomenon defies over-simplistic characterization. For instance, one meta-analysis found that with female subjects \"subtle threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and moderately explicit cues\" while with minorities \"moderately explicit stereotype threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and subtle cues\".\nSome researchers have argued that studies of stereotype threat may in fact systematically under-represent its effects, since such studies measure \"only that portion of psychological threat that research has identified and remedied. To the extent that unidentified or unremedied psychological threats further undermine performance, the results underestimate the bias.\"\nResearch into possible genetic factors.\nAlthough IQ differences between individuals have been shown to have a large hereditary component, it does not follow that mean group-level disparities (between-group differences) in IQ necessarily have a genetic basis. Today, the scientific consensus is that genetics does not explain differences in IQ test performance between groups. Growing evidence indicates that environmental factors, not genetic ones, explain the racial IQ gap.\nGenetics of race and intelligence.\nGeneticist Alan R. Templeton argued that the question about the possible genetic effects on the test score gap is muddled by the general focus on \"race\" rather than on populations defined by gene frequency or by geographical proximity, and by the general insistence on phrasing the question in terms of heritability. Templeton pointed out that racial groups neither represent sub-species nor distinct evolutionary lineages, and that therefore there is no basis for making claims about the general intelligence of races. He argued that, for these reasons, the search for possible genetic influences on the black\u2013white test score gap is \"a priori\" flawed, because there is no genetic material shared by all Africans or by all Europeans. , on the other hand, argued that by using genetic cluster analysis to correlate gene frequencies with continental populations it might be possible to show that African populations have a higher frequency of certain genetic variants that contribute to differences in average intelligence. Such a hypothetical situation could hold without all Africans carrying the same genes or belonging to a single evolutionary lineage. According to Mackintosh, a biological basis for the observed gap in IQ test performance thus cannot be ruled out on \"a priori\" grounds.\n noted that \"no genes related to difference in cognitive skills across the various racial and ethnic groups have ever been discovered. The argument for genetic differences has been carried forward largely by circumstantial evidence. Of course, tomorrow afternoon genetic mechanisms producing racial and ethnic differences in intelligence might be discovered, but there have been a lot of investigations, and tomorrow has not come for quite some time now.\" concurred, noting that while several environmental factors have been shown to influence the IQ gap, the evidence for a genetic influence has been negligible. A 2012 review by concluded that the entire IQ gap can be explained by known environmental factors, and Mackintosh found this view to be plausible.\nMore recent research attempting to identify genetic loci associated with individual-level differences in IQ has yielded promising results, which led the editorial board of \"Nature\" to issue a statement differentiating this research from the \"racist\" pseudoscience which it acknowledged has dogged intelligence research since its inception. It characterized the idea of genetically determined differences in intelligence between races as definitively false. Analysis of polygenic scores sampled from the 1000 Genomes Project has likewise found no evidence that intelligence was under diversifying selection in Africans and Europeans, suggesting that genetic differences cannot be a significant factor in the observed Black-White gap in average IQ test performance.\nHeritability within and between groups.\nTwin studies of intelligence have reported high heritability values. However, these studies have been criticized for being based on questionable assumptions. When used in the context of human behavior genetics, the term \"heritability\" can be misleading, as it does not necessarily convey information about the relative importance of genetic or environmental factors on the development of a given trait, nor does it convey the extent to which that trait is genetically determined. Arguments in support of a genetic explanation of racial differences in IQ are sometimes fallacious. For instance, hereditarians have sometimes cited the failure of known environmental factors to account for such differences, or the high heritability of intelligence within races, as evidence that racial differences in IQ are genetic.\nPsychometricians have found that intelligence is substantially heritable within populations, with 30\u201350% of variance in IQ scores in early childhood being attributable to genetic factors in analyzed US populations, increasing to 75\u201380% by late adolescence. In biology heritability is defined as the ratio of variation attributable to genetic differences in an observable trait to the trait's total observable variation. The heritability of a trait describes the proportion of variation in the trait that is attributable to genetic factors within a particular population. A heritability of 1 indicates that variation correlates fully with genetic variation and a heritability of 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the trait and genes at all. In psychological testing, heritability tends to be understood as the degree of correlation between the results of a test taker and those of their biological parents. However, since high heritability is simply a correlation between child and parents, it does not describe the causes of heritability which in humans can be either genetic or environmental.\nTherefore, a high heritability measure does not imply that a trait is genetic or unchangeable. In addition, environmental factors that affect all group members equally will not be measured by heritability, and the heritability of a trait may also change over time in response to changes in the distribution of genetic and environmental factors. High heritability does not imply that all of the heritability is genetically determined; rather, it can also be due to environmental differences that affect only a certain genetically defined group (indirect heritability).\nThe figure to the right demonstrates how heritability works. In each of the two gardens the difference between tall and short cornstalks is 100% heritable, as cornstalks that are genetically disposed for growing tall will become taller than those without this disposition. But the difference in height between the cornstalks to the left and those on the right is 100% environmental, as it is due to different nutrients being supplied to the two gardens. Hence, the causes of differences within a group and between groups may not be the same, even when looking at traits that are highly heritable.\nSpearman's hypothesis.\nSpearman's hypothesis states that the magnitude of the black\u2013white difference in tests of cognitive ability depends entirely or mainly on the extent to which a test measures general mental ability, or \"g\". The hypothesis was first formalized by Arthur Jensen, who devised the statistical \"method of correlated vectors\" to test it. If Spearman's hypothesis holds true, then the cognitive tasks that have the highest \"g\"-load are the tasks in which the gap between black and white test takers are greatest. Jensen and Rushton took this to show that the cause of \"g\" and the cause of the gap are the same\u2014in their view, genetic differences.\n acknowledges that Jensen and Rushton showed a modest correlation between \"g\"-loading, heritability, and the test score gap, but does not agree that this demonstrates a genetic origin of the gap. Mackintosh argues that it is exactly those tests that Rushton and Jensen consider to have the highest \"g\"-loading and heritability, such as the Wechsler test, that have seen the greatest increases in black performance due to the Flynn effect. This likely suggests that they are also the most sensitive to environmental changes, which undermines Jensen's argument that the black\u2013white gap is most likely caused by genetic factors. make the same point, noting also that the increase in the IQ scores of black test takers necessarily indicates an increase in \"g\".\nJames Flynn argued that his findings undermine Spearman's hypothesis. In a 2006 study, he and William Dickens found that between 1972 and 2002 \"The standard measure of the \"g\" gap between Blacks and Whites declined virtually in tandem with the IQ gap.\" Flynn also criticized Jensen's basic assumption that a correlation between \"g\"-loading and test score gap implies a genetic cause for the gap. In a 2014 suite of meta-analyses, along with co-authors Jan te Nijenhuis and Daniel Metzen, he showed that the same negative correlation between IQ gains and \"g\"-loading obtains for cognitive deficits of known environmental cause: iodine deficiency, prenatal cocaine exposure, fetal alcohol syndrome, and traumatic brain injury.\nAdoption studies.\nA number of IQ studies have been done on the effect of similar rearing conditions on children from different races. The hypothesis is that this can be determined by investigating whether black children adopted into white families demonstrated gains in IQ test scores relative to black children reared in black families. Depending on whether their test scores are more similar to their biological or adoptive families, that could be interpreted as supporting either a genetic or an environmental hypothesis. Critiques of such studies question whether the environment of black children\u2014even when raised in white families\u2014is truly comparable to the environment of white children. Several reviews of the adoption study literature have suggested that it is probably impossible to avoid confounding biological and environmental factors in this type of study. Another criticism by is that adoption studies on the whole tend to be carried out in a restricted set of environments, mostly in the medium-high SES range, where heritability is higher than in the low-SES range.\nThe Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study (1976) examined the IQ test scores of 122 adopted children and 143 nonadopted children reared by advantaged white families. The children were restudied ten years later. The study found higher IQ for white people compared to black people, both at age 7 and age 17. Acknowledging the existence of confounding factors, Scarr and Weinberg, the authors of the original study, did not consider that it provided support for either the hereditarian or environmentalist view.\nThree other studies lend support to environmental explanations of group IQ differences: \nFrydman and Lynn (1989) showed a mean IQ of 119 for Korean infants adopted by Belgian families. After correcting for the Flynn effect, the IQ of the adopted Korean children was still 10 points higher than that of the Belgian children.\nReviewing the evidence from adoption studies, Mackintosh finds that environmental and genetic variables remain confounded and considers evidence from adoption studies inconclusive, and fully compatible with a 100% environmental explanation. Similarly, Drew Thomas argues that race differences in IQ that appear in adoption studies are in fact an artifact of methodology, and that East Asian IQ advantages and black IQ disadvantages disappear when this is controlled for.\nRacial admixture studies.\nMost people have ancestry from different geographical regions. In particular, African Americans typically have ancestors from both Africa and Europe, with, on average, 20% of their genome inherited from European ancestors. If racial IQ gaps have a partially genetic basis, one might expect black people with a higher degree of European ancestry to score higher on IQ tests than black people with less European ancestry, because the genes inherited from European ancestors would likely include some genes with a positive effect on IQ. Geneticist Alan Templeton has argued that an experiment based on the Mendelian \"common garden\" design, where specimens with different hybrid compositions are subjected to the same environmental influences, are the only way to definitively show a causal relation between genes and group differences in IQ. Summarizing the findings of admixture studies, he concludes that they have shown no significant correlation between any cognitive ability and the degree of African or European ancestry.\nStudies have employed different ways of measuring or approximating relative degrees of ancestry from Africa and Europe. Some studies have used skin color as a measure, and others have used blood groups. surveys the literature and argues that the blood groups studies may be seen as providing some support to the genetic hypothesis, even though the correlation between ancestry and IQ was quite low. He finds that studies by , Willerman, Naylor &amp; Myrianthopoulos (1970) did not find a correlation between degree of African/European ancestry and IQ. The latter study did find a difference based on the race of the mother, with children of white mothers with black fathers scoring higher than children of black mothers and white fathers. Loehlin considers that such a finding is compatible with either a genetic or an environmental cause. All in all Loehlin finds admixture studies inconclusive and recommends more research.\nReviewing the evidence from admixture studies considers it to be inconclusive because of too many uncontrolled variables. quotes a statement by to the effect that admixture studies have not provided a shred of evidence in favor of a genetic basis for the IQ gap.\nMental chronometry.\nMental chronometry measures the elapsed time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response by the participant. These studies have shown inconsistent results when comparing black and white populations groups, with some studies showing whites outperforming blacks, and others showing blacks outperforming whites. \nArthur Jensen argued that this reaction time (RT) is a measure of the speed and efficiency with which the brain processes information, and that scores on most types of RT tasks tend to correlate with scores on standard IQ tests as well as with \"g\". Nisbett argues that some studies have found correlations closer to 0.2, and that a correlation is not always found. Nisbett points to the study in which a group of Chinese Americans had longer reaction times than a group of European Americans, despite having higher IQs. Nisbett also mentions findings in and suggesting that movement time (the measure of how long it takes a person to move a finger after making the decision to do so) correlates with IQ just as strongly as reaction time, and that average movement time is faster for black people than for white people. considers reaction time evidence unconvincing and comments that other cognitive tests that also correlate well with IQ show no disparity at all, for example the habituation/dishabituation test. He further comments that studies show that rhesus monkeys have shorter reaction times than American college students, suggesting that different reaction times may not tell us anything useful about intelligence.\nBrain size.\nA number of studies have reported a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group. Some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between racial groups, although this is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ as brain size also differs between men and women, but without significant differences in IQ. At the same time newborn black children have the same average brain size as white children, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in environment. Several environmental factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect black children.\nArchaeological data.\nArchaeological evidence does not support claims by Rushton and others that black people's cognitive ability was inferior to white people's during prehistoric times.\nPolicy relevance and ethics.\nThe ethics of research on race and intelligence has long been a subject of debate: in a 1996 report of the American Psychological Association; in guidelines proposed by Gray and Thompson and by Hunt and Carlson; and in two editorials in \"Nature\" in 2009 by Steven Rose and by Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams.\nSteven Rose maintains that the history of eugenics makes this field of research difficult to reconcile with current ethical standards for science.\nOn the other hand, James R. Flynn has argued that had there been a ban on research on possibly poorly conceived ideas, much valuable research on intelligence testing (including his own discovery of the Flynn effect) would not have occurred.\nMany have argued for increased interventions in order to close the gaps. Flynn writes that \"America will have to address all the aspects of black experience that are disadvantageous, beginning with the regeneration of inner city neighborhoods and their schools.\" Especially in developing nations, society has been urged to take on the prevention of cognitive impairment in children as a high priority. Possible preventable causes include malnutrition, infectious diseases such as meningitis, parasites, cerebral malaria, in utero drug and alcohol exposure, newborn asphyxia, low birth weight, head injuries, lead poisoning and endocrine disorders.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours or workload.\nMany people choose to retire when they are elderly or incapable of doing their job for health reasons. People may also retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits, although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or as a result of legislation concerning their positions. In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Previously, low life expectancy, lack of social security and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until their death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889.\nNowadays, most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, funded by employers or the state. However, only about 15% of private industry workers in the US had access to a traditional defined benefit pension plan as of March 2023.These plans, often called pensions, are increasingly rare, especially in the private sector, as most companies now offer defined contribution plans like 401(k)s instead. Public sector workers have much higher pension coverage, with about 75% participating in pension plans \nIn many poorer countries, there is no support for the elderly beyond that provided through the family. Today, retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies; hard ideological, social, cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right. In many Western countries, this is a right embodied in national constitutions.\nAn increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement, by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement.\nHistory.\nRetirement, or the practice of leaving one's job or ceasing to work after reaching a certain age, has been around since around the 18th century. Prior to the 18th century, humans had an average life expectancy between 26 and 40 years.\nIn consequence, only a small percentage of the population reached an age where physical impairments began to be obstacles to working. Countries began to adopt government policies on retirement during the late 19th century and the 20th century, beginning in Germany under Otto von Bismarck.\nRetirement age.\nA person may retire at whatever age they please. However, a country's tax laws or state old-age pension rules usually mean that in a given country a certain age is thought of as the standard retirement age. As life expectancy increases and more and more people live to an advanced age, in many countries the retirement age at which the public pension is awarded has been increased in the 21st century, often progressively.\nThe standard retirement age varies from country to country but it is generally between 50 and 70 (according to latest statistics, 2011). In some countries this age is different for men and women, although this has recently been challenged in some countries (e.g., Austria), and in some countries the ages are being brought into line. The table below shows the variation in eligibility ages for public old-age benefits in the United States and many European countries, according to the OECD.\n\"The retirement age in many countries is increasing, often starting in the 2010s and continuing until the late 2020s.\"\nNotes: Parentheses indicate eligibility age for women when different. Sources: Cols. 1\u20132: OECD Pensions at a Glance (2005), Cols. 3\u20136: Tabulations from HRS, ELSA and SHARE. Square brackets indicate early retirement for some public employees.\n1 In Denmark, early retirement is called \"efterl\u00f8n\" and there are some requirements to be met such as contributing to the labor market for at least 20 years. Early and normal retirement ages vary according to the date of birth of the person filing for retirement.\n2 In France, the retirement age was 60, with full pension entitlement at 65; in 2010 this was extended to 62 and 67 respectively, increasing progressively over the following eight years.\n3 In Latvia, the retirement age depends on the date of birth of the person filing for retirement.\n4 In Spain it was ruled that the retirement age was to increase from 65 to 67 progressively from 2013 to 2027.\n5 In the United States, while the normal retirement age for Social Security, or Old Age Survivors Insurance (OASI) was age 65 to receive unreduced benefits, it is gradually increasing to age 67 by 2027. Public servants are often not covered by Social Security but have their own pension programs. Police officers in the United States may typically retire at half pay after 20 years of service, or three-quarter pay after 30 years, allowing retirement from the early forties. Military members of the US Armed Forces may elect to retire after 20 years of active duty. (See also: military retirement pay and military pension.)\nIranian age of retirement was increased much in 2022 and 2023 to 42 years of work insurance payment record to avoid government social security bankruptcy.\nData sets.\nRecent advances in data collection have vastly improved the ability to understand important relationships between retirement and factors such as health, wealth, employment characteristics and family dynamics, among others. The most prominent study for examining retirement behavior in the United States is the ongoing Health and Retirement Study (HRS), first fielded in 1992. The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults in the U.S. ages 51+, conducted every two years, and contains a wealth of information on such topics as labor force participation (e.g., current employment, job history, retirement plans, industry/occupation, pensions, disability), health (e.g., health status and history, health and life insurance, cognition), financial variables (e.g., assets and income, housing, net worth, wills, consumption and savings), family characteristics (e.g., family structure, transfers, parent/child/grandchild/sibling information) and a host of other topics (e.g., expectations, expenses, internet use, risk taking, psychosocial, time use).\n2002 and 2004 saw the introductions of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which includes respondents from 14 continental European countries plus Israel. These surveys were closely modeled after the HRS in the sample frame, design and content. A number of other countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea) also now field HRS-like surveys, and others (e.g., China, India) are currently fielding pilot studies. These data sets have expanded the ability of researchers to examine questions about retirement behavior by adding a cross-national perspective.\nNotes: MHAS discontinued in 2003; ELSA numbers exclude institutionalized (nursing homes).

Retirement funding education is a big factor that affects the success of an individual's retirement experience. Social Security plays an important role because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security's trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual's retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people are much more likely to retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age \"a\" is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age \"a\"+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the Social Security earnings test or the tax system).\nGreater wealth tends to lead to earlier retirement since wealthier individuals can essentially \"purchase\" additional leisure. Generally, the effect of wealth on retirement is difficult to estimate empirically since observing greater wealth at older ages may be the result of increased saving over the working life in anticipation of earlier retirement. However, many economists have found creative ways to estimate wealth effects on retirement and typically find that they are small. For example, one paper exploits the receipt of an inheritance to measure the effect of wealth shocks on retirement using data from the HRS. The authors find that receiving an inheritance increases the probability of retiring earlier than expected by 4.4 percentage points, or 12 percent relative to the baseline retirement rate, over an eight-year period.\nA great deal of attention has surrounded how the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession are affecting retirement decisions, with the conventional wisdom saying that fewer people will retire since their savings have been depleted; however recent research suggests that the opposite may happen. Using data from the HRS, researchers examined trends in defined benefit (DB) vs. defined contribution (DC) pension plans and found that those nearing retirement had only limited exposure to the recent stock market decline and thus are not likely to substantially delay their retirement. At the same time, using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), another study estimates that mass layoffs are likely to lead to an increase in retirement almost 50% larger than the decrease brought about by the stock market crash, so that on net retirements are likely to increase in response to the crisis.\nMore information tells of how many who retire will continue to work, but not in the career they have had for the majority of their life. Job openings will increase in the next 5 years due to retirements of the baby boomer generation. The Over 50 population is actually the fastest growing labor groups in the US.\nA great deal of research has examined the effects of health status and health shocks on retirement. It is widely found that individuals in poor health generally retire earlier than those in better health. This does not necessarily imply that poor health status leads people to retire earlier, since in surveys retirees may be more likely to exaggerate their poor health status to justify their earlier decision to retire. This justification bias, however, is likely to be small. In general, declining health over time, as well as the onset of new health conditions, have been found to be positively related to earlier retirement. Health conditions that can cause someone to retire include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, joint diseases, and hyperlipidemia.\nMost people are married when they reach retirement age; thus, spouse's employment status may affect one's decision to retire. On average, husbands are three years older than their wives in the U.S., and spouses often coordinate their retirement decisions. Thus, men are more likely to retire if their wives are also retired than if they are still in the labor force, and vice versa.\nEU member states.\nResearchers analyzed factors affecting retirement decisions in EU member states:\nIncome for retirement.\nIncome after retirement can come from state pensions, occupational pensions, private savings and investments (private pension funds, owned housing), donations (e.g., by children), and social benefits. Pension plans can be categorized as funded or pay-as-you-go. \nProvision of pay-as-you-go state pensions for can be a significant drain on a government's budget, which can lead to pension underfunding.\nOlder people are more prone to sickness, and the cost of health care in retirement is large. Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for Medicare health cover at 65 years of age.\nFunded pension: size of lump sum required.\nIn case of funded pensions, to pay for pension, assumed for simplicity to be received at the end of each year, and taking discounted values in the manner of a net present value calculation, the ideal lump sum available at retirement should be:\n(1 \u2013 zprop ) R repl S {(1+ ireal ) \u22121+(1+ ireal ) \u22122 +... ...+ (1+ ireal ) \u2212p} = (1-zprop ) R repl S {(1 \u2013 (1+ireal)\u2212p )/ireal}\nAbove is the standard mathematical formula for the sum of a geometric series. (Or if ireal =0 then the series in braces sums to p since it then has p equal terms). As an example, assume that S=60,000 per year and that it is desired to replace Rrepl=0.80, or 80%, of pre-retirement living standard for p=30 years. Assume for current purposes that a proportion z prop=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved. Using ireal=0.02, or 2% per year real return on investments, the necessary lump sum is given by the formula as (1\u20130.25)*0.80*60,000*annuity-series-sum(30)=36,000*22.396=806,272 in the nation's currency in 2008\u20132010 terms. To allow for inflation in a straightforward way, it is best to talk of the 806,272 as being '13.43 years of retirement age salary'. It may be appropriate to regard this as being the necessary lump sum to fund 36,000 of annual supplements to any employer or government pensions that are available. It is common to not include any house value in the calculation of this necessary lump sum, so for a homeowner the lump sum pays primarily for non-housing living costs.\nAt retirement, the following amount will have been accumulated:\nzprop S {(1+ i rel to pay )w-1+(1+ i rel to pay )w-2 +... ...+ (1+ i rel to pay )+ 1 }\n\u00a0= zprop S ((1+i rel to pay)w- 1)/i rel to pay\nTo make the accumulation match with the lump sum needed to pay pension:\nzprop S (((1+i rel to pay )) w \u2013 1)/i rel to pay = (1-zprop ) R repl S (1 \u2013 ((1+i real)) \u2212p )/i real \nBring zprop to the left hand side to give the answer, under this rough and unguaranteed method, for the proportion of pay that should be saved:\nzprop = R repl (1 \u2013 ((1+i real )) \u2212p )/i real / [(((1+i rel to pay )) w \u2013 1)/i rel to pay + R repl (1 \u2013 ((1+i real )) \u2212p )/i real ] (Ret-03)\nNote that the special case i rel to pay =0 = i real means that the geometric series should be summed by noting that there are p or w identical terms and hence z prop = p/(w+p). This corresponds to the graph above with the straight line real-terms accumulation.\nSample results.\nThe result for the necessary zprop given by (Ret-03) depends critically on the assumptions made. As an example, one might assume that price inflation will be 3.5% per year forever and that one's pay will increase only at that same rate of 3.5%. If a 4.5% per year nominal rate of interest is assumed, then (using 1.045/1.035 in real terms) pre-retirement and post-retirement net interest rates will remain the same, irel to pay = 0.966 percent per year and ireal = 0.966 percent per year. These assumptions may be reasonable in view of the market returns available on inflation-indexed bonds, after expenses and any tax. Equation (Ret-03) is readily coded in Excel and with these assumptions gives the required savings rates in the accompanying picture.\nAnnuity.\nThe problem that the lifespan is not known in advance can be reduced by the purchase at retirement of an inflation-indexed life annuity. Inflation-adjusted annuities are designed to provide income that rises with inflation, helping retirees maintain purchasing power over time.\nCalculators.\nA useful and straightforward calculation can be done if it is assumed that interest, after expenses, taxes, and inflation is zero. Assume that in real (after-inflation) terms, one's salary never changes over \"w\" years of working life. During \"p\" years of pension, one has a living standard that costs a replacement ratio \"R\" times as much as one's living standard in working life. The working life living standard is one's salary minus the proportion of salary Z that should be saved. Calculations are per unit salary (e.g., assume salary = 1).\nThen after \"w\" years work, retirement age accumulated savings = \"wZ\". To pay for pension for \"p\" years, necessary savings at retirement = \"Rp(1-Z)\"\nEquate these: \"wZ\" = \"Rp\"(\"1-Z\") and solve to give \"Z\" = \"Rp\" / (\"w + Rp\"). For example, if \"w\" = 35, \"p\" = 30 and \"R\" = 0.65, a proportion \"Z\" = 35.78% should be saved.\nRetirement calculators generally accumulate a proportion of salary up to retirement age. This shows a straightforward case, which nonetheless could be practically useful for optimistic people hoping to work for only as long as they are likely to be retired.\nFor more complicated situations, there are several online retirement calculators on the Internet. Many retirement calculators project how much an investor needs to save, and for how long, to provide a certain level of retirement expenditures. Some retirement calculators, appropriate for safe investments, assume a constant, unvarying rate of return. Monte Carlo retirement calculators take volatility into account and project the probability that a particular plan of retirement savings, investments, and expenditures will outlast the retiree. Retirement calculators vary in the extent to which they take taxes, social security, pensions, and other sources of retirement income and expenditures into account.\nThe assumptions keyed into a retirement calculator are critical. One of the most important assumptions is the assumed rate of real (after inflation) investment return. A conservative return estimate could be based on the real yield of Inflation-indexed bonds offered by some governments, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The TIP$TER retirement calculator projects the retirement expenditures that a portfolio of inflation-linked bonds, coupled with other income sources like Social Security, would be able to sustain. Current real yields on United States Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are available at the US Treasury site. Current real yields on Canadian 'Real Return Bonds' are available at the Bank of Canada's site. As of December 2011, US Treasury inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) were yielding about 0.8% real per annum for the 30-year maturity and a noteworthy slightly negative real return for the 7-year maturity.\nMany individuals use \"retirement calculators\" on the Internet to determine the proportion of their pay they should be saving in a tax advantaged-plan (e.g., IRA or 401-K in the US, RRSP in Canada, personal pension in the UK, superannuation in Australia).\nAfter expenses and any taxes, a reasonable (though arguably pessimistic) long-term assumption for a safe real rate of return is zero. So in real terms, interest does not help the savings grow. Each year of work must pay its share of a year of retirement. For someone planning to work for 40 years and be retired for 20 years, each year of work pays for itself and for half a year of retirement. Hence, 33.33% of pay must be saved, and 66.67% can be spent when earned. After 40 years of saving 33.33% of pay, we have accumulated assets of 13.33 years of pay, as in the graph. In the graph to the right, the lines are straight, which is appropriate given the assumption of a zero real investment return.\nThe graph above can be compared with those generated by many retirement calculators. However, most retirement calculators use nominal (not \"real\" dollars) and therefore require a projection of both the expected inflation rate and the expected nominal rate of return. One way to work around this limitation is to, for example, enter \"0% return, 0% inflation\" inputs into the calculator. The Bloomberg retirement calculator gives the flexibility to specify, for example, zero inflation and zero investment return and to reproduce the graph above. The MSN retirement calculator in 2011 has as the defaults a realistic 3% per annum inflation rate and optimistic 8% return assumptions; consistency with the December 2011 US nominal bond and inflation-protected bond market rates requires a change to about 3% inflation and 4% investment return before and after retirement.\nIgnoring tax, someone wishing to work for a year and then relax for a year on the same living standard needs to save 50% of pay. Similarly, someone wishing to work from age 25 to 55 and be retired for 30 years till 85 needs to save 50% of pay if government and employment pensions are not a factor and if it is considered appropriate to assume a zero real investment return. \nA newer method for determining the adequacy of a retirement plan is Monte Carlo simulation. This method has been gaining popularity and is now employed by many financial planners. Monte Carlo retirement calculators allow users to enter savings, income and expense information and run simulations of retirement scenarios. The simulation results show the probability that the retirement plan will be successful.\nEarly retirement.\nRetirement is generally considered to be \"early\" if it occurs before the age (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources. Early retirees typically rely on their own savings and investments to be self-supporting, either indefinitely or until they begin receiving external support. Early retirement can also be used as a euphemistic term for being terminated from employment before typical retirement age.\nSavings needed.\nThe withdrawal rate from the portfolio depends on the remaining life expectancy.\nThose contemplating early retirement will want to know if they have enough to survive possible bear markets. The history of the US stock market shows that one would need to live on about 4% of the initial portfolio per year to ensure that the portfolio is not depleted before the end of the retirement; this rule of thumb is a summary of one conclusion of the Trinity study, though the report is more nuanced and the conclusions and very approach have been heavily criticized (see Trinity study for details). This allows for increasing the withdrawals with inflation to maintain a consistent spending ability throughout the retirement, and to continue making withdrawals even in dramatic and prolonged bear markets. (The 4% figure does not assume any pension or change in spending levels throughout the retirement.)\nWhen retiring prior to age &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442, there is a 10% IRS penalty on withdrawals from a retirement plan such as a 401(k) plan or a Traditional IRA. Exceptions apply under certain circumstances. At age 59 and six months, the penalty-free status is achieved and the 10% IRS penalty no longer applies.\nTo avoid the 10% penalty prior to age &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442, a person should consult a lawyer about the use of IRS rule 72 T. This rule must be applied for with the IRS. It allows the distribution of an IRA account prior to age &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442 in equal amounts of a period of either 5 years or until the age of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442, whichever is the longest time period, without a 10% penalty. Taxes still must be paid on the distributions.\nCalculations using actual numbers.\nAlthough the 4% initial portfolio withdrawal rate described above can be used as a rough gauge, it is often desirable to use a retirement planning tool that accepts detailed input and can render a result that has more precision. Some of these tools model only the retirement phase of the plan while others can model both the savings or accumulation phase as well as the retirement phase of the plan. For example, an analysis by \"Forbes\" reckoned that in 90% of historical markets, a 4% rate would have lasted for at least 30 years, while in 50% of the historical markets, a 4% rate would have been sustained for more than 40 years.\nThe effects of making inflation-adjusted withdrawals from a given starting portfolio can be modeled with a downloadable spreadsheet that uses historical stock market data to estimate likely portfolio returns. Another approach is to employ a retirement calculator that also uses historical stock market modeling, but adds provisions for incorporating pensions, other retirement income, and changes in spending that may occur during the course of the retirement.\nLife after retirement.\nRetirement might coincide with important life changes; a retired worker might move to a new location, for example a retirement community (Kamal et al., 2024), thereby having less frequent contact with their previous social context and adopting a new lifestyle. Often retirees volunteer for charities and other community organizations. Tourism is a common marker of retirement and for some becomes a way of life, such as for so-called grey nomads. Some retired people even choose to go and live in warmer climates in what is known as retirement migration.\nIt has been found that Americans have six lifestyle choices as they age: continuing to work full-time, continuing to work part-time, retiring from work and becoming engaged in a variety of leisure activities, retiring from work and becoming involved in a variety of recreational and leisure activities, retiring from work and later returning to work part-time, and retiring from work and later returning to work full-time. An important note to make from these lifestyle definitions are that four of the six involve working. America is facing an important demographic change in that the Baby Boomer generation is now reaching retirement age. This poses two challenges: whether there will be a sufficient number of skilled workers in the work force, and whether the current pension programs will be sufficient to support the growing number of retired people. The reasons that some people choose to never retire, or to return to work after retiring include not only the difficulty of planning for retirement but also wages and fringe benefits, expenditure of physical and mental energy, production of goods and services, social interaction, and social status may interact to influence an individual's work force participation decision.\nOften retirees are called upon to care for grandchildren and occasionally aged parents. For many it gives them more time to devote to a hobby or sport such as golf or sailing.\nOn the other hand, many retirees feel restless and suffer from depression as a result of their new situation. The newly retired are one of the most vulnerable social groups to become depressed most likely due to retirement coinciding with a deteriorating health status and increased care-giving responsibilities. Retirement coincides with deterioration of one's health that correlates with increasing age and this likely plays a major role in increased rates of depression in retirees. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that healthy elderly and retired people are as happy or happier and have an equal quality of life as they age as compared to younger employed adults, therefore retirement in and of itself is not likely to contribute to development of depression. Research around what retirees would ideally like to have a fulfilling life after retiring, found the most important factors were \"physical comfort, social integration, contribution, security, autonomy and enjoyment\".\nMany people in the later years of their lives, due to failing health, require assistance, sometimes in extremely expensive treatments \u2013 in some countries \u2013 being provided in a nursing home. Those who need care, but are not in need of constant assistance, may choose to live in a retirement home.\nResearch models.\nThere are range of research models through which psychologists and other researchers attempt to understand retirement. These include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike the KC-135, which is recognized by Boeing as the Model 717, most of the current RC-135 fleet, with the exception of the RAF's RC-135Ws, is internally designated as the Model 739 by the company. Many variants have been modified numerous times, resulting in a large variety of designations, configurations, and program names.\nDesign and development.\nIn 1962, the first RC-135 variant, the RC-135A, was ordered by the United States Air Force to replace the Boeing RB-50 Superfortress. Originally nine were ordered but this was later reduced to four. Boeing allocated the variant the designation \"Boeing 739-700\" but they were a modified variant of the KC-135A then in production. They used the same Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojet engines as the tanker and carried cameras in a bay just aft of the nose wheel well where the forward fuel tank was normally located. They had no in-flight refueling system and they were used for photographic and surveying tasks. Although the RC-135A was the first designation in the RC-135 family, it was not the first RC-135 in service. That distinction belongs to the RC-135S, which began operational reconnaissance missions in 1961, followed by the RC-135D in 1962.\nThe next variant ordered was the RC-135B, to be used as an electronic intelligence aircraft to replace the Boeing RB-47H Stratojet, a SIGINT platform. Unlike the earlier variants, the RC-135Bs had Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33 turbofans rather than the older J57s. These ten aircraft were delivered directly to Martin Aircraft beginning in 1965 for installation of their operational electronics suite. By 1967, they emerged as RC-135Cs and all entered service that year. The refueling boom was not fitted and the boom operator station was used as a camera bay for a KA-59 camera. Externally, the aircraft were distinguished by the large cheek antenna fairings on the forward fuselage.\nThe RC-135Bs were the last of the new aircraft built. All further reconnaissance variants that followed were modified aircraft, either from earlier RC-135 variants or from tankers and transports.\nIn 2005, the RC-135 fleet completed a series of significant airframe, navigation and powerplant upgrades, which include re-engining from the TF33 to the CFM International CFM-56 (F108) engines used on the KC-135R and T Stratotanker, and an upgrade of the flight deck instrumentation and navigation systems to the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) standard. The AMP standard includes conversion from analog readouts to a digital glass cockpit configuration.\nOperational history.\nThe current RC-135 fleet is the latest iteration of modifications to this pool of aircraft dating back to the early 1960s. Initially employed by Strategic Air Command for reconnaissance, the RC-135 fleet has participated in every armed conflict involving U.S. forces during its tenure. RC-135s supported operations in Vietnam War, the Mediterranean for Operation El Dorado Canyon, Grenada for Operation Urgent Fury, Panama for Operation Just Cause, the Balkans for Operations Deliberate Force and Allied Force, and Southwest Asia for Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. RC-135s have maintained a constant presence in Southwest Asia since the early 1990s. They were stalwarts of Cold War operations, with missions flown around the periphery of the USSR and its client states in Europe and around the world.\nOriginally, all RC-135s were operated by Strategic Air Command. Since 1992, they have been assigned to Air Combat Command. The RC-135 fleet is permanently based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska and operated by the 55th Wing, using forward operating locations worldwide.\nOn 9 August 2010, the Rivet Joint program recognized its 20th anniversary of continuous service in Central Command, dating back to the beginning of Desert Shield. This represents the longest unbroken presence of any aircraft in the Air Force inventory. During this time it has flown over 8,000 combat missions supporting air and ground forces of Operations Desert Storm, Desert Shield, Northern Watch, Southern Watch, Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.\nIn March 2010 the British Ministry of Defence announced that it reached an agreement with the US Government to purchase three RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft to replace the Nimrod R1, which was retired in June 2011. The aircraft, to be styled as 'Airseeker', were scheduled to be delivered by 2017 at a total cost of around \u00a3650 million, including provision of ground infrastructure, training of personnel and ground supporting systems. In 2013, the UK government confirmed that crews from the RAF's 51 Squadron had been training and operating alongside their USAF colleagues since 2011, having achieved in excess of 32,000 flying hours and 1,800 sorties as part of the 55th Wing at Offutt AFB.\nThe RAF received the first RC-135W in September 2013, which was deployed from July 2014 to support coalition action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants in Iraq. The second aircraft was delivered seven months ahead of schedule in September 2015, with over sixty improvements incorporated ranging from upgrades to the aircraft's mission systems to engine improvements providing increased fuel efficiency and durability. In due course, the first aircraft will receive the same upgrades. The aircraft will be air-to-air refuelled in service by USAF tankers based in Europe, as the UK does not operate boom-equipped refueling aircraft, and has no plans to adapt drogue-equipped aircraft.\nU.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force RC-135W Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft were deployed numerous times to conduct reconnaissance missions around Poland and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad during the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Stated objectives include broadcasting a clear signal that the US, and thus NATO, is aware of Russian movements in the area of operations.\nVariants.\nKC-135A Reconnaissance Platforms.\nAt least four KC-135A tankers were converted into makeshift reconnaissance platforms with no change of Mission Design Series (MDS) designation. KC-135As 55\u20133121, 55\u20133127, 59\u20131465, and 59-1514 were modified beginning in 1961. That year the Soviet Union announced its intention to detonate a 100 megaton thermonuclear device on Novaya Zemlya, the so-called Tsar Bomba. A testbed KC-135A (55\u20133127) was modified under the Big Safari program to the SPEED LIGHT BRAVO configuration in order to obtain intelligence information on the test. The success of the mission prompted conversion of additional aircraft for intelligence gathering duties.\nKC-135R Rivet Stand / Rivet Quick.\nNot to be confused with the CFM F108-powered KC-135R tanker, the KC-135R MDS was applied in 1963 to the three KC-135A reconnaissance aircraft under the Rivet Stand program. The three aircraft were 55\u20133121, 59\u20131465, and 59\u20131514. A fourth, serial no. 58\u20130126, was converted in 1969 to replace 1465, which crashed in 1967. Externally the aircraft had varied configurations throughout their careers, but generally they were distinguished by five \"towel bar\" antennas along the spine of the upper fuselage and a radome below the forward fuselage.\nThe first three aircraft retained the standard tanker nose radome, while 58-0126 was fitted with the 'hog nose' radome commonly associated with an RC-135. A trapeze-like structure in place of the refueling boom which was used to trail an aerodynamic shape housing a specialized receiver array, colloquially known as a \"blivet\", on a wire was installed. This was reported to be used for \"Briar Patch\" and \"Combat Lion\" missions. There were four small optically flat windows on each side of the forward fuselage.\nOn some missions, a small wing-like structure housing sensors was fitted to each side of the forward fuselage, with a diagonal brace below it. With the loss of 59\u20131465, KC-135A 58-0126 was modified to this standard under the Rivet Quick operational name. All four aircraft were lost in accidents or converted to KC-135R tanker configurations. They are among the few KC-135 tankers equipped with an aerial refueling receptacle above the cockpit, a remnant of their service as intelligence gathering platforms.\nKC-135T Cobra Jaw.\nIn 1969, KC-135R 55-3121 was modified by Lockheed Air Services to the unique KC-135T configuration, under the Cobra Jaw program name. Externally distinguished by the 'hog nose' radome, the aircraft featured spinning \"fang\" receiver antennas below the nose radome, a large blade antenna above the forward fuselage, a single 'towel bar' antenna on the spine, teardrop antennas forward of the horizontal stabilizers on each side, and the trapeze-like structure in place of the refueling boom. The aircraft briefly carried nose art consisting of the Ford Cobra Jet cartoon cobra. It was later modified into an RC-135T Rivet Dandy.\nRC-135A.\nFour RC-135As (63-8058 to 8061) were photo mapping platforms used briefly by the Air Photographic &amp; Charting Service, based at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia and later at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas as part of the 1370th Photographic Mapping Wing. The mission was soon assumed by satellites, and the RC-135As were de-modified and used in various other roles, such as staff transport and crew training.\nIn the early 1980s they were converted to tankers, with the designation KC-135D, of the same basic configuration as the KC-135A and later E, plus some remaining special mission equipment. Due to delays in reinstalling their original equipment, the RC-135As were the last of the entire C-135 series delivered to the USAF. The Boeing model number for the RC-135A is 739-700.\nRC-135B.\nThe as-delivered version of the RC-135. The RC-135B was never used operationally, as it had no mission equipment installed by Boeing. The entire RC-135B production run of ten aircraft was delivered directly to Martin Aircraft in Baltimore, Maryland for modification and installation of mission equipment under the Big Safari program. Upon completion, the RC-135Bs were re-designated RC-135C. The Boeing model number for the RC-135B is 739-445B.\nRC-135C Big Team.\nModified and re-designated RC-135B aircraft used for strategic reconnaissance duties, equipped with the AN/ASD-1 electronic intelligence (ELINT) system. This system was characterized by the large 'cheek' pods on the forward fuselage containing the Automated ELINT Emitter Locating System (AEELS\u00a0\u2013 not Side Looking Airborne Radar\u00a0\u2013 SLAR, as often quoted), as well as numerous other antennae and a camera position in the refuelling pod area of the aft fuselage. The aircraft was crewed by two pilots, two navigators, numerous intelligence gathering specialists, inflight maintenance technicians and airborne linguists. When the RC-135C was fully deployed, SAC was able to retire its fleet of RB-47H Stratojets from active reconnaissance duties. All ten continue in active service as either RC-135V Rivet Joint or RC-135U Combat Sent platforms.\nRC-135D Office Boy / Rivet Brass.\nThe RC-135Ds, originally designated KC-135A-II, were the first reconnaissance configured C-135s given the \"R\" MDS prefix designation, although they were not the first reconnaissance-tasked members of the C-135 family. In 1962, they were delivered to Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska as part of the Office Boy Project. Serial numbers were 60\u20130356, 60\u20130357, and 60\u20130362. In 1963, the aircraft began operational missions. These three aircraft were ordered as KC-135A tankers, but delivered without refueling booms, and known as \"falsie C-135As\" pending the delivery of the first actual C-135A cargo aircraft in 1961.\nThe primary Rivet Brass mission flew along the northern border of the Soviet Union, often as a shuttle mission between Eielson and RAF Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, and later RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, UK. The RC-135D was also used in Southeast Asia during periods when the RC-135M (see below) was unavailable. In the late 1970s, with the expansion of the RC-135 fleet powered by TF33 turbofan engines, the RC-135Ds were converted into tankers, and remain in service as receiver-capable KC-135Rs.\nRC-135E Lisa Ann / Rivet Amber.\nOriginally designated C-135B-II, project name Lisa Ann, the RC-135E Rivet Amber was a one-of-a-kind aircraft, equipped with a large 7 MW Hughes Aircraft phased-array radar system. Originally delivered as a C-135B, 62-4137 operated from Shemya Air Force Station, Alaska from 1966 to 1969. Its operations were performed in concert with the RC-135S Rivet Ball aircraft (see below). The radar system alone weighed over 35,000 pounds and cost over US$35 million (1960 dollars), making Rivet Amber both the heaviest C-135 derivative aircraft flying and the most expensive Air Force aircraft for its time. This prevented the forward and aft crew areas from having direct contact after boarding the aircraft.\nThe system could track an object the size of a soccer ball from a distance of . Its mission was to monitor Soviet ballistic missile testing in the reentry phase. The power requirement for the phased array radar was enormous, necessitating an additional power supply. This took the form of a podded Lycoming T55-L5 turboshaft engine in a pod under the left inboard wing section, driving a 350\u00a0kVA generator, dedicated to powering mission equipment.\nOn the opposite wing, in the same location, was a podded heat exchanger to permit cooling of the massive electronic components on board the aircraft. This configuration has led to the mistaken impression that the aircraft had six engines. On 5 June 1969, Rivet Amber was lost at sea on a ferry flight from Shemya to Eielson AFB for maintenance. No trace of the aircraft or its crew was ever found.\nRC-135M Rivet Card.\nThe RC-135M was an interim type, with more limited ELINT capability than the RC-135C, but with extensive additional COMINT capability. They were converted from Military Airlift Command C-135B transports, and operated by the 82d Reconnaissance Squadron during the Vietnam War from Kadena Air Base, gathering signals intelligence over the Gulf of Tonkin and Laos with the program name Combat Apple, originally Burning Candy. There were six RC-135M aircraft, 62\u20134131, 62\u20134132, 62\u20134134, 62\u20134135, 62\u20134138 and 62\u20134139. All were later modified to and continue in active service as RC-135W Rivet Joints by the early 1980s.\nRC-135S Nancy Rae / Wanda Belle / Rivet Ball.\nRivet Ball was the predecessor program to Cobra Ball and was initiated with a single RC-135S (serial 59\u20131491, formerly a JKC-135A) on 31 December 1961. The aircraft first operated under the Nancy Rae project as an asset of Air Force Systems Command, and later as an RC-135S reconnaissance platform with Strategic Air Command under project Wanda Belle. The name Rivet Ball was assigned in January 1967. The aircraft operated from Shemya AFB, Alaska. Along with most other RC-135 variants, the RC-135S had an elongated nose radome, housing an S band receiving antenna.\nThe aircraft had ten large optically flat quartz windows for tracking cameras on the right side of the fuselage. Unlike any other RC-135S, Rivet Ball had a plexiglass dome mounted top-center on its fuselage for the Manual Tracker position. It obtained the first photographic documentation of Soviet Multiple Reentry vehicle (MRV) testing on 4 October 1968. On 13 January 1969, Rivet Ball was destroyed when it overran the runway when landing at Shemya, with no fatalities.\nRC-135S Cobra Ball.\nThe RC-135S Cobra Ball is a measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) collector equipped with special electro-optical instruments such an All Weather Tracking Radar and Medium Wave Infrared Array (MIRA) designed to observe ballistic missile flights at long range. The Cobra Ball monitors missile-associated signals and tracks missiles during boost and re-entry phases to provide reconnaissance for treaty verification and theater ballistic missile proliferation. The aircraft are extensively modified C-135Bs. The right wing and engines are traditionally painted black to reduce sun glare for tracking cameras.\nThere are three aircraft in service, assigned to the 55th Wing, 45th Reconnaissance Squadron based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Cobra Ball aircraft were originally assigned to Shemya and used to observe ballistic missile tests on the Kamchatka peninsula in conjunction with Cobra Dane and Cobra Judy. In 1969, two aircraft were converted for Cobra Ball. Following the loss of an aircraft in 1981, another aircraft was converted in 1983. In 1995, the sole RC-135X was converted into an RC-135S to supplement the other aircraft.\nRC-135T Rivet Dandy.\nIn 1971, KC-135T 55-3121 was modified to a RC-135T Rivet Dandy configuration. It was used to supplement the RC-135C/D/M fleet, then in short supply due to ongoing upgrades requiring airframes to be out of service. It operated under the Burning Candy operational order. In 1973, the aircraft's SIGINT gear was removed and transferred to KC-135R 58\u20130126, resulting in 55-3121 assuming the role of trainer, a role which it fulfilled for the remainder of its operational existence. Externally the aircraft retained the 'hog nose' radome and some other external modifications. The aerial refueling boom and trapeze below the tail were removed, and it had no operational reconnaissance role.\nIn this configuration, it operated variously with the 376th Strategic Wing at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, the 305th AREFW at Grissom AFB, Indiana, and the 6th Strategic Wing at Eielson AFB, Alaska. In 1982, the aircraft was modified with Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33-PW102 engines and other modifications common to the KC-135E tanker program, and returned to Eielson AFB. It crashed while on approach to Valdez Airport, Alaska on 25 February 1985 with the loss of three crew members. The wreckage was found in August 1985, six months after the accident.\nRC-135U Combat Sent.\nThe RC-135U Combat Sent is designed to collect technical intelligence on adversary radar emitter systems. Combat Sent data is collected to develop new or upgraded radar warning receivers, radar jammers, decoys, anti-radiation missiles, and training simulators.\nA\nDistinctly identified by the antenna arrays on the fuselage chin, tailcone, and wing tips, three RC-135C aircraft were converted to RC-135U (63-9792, 64\u201314847, &amp; 64\u201314849) in the early 1970s. In 1978, 63-9792 was converted into a Rivet Joint. All aircraft remain in service based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Minimum crew requirements are 2 pilots, 2 navigators, 3 systems engineers, 10 electronic warfare officers, and 6 area specialists.\nRC-135V/W Rivet Joint.\nThe RC-135V/W is the USAF's standard airborne SIGINT platform. Missions flown by the RC-135s are designated either Burning Wind or Misty Wind. Its sensor suite allows the mission crew to detect, identify and geolocate signals throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. The mission crew can then forward gathered information in a variety of formats to a wide range of consumers via Rivet Joint's extensive communications suite. The crew consists of the cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators, and airborne systems maintenance personnel. All Rivet Joint airframe and mission systems modifications are performed by L-3 Communications in Greenville, Texas, under the oversight of the Air Force Materiel Command.\nAll RC-135s are assigned to the 55th Wing, Air Combat Command at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. The wing uses various forward deployment locations worldwide. They have flown from Eielson AFB, Alaska; Howard AB, Panama; Hellenikon Air Base, Greece; Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan; and RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, and RAF Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, in the United Kingdom.\nFor many years, the RC-135V/W could be identified by the four large disc-capped Multiple Communications Emitter Location System (MUCELS) antennas forward, four somewhat smaller blade antennae aft and myriad of smaller underside antennas. Baseline 8 Rivet Joints, in the 2000s, introduced the first major change to the external RC-135V/W configuration, replacing the MUCELS antennas with plain blade antennas. The configuration of smaller underside antennas was also changed significantly.\nRC-135W Rivet Joint (Project Airseeker).\nThe United Kingdom bought three KC-135R aircraft for conversion to RC-135W Rivet Joint standard under the Airseeker project. Acquisition of the three aircraft was budgeted at \u00a3634m, with entry into service in October 2014. The aircraft formed No. 51 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Waddington along with the RAF's other ISTAR assets. They are expected to remain in service until 2045.\nPreviously, the Royal Air Force had gathered signals intelligence with three Nimrod R1 aircraft. When the time came to upgrade the maritime Nimrods to MRA4 standard, Project Helix was launched in August 2003 to study options for extending the life of the R1 to 2025. In 2008, the option of switching to Rivet Joint was added to Helix, and the retirement of the R1 became inevitable when the MRA4 was cancelled under the UK's 2010 defence review. The R1's involvement over Libya in Operation Ellamy delayed its retirement until June 2011.\nHelix became Project Airseeker, under which three KC-135R airframes were converted to the RC-135W standard by L-3 Communications. L-3 provides ongoing maintenance and upgrades under a long-term agreement. The three airframes are former United States Air Force KC-135Rs, all of which first flew in 1964 and were modified to the latest RC-135W standard before delivery. These three airframes were the youngest KC-135s in the USAF fleet. As of September 2010 the aircraft had approximately 23,200 flying hours, 22,200 hours and 23,200 hours.\nIn January 2011, 51 Sqn personnel began training at Offutt for conversion to the RC-135. The first RC-135W (ZZ664) was delivered ahead of schedule to the Royal Air Force on 12 November 2013, for final approval and testing by the Defence Equipment and Support team prior to its release to service from the UK MAA. The second (ZZ665) was delivered in September 2015 and the third (ZZ666) in June 2017. The latter entered operational service in December 2017.\nRC-135X Cobra Eye.\nThe sole RC-135X Cobra Eye was converted during the mid-to-late-1980s from a C-135B Telemetry/Range Instrumented Aircraft, serial number 62\u20134128, with the mission of tracking ICBM reentry vehicles. In 1993, it was converted into an additional RC-135S Cobra Ball.\nTC-135.\nThree aircraft are in service for crew training, and lack fully functional mission equipment. One TC-135S (62\u20134133) provides training capability for the Cobra Ball mission, and is distinguishable from combat-ready aircraft by the lack of cheeks on the forward fuselage. It was converted from an EC-135B in 1985 following the crash of the former RC-135T 55\u20133121, which had been used as a trainer up to that point. Two TC-135Ws (62-4127 and 4129) serve as training aircraft, primarily for the Rivet Joint mission, but can provide some training capability for RC-135U Combat Sent crews.

With a career of several commercially successful works, beginning with \"Urusei Yatsura\" in 1978, she is one of Japan's best-known and wealthiest manga artists. Her works are known worldwide, where they have been translated into a variety of languages, with over 230\u00a0million copies in circulation; making Takahashi one of the best-selling authors of all time. She has won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice, once in 1980 for \"Urusei Yatsura\" and again in 2001 for \"Inuyasha\", and the Seiun Award twice, once in 1987 for \"Urusei Yatsura\" and again in 1989 for \"Mermaid Saga\". She also received the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoul\u00eame in 2019, becoming the second woman and second Japanese to win the prize. In 2020, the Japanese government awarded Takahashi the Medal with Purple Ribbon for her contributions to the arts.\nCareer.\nTakahashi was born in Niigata, Japan. Although she showed little interest in manga as a child, she was said to occasionally doodle in the margins of her papers while attending Niigata Ch\u016b\u014d High School. She co-founded a manga club at high school together with Y\u014dko Kond\u014d, who also became a manga artist. Takahashi's interest in drawing manga herself did not start until later. In an interview in 2000, Takahashi said that she had always wanted to become a professional comic author since she was a child.\nInitial works.\nDuring her university years, Takahashi enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, author of \"Crying Freeman\" and \"Lone Wolf and Cub\". Under his guidance, Takahashi began to publish her first \"d\u014djinshi\" creations in 1975, such as \"Bye-Bye Road\" and \"Star of Futile Dust\". Koike often urged his students to create well-thought out, interesting characters, and this influence would greatly impact Takahashi's works throughout her career. Takahashi worked as an assistant for horror manga artist and \"Makoto-chan\" series creator Kazuo Umezu.\n\"Katte na Yatsura\" and \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\".\nTakahashi's professional career began in 1978. Her first published work was the one-shot \"Katte na Yatsura\" (\"Those Selfish Aliens\"), which garnered her an honorable mention at that year's Shogakukan New Comics Contest. Later that same year, she began her first serialized story in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\"; \"Urusei Yatsura\", a comedic science fiction story. Takahashi initially had difficulty meeting deadlines, so chapters were published sporadically until 1980. During the run of the series, she shared a small apartment with two assistants, and often slept in a closet due to a lack of space. During the same year, Takahashi published \"Time Warp Trouble\", \"Shake Your Buddha\", and the \"Golden Gods of Poverty\" in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" magazine, a publication which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years.\nRomantic comedies and short stories.\nIn 1980, Takahashi started her second major series, \"Maison Ikkoku\", in \"Big Comic Spirits\" magazine, which had an older target audience than her previous work. Because of the influence of the New Wave movement of manga in the late 1970s, \"seinen\" manga, or comics marketed toward young men, became more open to including \"sh\u014djo\" manga aesthetics, or the aesthetics of comics marketed toward young women, and to hiring female manga artists. \"Maison Ikkoku\" is a romantic comedy, and Takahashi used her own experience living in an apartment complex to create the series. Takahashi managed to work on the series on and off simultaneously with \"Urusei Yatsura\". She concluded both series in 1987, with \"Urusei Yatsura\" ending at 34 volumes, and \"Maison Ikkoku\" at 15.\nDuring the 1980s, Takahashi became a prolific writer of short story manga. Her stories \"Laughing Target\", \"Maris the Chojo\", and \"Fire Tripper\" were all adapted into original video animations (OVAs). In 1984, during the writing of \"Urusei Yatsura\" and \"Maison Ikkoku,\" Takahashi began a series published sporadically in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" called \"Mermaid Saga\" which ran for 10 years, until 1994. The series was partially released in two wide-ban volumes, with the complete story released as a set of \"shinsoban\", or special edition, in 2003.\nAnother short work of Takahashi's to be published sporadically was \"One-Pound Gospel\". Takahashi concluded the series in 2007 after publishing chapters in 1998, 2001, and 2006. One-Pound Gospel was adapted into a live-action TV drama.\nOther works.\nIn 1987, Takahashi began her third major series, \"Ranma \u00bd \". Following the late 1980s and early 1990s trend of \"sh\u014dnen\" martial arts manga, \"Ranma \u00bd\" features a gender-bending twist. The series continued for nearly a decade until 1996, when it ended at 38 volumes. \"Ranma \u00bd\" and its anime adaptation are cited as some of the first of their mediums to have become popular in the United States.\nDuring the latter half of the 1990s, Rumiko Takahashi continued with short stories and her installments of \"Mermaid Saga\" and \"One-Pound Gospel\" until beginning her fourth major work, \"Inuyasha\". Unlike the majority of her works, \"Inuyasha\" has a darker tone more akin to \"Mermaid Saga\" and, having been serialized in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" from 1996 to 2008, is her longest to date. On March 5, 2009, Rumiko Takahashi released her one-shot \"Unmei No Tori\". On March 16, 2009, she collaborated with Mitsuru Adachi, creator of \"Touch\" and \"Cross Game\", to release a one-shot called \"My Sweet Sunday\". Her next manga series, \"Ky\u014dkai no Rinne\" started on April 22, 2009. This was Rumiko Takahashi's first new manga series since her previous manga series \"Inuyasha\" ended in June 2008. She concluded it on December 13, 2017, with a total of 398 chapters, collected in 40 volumes.\n\"Urusei Yatsura\", \"Maison Ikkoku\", \"Ranma \u00bd\", \"Inuyasha\", and \"RIN-NE\" are all published in English in the United States by Viz Comics. The 1989 re-release of \"Urusei Yatsura\" was halted after only a few volumes were translated, but a reprint in a 2-in-1 omnibus format began in 2019 .\nRumiko Takahashi started a new manga series entitled \"Mao\" in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" issue #23 released on May 8, 2019.\nAnimation.\nIn 1981, \"Urusei Yatsura\" became the first of Takahashi's works to be animated. This series first aired on Japanese television on October 14, and went through multiple director changes during its run. Though the 195-episode TV series ended in March 1986, \"Urusei Yatsura\" was kept alive in anime form through OVA and movie releases through 1991. Most notable of the series directors was Mamoru Oshii, who made \"Beautiful Dreamer\", the second \"Urusei Yatsura\" movie. AnimEigo has released the entire TV series and all of the OVAs and movies except for \"Beautiful Dreamer\" (which was released by Central Park Media in the U.S.) in the United States in English-subtitled format, with English dubs also made for the first two TV episodes (as \"Those Obnoxious Aliens\") and for all of the movies.\nKitty Films.\nContinued cooperation of Kitty Films, Studio Pierrot, and Studio Deen in 1986 led to the adaptation of Rumiko Takahashi's second work, \"Maison Ikkoku,\" which debuted the week after the final TV episode of \"Urusei Yatsura\". The TV series ran for 96 episodes, 3 OVAs, a movie and also a live-action movie.\nOVAs produced in the mid-80s:\nOVAs produced in the early 90s:\nAll listed titles were eventually subtitled in English and released in the United States. Viz Communications has released the anime of \"Maison Ikkoku\", \"Ranma\" and \"Inuyasha\" in English, in both subtitled and dubbed formats. Studio Deen also provided animation duties on \"Maison Ikkoku\" and \"Ranma\".\n\"Ranma \u00bd\" was the last major series produced by Kitty Films. The series was never concluded in animated form despite being 161 episodes and having two movies. Kitty Films discontinued work on the series due to turmoil in the company, and was continued by Studio Deen until 1996.\nAfter Kitty Films, Sunrise was the first studio to adapt a major Rumiko Takahashi series. From 2000 to 2004, \"Inuyasha\" ran for 167 episodes and spawned four major films. The first anime ended before the manga did, thus wrapping up inconclusively. A second Inuyasha series in 2009, \"\", ran until March 2010 in order to officially conclude the story.\n2008 special exhibit.\n2008 marked the 50th anniversary of \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday\" and the 30th anniversary of the first publication of \"Urusei Yatsura\". Rumiko Takahashi's manga work was honoured in \"It's a Rumic World\", a special exhibition held from July 30 to August 11 at the Matsuya Ginza department store in Tokyo.\nThe exhibit included a new half-hour \"Ranma \u00bd\" and \"Inuyasha\" OVAs and an introductory sequence featuring characters from \"Urusei Yatsura\", \"Ranma\" and \"Inuyasha\" (starring the characters' original anime voice talents).\n\"It's a Rumic World\" was scheduled to re-open in Sendai in December 2008, at which time a new half-hour \"Urusei Yatsura\" OVA was scheduled to premiere. A special DVD release containing all three new OVAs was announced as coming out on January 29, 2010, with a trailer posted in September 2009. However, it is not known whether any of the new episodes will ever be released outside Japan.\n\"Rumiko Takahashi Anthology\", animated by TMS Entertainment adapts many of her short stories from the 80s. It features her stories \"The Tragedy of P\", \"The Merchant of Romance\", \"Middle-Aged Teen\", \"Hidden in the Pottery\", \"Aberrant Family F\", \"As Long As You Are Here\", \"One Hundred Years of Love\", \"In Lieu of Thanks\", \"Living Room Lovesong\", \"House of Garbage\", \"One Day Dream\", \"Extra-Large Size Happiness\", and \"The Executive's Dog\". Also, a TV series of \"Mermaid Saga\" was produced in 2003, animating 8 of her stories.\nLegacy and impact in the West.\nMany of Takahashi's works have been translated into English, as well as other European languages. Takahashi has said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi told Viz Media in a March 2000 interview: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'. I suppose the same thing must happen with my books. It's inevitable. And yet, that doesn't mean my books can't be enjoyed by English-speaking readers. I feel confident that there's enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can have a lot of fun reading them.\"\nArtists that have cited Takahashi and her work as an influence include Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley on his series \"Scott Pilgrim\", American Colleen Coover on her erotic series \"Small Favors\", Japanese Chihiro Tamaki on her manga \"Walkin' Butterfly\", Chinese-Australian Queenie Chan, and Thai Wisut Ponnimit. Scottish rock band Urusei Yatsura named themselves after her first work. Matt Bozon, creator of the \"Shantae\" video game series, cited \"Ranma \u00bd\" as a big influence on his work. Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Domee Shi listed both \"Ranma \u00bd\" and \"Inuyasha\" as influences on her film \"Turning Red\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26513", "revid": "50639935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26513", "title": "Reverse Polish notation", "text": "Mathematics notation where operators follow operands\nReverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as reverse \u0141ukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators \"follow\" their operands, in contrast to prefix or Polish notation (PN), in which operators \"precede\" their operands. The notation does not need any parentheses for as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.\nThe term \"postfix notation\" describes the general scheme in mathematics and computer sciences, whereas the term \"reverse Polish notation\" typically refers specifically to the method used to enter calculations into hardware or software calculators, which often have additional side effects and implications depending on the actual implementation involving a stack. The description \"Polish\" refers to the nationality of logician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.\nThe first computer to use postfix notation, though it long remained essentially unknown outside of Germany, was Konrad Zuse's Z3 in 1941 as well as his Z4 in 1945. The reverse Polish scheme was again proposed in 1954 by Arthur Burks, Don Warren, and Jesse Wright and was independently reinvented by Friedrich L. Bauer and Edsger W. Dijkstra in the early 1960s to reduce computer memory access and use the stack to evaluate expressions. The algorithms and notation for this scheme were extended by the philosopher and computer scientist Charles L. Hamblin in the mid-1950s.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Hewlett-Packard used RPN in all of their desktop and hand-held calculators, and has continued to use it in some models into the 2020s. In computer science, reverse Polish notation is used in stack-oriented programming languages such as Forth, dc, Factor, STOIC, PostScript, RPL, and Joy.\nExplanation.\nIn reverse Polish notation, the operators follow their operands. For example, to add 3 and 4 together, the expression is 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4. The conventional notation expression 3 \u2212 4 + 5 becomes 3 (enter) 4 \u2212 5 + in reverse Polish notation: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it.\nThe concept of a \"stack\", a last-in/first-out construct, is integral to the left-to-right evaluation of RPN. In the example 3 4 \u2212, first the 3 is put onto the stack, then the 4; the 4 is now on top and the 3 below it. The subtraction operator removes the top two items from the stack, performs 3 \u2212 4, and puts the result of \u22121 onto the stack.\nCommon language in this context refers to items being pushed onto the stack when added and popped or removed from the stack when taken off.\nThe advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for order of operations and parentheses that are required by infix notation and can be evaluated linearly, left-to-right. For example, the infix expression (3 + 4) \u00d7 (5 + 6) becomes 3 4 + 5 6 + \u00d7 in reverse Polish notation.\nPractical implications.\nReverse Polish notation has been compared to how one had to work through problems with a slide rule.\nIn comparison, testing of reverse Polish notation with algebraic notation, reverse Polish has been found to lead to faster calculations, for two reasons. The first reason is that reverse Polish calculators do not need expressions to be parenthesized, so fewer operations need to be entered to perform typical calculations. Additionally, users of reverse Polish calculators made fewer mistakes than for other types of calculators. Later research clarified that the increased speed from reverse Polish notation may be attributed to the smaller number of keystrokes needed to enter this notation, rather than to a smaller cognitive load on its users. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that reverse Polish notation is more difficult for users who previously learned algebraic notation.\nConverting from infix notation.\nEdsger W. Dijkstra invented the shunting-yard algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions (reverse Polish notation), so named because its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard.\nThere are other ways of producing postfix expressions from infix expressions. Most operator-precedence parsers can be modified to produce postfix expressions; in particular, once an abstract syntax tree has been constructed, the corresponding postfix expression is given by a simple post-order traversal of that tree.\nImplementations.\nHardware calculators.\nEarly history.\nThe first computer implementing a form of reverse Polish notation (but without the name and also without a stack), was Konrad Zuse's Z3, which he started to construct in 1938 and demonstrated publicly on 12 May 1941. In dialog mode, it allowed operators to enter two operands followed by the desired operation. It was destroyed on 21 December 1943 in a bombing raid. With Zuse's help a first replica was built in 1961. The 1945 Z4 also added a 2-level stack.\nOther early computers to implement architectures enabling reverse Polish notation were the English Electric Company's KDF9 machine, which was announced in 1960 and commercially available in 1963, and the Burroughs B5000, announced in 1961 and also delivered in 1963:\nThe KDF9 designers drew ideas from Hamblin's GEORGE (General Order Generator), a high-level programming language written for a DEUCE computer installed at The New South Wales University of Technology, Kensington, Australia, in 1957.\nOne of the designers of the B5000, Robert S. Barton, later wrote that he developed reverse Polish notation independently of Hamblin sometime in 1958 after reading a 1954 textbook on symbolic logic by Irving Copi, where he found a reference to Polish notation, which made him read the works of Jan \u0141ukasiewicz as well, and before he was aware of Hamblin's work.\nFriden introduced reverse Polish notation to the desktop calculator market with the EC-130, designed by Robert \"Bob\" Appleby Ragen, supporting a four-level stack in June 1963. The successor EC-132 added a square root function in April 1965. Around 1966, the Monroe Epic calculator supported an unnamed input scheme resembling RPN as well.\nHewlett-Packard.\nHewlett-Packard engineers designed the 9100A Desktop Calculator in 1968 with reverse Polish notation with only three stack levels with working registers \"X\" (\"keyboard\"), \"Y\" (\"accumulate\") and visible storage register \"Z\" (\"temporary\"), a reverse Polish notation variant later referred to as \"three-level RPN\". This calculator popularized reverse Polish notation among the scientific and engineering communities.\nThe HP-35, the world's first handheld scientific calculator, introduced the classical \"four-level RPN\" with its specific ruleset of the so-called \"operational (memory) stack\" (later also called \"automatic memory stack\") in 1972. In this scheme, the key duplicates values into Y under certain conditions (\"automatic stack lift\" with \"temporary stack lift disable\"), and the top register \"T\" (\"top\") gets duplicated on drops (\"top copy on pop\" aka \"top stack level repetition\") in order to ease some calculations and to save keystrokes. HP used reverse Polish notation on every handheld calculator it sold, whether scientific, financial, or programmable, until it introduced the HP-10 adding machine calculator in 1977. By this time, HP was the leading manufacturer of calculators for professionals, including engineers and accountants.\nLater calculators with LCDs in the early 1980s, such as the HP-10C, HP-11C, HP-15C, HP-16C, and the financial HP-12C calculator also used reverse Polish notation. In 1988, Hewlett-Packard introduced a business calculator, the HP-19B, without reverse Polish notation, but its 1990 successor, the HP-19BII, gave users the option of using algebraic or reverse Polish notation again.\nIn 1986, HP introduced RPL, an object-oriented successor to reverse Polish notation. It deviates from classical reverse Polish notation by using a dynamic stack only limited by the amount of available memory (instead of three or four fixed levels) and which could hold all kinds of data objects (including symbols, strings, lists, matrices, graphics, programs, etc.) instead of just numbers. The system would display an error message when running out of memory instead of just dropping values off the stack on overflow as with fixed-sized stacks. It also changed the behaviour of the stack to no longer duplicate the top register on drops (since in an unlimited stack there is no longer a top register) and the behaviour of the key so that it no longer duplicated values into Y, which had shown to sometimes cause confusion among users not familiar with the specific properties of the \"automatic memory stack\". From 1990 to 2003, HP manufactured the HP-48 series of graphing RPL calculators, followed by the HP-49 series between 1999 and 2008. The last RPL calculator was named HP 50g, introduced in 2006 and discontinued in 2015. However, there are several community efforts like newRPL or DB48X to recreate RPL on modern calculators.\nAs of 2011, Hewlett-Packard was offering the calculator models 12C, 12C Platinum, 17bII+, 20b, 30b, 33s, 35s, 48gII (RPL) and 50g (RPL) which support reverse Polish notation.\nWhile calculators emulating classical models continued to support classical reverse Polish notation, new reverse Polish notation models feature a variant of reverse Polish notation, where the key behaves as in RPL. This latter variant is sometimes known as \"entry RPN\".\nIn 2013, the HP Prime introduced a \"128-level\" form of entry RPN called \"advanced RPN\". In contrast to RPL with its dynamic stack, it just drops values off the stack on overflow like other fixed-sized stacks do. However, like RPL, it does not emulate the behaviour of a classical operational RPN stack to duplicate the top register on drops.\nIn late 2017, the list of active models supporting reverse Polish notation included only the 12C, 12C Platinum, 17bii+, 35s, and Prime. By July 2023, only the 12C, 12C Platinum, the HP 15C Collector's Edition, and the Prime remain active models supporting RPN.\nSinclair Radionics.\nIn Britain, Clive Sinclair's Sinclair Scientific (1974) and Scientific Programmable (1975) models used reverse Polish notation.\nCommodore.\nIn 1974, Commodore produced the Minuteman *6 (MM6) without an key and the Minuteman *6X (MM6X) with an key, both implementing a form of \"two-level RPN\". The SR4921 RPN came with a variant of \"four-level RPN\" with stack levels named X, Y, Z, and W (rather than T) and an key (for \"entry\"). In contrast to Hewlett-Packard's reverse Polish notation implementation, W filled with 0 instead of its contents being duplicated on stack drops.\nPrinztronic.\nPrinz and Prinztronic were own-brand trade names of the British Dixons photographic and electronic goods stores retail chain, later rebranded as Currys Digital stores, and became part of DSG International. A variety of calculator models was sold in the 1970s under the Prinztronic brand, all made for them by other companies.\nAmong these was the PROGRAM Programmable Scientific Calculator which featured reverse Polish notation.\nHeathkit.\nThe Aircraft Navigation Computer Heathkit OC-1401/OCW-1401 used \"five-level RPN\" in 1978.\nSoviet Union / Semico.\nSoviet programmable calculators (MK-52, MK-61, B3-34 and earlier B3-21 models) used reverse Polish notation for both automatic mode and programming. Modern Russian calculators MK-161 and MK-152, designed and manufactured in Novosibirsk since 2007 and offered by Semico, are backwards compatible with them. Their extended architecture is also based on reverse Polish notation.\nCommunity-developed hardware-based calculators.\nAn eight-level stack was suggested by John A. Ball in 1978.\nThe community-developed calculators WP\u00a034S (2011), WP\u00a031S (2014) and WP\u00a034C (2015), which are based on the HP\u00a020b/HP\u00a030b hardware platform, support classical Hewlett-Packard-style reverse Polish notation supporting automatic stack lift behaviour of the key and top register copies on pops, but switchable between a four- and an eight-level operational stack.\nIn addition to the optional support for an eight-level stack, the newer SwissMicros DM42-based WP\u00a043S as well as the WP\u00a043C (2019)\u00a0/ C43 (2022)\u00a0/ C47 (2023) derivatives support data types for stack objects (real numbers, infinite integers, finite integers, complex numbers, strings, matrices, dates and times). The latter three variants can also be switched between \"classical\" and \"entry RPN\" behaviour of the key, a feature often requested by the community. They also support a rarely seen significant figures mode, which had already been available as a compile-time option for the WP\u00a034S and WP\u00a031S.\nSince 2021, the HP-42S simulator Free42 version 3 can be enabled to support a dynamic RPN stack only limited by the amount of available memory instead of the classical 4-level stack. This feature was incorporated as a selectable function into the DM42 since firmware DMCP-3.21\u00a0/ DM42-3.18.\nSoftware calculators.\nSoftware calculators:\nProgramming languages.\nExisting implementations using reverse Polish notation include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has also published plays and poetry. He is the Frank H. T. Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus at Cornell University.\nEarly life.\nEscape from the Holocaust.\nHoffmann was born in Z\u0142ocz\u00f3w, Poland (now Zolochiv, Ukraine), to a Polish-Jewish family, and was named in honor of the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. His parents were Clara (Rosen), a teacher, and Hillel Safran, a civil engineer. After Germany invaded Poland and occupied the town, his family was placed in a labor camp where his father, who was familiar with much of the local infrastructure, was a valued prisoner. As the situation grew more dangerous, with prisoners being transferred to extermination camps, the family bribed guards to allow an escape. They arranged with a Ukrainian neighbor named Mykola Dyuk for Hoffmann, his mother, two uncles and an aunt to hide in the attic and a storeroom of the local schoolhouse, where they remained for eighteen months, from January 1943 to June 1944, while Hoffmann was aged 5 to 7.\nHis father remained at the labor camp, but was able to occasionally visit, until he was tortured and killed by the Germans for his involvement in a plot to arm the camp prisoners. When she received the news, his mother attempted to contain her sorrow by writing down her feelings in a notebook her husband had been using to take notes on a relativity textbook he had been reading. While in hiding his mother kept Hoffmann entertained by teaching him to read and having him memorize geography from textbooks stored in the attic, then quizzing him on it. He referred to the experience as having been enveloped in a cocoon of love. In 1944 they moved to Krak\u00f3w where his mother remarried. They adopted her new husband's surname Hoffmann.\nMost of the rest of the family was killed in the Holocaust, though one grandmother and a few others survived. They migrated to the United States on the troop carrier \"Ernie Pyle\" in 1949.\nHoffmann visited Zolochiv with his adult son (by then a parent of a five-year-old) in 2006 and found that the attic where he had hidden was still intact, but the storeroom had been incorporated, ironically enough, into a chemistry classroom. In 2009, a monument to Holocaust victims was built in Zolochiv on Hoffmann's initiative.\nPersonal life.\nHoffmann married Eva B\u00f6rjesson in 1960. They have two children, Hillel Jan and Ingrid Helena.\nHe describes himself as \"an atheist who is moved by religion.\"\nEducation and academic credentials.\nHoffmann graduated in 1955 from New York City's Stuyvesant High School, where he won a Westinghouse science scholarship. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree at Columbia University (Columbia College) in 1958. He earned his Master of Arts degree in 1960 from Harvard University. He earned his doctor of philosophy degree from Harvard University while working under joint supervision of Martin Gouterman and subsequent 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. Hoffman worked on the molecular orbital theory of polyhedral molecules. Under Lipscomb's direction the Extended H\u00fcckel method was developed by Lawrence Lohr and by Roald Hoffmann. This method was later extended by Hoffmann. In 1965, he went to Cornell University and has remained there, where he is a professor emeritus.\nScientific research.\nHoffmann's research and interests have been in the electronic structure of stable and unstable molecules, and in the study of transition states in reactions. He has investigated the structure and reactivity of both organic and inorganic molecules, and examined problems in organo-metallic and solid-state chemistry. Hoffman has developed semiempirical and nonempirical computational tools and methods such as the extended H\u00fcckel method which he proposed in 1963 for determining molecular orbitals.\nWith Robert Burns Woodward he developed the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules for elucidating reaction mechanisms and their stereochemistry. They realized that chemical transformations could be approximately predicted from subtle symmetries and asymmetries in the electron orbitals of complex molecules. Their rules predict differing outcomes, such as the types of products that will be formed when two compounds are activated by heat compared with those produced under activation by light. For this work Hoffmann received the 1981 Nobel Prize in chemistry, sharing it with Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui, who had independently resolved similar issues. (Woodward was not included in the prize, which is given only to living persons, although he had won the 1965 prize for other work.) In his Nobel Lecture, Hoffmann introduced the isolobal analogy for predicting the bonding properties of organometallic compounds.\nSome of Hoffman's most recent work, with Neil Ashcroft and Vanessa Labet, examines bonding in matter under extreme high pressure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArtistic interests.\n\"The World Of Chemistry\" with Roald Hoffmann.\nIn 1988 Hoffmann became the series host in a 26-program PBS education series by Annenberg/CPB, \"The World of Chemistry\", opposite with series demonstrator Don Showalter. While Hoffmann introduced a series of concepts and ideas, Showalter provided a series of demonstrations and other visual representations to help students and viewers to better understand the information.\n\"Entertaining Science\".\nSince the spring of 2001, Hoffmann has been the host of the monthly series \"Entertaining Science\" at New York City's Cornelia Street Cafe, which explores the juncture between the arts and science.\nNon-fiction.\nHe has published books on the connections between art and science: \"Roald Hoffmann on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry\" and \"Beyond the Finite: The Sublime in Art and Science\".\nPoetry.\nHoffmann is also a writer of poetry. His collections include \"The Metamict State\" (1987, ), \"Gaps and Verges\" (1990, ), and \"Chemistry Imagined\" (1993, , co-produced with artist Vivian Torrence.\nPlays.\nHe co-authored with Carl Djerassi the play \"Oxygen\", about the discovery of oxygen and the experience of being a scientist. Hoffman's play, \"Should've\" (2006) about ethics in science and art, has been produced in workshops, as has a play based on his experiences in the holocaust, \"We Have Something That Belongs to You\" (2009), later retitled \"Something That Belongs to You.\nHonors and awards.\nNobel Prize in Chemistry.\nIn 1981, Hoffmann received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which he shared with Kenichi Fukui \"for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions\".\nOther awards.\nHoffmann has won many other awards, and is the recipient of more than 25 honorary degrees.\nHoffmann is a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and the Board of Sponsors of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.\nIn August 2007, the American Chemical Society held a symposium at its biannual national meeting to honor Hoffmann's 70th birthday.\nIn 2008, the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities awarded him its Lichtenberg Medal.\nIn August 2017, another symposium was held at the 254th American Chemical Society National Meeting in Washington DC, to honor Hoffmann's 80th birthday.\nThe Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials in Shenzhen, named after him, was founded in his honor in February 2018 and formally opened in his presence in May 2019.\nIn 2023, Roald Hoffmann was named by Carnegie Corporation of New York as an honoree of the Great Immigrants Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26515", "revid": "15424115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26515", "title": "Rhotic consonant", "text": "Class of consonants\nIn phonetics, rhotic consonants, or \"R-like\" sounds, are liquid consonants that are traditionally represented orthographically by symbols derived from the Greek letter rho (\u03a1 and \u03c1), including \u27e8R\u27e9, \u27e8r\u27e9 in the Latin script and \u27e8\u0420\u27e9, \u27e8p\u27e9 in the Cyrillic script. They are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by upper- or lower-case variants of Roman \u27e8R\u27e9, \u27e8r\u27e9: \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9, and \u27e8\u27e9. Transcriptions for vocalic or semivocalic realisations of underlying rhotics include the \u27e8\u27e9 and \u27e8\u27e9.\nThis class of sounds is difficult to characterise phonetically; from a phonetic standpoint, there is no single articulatory correlate (manner or place) common to rhotic consonants. Rhotics have instead been found to carry out similar phonological functions or to have certain similar phonological features across different languages.\nBeing \"R-like\" is an elusive and ambiguous concept phonetically and the same sounds that function as rhotics in some systems may pattern with fricatives, semivowels or even stops in others. For example, the alveolar flap is a rhotic consonant in multiple languages, but in North American English, the alveolar tap is an allophone of the stop phoneme , as in \"water\". It is likely that rhotics are not a phonetically natural class but a phonological class.\nSome languages have rhotic and non-rhotic varieties, which differ in the incidence of rhotic consonants. In non-rhotic accents of English, is not pronounced unless it is followed directly by a vowel.\nTypes.\nThe most typical rhotic sounds found in the world's languages are the following:\nFurthermore, there is also a non-syllabic open vowel (conventional transcription, the exact quality varies) that patterns as in some Germanic languages such as German, Danish and Luxembourgish. It occurs only in the syllable coda.\nCharacteristics.\nIn broad transcription rhotics are usually symbolised as unless there are two or more types of rhotic in the same language; for example, most Australian Aboriginal languages, which contrast approximant and trill , use the symbols \"r\" and \"rr\" respectively. The IPA has a full set of different symbols which can be used whenever more phonetic precision is required: an \"r\" rotated 180\u00b0 for the alveolar approximant, a small capital \"R\" for the uvular trill, and a flipped small capital \"R\" for the voiced uvular fricative or approximant.\nThe fact that the sounds conventionally classified as \"rhotics\" vary greatly in both place and manner in terms of articulation, and also in their acoustic characteristics, has led several linguists to investigate what, if anything, they have in common that justifies grouping them together. One suggestion that has been made is that each member of the class of rhotics shares certain properties with other members of the class, but not necessarily the same properties with all; in this case, rhotics have a \"family resemblance\" with each other rather than a strict set of shared properties. Another suggestion is that rhotics are defined by their behaviour on the sonority hierarchy, namely, that a rhotic is any sound that patterns as being more sonorous than a lateral consonant but less sonorous than a vowel. The potential for variation within the class of rhotics makes them a popular area for research in sociolinguistics.\nRhotics and rhoticity in the world's languages.\nEnglish.\nEnglish has rhotic and non-rhotic accents. Rhotic speakers pronounce a historical in all instances, while non-rhotic speakers only pronounce at the beginning of a syllable.\nDutch.\nColloquial Northern Dutch speech of the Randstad region is variably rhotic. In the syllable coda, the sequences may be realized as , which may be close to or the same as the vowels or sequences , resulting in a variable merger. For instance, \"kerk\" 'church' and \"cake\" 'pound cake' may become homophonous as , whereas \"maar\" 'but' can be homophonous with \"maai\" '(I) mow' as . and are usually somewhat distinct from and as the former feature vowels that are more central (and features a diphthong in certain dialects, such as Rotterdam Dutch).\nAfter , may be dropped altogether, as in \"kilometer\" 'kilometer'. This is commonly heard in The Hague. It is not necessarily restricted to the word-final position, as it can also happen in word-final clusters in words such as \"honderd\" 'hundred'.\nAfter , , , and , may be realized as a centering glide, as in \"mier\" 'ant', \"muur\" 'wall', \"moer\" 'queen bee', \"meer\" 'lake' and \"deur\" 'door'. As with and , these vowels are more central (and also longer) than in other contexts. Furthermore, both and are raised in this context, so that \"meer\" becomes a near-homophone of \"mier\", whereas \"deur\" becomes a quasi-rhyme of \"muur\".\nIn citation forms, in the syllable coda is pronounced as a pharyngealized pre-velar bunched approximant (known in Dutch as the \"Gooise r\") that is acoustically similar to : etc. Other realizations (alveolar taps and voiced uvular fricatives) are also possible, depending on the region and individual speaker, so that \"mier\" may be also pronounced or . The pre-velar bunched approximant as well as the palatal approximant realization of described above are virtually unknown in southern varieties of Dutch. In the varieties where they do occur, they are restricted to the syllable coda. In other environments, is realized as or .\nOther Germanic languages.\nIn most varieties of German (with the notable exception of Swiss Standard German), in the syllable coda is frequently realized as a vowel or a semivowel, or . In the traditional standard pronunciation, this happens only in the unstressed ending \"-er\" and after long vowels: for example \"besser\" , \"sehr\" . In common speech the vocalization is usual after short vowels as well, and additional contractions may occur: for example \"Dorn\" ~ , \"hart\" ~ . Commonplace mergers include that of with (leading to homophony of e.g. \"warten, waten\") and loss of length distinctions before coda (e.g. homophony of \"Herr, Heer\"). Compare German phonology.\nSimilarly, Danish after a vowel is, unless followed by a stressed vowel, either pronounced (\"mor\" \"mother\" , \"n\u00e6ring\" \"nourishment\" ) or merged with the preceding vowel while usually influencing its vowel quality ( and or are realised as long vowels and , and , and are all pronounced ) (\"l\u00f8ber\" \"runner\" , \"S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\" (personal name) ).\nAstur-Leonese.\nIn Asturian, word-final is always lost in infinitives before an enclitic pronoun, which is reflected in writing. For example, the infinitive form \"dar\" plus the third-person plural dative pronoun \"-yos\" \"da-yos\" (\"give to them\") or the accusative form \"los\" \"dalos\" (\"give them\"). That happens also in Leonese in which the infinitive form is \"dare\" , and both the and the vowel are dropped (\"da-yos\", not *\"d\u00e1re-yos\"). However, most speakers also drop rhotics in the infinitive before a lateral consonant of a different word, but that is not shown in writing: \"dar los dos\" (give the two [things]). That does not occur in the middle of words: the name \"Carlos\" .\nCatalan.\nIn some Catalan dialects, word-final is lost in coda position not only in suffixes of nouns and adjectives denoting the masculine singular and plural (written as \"-r\", \"-rs\"; as well as in words like \"llavors\" \"then; so\"), but also in the \"-\"ar\", -\"er\" and -\"ir\"\" suffixes of infinitives: \"forner\" \"(male) baker\", \"forners\" , \"fer\" \"to do\", \"lluir\" \"to shine, to look good\". However, rhotics are \"recovered\" when followed by the feminine suffix \"-a\" , and when infinitives have single or multiple enclitic pronouns (notice the two rhotics are neutralized in the coda, with a flap occurring between vowels, and a trill elsewhere); e.g. \"fornera\" \"(female) baker\", \"fer-lo\" \"to do it (masc.)\", \"fer-ho\" \"to do it/that/so\", \"lluir-se\" \"to excel, to show off\".\nFrench.\nFinal \u27e8r\u27e9 is generally not pronounced in words ending in \u27e8-er\u27e9. The R in \"parce que\" (\"because\") is not pronounced in informal speech.\nMalay (including Indonesian).\nThe pronunciation of final in Malay and Indonesian varies considerably. In Indonesian, (lit.\u2009'standard') Malay, and Kedah Malay, the final is pronounced, but in the Johor-Riau accent, the standard accent of Malay in Brunei and Malaysia, and several other dialects, it is not.\nThe quality of the realization of the phoneme varies too. In the syllable onset, in Indonesian, Malay, and standard Johor-Riau Malay, it varies between a trill , a flap , and sometimes, even an approximant . In a number of dialects of Malay, such as those of Kedah, Kelantan-Pattani and Terengganu, onset is usually realized as a velar fricative . In Perak Malay, a uvular pronunciation, is more common.\nIn Kedah Malay, final is uniquely realized as a pharyngeal fricative . In the dialect of Malacca, when it appears after , final is vocalized into or .\nPortuguese.\nIn some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese, is unpronounced or aspirated. That occurs most frequently with verbs in the infinitive, which is always indicated by a word-final . In some states, however, it happens mostly with any when preceding a consonant. The \"Carioca\" accent (from the city of Rio de Janeiro) is notable for this. The Caipira dialect (from S\u00e3o Paulo countryside) usually realizes as , , or . \nSpanish.\nAmong the Spanish dialects, Andalusian Spanish, Caribbean Spanish (descended from and still very similar to Andalusian and Canarian Spanish), Cast\u00fao (the Spanish dialect of Extremadura), Northern Colombian Spanish (in cities like Cartagena, Monter\u00eda, San Andr\u00e9s and Santa Marta, but not Barranquilla, which is mostly rhotic) and the Argentine dialect spoken in the Tucum\u00e1n province may have an unpronounced word-final , especially in infinitives, which mirrors the situation in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese. However, in Antillean Caribbean forms, word-final in infinitives and non-infinitives is often in free variation with word-final , which may be delateralized to , forming a rising diphthong with the preceding vowel (as in \"dar\" 'to give').\nThai.\nThe native Thai rhotic is the alveolar trill. The English approximants /\u0279/ and /l/ are used interchangeably in Thai. That is, Thai-speakers generally replace an English-derived \"r\" (\u0e23) with an \"l\" (\u0e25), and when they hear an \"l\" (\u0e25), they may write an \"r\" (\u0e23).\nTurkish.\nIn Istanbul Turkish, is always pronounced except in colloquial speech for the present continuous tense suffix as in ('going') or ('I was writing') and ('one') when used as an adjective/quantifier (but not other numbers containing this word, such as ('eleven')). In these cases, the preceding vowel is not lengthened. The unfavorability of dropping can be explained with minimal pairs, such as ('stole') versus (imperative 'ring').\nIn some parts of Turkey, like Kastamonu, the syllable-final is almost never pronounced: \"gidiya\" instead of \"gidiyor\" (\"she/he is going\") and \"gide\" instead of \"gider\" (\"she/he goes\"). In \"gide\", the preceding \"e\" is lengthened and pronounced somewhat between \"e\" and \"a\".\nChinese.\nNorthern Chinese accents, centered around Beijing, are well known as having \"erhua\" which can be translated as \"R-change\". This normally happens at ends of words, particularly ones that end in an -n/-ng sound. So a southern Chinese might say \"y\u012b di\u01cen\" (\u4e00\u70b9) (\"a little bit\") but a Beijinger would say it more like [(j)i t\u02b2\u025a] which in Pinyin is sometimes rendered \"y\u012b di\u01cenr\" to show if the word can be rhotacized. The final \"R\" sound is strongly pronounced, not unlike Irish or American accents.\nUyghur.\nAmong the Turkic languages, Uyghur displays more or less the same feature, as syllable-final is dropped, and the preceding vowel is lengthened: \"Uyghurlar\" 'Uyghurs'. The may, however, sometimes be pronounced in unusually \"careful\" or \"pedantic\" speech; in such cases, it is often mistakenly inserted after long vowels even when there is no phonemic .\nYaqui.\nSimilarly in Yaqui, an indigenous language of northern Mexico, intervocalic or syllable-final is often dropped with lengthening of the previous vowel: \"pariseo\" becomes , \"sewaro\" becomes .\nLacid.\nLacid, whose exonyms in various literature include Lashi, Lachik, Lechi, and Leqi, is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by the Lacid people. There are various reports of their population from 30,000 to 60,000 people. Most are in Myanmar, but there are also small groups in China and Thailand. Noftz (2017) reports finding an example of a rhotic alveolar fricative in Lacid while he was doing phonological research at Payap University, in Thailand, in 2015. He was not able to continue his research and expressed the need for further examination of the segment to verify his results. It is postulated that the segment is a remnant of the rhotic fricative in Proto-Tibeto-Burman.\nBerber languages.\nSyllable-final is lost in multiple varieties of Rif Berber and is lengthened before to , and and become diphthongs like in English or German. However, a distinct phoneme from earlier exists and does not undergo the same development.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their 1977 album \"Blank Generation\" influenced many other punk bands. Its title track was named \"One of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock\" by music writers in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listing and is ranked as one of the all-time Top 10 punk songs by a 2006 poll of original British punk figures, as reported in the \"Rough Guide to Punk\".\nSince the late 1980s, Hell has devoted himself primarily to writing, publishing two novels and several other books. He was the film critic for \"BlackBook\" magazine from 2004 to 2006.\nBiography.\nEarly life and career.\nRichard Lester Meyers was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1949. His father was Jewish, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was seven years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, Carolyn H. Rhodes, who came from Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor.\nHell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism.\nHell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded \"Genesis:Grasp\". They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books.\nBefore he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from \"Rolling Stone\" to the New Directions \"Annual\"s. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \"Stern\", \"Wanna Go Out?\", was released by Dot in 1973.\nThe Neon Boys, Television, and the Heartbreakers.\nIn 1972, Verlaine joined Hell in New York and formed the Neon Boys. In 1974, the band added a second guitarist, Richard Lloyd, and changed their name to Television.\nTelevision's performances at CBGB helped kick-start the first wave of punk bands, inspiring a number of different artists including Patti Smith, who wrote the first press review of Television for the \"SoHo Weekly News\" in June 1974. She formed a highly successful band of her own, the Patti Smith Group. Television was one of the early bands to play at CBGB because their manager, Terry Ork, persuaded owner Hilly Kristal to book them alongside the Ramones. They also built the club's first stage. Hell started playing his punk rock anthem \"Blank Generation\" during his time in Television. In early 1975, Hell parted ways with Television after a dispute over creative control. Hell claimed that he and Verlaine had originally divided the songwriting evenly, but that later Verlaine sometimes refused to play Hell's songs. Verlaine remained silent on the subject.\nHell left Television the same week that Jerry Nolan and Johnny Thunders quit the New York Dolls. In May 1975, the three of them formed the Heartbreakers (not to be confused with Tom Petty's band, which adopted the same name the following year). After one show, Walter Lure joined the Heartbreakers as a second guitarist. Four Heartbreakers demo tracks, recorded while Hell was still in the band, were later released on that band's \"L.A.M.F. Definitive Edition\" reissue. A live album recorded with Hell in 1975 was released as \"What Goes Around...\" in 1991.\nRichard Hell and the Voidoids.\nIn early 1976, Hell quit the Heartbreakers and started Richard Hell and the Voidoids with Robert Quine, Ivan Julian and Marc Bell. The band released two albums, though the second, \"Destiny Street\", retained only Quine from the original group, with Naux (Juan Maciel) on guitar and Fred Maher on drums. Hell's best known songs with the Voidoids included \"Blank Generation\", \"Love Comes in Spurts\", \"The Kid With the Replaceable Head\" and \"Time\". In 2009, the guitar tracks on \"Destiny Street\" were re-recorded and released as \"Destiny Street Repaired\", with guitarists Julian, Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell playing to the original rhythm tracks. Also in 2009, Hell gave his blessing to the public access program Pancake Mountain to create an animated music video for \"The Kid with the Replaceable Head\". It was the Voidoids' first and only official music video. The cut used for the animation appears on Hell's 2005 retrospective album, \"Spurts, The Richard Hell Story\".\nDim Stars and other collaborations.\nHell's only other album release was as part of the band Dim Stars, for which he came out of retirement for a month in the early 1990s. Dim Stars featured guitarist Thurston Moore and drummer Steve Shelley from Sonic Youth, Gumball's guitarist Don Fleming, and Quine. They formed only to record a 1991 EP and a 1992 album, both titled \"Dim Stars\", and played one show in public, a WFMU benefit at The Ritz in Manhattan. Hell played bass, sang lead vocals and wrote the lyrics for the album.\nHell also guested on the 1993 \"Roller Coaster\" album by Shotgun Rationale, and co-wrote and sang lead vocals on the song \"Never Mind\" by the Heads, a 1996 collaborative effort between three former members of Talking Heads.\nBooks.\n\"The Voidoid\", a novella written in 1973, was finally published by CodeX in 1993. It was reissued in 2009 by 38th Street Publishers with illustrations by Kier Cooke Sandvik. His early poetry collections include \"I Was a Spiral on the Floor\" (1988) and \"Across the Years\" (1992), both published by Soyo Publications. \"Artifact: Notebooks from Hell 1974\u20131980\", a collection of his punk-era journals, was released in 1990 by Hanuman Books. In 1996, Scribner published Hell's first full-length novel, \"Go Now\", set in 1980 and drawn largely from his own experiences. Hell released a collection of short pieces (poems, essays and drawings) called \"Hot and Cold\" in 2001. His second novel, \"Godlike\", was published in 2005 by Akashic Books as part of Dennis Cooper's Little House on the Bowery Series. Also published in 2005 was \"Rabbit Duck\", a book of 13 poems written in collaboration with David Shapiro. More recent works include \"Psychopts\" (2008), a collaboration with artist Christopher Wool, as well as \"Disgusting\" (2010) and \"I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp\" (2013).\nHell's nonfiction has been widely anthologized, including a number of appearances in \"best music writing\" collections. \"The Toilet Paper Columns\" (2007) compiled his columns for the Colorado alternative magazine \"Toilet Paper\", while \"Massive Pissed Love: Nonfiction 2001-2014\" was issued by Soft Skull Press in 2015. Hell's archive of his manuscripts, tapes, correspondence (written and email), journals and other documents of his life was purchased for $50,000 by New York University's Fales Library in 2003.\nA mural in Hell's hometown of Lexington, Kentucky, created by students from Lexington Montessori High School, was completed in June 2019. The mural, located in the city's North Limestone neighborhood, has three parts: two profiles of Hell, and a quote from his autobiography, \"I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp\". \"This was in Lexington, Ky. when everybody was a kid. I looked for caves and birds and ran away from home. My favorite thing to do was to run away. The words \u2018let\u2019s run away\u2019 still sounds magical to me.\"\nFilms.\nHell has appeared in several low-budget films, most notably Susan Seidelman's \"Smithereens\". Other acting appearances include Ulli Lommel's \"Blank Generation\", Nick Zedd's \"Geek Maggot Bingo\", Rachel Amadeo's \"What About Me?\" and Rachid Kerdouche's \"Final Reward\". Hell had a non-speaking cameo role as Madonna's murdered boyfriend in Seidelman's 1985 \"Desperately Seeking Susan\".\nPersonal life.\nIn 1976, Hell dated Nancy Spungen for a few months before she moved to England. Hell was married to Scandal's Patty Smyth for two years during 1985\u201386, and they had a daughter, Ruby. In January 2020, it was mentioned on Hell's website that he had begun a relationship with novelist Katherine Faw.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Smith loosely based upon Scottish folk hero Rob Roy MacGregor, and the Walter Scott novel about him.\nA Rob Roy is similar to a Manhattan, but is made exclusively with Scotch whisky; the Manhattan is traditionally made with rye, and today also commonly made with bourbon or Canadian whisky.

The standard Rob Roy is the sweet version, made with sweet vermouth, so there is no need to specify a \"sweet\" Rob Roy when ordering. A \"dry\" Rob Roy is made by replacing the sweet vermouth with dry vermouth. A \"perfect\" Rob Roy is made with equal parts sweet and dry vermouth.\nThe Rob Roy includes a dash of Angostura bitters (mostly for color), and is usually served in a cocktail glass garnished with two maraschino cherries on a skewer (for the standard version), or a lemon twist (for the perfect and dry versions).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, the linguistic construction \u2018_ was wise\u2019 is referentially transparent (e.g., \"Socrates was wise\" is equivalent to \"The founder of Western philosophy was wise\") but \u2018_ said _\u2019 is referentially opaque (e.g., \"Xenophon said \u2018Socrates was wise\u2019\" is not equivalent to \"Xenophon said \u2018The founder of Western philosophy was wise\u2019\").\nReferential transparency, in programming languages, depends on semantic equivalences among denotations of expressions, or on contextual equivalence of expressions themselves. That is, referential transparency depends on the semantics of the language. So, both declarative languages and imperative languages can have referentially transparent positions, referentially opaque positions, or (usually) both, according to the semantics they are given.\nThe importance of referentially transparent positions is that they allow the programmer and the compiler to reason about program behavior as a rewrite system at those positions. This can help in proving correctness, simplifying an algorithm, assisting in modifying code without breaking it, or optimizing code by means of memoization, common subexpression elimination, lazy evaluation, or parallelization.\nHistory.\nThe concept originated in Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell's \"Principia Mathematica\" (1910\u20131913):\nA proposition as the vehicle of truth or falsehood is a particular occurrence, while a proposition considered factually is a class of similar occurrences. It is the proposition considered factually that occurs in such statements as \u201c\"A\" believes \"p\"\u201c and \u201c\"p\" is about \"A\".\u201d\nOf course it is possible to make statements about the particular fact \u201cSocrates is Greek.\u201d We may say how many centimetres long it is; we may say it is black; and so on. But these are not the statements that a philosopher or logician is tempted to make.\nWhen an assertion occurs, it is made by means of a particular fact, which is an instance of the proposition asserted. But this particular fact is, so to speak, \u201ctransparent\u201d; nothing is said about it, but by means of it something is said about something else. It is this \u201ctransparent\u201d quality that belongs to propositions as they occur in truth-functions. This belongs to \"p\" when \"p\" is asserted, but not when we say \u201c\"p\" is true.\u201d\nIt was adopted in analytic philosophy in Willard Van Orman Quine's \"Word and Object\" (1960):\nWhen a singular term is used in a sentence purely to specify its object, and the sentence is true of the object, then certainly the sentence will stay true when any other singular term is substituted that designates the same object. Here we have a criterion for what may be called \"purely referential position\": the position must be subject to the \"substitutivity of identity\".\nReferential transparency has to do with constructions (\u00a7 11); modes of containment, more specifically, of singular terms or sentences in singular terms or sentences. I call a mode of containment \u03c6 referentially transparent if, whenever an occurrence of a singular term t is purely referential in a term or sentence \"\u03c8\"(\"t\"), it is purely referential also in the containing term or sentence \"\u03c6\"(\"\u03c8\"(\"t\")).\nThe term appeared in its contemporary computer science usage in the discussion of variables in programming languages in Christopher Strachey's seminal set of lecture notes \"Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages\" (1967):\nOne of the most useful properties of expressions is that called by Quine [4] \"referential transparency\". In essence this means that if we wish to find the value of an expression which contains a sub-expression, the only thing we need to know about the sub-expression is its value. Any other features of the sub-expression, such as its internal structure, the number and nature of its components, the order in which they are evaluated or the colour of the ink in which they are written, are irrelevant to the value of the main expression.\nFormal definitions.\nThere are three fundamental properties concerning substitutivity in formal languages: referential transparency, definiteness, and unfoldability.\nLet\u2019s denote syntactic equivalence with \u2261 and semantic equivalence with =.\nReferential transparency.\nA \"position\" is defined by a sequence of natural numbers. The empty sequence is denoted by \u03b5 and the sequence constructor by \u2018.\u2019.\n\"Example.\" \u2014 Position 2.1 in the expression (+ (\u2217 \"e\"1 \"e\"1) (\u2217 \"e\"2 \"e\"2)) is the place occupied by the first occurrence of .\nExpression e \"with\" expression e\u2032 \"inserted at\" position p is denoted by \"e\"[\"e\u2032\"/\"p\"] and defined by\n \"e\"[\"e\u2032\"/\u03b5] \u2261 \"e\u2032\"\n \"e\"[\"e\u2032\"/\"i\".\"p\"] \u2261 &lt;\u03a9 \"e\"1 \u2026 \"e\"\"i\"[\"e\u2032\"/\"p\"] \u2026 \"e\"\"n\"&gt; if \"e\" \u2261 &lt;\u03a9 \"e\"1 \u2026 \"e\"\"i\" \u2026 \"e\"\"n\"&gt; else undefined, for all operators \u03a9 and expressions .\n\"Example.\" \u2014 If \"e\" \u2261 (+ (\u2217 \"e\"1 \"e\"1) (\u2217 \"e\"2 \"e\"2)) then \"e\"[\"e\"3/2.1] \u2261 (+ (\u2217 \"e\"1 \"e\"1) (\u2217 \"e\"3 \"e\"2)).\nPosition p is \"purely referential\" in expression e is defined by\n \"e\"1 = \"e\"2 implies \"e\"[\"e\"1/\"p\"] = \"e\"[\"e\"2/\"p\"], for all expressions .\nIn other words, a position is purely referential in an expression if and only if it is subject to the substitutivity of equals. \u03b5 is purely referential in all expressions.\nOperator \u03a9 is \"referentially transparent\" in place i is defined by\n p is purely referential in e\"i\" implies \"i\".\"p\" is purely referential in \"e\" \u2261 &lt;\u03a9 \"e\"1 \u2026 \"e\"\"i\" \u2026 \"e\"\"n\"&gt;, for all positions p and expressions .\nOtherwise \u03a9 is \"referentially opaque\" in place i.\nAn operator is \"referentially transparent\" is defined by it is referentially transparent in all places.

{"id": "26529", "revid": "50976051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26529", "title": "Reaganomics", "text": "Economic policies of Ronald Reagan\nReaganomics (; a portmanteau of \"Reagan\" and \"economics\" attributed to Paul Harvey), or Reaganism, were the neoliberal \neconomic policies promoted by Ronald Reagan, president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. These policies focused mainly on supply-side economics. Opponents (including some Republicans) characterized them as \"trickle-down economics\" or Voodoo Economics, while Reagan and his advocates preferred to call it free-market economics.\nThe pillars of Reagan's economic policy included increasing defense spending, slowing the growth of government spending, reducing the federal income tax and capital gains tax, reducing government regulation, and tightening the money supply in order to reduce inflation.\nThe effects of Reaganomics are debated. Supporters have pointed to the end of stagflation, stronger GDP growth, and an entrepreneurial revolution in the decades that followed. \nCritics have pointed to the widening income gap, what they described as an atmosphere of greed, reduced economic mobility, and the national debt tripling in eight years which ultimately reversed the post-World War II trend of a shrinking national US debt as percentage of GDP.\nHistorical context.\nPrior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy experienced a decade of high unemployment and persistently high inflation (known as stagflation). Attacks on Keynesian economic orthodoxy as well as empirical economic models such as the Phillips Curve grew. Political pressure favored stimulus resulting in an expansion of the money supply. President Richard Nixon's wage and price controls were phased out. The federal oil reserves were created to ease any future short term shocks. President Jimmy Carter had begun phasing out price controls on petroleum while he created the Department of Energy. Much of the credit for the resolution of the stagflation is given to two causes: renewed focus on increasing productivity and a three-year contraction of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board under Paul Volcker.\nIn stating that his intention was to lower taxes, Reagan's approach was a departure from his immediate predecessors. Reagan enacted lower marginal tax rates as well as simplified income tax codes and continued deregulation. During Reagan's eight year presidency, the annual deficits averaged 4.0% of GDP, compared to a 2.2% average during the preceding eight years. The real (inflation adjusted) average rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. GDP per employed person increased at an average 1.5% rate during the Reagan administration, compared to an average 0.6% during the preceding eight years. Private sector productivity growth, measured as real output per hour of all persons, increased at an average rate of 1.9% during Reagan's eight years, compared to an average 1.3% during the preceding eight years. Federal net outlays as a percent of GDP averaged 20.27% under Reagan (01/20/1981 - 01/20/1989), compared to 21.14% during the preceding eight (01/20/1973 - 1/20/1981) years.\nDuring the Nixon and Ford Administrations, before Reagan's election, a combined supply and demand side policy was considered unconventional by the moderate wing of the Republican Party. While running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980, George H. W. Bush had derided Reaganomics as \"voodoo economics\". Similarly, in 1976, Gerald Ford had severely criticized Reagan's proposal to turn back a large part of the Federal budget to the states.\nJustifications.\nRonald Reagan\u2019s 1980 campaign speeches presented his economic vision as a revival of America\u2019s free enterprise tradition, emphasizing the dynamism of the market economy that had fueled prosperity before the Great Depression. He argued that the United States could regain its economic vitality by reducing government intervention and restoring confidence in the private sector. This message resonated deeply with advocates of supply-side economics, who believed that lowering tax burdens would unleash innovation, expand productivity, and ultimately strengthen the nation\u2019s fiscal foundation.\nSupply-side economics, popularized in the late 1970s and early 1980s, was rooted in the idea that tax cuts stimulate growth by incentivizing individuals and businesses to invest and produce more. Reagan\u2019s administration implemented this philosophy through the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which enacted one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Supporters argued that these measures would not only invigorate the economy but also expand the tax base, thereby offsetting potential revenue losses.\nA central theoretical underpinning of Reagan\u2019s program was the Laffer Curve, developed by economist Arthur Laffer. The curve illustrates that there exists an optimal tax rate that maximizes government revenue: excessively high taxes discourage work and investment, while excessively low taxes fail to generate sufficient revenue. Reagan embraced this principle, presenting it as common sense economics, if people and businesses were allowed to keep more of what they earned, they would invest, innovate, and expand, ultimately benefiting the entire nation. Laffer himself served on Reagan\u2019s Economic Policy Advisory Board, giving intellectual weight to the administration\u2019s policies.\nReagan also drew inspiration from Ibn Khaldun, the 14th\u2011century Arab scholar whose insights anticipated modern supply-side thought. Ibn Khaldun observed that societies flourished when taxes were modest, as people were motivated to produce and contribute, but declined when taxes became burdensome. At a press conference in October 1981, Reagan paraphrased Khaldun: \u201cIn the beginning of the dynasty, great tax revenues were gained from small assessments\u2026 at the end of the dynasty, small tax revenues were gained from large assessments.\u201d Reagan emphasized that his goal was to restore the conditions of \u201csmall assessments and great revenues,\u201d underscoring his belief that lower taxes could lead to greater prosperity.\nThe optimism of Reagan\u2019s program, later known as Reaganomics, was not limited to tax policy. It also included efforts to reduce government regulation, control inflation, and encourage private investment. Reagan framed these policies as a way to restore America\u2019s economic confidence and global leadership. His speeches often highlighted the moral dimension of economic freedom, portraying free markets as not only efficient but also aligned with the nation\u2019s values of liberty and opportunity.\nBy blending modern economic theory with timeless insights from history, Reagan\u2019s economic program was presented as a bold, forward-looking path toward revitalizing America\u2019s economy. It sought to reduce inflation, spur growth, and reaffirm the nation\u2019s confidence in the power of free markets and individual initiative. While debates over the long-term effects of Reaganomics continue, the campaign\u2019s framing was undeniably positive, aspirational, and rooted in the belief that economic freedom could restore national prosperity.\nPolicies.\nReagan lifted remaining domestic petroleum price and allocation controls on January 28, 1981, and lowered the oil windfall profits tax in August 1981. He ended the oil windfall profits tax in 1988. During the first year of Reagan's presidency, federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. This act slashed estate taxes and trimmed taxes paid by business corporations by $150 billion over a five-year period. In 1982 Reagan agreed to a rollback of corporate tax cuts and a smaller rollback of individual income tax cuts. The 1982 tax increase undid a third of the initial tax cut. In 1983 Reagan instituted a payroll tax increase on Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance. In 1984 another bill was introduced that closed tax loopholes. According to tax historian Joseph Thorndike, the bills of 1982 and 1984 \"constituted the biggest tax increase ever enacted during peacetime\".\nWith the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress sought to simplify the tax system by eliminating many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and reducing the number of tax brackets. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. \nFederal revenue share of GDP fell from 19.6% in fiscal 1981 to 17.3% in 1984, before rising back to 18.4% by fiscal year 1989. Personal income tax revenues fell during this period relative to GDP, while payroll tax revenues rose relative to GDP. Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only its lowest level since the Hoover administration (1929\u200a\u20131933). The 1986 act set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%.\nReagan significantly increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from $267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to $393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); most of those years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973. In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%. The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987 and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget. The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. This was the slowest rate of growth in inflation adjusted spending since Eisenhower. However, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration. As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation. Reagan described the new debt as the \"greatest disappointment\" of his presidency.\nAccording to William A. Niskanen, one of the architects of Reaganomics, \"Reagan delivered on each of his four major policy objectives, although not to the extent that he and his supporters had hoped\", and notes that the most substantial change was in the tax code, where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a \"major reversal in the tax treatment of business income\", with effect of \"reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment\". Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress.\nResults.\nOverview.\nSpending during the years Reagan budgeted (FY 1982\u201389) averaged 21.6% GDP, roughly tied with president Obama, but lagging behind President Trump's 38.2%, though much of that was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Both Obama and Reagan faced a severe recession early in their administration. In addition, the public debt rose from 26% GDP in 1980 to 41% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2.052 trillion in 1988, a roughly three-fold increase. The unemployment rate fell from 7% in 1980, to 5% in 1988. The inflation rate declined from 10% in 1980 to 4% in 1988.\nSome economists have stated that Reagan's policies were an important part of bringing about the third longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. During the Reagan administration, real GDP growth averaged 3.5%, compared to 2.9% during the preceding eight years. The annual average unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percentage points, from 7.2% in 1980 to 5.5% in 1988, after it had increased by 1.6 percentage points over the preceding eight years. Nonfarm employment increased by 16.1 million during Reagan's presidency, compared to 15.4 million during the preceding eight years, while manufacturing employment declined by 582,000 after rising 363,000 during the preceding eight years. Reagan's administration is the only one not to have raised the minimum wage. The inflation rate, 13.5% in 1980, fell to 4.1% in 1988, in part because the Federal Reserve increased interest rates (prime rate peaking at 20.5% in August 1981). The latter contributed to a recession from July 1981 to November 1982 during which unemployment rose to 9.7% and GDP fell by 1.9%. Additionally, income growth slowed for middle- and lower-class (2.4% to 1.8%) and rose for the upper-class (2.2% to 4.83%).\nThe misery index, defined as the inflation rate added to the unemployment rate, shrank from 19.33 when he began his administration to 9.72 when he left, the greatest improvement record for a President since Harry S. Truman left office. In terms of American households, the percentage of total households making less than $10,000 a year (in real 2007 dollars) shrank from 8.8% in 1980 to 8.3% in 1988 while the percentage of households making over $75,000 went from 20.2% to 25.7% during that period, both signs of progress.\nEmployment.\nThe job growth (measured for non-farm payrolls) under the Reagan administration averaged 168,000 per month, versus 216,000 for Carter, 55,000 for H.W. Bush, and 239,000 for Clinton. The annual job growth percentages (comparing the beginning and ending number of jobs during their time in office to determine an annual growth rate) show that jobs grew by 2.0% annually under Reagan, versus 3.1% under Carter, 0.6% under H.W. Bush, and 2.4% under Clinton.\nThe unemployment rate averaged 7.5% under Reagan, compared to an average 6.6% during the preceding eight years. Declining steadily after December 1982, the rate was 5.4% the month Reagan left office.\nThe labor force participation rate increased by 2.6 percentage points during Reagan's eight years, compared to 3.9 percentage points during the preceding eight years.\nGrowth rates.\nFollowing the 1981 recession, the unemployment rate had averaged slightly higher (6.75% vs. 6.35%), productivity growth lower (1.38% vs. 1.92%), and private investment as a percentage of GDP slightly less (16.08% vs. 16.86%). In the 1980s, industrial productivity growth in the United States matched that of its trading partners after trailing them in the 1970s. By 1990, manufacturing's share of GNP exceeded the post-World War II low hit in 1982 and matched \"the level of output achieved in the 1960s when American factories hummed at a feverish clip\".\nGDP growth.\nReal GDP grew over one-third during Reagan's presidency, an over $2 trillion increase. The compound annual growth rate of GDP was 3.6% during Reagan's eight years, compared to 2.7% during the preceding eight years. Real GDP per capita grew 2.6% under Reagan, compared to 1.9% average growth during the preceding eight years.\nReal wages.\nThe average real hourly wage for production and nonsupervisory workers continued the decline that had begun in 1973, albeit at a slower rate, and remained below the pre-Reagan level in every Reagan year. While inflation remained elevated during his presidency and likely contributed to the decline in wages over this period, Reagan's critics often argue that his neoliberal policies were responsible for this and also led to a stagnation of wages.\nIncome and wealth.\nReal median family income grew by $4,492 during the Reagan period, compared to a $1,270 increase during the preceding eight years. After declining from 1973 through 1980, real mean personal income rose $4,708 by 1988, and real median personal income rose every year from 1981 to 1989, increasing overall by 19.9%.\nIn nominal terms, median household income grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% during the Reagan presidency, compared to 8.5% during the preceding five years (pre-1975 data are unavailable). Nominal household net worth increased by a CAGR of 8.4%, compared to 9.3% during the preceding eight years.\nPoverty level.\nThe percentage of the total population below the poverty level increased from 13.0% in 1980 to 15.2% in 1983, then declined back to 13.0% in 1988. During Reagan's first term, critics noted homelessness as a visible problem in U.S. urban centers. According to Don Mitchell, the increased cuts to spending on housing and social services under Reagan was a contributing factor to the homeless population nearly doubling in just three years, from 1984 to 1987. In the closing weeks of his presidency, Reagan told David Brinkley that the homeless \"make it their own choice for staying out there,\" noting his belief that there \"are shelters in virtually every city, and shelters here, and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to going into one of those shelters\". He also stated that \"a large proportion\" of them are \"mentally impaired\", which he believed to be a result of lawsuits by the ACLU (and similar organizations) against mental institutions.\nFederal income tax and payroll tax levels.\nDuring the Reagan administration, fiscal year federal receipts grew from $599 billion to $991 billion (an increase of 65%) while fiscal year federal outlays grew from $678 billion to $1144 billion (an increase of 69%). According to a 1996 report of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress, during Reagan's two terms, and through 1993, the top 10% of taxpayers paid an increased share of income taxes (not including payroll taxes) to the Federal government, while the lowest 50% of taxpayers paid a reduced share of income tax revenue. Personal income tax revenues declined from 9.4% GDP in 1981 to 8.3% GDP in 1989, while payroll tax revenues increased from 6.0% GDP to 6.7% GDP during the same period.\nTax receipts.\nBoth CBO and the Reagan Administration forecast that individual and business income tax revenues would be lower if the Reagan tax cut proposals were implemented, relative to a policy baseline without those cuts, by about $50 billion in 1982 and $210 billion by 1986. According to a 2003 Treasury study, the tax cuts in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 resulted in a significant decline in revenue relative to a baseline without the cuts, approximately $111 billion (in 1992 dollars) on average during the first four years after implementation or nearly 3% GDP annually. Other tax bills had neutral or, in the case of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, a (~+1% of GDP) increase in revenue as a share of GDP. The study did not examine the longer-term impact of Reagan tax policy, including sunset clauses and \"the long-run, fully-phased-in effect of the tax bills\". The fact that tax receipts \"as a percentage of GDP\" fell following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 shows a decrease in tax burden as share of GDP and a commensurate increase in the deficit, as spending did not fall relative to GDP. Total federal tax receipts increased in every Reagan year except 1982, at an annual average rate of 6.2% compared to 10.8% during the preceding eight years.\nThe effect of Reagan's 1981 tax cuts (reduced revenue relative to a baseline without the cuts) were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax increases that had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977, and further increases by Reagan in 1983 and following years, also to counter the uses of tax shelters. An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation.\nDebt and government expenditures.\nReagan was inaugurated in January 1981, making the first fiscal year (FY) he budgeted 1982 and the final budget 1989. \nBusiness and market performance.\nNominal after-tax corporate profits grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3.0% during Reagan's eight years, compared to 13.0% during the preceding eight years. The S&amp;P 500 Index increased 113.3% during the 2024 trading days under Reagan, compared to 10.4% during the preceding 2024 trading days. The business sector share of GDP, measured as gross private domestic investment, declined by 0.7 percentage points under Reagan, after increasing 0.7 percentage points during the preceding eight years.\nSize of federal government.\nThe federal government's share of GDP increased 0.2 percentage points under Reagan, while it decreased 1.5 percentage points during the preceding eight years. The number of federal civilian employees increased 4.2% during Reagan's eight years, compared to 6.5% during the preceding eight years.\nAs a candidate, Reagan asserted he would shrink government by abolishing the Cabinet-level departments of energy and education. He abolished neither, but elevated veterans affairs from independent agency status to Cabinet-level department status.\nIncome distribution.\nContinuing a trend that began in the 1970s, income inequality grew and accelerated in the 1980s. \"The Economist\" wrote in 2006: \"After the 1973 oil shocks, productivity growth suddenly slowed. A few years later, at the start of the 1980s, the gap between rich and poor began to widen.\" According to the CBO: \nAnalysis.\nAccording to a 1996 study by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key economic variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. The study asserted that real median family income grew by $4,000 during the eight Reagan years and experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years. The Cato study was dismissive of any positive effects of tightening, and subsequent loosening, of Federal Reserve monetary policy under \"inflation hawk\" Paul Volcker, whom President Carter had appointed in 1979 to halt the persistent inflation of the 1970s.\nEconomic analyst Stephen Moore stated in the Cato analysis, \"No act in the last quarter century had a more profound impact on the U.S. economy of the eighties and nineties than the Reagan tax cut of 1981.\" He argued that Reagan's tax cuts, combined with an emphasis on federal monetary policy, deregulation, and expansion of free trade created a sustained economic expansion, the greatest American sustained wave of prosperity ever. He also writes that the American economy grew by more than a third in size, producing a $15 trillion increase in American wealth. Consumer and investor confidence soared. Cutting federal income taxes, cutting the U.S. government spending budget, cutting programs, scaling down the government work force, maintaining low interest rates, and keeping a watchful inflation hedge on the monetary supply was Ronald Reagan's formula for a successful economic turnaround.\nMilton Friedman stated, \"Reaganomics had four simple principles: Lower marginal tax rates, less regulation, restrained government spending, noninflationary monetary policy. Though Reagan did not achieve all of his goals, he made good progress.\"\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 and its impact on the alternative minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.\nEconomist Paul Krugman argued the economic expansion during the Reagan administration was primarily the result of the business cycle and the monetary policy by Paul Volcker. Krugman argues that there was nothing unusual about the economy under Reagan because unemployment was reducing from a high peak and that it is consistent with Keynesian economics for the economy to grow as employment increases if inflation remains low. Krugman has also criticized Reaganomics from the standpoint of wealth and income inequality. He argues that the Reagan era tax cuts ended the post-World War II \"Great Compression\" of wealth held by the rich.\nThe CBO Historical Tables indicate that federal spending during Reagan's two terms (FY 1981\u201388) averaged 22.4% GDP, well above the 20.6% GDP average from 1971 to 2009. In addition, the public debt rose from 26.1% GDP in 1980 to 41.0% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2,052 billion in 1988, a three-fold increase. Krugman argued in June 2012 that Reagan's policies were consistent with Keynesian stimulus theories, pointing to the significant increase in per-capita spending under Reagan.\nWilliam Niskanen noted that during the Reagan years, privately held federal debt increased from 22% to 38% of GDP, despite a long peacetime expansion. Second, the savings and loan problem led to an additional debt of about $125 billion. Third, greater enforcement of U.S. trade laws increased the share of U.S. imports subjected to trade restrictions from 12% in 1980 to 23% in 1988.\nEconomists Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales pointed out that many deregulation efforts had either taken place or had begun before Reagan (note the deregulation of airlines and trucking under Carter, and the beginning of deregulatory reform in railroads, telephones, natural gas, and banking). They stated, \"The move toward markets preceded the leader [Reagan] who is seen as one of their saviors.\" Economists Paul Joskow and Roger Noll made a similar contention.\nEconomist William A. Niskanen, a member of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers wrote that deregulation had the \"lowest priority\" of the items on the Reagan agenda given that Reagan \"failed to sustain the momentum for deregulation initiated in the 1970s\" and that he \"added more trade barriers than any administration since Hoover.\" By contrast, economist Milton Friedman has pointed to the number of pages added to the Federal Register each year as evidence of Reagan's anti-regulation presidency (the Register records the rules and regulations that federal agencies issue per year). The number of pages added to the Register each year declined sharply at the start of the Ronald Reagan presidency breaking a steady and sharp increase since 1960. The increase in the number of pages added per year resumed an upward, though less steep, trend after Reagan left office. In contrast, the number of pages being added each year increased under Ford, Carter, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. The number of pages in Federal Register is however criticized as an extremely crude measure of regulatory activity, because it can be easily manipulated (e.g. font sizes have been changed to keep page count low). The apparent contradiction between Niskanen's statements and Friedman's data may be resolved by seeing Niskanen as referring to \"statutory\" deregulation (laws passed by Congress) and Friedman to \"administrative\" deregulation (rules and regulations implemented by federal agencies). A 2016 study by the Congressional Research Service found that Reagan's average annual number of final federal regulatory rules published in the Federal Register was higher than during the Clinton, George W. Bush or Obama's administrations, even though the Reagan economy was considerably smaller than during those later presidents. Another study by the QuantGov project of the libertarian Mercatus Center found that the Reagan administration added restrictive regulations \u2014 containing such terms as \"shall,\" \"prohibited\" or \"may not\" \u2014 at a faster average annual rate than did Clinton, Bush or Obama.\nGreg Mankiw, a conservative Republican economist who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, wrote in 2007:\nI used the phrase \"charlatans and cranks\" in the first edition of my principles textbook to describe some of the economic advisers to Ronald Reagan, who told him that broad-based income tax cuts would have such large supply-side effects that the tax cuts would raise tax revenue. I did not find such a claim credible, based on the available evidence. I never have, and I still don't ... My other work has remained consistent with this view. In a paper on dynamic scoring, written while I was working at the White House, Matthew Weinzierl and I estimated that a broad-based income tax cut (applying to both capital and labor income) would recoup only about a quarter of the lost revenue through supply-side growth effects. For a cut in capital income taxes, the feedback is larger \u2014 about 50 percent \u2014 but still well under 100 percent. A chapter on dynamic scoring in the 2004 Economic Report of the President says about the same thing.\nGlenn Hubbard, who preceded Mankiw as Bush's CEA chair, also disputed the assertion that tax cuts increase tax revenues, writing in his 2003 Economic Report of the President: \"Although the economy grows in response to tax reductions (because of higher consumption in the short run and improved incentives in the long run), it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity.\"\nIn 1986, Martin Feldstein \u2014 a self-described \"traditional supply sider\" who served as Reagan's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1984 \u2014 characterized the \"new supply siders\" who emerged circa 1980:\nWhat distinguished the new supply siders from the traditional supply siders as the 1980s began was not the policies they advocated but the claims that they made for those policies ... The \"new\" supply siders were much more extravagant in their claims. They projected rapid growth, dramatic increases in tax revenue, a sharp rise in saving, and a relatively painless reduction in inflation. The height of supply side hyperbole was the \"Laffer curve\" proposition that the tax cut would actually increase tax revenue because it would unleash an enormously depressed supply of effort. Another remarkable proposition was the claim that even if the tax cuts did lead to an increased budget deficit, that would not reduce the funds available for investment in plant and equipment because tax changes would raise the saving rate by enough to finance the increased deficit ... Nevertheless, I have no doubt that the loose talk of the supply side extremists gave fundamentally good policies a bad name and led to quantitative mistakes that not only contributed to subsequent budget deficits but that also made it more difficult to modify policy when those deficits became apparent.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded by Ikutaro Kakehashi in Osaka in 1972. In 2005, its headquarters relocated to Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture. It has factories in Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States. As of December 2022, it employed 2,783 people. In 2014, it was subject to a management buyout by its CEO, Junichi Miki, supported by Taiyo Pacific Partners.\nRoland has manufactured numerous instruments that have had lasting impacts on music, such as the Juno-106 synthesizer, TB-303 bass synthesizer, and TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines. It was also instrumental in the development of MIDI, a standardized means of synchronizing electronic instruments manufactured by different companies. In 2016, \"Fact\" wrote that Roland had arguably had more influence on electronic music than any other company.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nRoland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi had founded Ace Electronic Industries in 1960, with Ace having designed and manufactured electronic organs, drum machines, instrument amplifiers, and effects pedals. In March 1972, after one of Ace's major investors, Sakata Shokai, was acquired by Sumitomo Chemical (an industrial company with no interest in the music industry), Kakehashi resigned.\n1970s.\nOn 18 April 1972, just a month after resigning from Ace, Kakehashi founded Roland in Osaka, Kakehashi, who had no musical training, wanted to appeal to amateurs and hobbyists, and focused on miniaturization, affordability, and simplicity.\nThe \"Roland\" name was selected for export purposes, as Kakehashi was interested in a name that was easy to pronounce for his worldwide target markets. The name was found in a telephone directory, and Kakehashi was satisfied with the simple two-syllable word and its soft consonants. The letter \"R\" was chosen because it was not used by many other music equipment companies, so would stand out in trade-show directories and industry listings. Kakehashi did not learn of the French epic poem \"The Song of Roland\" until later.\nWith seven employees from his former company, a rented shed, and $100,000, Kakehashi built on his experience at Ace, introducing a drum machine, the TR-77 or Rhythm 77, as Roland's first product, followed by the TR-33 and TR-55 released that same year. In 1973, Roland introduced the first compact synthesizer produced in Japan and the first synthesizer produced by Roland, the SH-1000, as well as their first non-preset synthesizer, the SH-3.\nThe company was also manufacturing effects units, introducing the RE-201 Space Echo in 1974, and expanding into guitar amplifiers the following year with the JC-60 and JC-120 Jazz Chorus, whose chorus circuit would become the first BOSS product, the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, the following year. In 1976, Roland introduced the semi-modular System 100 and the modular System 700 synthesizers.\nIn 1977, the company introduced one of the earliest microprocessor-driven music sequencers, the MC-8 MicroComposer, and the first guitar synthesizer, the GR-500. Just one year later, they introduced the CompuRhythm CR-78, the first drum machine that enabled users to program and store their own drum patterns.\n1980s.\nFollowing the bankruptcy of its European distributor in 1980, Roland established new distribution companies in the UK, Germany, Scandinavia, and Switzerland the following year. Over the next several years, Roland released several instruments that have had a lasting influence on popular music. After Kakehashi realized microprocessors could be used to program drum machines, Roland launched the TR-808 Rhythm Composer, its first programmable drum machines, in 1980. Although it was not an immediate commercial success, the 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine and became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic and hip hop genres. It has been described as hip hop's equivalent to the Fender Stratocaster guitar, which dramatically influenced the development of rock music. The 808 was followed in 1983 by the TR-909, which, alongside the TB-303 Bass Line synthesizer, influenced the development of dance music such as techno, house, and acid.\nRoland released a new flagship synthesizer, the Jupiter-8 in 1981, and introduced the SH-101 analog monosynth and the first Juno-series polysynths, the Juno-6 and Juno-60, the following year. Roland played a key role in the development of MIDI, a standardized means of synchronizing electronic musical instruments manufactured by different companies. Kakehashi proposed developing a standard with representatives from Oberheim, Sequential Circuits, Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai. He and Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits unveiled MIDI in 1983. It remains the industry standard.\nThe company introduced the first JX-series synthesizer, the 6-voice JX-3P, in 1983; the 8-voice JX-8P and 12-voice JX-10 followed in 1985 and 1986. The D-50, which popularized sample-based synthesis, was introduced in 1987, and was the bestselling synth that year.\n1990s.\nIn, 1991 Roland released the JD-800, a digital synthesizer with many sliders. In 1993, they released the JD-990, which is the rackmount version of the JD-800. In 1994, Kakehashi founded the Roland Foundation and became chairman. In 1995, he was appointed the chairman of Roland Corporation.\nRoland instruments were also featured in the \"There Goes A . . . \" series of videos by Dave Hood.\n2000s.\nIn 2001, Kakehashi resigned as chair of Roland Corporation and was appointed as a special executive adviser. In 2002, he published an autobiography, \"I Believe in Music.\" His second book, \"An Age Without Samples: Originality and Creativity in the Digital World\", was published in 2017.\n2010s.\nIn 2018, Roland launched a subscription service called Roland Cloud. Users of the service can download and emulate a number of Roland synthesizers (modelled through a proprietary paradigm called \"ACB\") and drum machines in audio plugin formats. This collection also includes orchestral modules (namely the Roland SRX racks) and new additions such as original sampled instruments. \n2020s.\nThroughout 2022, Roland celebrated their 50th anniversary by releasing two new editions of their Space Echo tape delay through their Boss brand, along with selling commemorative merchandise and clothing through their online streetswear shop \"Roland Lifestyle\". Later on, a collaboration with Dais Records was announced on 8 June ahead of the release of the JUNO-X synthesizer the following month. A new Jupiter-4 emulation for Roland Cloud and an NFT collection also materialised in the summer and autumn respectively.\nBrands.\nRoland markets products under a number of brand names, each of which is used on products geared toward a different niche.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26532", "revid": "22380047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26532", "title": "Rhys ap Gruffudd", "text": "Rhys ap Gruffudd or (often anglicised to \"Griffith\"; c. 1132 \u2013 28 April 1197) was the ruler of the kingdom of Deheubarth in south Wales from 1155 to 1197. Today, he is commonly known as The Lord Rhys, in Welsh \"Yr Arglwydd Rhys\", although this title may have not been used in his lifetime. He usually used the title \"Proprietary Prince of Deheubarth\" or \"Prince of South Wales\", but two documents have been discovered in which he uses the title \"Prince of Wales\" or \"Prince of the Welsh\". \nAt the time, the word \"prince\", deriving as it did from the Latin \"princeps\", meant \"first person, chief leader; ruler, sovereign.\" It was not until the 14th century that it came to mean \"heir to the throne\". Thus, Rhys, by designating himself princeps, was calling himself the principal ruler of Wales.\nRhys was one of the most successful and powerful Welsh rulers, and, after the death of Owain Gwynedd of Gwynedd in 1170, the dominant power in Wales.\nRhys's grandfather, Rhys ap Tewdwr, was king of Deheubarth, and was killed at Brecon in 1093 by Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9. Following his death, most of Deheubarth was taken over by the Normans. Rhys's father, Gruffudd ap Rhys, eventually was able to become ruler of a small portion, and more territory was won back by Rhys's older brothers after Gruffudd's death. Rhys became ruler of Deheubarth in 1155. He was forced to submit to King Henry II of England in 1158. Henry invaded Deheubarth in 1163, stripped Rhys of all his lands and took him prisoner. A few weeks later he was released and given back a small part of his holdings. Rhys made an alliance with Owain Gwynedd and, after the failure of another invasion of Wales by Henry in 1165, was able to win back most of his lands.\nIn 1171 Rhys made peace with King Henry and was confirmed in possession of his recent conquests as well as being named Justiciar of South Wales. He maintained good relations with King Henry until the latter's death in 1189. Following Henry's death Rhys revolted against Richard I and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory, capturing a number of castles. In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffudd, who maintained a feud with each other. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196 and captured a number of castles. The following year he died unexpectedly and was buried in St Davids Cathedral.\nGenealogy and early life.\nRhys was the fourth son of Gruffydd ap Rhys, ruler of part of Deheubarth, by his wife Gwenllian ferch Gruffudd, daughter of Gruffudd ap Cynan, king of Gwynedd. His next older brother was Maredudd ap Gruffydd, and there were older brothers, Morgan and Maelgwn, who were killed in battle with their mother in 1136. He also had two older half-brothers, Anarawd and Cadell, from his father's first marriage. Rhys married Gwenllian ferch Madog, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, the last Prince of all Powys.\nHis grandfather, Rhys ap Tewdwr, had been king of all Deheubarth until his death in 1093. Rhys ap Tewdwr was killed in Brycheiniog, and most of his kingdom was taken over by Norman lords. Gruffudd ap Rhys was forced to flee to Ireland. He later returned to Deheubarth and ruled a portion of the kingdom, but was forced to flee to Ireland again in 1127. When Rhys was born in 1132, his father held only the commote of Caeo in Cantref Mawr.\nThe death of King Henry I of England, and the ensuing Anarchy arising from the rival claims of Stephen and Matilda to the English throne, gave the Welsh the opportunity to rise against the Normans. A revolt spread through south Wales in 1136, and Gruffudd ap Rhys, aided by his two eldest sons, Anarawd and Cadell, defeated the Normans in a battle near Loughor, killing over five hundred. After driving Walter de Clifford out of Cantref Bychan, Gruffudd set off to Gwynedd to enlist the help of his father-in-law, Gruffudd ap Cynan. In the absence of her husband, Gwenllian led an army against the Norman lordship of Cydweli (Kidwelly), taking along her two oldest sons, Morgan and Maelgwn. She was defeated and killed by an army commanded by Maurice de Londres of Oystermouth Castle. Morgan was also killed and Maelgwn captured.\nGruffudd formed an alliance with Gwynedd, and later in 1136 the sons of Gruffudd ap Cynan, Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladr ap Gruffudd, led an army to Ceredigion. Their combined forces won a decisive victory over the Normans at the Battle of Crug Mawr. Ceredigion was reclaimed from the Normans, but was annexed by Gwynedd as the senior partner in the alliance. Gruffudd ap Rhys continued his campaign against the Normans in 1137, but died later that year. The leadership of the family now passed to Rhys' half-brother Anarawd ap Gruffudd. In 1143, when Rhys was eleven, Anarawd was murdered, a death arranged for by Cadwaladr ap Gruffudd, brother of Owain Gwynedd, king of Gwynedd. Owain punished Cadwaladr by depriving him of his lands in Ceredigion.\nFirst battles (1146\u20131155).\nAnarawd's brother, Cadell ap Gruffydd, took over as head of the family. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, rebuilt Carmarthen Castle in 1145, then began a campaign to reclaim Ceredigion. He built a castle in the commote of Mabudryd, but Cadell, aided by Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd who held Ceredigion for Gwynedd, destroyed it in 1146. Rhys appears in the annals for the first time in 1146, fighting alongside his brothers Cadell and Maredudd in the capture by assault of Llansteffan Castle. This was followed by the capture of Wiston in 1147, Carmarthen in 1150 and Loughor in 1151. In 1151 Cadell was attacked while out hunting by a group of Norman and Flemish knights from Tenby, and left for dead. He survived, but suffered injuries which left him unable to play an active role, and in 1153 he left on a pilgrimage to Rome.\nMaredudd became ruler of Deheubarth and continued a campaign, begun in 1150, aimed at recovering Ceredigion, which had been held by Gwynedd since 1136. Maredudd and Rhys drove Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd from Ceredigion by 1153. The same year Rhys is recorded as an independent commander for the first time, leading an army to capture the Norman castle of St Clears. Maredudd and Rhys also destroyed the castles at Tenby and Aberafan that year. Maredudd died in 1155 at the age of twenty-five and left Rhys as ruler of Deheubarth. Around this time he married Gwenllian ferch Madog, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, prince of Powys.\nEarly reign.\nLoss of territory (1155\u20131163).\nShortly after becoming ruler of Deheubarth, Rhys heard rumours that Owain Gwynedd was planning to invade Ceredigion in order to reclaim it for Gwynedd. Rhys responded by building a castle at Aberdyfi in 1156. The threatened invasion did not take place, and Turvey claims that Owain's intention may have been to test the resolve of the new ruler.\nKing Stephen had died in October 1154, bringing to an end the long dispute with the Empress Matilda which had helped Anarawd, Cadell and Maredudd to extend their rule in Deheubarth. With disunity within the realm no longer a problem, the new king of England, Henry II, soon turned his attention to Wales. He began with an invasion of Gwynedd in 1157. This invasion was not entirely successful, but Owain Gwynedd was induced to seek terms and to give up some territory in the north-east of Wales.\nThe following year, Henry prepared an invasion of Deheubarth. Rhys made plans to resist, but was persuaded by his council to meet the king to discuss peace terms. The terms were much harsher than those offered to Owain: Rhys was stripped of all his possessions apart from Cantref Mawr, though he was promised one other cantref. The other territories were returned to their Norman lords.\nAmong the Normans who returned to their holdings was Walter de Clifford, who reclaimed Cantref Bychan, then invaded Rhys's lands in Cantref Mawr. An appeal to the king produced no response, and Rhys resorted to arms, first capturing Clifford's castle at Llandovery then seizing Ceredigion. King Henry responded by preparing another invasion, and Rhys submitted without resistance. He was obliged to give hostages, probably including his son Hywel.\nThe king was absent in France in 1159, and Rhys took the opportunity to attack Dyfed and then to lay siege to Carmarthen, which was saved by a relief force led by Earl Reginald of Cornwall. Rhys retreated to Cantref Mawr, where an army led by five earls, the Earls of Cornwall, Gloucester, Hertford, Pembroke and Salisbury, marched against him. The earls were assisted by Cadwaladr, brother of Owain Gwynedd, and Owain's sons, Hywel and Cynan. However, they were forced to withdraw and a truce was arranged. In 1162, Rhys again attempted to recover some of his lost lands, and captured Llandovery castle. The following year Henry II returned to England after an absence of four years and prepared for another invasion of Deheubarth. Rhys met the king to discuss terms and was obliged to give more hostages, including another son, Maredudd. He was then seized and taken to England as a prisoner. Henry appears to have been uncertain what to do with Rhys, but after a few weeks decided to free him and allow him to rule Cantref Mawr. Rhys was summoned to appear before Henry at Woodstock to do homage together with Owain Gwynedd and Malcolm IV of Scotland.\nWelsh uprising (1164\u20131170).\nIn 1164 all the Welsh princes united in an uprising. Warren suggests that when Rhys and Owain were obliged to do homage to Henry in 1163 they were forced to accept a status of dependent vassalage instead of their previous client status, and that this led to the revolt. Rhys had other reasons for rebellion, for he had returned to Deheubarth from England to find that the neighbouring Norman lords were threatening Cantref Mawr. His nephew, Einion ab Anarawd, who was the captain of his bodyguard, had been murdered at the instigation of Roger de Clare, Earl of Hertford. The murderer had been given the protection of the Clares in Ceredigion. Rhys first appealed to the king to intercede; when this failed, he invaded Ceredigion and recaptured all of it apart from the town and castle of Cardigan. The Welsh revolt led to another invasion of Wales by King Henry in 1165. Henry attacked Gwynedd first, but instead of following the usual invasion route along the north coast he attacked from the south, following a route over the Berwyn hills. He was met by the united forces of the Welsh princes, led by Owain Gwynedd and including Rhys. According to \"Brut y Tywysogion\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTorrential rain forced Henry's army to retreat in disorder without fighting a major battle, and Henry vented his spleen on the hostages, having Rhys's son Maredudd blinded. Rhys's other son, Hywel, was not among the victims. Rhys returned to Deheubarth where he captured and burned Cardigan Castle. He allowed the garrison to depart, but held the castellan, Robert Fitz-Stephen, as a prisoner. Shortly afterwards Rhys captured Cilgerran castle.\nIn 1167 he joined Owain Gwynedd in an attack on Owain Cyfeiliog of southern Powys, and spent three weeks helping Owain besiege the Norman castle of Rhuddlan. In 1168 he attacked the Normans at Builth, destroying its castle. Rhys benefited from the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 and 1170, which was largely led by the Cambro-Norman lords of south Wales. In 1167 the King of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, who had been driven out of his kingdom, had asked Rhys to release Robert Fitz-Stephen from captivity to take part in an expedition to Ireland. Rhys did not oblige at the time, but released him the following year and in 1169 Fitz-Stephen led the vanguard of a Norman army which landed in Wexford. The leader of the Norman forces, Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, known as \"Strongbow\", followed in 1170. According to Warren, \"they were prompted to go by a growing suspicion that King Henry did not intend to renew his offensive against the Welsh, but was instead seeking an accommodation with the Welsh leaders\". The departure of the Norman lords enabled Rhys to strengthen his position, and the death of Owain Gwynedd in late 1170 left him as the acknowledged leader of the Welsh princes.\nLater reign.\nPeace with King Henry (1171\u20131188).\nIn 1171 King Henry II arrived in England from France, on his way to Ireland. Henry wished to ensure that Richard de Clare, who had married Diarmait's daughter and become heir to Leinster, did not establish an independent Norman kingdom in Ireland. His decision to try a different approach in his dealings with the Welsh was influenced by the events in Ireland, although Warren suggests that \"it seems likely that Henry began rethinking his attitude to the Welsh soon after the d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of 1165\". Henry now wished to make peace with Rhys, who came to Newnham to meet him. Rhys was to pay a tribute of 300 horses and 4,000 head of cattle, but was confirmed in possession of all the lands he had taken from Norman lords, including the Clares. They met again in October that year at Pembroke as Henry waited to cross to Ireland. Rhys had collected 86 of the 300 horses, but Henry agreed to take only 36 of them and remitted the remainder of the tribute until after his return from Ireland. Rhys's son, Hywel, who had been held as a hostage for many years, was returned to him. Henry and Rhys met once more at Laugharne as Henry returned from Ireland in 1172, and shortly afterwards Henry appointed Rhys \"justice on his behalf in all Deheubarth\". According to A. D. Carr:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This meant the delegation to him of any authority which the king might have claimed over his fellow Welsh rulers; it might also have involved some authority over the king's Anglo-Norman subjects... Rhys was more than a native Welsh ruler; he was one of the great feudatories of the Angevin empire.\nThe agreement between Henry and Rhys was to last until Henry's death in 1189. When Henry's sons rebelled against him in 1173 Rhys sent his son Hywel Sais to Normandy to aid the king, then in 1174 personally led an army to Tutbury in Staffordshire to assist at the siege of the stronghold of the rebel Earl William de Ferrers. When Rhys returned to Wales after the fall of Tutbury, he left a thousand men with the king for service in Normandy. King Henry held a council at Gloucester in 1175 which was attended by a large gathering of Welsh princes, led by Rhys. It appears to have concluded with the swearing of a mutual assistance pact for the preservation of peace and order in Wales. In 1177 Rhys, Dafydd ab Owain, who had emerged as the main power in Gwynedd, and Cadwallon ap Madog from Rhwng Gwy a Hafren swore fealty and liege homage to Henry at a council held at Oxford. At this council the king gave Meirionnydd, part of the kingdom of Gwynedd, to Rhys.\nRhys built a number of stone castles, starting with Cardigan Castle, which was the earliest-recorded native-built stone castle in Wales. He also built Carreg Cennen Castle near Llandeilo, a castle set in a spectacular position on a mountain top. He held a festival of poetry and song at his court at Cardigan over Christmas 1176. This is generally regarded as the first recorded Eisteddfod. The festival was announced a year in advance throughout Wales and in England, Scotland, Ireland and possibly France. Two chairs were awarded as prizes, one for the best poem and the other for the best musical performance. J. E. Caerwyn Williams suggests that this event may be an adaptation of the similar French \"puys\". R.R. Davies suggests that the texts of Welsh law, traditionally codified by Hywel Dda at Whitland, were first assembled in book form under the aegis of Rhys.\nRhys founded two religious houses during this period. Talley Abbey was the first Premonstratensian abbey in Wales, while Llanllyr was a Cistercian nunnery, only the second nunnery to be founded in Wales and the first to prosper. He became the patron of the abbeys of Whitland and Strata Florida and made large grants to both houses. Giraldus Cambrensis, who was related to Rhys, gives an account of his meetings with Rhys in 1188 when Giraldus accompanied Archbishop Baldwin around Wales to raise men for the Third Crusade. Some Welsh clerics were not happy about this visit, but Rhys was enthusiastic and gave the Archbishop a great deal of assistance. Giraldus says that Rhys decided to go on crusade himself and spent several weeks making preparations, but was eventually persuaded to change his mind by his wife Gwenllian, \"by female artifices\".\nFinal campaigns (1189\u20131196).\nHenry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by Richard I. Rhys considered that he was no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest and Gower, and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.\nIn his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffudd. In 1189 Gruffudd persuaded Rhys to imprison Maelgwn, and he was given into Gruffudd's keeping at Dinefwr. Gruffudd handed him over to his father-in-law, William de Braose. Gruffudd is also said to have persuaded his father to annex the lordship of Cemais and its chief castle of Nevern, held by William FitzMartin, in 1191. This action was criticised by Giraldus Cambrensis, who describes Gruffudd as \"a cunning and artful man\". William FitzMartin was married to Rhys's daughter Angharad, and, according to Giraldus, Rhys \"had solemnly sworn, by the most precious relics, that his indemnity and security should be faithfully maintained\". Rhys had also annexed the Norman lordships of Cydweli and Carnwyllion in 1190. In 1192 Rhys secured Maelgwn's release, but by now Maelgwn and Gruffudd were bitter enemies. In 1194 Rhys was defeated in battle by Maelgwn and Hywel, who imprisoned him in Nevern castle, though Hywel later released his father without Maelgwn's consent. Giraldus suggests that Rhys's incarceration in Nevern castle was divine vengeance for the dispossession of William FitzMartin. In 1195 two other sons, Rhys Gryg and Maredudd, seized Llanymddyfri and Dinefwr, and Rhys responded by imprisoning them. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196. He captured a number of castles, including Carmarthen, Colwyn, Radnor and Painscastle, and defeated an army led by Roger de Mortimer and Hugh de Say near Radnor, with forty knights among the dead. This was Rhys' last battle. William de Braose offered terms, and Painscastle was returned to him.\nDeath and aftermath (1197).\nRhys died on 28 April 1197, unexpectedly, and was buried in St Davids Cathedral. The chronicler of \"Brut y Tywysogion\" records for 1197:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRhys died excommunicate, having quarreled with the Bishop of St Davids, Peter de Leia, over the theft of some of the bishop's horses some years previously. Before he could be buried in the cathedral, the bishop had his corpse scourged in posthumous penance.\nRhys had nominated his eldest legitimate son, Gruffudd ap Rhys, as his successor, and soon after his father's death Gruffudd met the Justiciar, Archbishop Hubert Walter, on the border and was confirmed as heir. Maelgwn, the eldest son but illegitimate, refused to accept this and was given military assistance by Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys. Maelgwn took the town and castle of Aberystwyth and captured Gruffudd, whom he handed over to the custody of Gwenwynwyn. Gwenwynwyn later handed him over to the king, who imprisoned him at Corfe Castle.\nCharacter and historical assessment.\nGiraldus Cambrensis frequently mentions Rhys in his writings and describes him as \"a man of excellent wit and quick in repartee\". Gerald tells the story of a banquet at Hereford in 1186 where Rhys sat between two members of the Clare family. What could have been a tense affair, since Rhys had seized lands in Ceredigion previously held by the Clare family, passed off with an exchange of courteous compliments, followed by some good-natured banter between Rhys and Gerald about their family connections. Rhys gave Gerald and Archbishop Baldwin a great deal of assistance when they visited Wales to raise troops for the crusade in 1188, and Gerald several times refers to his \"kindness\" and says that Rhys accompanied them all the way from Cardigan to the northern border of Ceredigion \"with a liberality peculiarly praiseworthy in so illustrious a prince\".\nAnother contemporary writer also wrote of Rhys if Roger Turvey is correct in stating that Walter Map's piece \"Of the King Appollonides\" deals with Rhys under a pseudonym. Map was less favourably disposed toward Rhys, describing him as \"This king I have seen and know, and hate\", but goes on to say \"I would not have my hatred blacken his worth; it is not my wish ever to suppress any man's excellence through envy\". He tells the following story about Apollonides/Rhys:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This same man gave provisions to his enemies when besieged and driven by risk of famine to capitulate; he wished them to be overcome by his own strength and not by want of bread; and though he deferred victory, he increased the renown of it.\nDavies provides the following assessment of Rhys:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rhys's career was indeed a remarkable one. Its very length was a tribute to his stamina and skill: he had occupied the stage of Welsh politics for over fifty years, from his first appearance in his early 'teens, at the capture of Llansteffan castle in 1146, to his death in 1197. But it was his achievement which was astounding: he had reconstituted the kingdom of Deheubarth and made it the premier Welsh kingdom. For once, the poet's compliment was well deserved: Rhys had restored \"the majesty of the South\".\nDavies also notes two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the personal nature of his accord with Henry II, which meant that it did not survive Henry's death. The other was his inability to control his sons or to force them to accept Gruffudd as his successor.\nChildren.\nRhys had at least nine sons and eight daughters. Three of the sons were named Maredudd and two of the daughters were named Gwenllian.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26534", "revid": "34128202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26534", "title": "Rachel Summers", "text": "Marvel Comics fictional character\nRachel Anne Summers is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-plotter John Byrne.\nIn her first appearance, the character's surname was not revealed; in later appearances, she was established as the daughter of the alternate future counterparts to Cyclops and Jean Grey-Summers from the dystopian Days of Future Past timeline. Although there are other characters bearing her name throughout the multiverse, she herself is considered a multiversal anomaly with no true alternate-universe counterparts.\nThe character is a mutant with similar abilities to her mother, including telepathy, telekinesis, and a connection to the Phoenix Force. Throughout her publication history, she has also been referred to by the monikers Marvel Girl, Phoenix, Prestige, and Mother Askani (later simply Askani).\nPublication history.\nRachel first appeared in \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #141 (Jan. 1981) and has since been affiliated with several comic book superhero teams including the X-Men and Excalibur.\nIn 2022, she joined the Knights of X team as part of the Destiny of X era under the leadership of Captain Britain, who takes a group of mutants under her wing leading them into the Otherworld. The title was the follow-up to the 2019's Excalibur relaunch and was written by Tini Howard. In its fourth issue, Rachel Summers and her long-time friend Betsy Braddock confessed their romantic feelings for each other and their kiss was shown in a splash page.\nFictional character biography.\nFuture adolescence.\nRachel Anne Summers comes from an alternate future Earth known as Earth-811, as seen in the \"Days of Future Past\" storyline from \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #141\u2013142. In this reality, the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly provoked the ratification of the Mutant Registration Act, leading to a dystopian future where the mutant-hunting Sentinel robots rule North America. Rachel was abducted by operatives working for Ahab, who used drugs and hypnotherapy to turn Rachel into the mutant-hunting \"Hound\". She fulfilled her duties, but her psychic powers linked her to her victims; fueling her grief and despair until she attacked Ahab and scarred him. In return, he sent her to the mutant concentration camps. There, she befriended the surviving mutant rebels, including Wolverine, Magneto, Colossus, Storm, Kate Pryde, and her lover, the adult Franklin Richards.\nRachel managed to send Kate's consciousness into the past to her younger self to prevent the assassination, but it did not change their time. Rachel sent her astral form into the past to find out why and discovered she had sent Kate into an alternate past. On the way back, she encountered the disembodied Phoenix Force and it followed her to her present. Rachel passed out from the strain of astral projection and the Phoenix Force revealed itself to Kate, who asked it to give Rachel a fresh start.\nWhen Rachel and Kate broke into \"Project: Nimrod\" on a suicide mission to destroy a new model of Sentinel, they became trapped. When Kate spoke the words \"Dark Phoenix,\" the Phoenix Force ripped Rachel from her timeline and sent her body back to the alternate past to which she had sent Kate's consciousness. This was a past where she learned Jean Grey was dead and that her father was married to someone else. Rachel experienced additional heartache and displacement trauma when she discovered that her father's new wife, Madelyne Pryor, was pregnant with a son (Nathan Summers), because in her timeline she was the first-born child of Scott Summers.\nX-Men.\nRachel had a brief membership in the X-Men before finding a Shi'ar holoempathic crystal at her grandparents' home. The crystal was imprinted with a portion of Rachel's mother's essence inside it as a tribute to the family shortly after Jean Grey's death. After Rachel took a vow to remember her mother with the uniform and name of Phoenix, the Phoenix Force fully bonded with her. She was granted access to its power on a cosmic magnitude, albeit in a much more limited fashion than the Dark Phoenix. Soon after, the grudge which she had begun with Selene boiled over when Rachel secretly invaded the Hellfire Club. She did this with the intention of taking vengeance on Selene for the murders she had committed, particularly that of nightclub owner Nicholas Damiano, who had previously taken Rachel into his home after Selene had attacked her. Selene proved to be no match for Rachel's newly increased powers, but just as she was about to finish Selene, Wolverine arrived and was forced to stab Rachel in the chest. Critically injured, Rachel was lured into Spiral's \"Body Shoppe.\"\nExcalibur.\nMonths later, while recuperating from injuries on Muir Island, Shadowcat and Nightcrawler both had the same dream, where they were actors and helped Rachel, who was trapped there, escape. Shortly thereafter, Rachel escaped from the alternate reality of Mojoworld. Rachel has once been cited having a flashback to her time there where she is held in chains and tortured. The three former X-Men were joined by Captain Britain and Meggan and founded the British superhero team Excalibur. While part of the team, she discovered that this universe's version of her mother, Jean Grey, was alive. She attempted to bond with Jean, but Jean, upon discovering Rachel was the present host for the Phoenix, rejected any contact with her. Jean still resented the Phoenix Force for stealing a portion of her life. She also rejected Rachel because she felt that Rachel's existence was a constant reminder of the dystopian future she feared could still come to pass. Eventually, however, Jean moved past those feelings and formally welcomed Rachel into her life.\nAskani.\nRachel remained with Excalibur until an incident caused Captain Britain to be lost in the timestream. She exchanged places with the time-lost Captain Britain and emerged two thousand years in the future, in a world conquered by Apocalypse and crushed under his iron fist. She gathered together a group of rebels and founded the Askani. She trained one of her followers to travel back in time and bring her \"brother\" Nathan forward in time when he was infected with a techno-organic virus. The Askani cloned Nathan in case he was not able to survive the virus. Apocalypse's followers attacked the Askani and took the clone (who would later become the supervillain Stryfe), leaving Rachel critically injured. Hooked up to life support, she drew the minds of Scott and Jean into the future, as \"Slym\" and \"Redd\", to raise Nathan and tutor him in the use of his powers. Rachel finally died ten years later and sent Scott and Jean back to their original bodies seconds after they had left.\nAfter Nathan, now known as Cable, had finally defeated Apocalypse, he went into the timeline to retrieve Rachel. There, he discovered a Rachel \"sans\" Phoenix Force. With the premature death of Apocalypse, the Askani timeline had been diverged from the mainstream Marvel Universe, Earth-616. As a result, she had been flung into the far future, yet subjectively a short time after she had been lost in the timestream, as the slave of a creature called \"Gaunt\", who had used her to lead Cable there for a \"battle of the ages\". Cable defeated Gaunt in the battle and Rachel, now free, was able to use her residual Phoenix Force to return them both to the present. She then decided to take a break from superheroics and enrolled in college after she made Cable promise he would not tell anyone she was back. Despite her efforts to live a normal life, however, she was kidnapped by the telepath Elias Bogan and subsequently rescued by the X-Men.\nRachel Grey.\nShe decided to rejoin the X-Men, taking the name \"Marvel Girl\" to honor her mother (who had recently died yet again) and wearing a costume her mother had designed but never worn: a variation on Jean's first green costume. She also changed her last name to \"Grey\", possibly to express disapproval at her father's betrayal of Jean, as well as his continuing relationship with Emma Frost; though she and Emma made a truce of sorts during one of the team's missions in Hong Kong. Rachel and Nightcrawler began to have an attraction towards each other, kissing at one point, but nothing came of it as Nightcrawler also had an attraction to Storm at the time, who was in somewhat of a romantic \"friendship\" with Wolverine. Her stint with this team also included a visit to the Savage Land. In the storyline \"World's End\", which was heavily criticized by readers, Rachel was subjected to the mind-control of a tribe of advanced dinosaur people, the Hauk'ka, causing her to believe she belonged to their species. Afterward, she subconsciously used her telekinesis to change her own genome in their image. This was eventually reverted. After \"House of M\" and \"Decimation\", where most of the world's mutants lost their powers, the government had Sentinels instituted at the X-Mansion to protect the mutants in case any enemies used this low point to attack. Though their intentions were good this time, it reminded Rachel too much of the previous timeline when Sentinels herded mutants into concentration camps.\nRachel had a short stint with newly re-formed Excalibur, reminiscent of the former team, shortly after the \"House of M\" events. She assisted the team in battling Shadow-X and the Shadow King (in the guise of Professor X).\nEnd of Greys.\nRachel spent some time with her grandparents, bonding with her grandfather. At a family reunion with all her relatives, a commando unit under the order of the Shi'ar attacked the party, killing everyone in an effort to wipe out the Grey genome. The commando unit was unable to kill Rachel; instead, one member was able to graft a \"deathmark\" on her back that would allow them to find her wherever she went. It is assumed that the only remaining member of the Grey family now left on Earth besides Rachel is Cable. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shi'ar and was quoted as saying, \"I'm not my mom. I'm not the Phoenix. I'm my own woman. And by the time I'm done... they'll wish I \"was\" the Phoenix.\"\nThe Death Commandos later tracked Rachel to the psychiatry office of Dr. Maureen Lyszinski. Rachel, with the help of Psylocke, Nightcrawler, Bishop, and Cannonball, saved the doctor and took down the Death Commandos. She decided to imprison them, instead of killing them, by telling them, \"I mean to find destiny in a way that brings us both [Jean Grey] honor.\" She is also sometimes referenced as \"Starchilde\" in this series.\nRise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire.\nAfter Rachel was kidnapped, along with Cyclops, by her paternal uncle Vulcan, he freed Darwin from inside him. Later, Professor X recruited Rachel, along with Havok, Nightcrawler, Warpath, Darwin, and Polaris, for a space mission to stop Vulcan from laying waste to the Shi'ar empire. Xavier, who recently was stripped of his powers, recruited Rachel to serve as his telepathic \"eyes and ears\" during their mission. Aware of Rachel's vendetta against the Shi'ar, Xavier agreed to use their trip into space to find out who in the Shi'ar Empire gave the order to wipe out all members of the Grey family, and he warned Rachel that they will deal with the people responsible for her recent losses Xavier's way.\nWhile in space, the team was attacked by Korvus, a Shi'ar warrior sent to kill Rachel. Korvus' ancestor, Rook'shir, was a previous host of the Phoenix Force, and a small portion of the Phoenix's power was left behind in his sword, the Blade of the Phoenix. With this power, Korvus made short work of the other X-Men, but when Rachel blocked the sword, their minds were involuntarily linked. Through this link, Rachel learned that Korvus' family was also murdered by the Shi'ar government because of their connection to the Phoenix. The remaining echo of the Phoenix power from the sword was then transferred to Rachel. Rachel claimed that rather than having taken the power, the power chose to go to her, saying, \"The Phoenix knows me, remember? It likes me.\" When this happened, Rachel's normally gold energy aura turned blue, the same color as the Blade of the Phoenix. She then telekinetically disabled an explosive implant that the Shi'ar chancellor was using to force Korvus' obedience.\nDue to Rachel's connection to Korvus through the sword, she discovers the Phoenix Force formerly in the blade is just an echo, a \"blue shadow\", of the Force. The shadow of the Phoenix begins influencing Rachel's behavior, causing her to design a new darker uniform and begin a romance with Korvus. She soon breaks off the relationship after she realizes their bond is only because of the residual Phoenix Force.\nLeading up to the fight with Vulcan, Rachel is shown using her powers to kill the guards who stand in her way. Havok warns her not to, but Rachel tells him that they deserve to die after what they did to her family. When it comes to the big fight, Rachel shows just how powerful she is by protecting Korvus from one of Vulcan's blasts. Rachel is one of the X-Men stranded in Shi'ar space when their ship is sent back to Earth.\nAfter the death of her other grandfather, Corsair, at the hands of Vulcan, she, along with Havok, Polaris, Korvus, Ch'od, and Raza, become the new Starjammers. They elect to remain in Shi'ar space and restore Lilandra to the throne or die trying. As her uncle states, \"If they fail, he has no doubt that Vulcan will head for Earth.\"\nStarjammers.\nDuring the conflict, the Starjammers find another threat in the form of the Scy'ar Tal (translates as \"Death to the Shi'ar\"). Rachel makes contact with the eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the M'Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi`ar attacked them, killing a great number of their people and making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M'Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra and K'ythri. The M'Kraan then changed their name to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi`ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan made contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.\nDuring the ceasefire, Rachel comes into contact with the Death Commandos again and attempts to kill them to avenge the deaths of her relatives; however, she is deterred by Polaris. In the end, all the Starjammers are captured by the Shi'ar except Rachel, Korvus, and Lilandra.\nX-Men: Kingbreaker and War of Kings.\nRachel and the Starjammers play a large role in the sequel to the \"Emperor Vulcan\" miniseries called \"X-Men: Kingbreaker\". She is also seen prominently in the \"War of Kings\" storyline, which features Vulcan, the Inhumans, Nova, and the Guardians of the Galaxy.\nWhile with the Starjammers, in battle with Vulcan's new guard, the fragment of the \"blue\" Phoenix within her and Korvus' blade mysteriously leaves them. After the Phoenix echo leaves Rachel, she says \"please... not now... Mom.\" From this frame onward, the \"hound\" markings reappear on Rachel's face.\nIn agreement with the Inhumans, the Starjammers and the Guardians of the Galaxy assault a Shi'ar vessel to free Lilandra, hoping to end the conflict while restoring her to the throne. Even without her Phoenix powers, Rachel is powerful enough to entrap Gladiator in an illusion to keep him distracted from battle. Their gambit pays off and the group is able to free Lilandra.\nRachel is next seen as Lilandra's bodyguard along with the rest of the Starjammers. On the home planet of the Shi'ar, Lilandra assumes her throne, but while making a ceremonial gesture is killed by the murderer known as Razor, who possesses the Darkhawk armor. The only person who perceives this is Rachel, since Razor is shielded from the perceptions of others.\nAfter Lilandra is assassinated, Rachel fights alongside the Starjammers against the Shi'ar Guard and Araki, who has summoned the same Shi'ar commandos that killed Rachel's family and branded her with the Shi'ar death mark. Rachel uses her powers to implode Black Cloak's head, saying, \"He was the one... He killed my family,\" though killing him does not make her feel happier. Gladiator finishes the job by killing Araki himself. Rachel, along with the rest of the Starjammers, regroup later on and mourn the Shi'ar, as they doubt that they will recover from this war.\nRealm of Kings.\nIt is known through Ch'od, and apparently due to the incident where she and Korvus both lost the connection to the Phoenix Force, that Rachel and Korvus, along with Havok and Polaris, have departed for Earth.\nAge of X.\nWhile on the way back to Earth, Rachel attempted to contact Professor Xavier or Emma Frost with a message. However at that moment, Moira (a powerful alternate personality of the mutant Legion) warped reality taking Rachel's mind with it creating the amnesic Revenant. Once reality was restored, Rachel's mind is separated from her body which according to her is \"half a universe away\". Because of Moira's actions, Rachel no longer remembers the message and her mind retains the form of her Age of X counterpart. Scott promised her that they would return her home.\nSchism and Regenesis.\nRachel reappears in \"\".\nBorrowing one of Legion's manifold powers, Rogue teleports alongside Gambit, Magneto and Frenzy to rescue their teammates on the other side of the galaxy. Once there, Rachel is retrieved from a band of pirates as Rogue becomes their new leader. The remaining X-Men discover they've arrived at a space station called Gul Damar which is in a state of upheaval due to the rebellion of insectoid creatures called Grad Nan Holt against their Shi'ar enslavers. They are also being pulled into an exploding sun and the entire civil war is revealed to be orchestrated by a powerful Grad Nan Holt telepath known as \"Friendless.\" A number of battles with the creature proves unsuccessful for Rachel, but with the combined efforts of Rogue and the X-Men they are able to defeat him and return home via the wormhole that was created from the collapsing star.\nRachel as part of a team of Wolverine's X-Men attempted to psychically battle Exodus in an attempt to prevent the assassination of Cyclops. The team is eventually beaten and the X-Men are saved by Generation Hope.\nRachel is then invited to hold a position as senior staff member of the \"Jean Grey School for Higher Learning,\" which was rebuilt from the Xavier Institute and has Wolverine as acting Headmaster and Kitty Pryde as Headmistress.\nAvengers vs. X-Men.\nDuring the events of \"AVX\", when the X-Men on Utopia escape from the invading Avengers, Rachel contacts Cyclops to provide Hope's location. Afterwards, Rachel states that she knows the Phoenix Force better than anyone else on Earth and that she is living proof that it can be controlled. She also says that if the Phoenix has chosen her and that is the destiny that Hope wants, she will do everything in her power to help her. She and Iceman tell Wolverine at the school that they are going to help Cyclops in the battle. However, when Cyclops and Emma Frost begin to be corrupted by the Phoenix's power, she, like the other X-Men, decide to oppose their rule. Rachel then battled against Cyclops and helped both the Avengers and X-Men in the final battle.\nMarvel NOW! and Inhuman war.\nIn 2013, Marvel revealed an all new all female series simply named \"X-Men\". Written by Brian Wood with art by Olivier Coipel, \"X-Men\" will feature an all female cast including Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey and Psylocke.\nThe X-Men are in pursuit of Arkea, who has attempted to revive the X-Men's long lost enemies. The X-Men are attacked by the newly formed Sisterhood and Rachel is telepathically locked down by Madelyne Pryor. Storm strikes a deal for Rachels freedom allowing Madelyne and Selene to walk free.\nIn the \"AXIS\" story arc, Storm sends the entire student body against the Red Onslaught in an attempt to save Earth. Rachel is shown to be reverted to her hound form by Dr. Doom and Wanda Maximoffs spell.\nRachel is part of Storm's team of Amazing X-Men who attempts to stop the Living Monolith from becoming the new Juggernaut.\nRachel Grey is distrusting of Spider-Man's newly appointed position as Jean Grey School guidance counsellor. Using her telepathy she seeks to expose his secret identity only to lose that memory by being mind-wiped by Martha Johansson.\nRachel is shown as a teacher at the Jean Grey Institute in the battle against Kenji.\nResurrXion.\nWhen Kitty Pryde returns from space to lead the X-Men, Rachel joins her team in \"X-Men Gold\" and adopts the unique, new code name Prestige.\nDawn of X.\nIn the new status quo for mutants post \"House of X and Powers of X\", Professor X and Magneto invite all mutants to live on Krakoa and welcome even former enemies into their fold. Rachel spends some time with her family on the Summer House, the new residence of the Summers Family, located on the Moon. Soon after X (Xavier) is killed by bioengineered human terrorists, Cyclops gathers Rachel and Kid Cable for a mission on the Atlantic Ocean regarding a piece of their new homeland of Krakoa.\nLater, she joins Polaris, Daken, Northstar and former X-students Eye-Boy and Prodigy in a new initiative in Krakoa: they are to investigate any mutant death and prepare a report for The Five as part of the Resurrection Protocols of Krakoa. Their first case involves the supposed death of Northstar's twin sister, Aurora.\nPowers and abilities.\nRachel possesses various psionic abilities, generally exhibited through telepathy, psychometry, telekinesis, and limited time manipulation.\nTelepathy.\nRachel's \"virtually unlimited\" telepathy allows her to receive, broadcast, and manipulate cognitive processes (such as thoughts) in an intricate manner. Examples of Rachel's aptitudes for this include creating durable mind-links across distances, projecting blasts of psionic energy that disrupt aspects of brain functioning, shielding her mind from other telepaths, creating illusions, and rendering someone imperceptible to the five senses. In addition, Rachel has demonstrated the ability to telepathically suppress superpowers; control, repair, and exchange minds; as well as safely editing memories. Rachel has also harnessed her telepathy to sense, locate, and track other sentient beings based on their thought patterns, but has a moral apprehension about using this skill due to her experiences as a Hound.\nIt has been suggested that Rachel's telepathy, although immeasurable in raw power, is mitigated by her limited training and finesse. Emma Frost was able to outflank an incredulous Rachel in a contest on the astral plane. In the same issue, Emma offered her educative services; and later still, Rachel received training from Professor Charles Xavier (while he was depowered), giving her access to his vast knowledge and expertise in telepathy.\nTelekinesis.\nBy using telekinesis, Marvel Girl can remotely manipulate matter even on a sub-atomic level. She can channel this ability to create protective force fields and blasts of concussive force. By using her telekinesis to levitate herself, Marvel Girl can fly at incredible speeds. Rachel has been able to create a micro black hole, levitate an entire city for a time, sustain shields that withstood Jovian atmospheric pressures, and direct blows from Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. Moreover, Rachel's telekinetic fine-motor control has allowed her to alter molecular valences, mentally alter clothing with ease, create a telekinetic/psionic sword (much like Psylocke's telekinetic katana), a telekinetic hammer powerful enough to knock Thor off his feet, and even rewrite human genomes.\nWhile all depictions portray Rachel as an extremely powerful telekinetic, the limitations of her hard-psi capabilities have been somewhat inconsistent. Some instances have depicted Rachel's telekinetic potential to be nigh-unlimited, whereas others have shown her struggling against, and even outmatched by, lesser developed telekinetics such as Psylocke.\nChronoskimming.\nMarvel Girl utilizes her psionic talents in conjunction with her ability to manipulate time in a variety of ways. \"Chronoskimming\" describes her ability to temporarily transplant a person's mind and send it through time into a younger/older version, a close ancestor/descendant, or as a disembodied astral form.\nRachel unconsciously emanates a fourth dimensional pulse, effectively creating a chrono-shield that protects her from changes in the timeline. She can also sense and manipulate residual psychic energy in the form of psychometry.\nPhoenix Force.\nWhen Rachel was bonded to the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force, she demonstrated heightened psi-powers, the ability to manipulate energy and life-forces, and limited cosmic awareness. Rachel's connection to the Phoenix power was lost in the distant future and did not return with her when she traveled back to the early 21st century (present) of Earth-616 (Marvel's mainstream universe).\nMost recently, Marvel Girl absorbed a residual echo of the Phoenix Force left in the sword of a previous host, a Shi'ar named Rook'shir. It was revealed that this energy source was a less powerful (but easier to wield) form of the Phoenix Force. The echo was powerful enough to allow Rachel to survive in and fly through the vacuum of space without the need for additional protection, as well as being able to hold her own in combat against the tremendous physical power of Gladiator. These demonstrations were short lived, however, due to its disappearance, which Rachel attributes to Jean Grey. She now exhibits her standard power levels, however she has later shown the ability to manipulate Phoenix Fire from the Multiverse.\nPower signature.\nAs a host for the Phoenix Force, Rachel manifested the cosmic firebird in displays of great power. During her 2000s \"Uncanny X-Men\" appearances, Marvel Girl also exhibited a Phoenix emblem over her left eye whenever she demonstrated psionic feats. It was at first accompanied by a \"shadow form\" (similar to the one Jean Grey manifested when she absorbed the telepathic powers of Psylocke). However, the illustration of this shadow form ceased without explanation. After regaining a small portion of the Phoenix Force (echo), the emblem over her eye changed from a gold Phoenix shape to a static version made of electric blue flame. Her display of power was once more altered in \"X-Men: Emperor Vulcan\" #3, where she produced the familiar fiery raptor with which the Phoenix Force is commonly associated (see profile image).\nSkills and abilities.\nAt times, Rachel has been shown to learn new skills extremely quickly. For example, she mastered a set of \"demon ninja\" sword skills simply by watching her teammate Shadowcat perform them. Along with sword fighting, Rachel has experience in lock-picking, vehicular repair (such as engines), and use of advanced technology and weaponry. However, these abilities have not been evident in her more recent appearances.\nPotential and limitations.\nRachel's power level and scope of abilities have been inconsistently described by writers over the years. However, she is usually depicted with \"virtually unlimited\" potential in her dual psionic talents. In most cases, she displayed greater feats as the Phoenix and even matched Gladiator's strength with the aid of a \"Phoenix echo\". Rachel is considered by many to be an Omega-level mutant (like her mother), but the only literary reference to this attribute is when the future Sentinel, Nimrod, classified Rachel as an \"Omega class subject\" several years before the term was established in Marvel canon.\nEven with the omnipotent strength of the Phoenix, magic and magical objects are able to resist Rachel's powers. When the Soulsword appeared near the Excalibur lighthouse headquarters seeking Kitty Pryde to become its new wielder, Rachel attempted to remove it from bedrock to alleviate her friend's apprehension. Despite using the full extent of power permitted by the Phoenix Force, Rachel was unable to remove the sword, surmising that only Kitty could remove it.\nOther versions.\nIn the first issue of the \"Uncanny X-Men\" story arc \"Season of the Witch\", Rachel and Psylocke were transported to the White Hot Room as an indirect result of the reality-shift performed by a mentally unstable Scarlet Witch. While there, it was established that the Rachel appearing in Earth-616 (originally from Earth-811) has no true alternate counterparts within the Marvel multiverse. Rather, all other incarnations of \"Rachel Summers\" that exist in parallel timelines (see below) are linked only by having the same name, or attributes.\nHouse of M.\nThe \"House of M\" reality had Rachel and Psylocke return to their dimension and thus be engrossed in the Scarlet Witch's reconstruction of the world. In this reality, Rachel was the bodyguard and traveling companion to Psylocke, who was crowned British royalty after her brother, Brian, became ruler of all England. Rachel then became involved with Captain Britain's mission to seal the breach in reality (rift) that was created by the Scarlet Witch's manipulations.\nVariations of Days of Future Past.\nIn at least three alternate future timelines derived from \"Days of Future Past\", a Rachel Summers married Franklin Richards and procreated mutant children. One such child was the time-traveling supervillain Hyperstorm (Jonathan Richards). Hyperstorm was responsible for causing the Fantastic Four to think that Mister Fantastic (Jonathan's grandfather) and Doctor Doom were dead; he was only defeated when he was trapped in another dimension by Galactus. The second child was Dream Summers, who possessed empathic superpowers. She was a superhero who appeared in the \"Spider-Man/X-Men: Time's Arrow\" trilogy of novels. In a third reality, they produced a child named David Richards, who was rescued from a concentration camp by the interdimensional traveling Exiles and raised by the \"Age of Apocalypse\" version of Sabretooth. David's traumatic experiences at the camp motivated him to become a fanatical murderer.\nIn another variation of the \"Days of Future Past\", shown in \"Weapon X: Days of Future Now\", a Rachel Summers was captured by Weapon X and detained in the \"Neverland\" concentration camp.\nExiles.\nIn the so-called \"Legacy Earth\" reality of \"Exiles\", in which the Legacy Virus mutated into a techno-organic plague, a Rachel Summers was a member of the Avengers, the last superhero group. At Morph's behest, she contacted Thor and the Asgardians to help them against the Vi-Locks, a race of beings infected with the techno-organic virus.\n\"X-Men: The End\".\nThe miniseries \"\" (written by Chris Claremont) details the last adventures of the X-Men in a possible future. In this reality, Rachel played a central role, and was the political campaign manager of Kitty Pryde (Chicago mayoral candidate). However, she abandoned this position after Cassandra Nova led a series of attacks on the X-Men and their allies. She traveled alongside Cable into Shi'ar space. After a Professor X was taken hostage by Nova, and she entered his psyche to free him. However, Nova traps her and Lilandra within. She seemingly kills them both, but Rachel used the power of the Phoenix to save herself and incapacitates Nova. They leave Xavier's mind and continue the battle in Rachel's mind, where Rachel is overpowered. Cassandra, using Rachel's body, kills Jean Grey and Cyclops, leaving Rachel forced to watch the ordeal. Nova then leaves Rachel's body, stealing the Phoenix Force. This immediately kills her, as the Phoenix is the only thing keeping her alive after Cassandra destroyed her mental form.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26535", "revid": "1316806382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26535", "title": "Richard of Saint Victor", "text": "Scottish philosopher, died 1173\nRichard of Saint Victor (died 10 March 1173) was a Medieval Scottish philosopher and theologian and one of the most influential religious thinkers of his time. A canon regular, he was a prominent mystical theologian, and was prior of the famous Augustinian Abbey of Saint Victor in Paris from 1162 until his death in 1173.\nLife.\nVery little is known about the origins and upbringing of Richard of Saint Victor. John of Toulouse wrote a short \"Vita\" of Richard in the seventeenth century. He said that Richard came from Scotland. John added that Richard was received into the Abbey of St Victor by Abbot Gilduin (1114\u20131155) and was a student under Hugh of St Victor, the most influential of all Victorine teachers (implying that Richard entered the community before Hugh's death in 1141). This account of Richard's early life is not accepted by all modern scholars, however, and some have suggested that Richard entered the abbey after Hugh's death in 1141.\nAll scholarship agrees, however, that Richard was a magister during the 1150s, and was then promoted to subprior in 1159 (as stated by a document found at the abbey). He served under Achard of St. Victor's elected successor Ernisius, who was unworthy of the position. Richard's life was then burdened by the frustrations of working under a man who was ill-suited for his responsibilities. Ernisius wasted the abbey's resources on overly ambitious building projects and persecuted those who attempted to resist him. Richard was allowed to keep his office but his influence was restricted. Things became so unbearable that an appeal was made to the Pope, who then visited Saint Victor in 1162. Through a multitude of transactions, Ernisius was eventually removed from his position and the Pope commended Richard for his continued involvement in the matter. Letters from England written to Richard show that he was in constant touch with English affairs and give evidence of the international character of intellectual life at this time.\nHe was then promoted to prior in 1162, a position he held until his death on 10 March 1173.\nWritings.\nRichard wrote extensively (Migne's \"Patrologia Latina\" contains 34 works attributed to him, and this is not Richard's full corpus). There are some problems with establishing the chronology of Richard's works. The earliest ones come before 1153, and the latest were written one or two years before his death. His earlier works are similar to the general teaching and writing of the period. His writing develops from basic exegesis, theology and philosophy to more of a study of purely spiritual questions. In his early writings he relies on the moral interpretations of previous theologians such as Augustine of Hippo, Bede, Pope Gregory I and Hugh. He later became more independent and strayed from Hugh's influence. There is some debate between historians about which of Richard's texts are the most influential and important. Because Richard's work covers many spheres of thought it is somewhat difficult to categorise his work.\n\"The Book of the Twelve Patriarchs\", or \"Benjamin Minor\".\n\"The Book of the Twelve Patriarchs\", sometimes titled \"Benjamin Minor\", is one of Richard of Saint Victor's great works on contemplation. It is not exactly known when it was written, but it would seem to date before 1162. Richard specifies that this work is not a treatise on contemplation but rather prepares the mind for contemplation. \n\"The Mystical Ark\", or \"Benjamin Major\".\n\"The Mystical Ark\", sometimes called \"Benjamin Major\" or \"The Grace of Contemplation\" completes this with the study of the mind in relation to prayer. However, in the last chapters of \"Benjamin Major\", written later than the Minor, Richard almost abandons his topic and the discussion of the teaching of mystical theology takes up a good portion of every remaining chapter. He is still attempting to instruct his followers on a text but he has also engaged himself in creating a system of mystical theology.\n\"De Trinitate\".\nOne of Richard's greatest works was the \"De Trinitate\" which was probably written while Richard was prior, between 1162 and 1173. This is known because it incorporates pieces of theological text which editors are now finding in earlier works. \"De Trinitate\" is Richard's most independent and original study on dogmatic theology. It stems from the desire to show that dogmatic truths of Christian revelation are ultimately not against reason. Richard's theological approach stems from a profoundly mystical life of prayer, which in the Spirit seeks to involve the mind, in continuation with the Augustinian and Anselmian tradition.\nSince this work was not available in any English translation until recently, its diffusion has been limited and its influence has seldom gone beyond 'Book III'. In 2011, the first full English translation of Richard's \"De Trinitate\" was published by Ruben Angelici.\nOther treatises and works.\nRichard wrote a massive handbook of biblical education entitled \"Liber Exceptionum\" (\"Book of Selections/Book of Notes\"), important scriptural commentaries, and many treatises.\n\"The Four Degrees of Violent Charity\", composed about 1170, with its description of how vehement love leads to union with God and more perfect service of neighbour, has been of interest to writers interested in Christian mysticism.\nRichard's other treatises are a number of short works which mainly deal with textual difficulties and theological issues. Many of them can be grouped together with larger works. Some of them are correspondence between Richard and his students while others seem to have been written at the request of friends. Although short, they are often interesting because they allow the modern reader to see the mentality of the students and the discussions and issues of the time.\nRichard of Saint Victor's \"Commentary on Ezekiel\" is of special interest in the field of art history because the explanations laid out by the author are accompanied by illustrations. A number of copies have come down to us, none of which are dated, but they are written in a style attributable to the second half of the twelfth century.\nHistoriographical contributions.\nWhat makes Richard of Saint-Victor stand out from other theologians of his time is that he approaches theological problems as more of a psychologist, contributing to 'a careful analysis of contemplative experiences.'\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26537", "revid": "8565473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26537", "title": "Rose", "text": "Genus of flowering plants\nA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through pinks, reds, oranges and yellows. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and Northwest Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"rose\" comes from Latin \"rosa\", which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek \u1fe5\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd \"rh\u00f3don\" (Aeolic \u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd \"wr\u00f3don\"), itself borrowed from Old Persian \"wrd-\" (\"wurdi\"), related to Avestan \"var\u0259\u03b4a\", Sogdian \"ward\", Parthian \"w\u00e2r\".\nBotany.\nThe leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species, they are long, pinnate, with (3\u2013) 5\u20139 (\u221213) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.\nThorns.\nThe sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called \"thorns\", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as \"Rosa rugosa\" and \"R.\u00a0pimpinellifolia\" have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.\nPlant geneticist Zachary Lippman of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory found that prickles are controlled by the LOG gene. Blocking the LOG gene in roses reduced the thorns (large prickles) into tiny buds.\nFlower.\nThe flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of \"Rosa omeiensis\" and \"Rosa sericea\", which usually have only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some \"Rosa omeiensis\" and \"Rosa sericea\", four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. The coloured petals are fused on the axis and arranged in five bundles forming a circle, the petal bundles expand further from each other; the petals form a cup or disc surrounding the gynoecium. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.\nReproduction.\nRoses are insect-pollinated in nature. A fertilized ovary forms a berry-like aggregate fruit called a \"hip\". The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. \"Rosa pimpinellifolia\") have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5\u2013160 \"seeds\" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (\"Rosa canina\") and rugosa rose (\"R.\u00a0rugosa\"), are very rich in vitamin\u00a0C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings.\nMany of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are too tightly petalled to provide access for pollination and the plants can only propagate through human-made cuttings.\nEvolution.\nThe oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.\nToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.\nGenome.\nA study of the patterns of natural selection in the genome of roses indicated that genes related to DNA damage repair and stress adaptation have been positively selected, likely during their domestication. This rapid evolution may reflect an adaptation to genome confliction resulting from frequent intra- and inter-species hybridization and switching environmental conditions of growth.\nSpecies.\nThe genus \"Rosa\" is composed of 140\u2013180 species and divided into four subgenera:\nEcology.\nSome birds, particularly finches, eat the seeds.\nPests and diseases.\nWild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.\nCultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.\nUses.\nRoses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have also been used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.\nOrnamental plants.\nThe majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as \"Rosa glauca\" and \"R.\u00a0rubiginosa\"), ornamental thorns (such as \"R.\u00a0sericea\") or for their showy fruit (such as \"R.\u00a0moyesii\").\nOrnamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.\nIn the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.\nCut flowers.\nRoses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. The price of the roses depends partly on the characteristics of the rose itself, such as how long the stem is and how big the bloom is, and partly on factors about how it was grown, such as which country it was grown in.\nIn temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.\nSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.\nPerfume.\nRose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (\"Rosa\" \u00d7 \"damascena\" 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world \"Rosa\" \u00d7 \"centifolia\" is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.\nThe main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. \u03b2-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.\nFood and drink.\nRose hips, usually from \"R. canina\", are high in vitamin C, and are edible raw after the removal of the irritant hairs. Hips can be made into jam, jelly, marmalade, and soup, or brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.Diarrhodon (Gr \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd, \"compound of roses\", from \u1fe5\u03cc\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd, \"of roses\") is the historic name for various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.\nRose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine\u2014especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.\nIn France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.\nThe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.\nRose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.\nUnder the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain \"Rosa\" species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).\nArt and symbolism.\nThe long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the \"Iliad\", Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the \"immortal oil of the rose\" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him \"among rose blossoms\". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel \"The Golden Ass\" by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity. French writer Ren\u00e9 Rapin invented a myth in which a beautiful Corinthian queen named Rhodanthe (\"she with rose flowers\") was besieged inside a temple of Artemis by three ardent suitors who wished to worship her as a goddess; the god Apollo then transformed her into a rosebush.\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity. The Rose Cross incorporates the flower directly into the Christian cross, and is the namesake of the esoteric religious order of Rosicrucianism.\nEver since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht D\u00fcrer's painting \"The Feast of the Rosary\" (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her devotees.\nRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Subsequently roses of the corresponding colours have been used a emblems for the English counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nThe Tudor rose combines the colours of the roses of York and Lancaster, and is an emblem of then Tudor dynasty and of England.\nRoses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9 is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.\nHenri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.\nOther impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul C\u00e9zanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.\nIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.\nThe rose is often exchanged on St. Valentines Day and is used often as a symbol of such.\nThe term , \"rose\" in Japanese, has historically been used in Japan as a pejorative for men who love men, roughly equivalent to the English language term \"pansy\".40 Beginning in the 1960s, the term was reappropriated by Japanese gay media: notably with the 1961 anthology , a collection of semi-nude photographs of homosexual writer Yukio Mishima by photographer Eikoh Hosoe,34 and later with in 1971, the first commercially produced gay magazine in Asia. The use of the rose as a prominent symbol of love between males is supposedly derived from the Greek myth of King Laius having affairs with boys under rose trees. Since the 2000s, \"bara\" has been used by non-Japanese audience as an umbrella term to describe a wide variety of Japanese and non-Japanese gay media featuring love and sex between masculine men. The rose is also the sacred flower of Eros, the Greek god of love and sex, and patron of love between men. Eros was responsible for the first rose to sprout on Earth, followed by every flower and herb. Roses are a symbol of pederasty in ancient Greece: handsome boys were metaphorically called roses by their male admirers in homoerotic poems such as those by Solon, Straton, Meleager, Rhianus, and Philostratos.\nAs opposed to the red rose and its association with romantic affection, giving someone a yellow rose is symbolic of platonic love. Because of this, yellow roses have also become popular as symbols of aromantic people.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
