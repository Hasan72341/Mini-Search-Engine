Her 1975 debut album \"Horses\" made her an influential member of the New York City\u2013based punk rock movement. Smith has fused rock and poetry in her work. In 1978, her most widely known song, \"Because the Night,\" co-written with Bruce Springsteen, reached number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and number five on the UK Singles Chart.\nIn 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In November 2010, Smith won the National Book Award for her memoir \"Just Kids\", written to fulfill a promise she made to Robert Mapplethorpe, her longtime partner and friend. She is ranked 47th on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of all Time, published in 2010, and was awarded the Polar Music Prize in 2011.\nEarly life and education.\nSmith was born on December 30, 1946, at Grant Hospital in the Lincoln Park section of Chicago, to Beverly Smith, a jazz singer turned waitress, and Grant Smith, a Honeywell machinist. Her family is of partially Irish ancestry (though in her 2025 memoir \"\", Smith revealed that she learned at age 70 that Grant Smith was in fact not her biological father and her patrilineal lineage is Ashkenazi Jewish). Patti is the eldest of four children, with siblings Linda, Kimberly, and Todd.\nWhen Smith was four, the family moved from Chicago to the Germantown section of Philadelphia, then to Pitman, New Jersey, and finally settled in the Woodbury Gardens section of Deptford Township, New Jersey.\nAt an early age, Smith was exposed to music, including the albums \"Shrimp Boats\" by Harry Belafonte, \"The Money Tree\" by Patience and Prudence, and \"Another Side of Bob Dylan\", Bob Dylan's fourth album, released in 1964, which her mother gave her.\nIn 1964, Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School, and began working in a factory. She briefly attended Glassboro State College, now Rowan University, in Glassboro, New Jersey.\nCareer.\nEarly performances.\nIn 1969, Smith went to Paris with her sister, and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to Manhattan, she lived at the Hotel Chelsea with Robert Mapplethorpe. They frequented Max's Kansas City on Park Avenue, and Smith provided the spoken word soundtrack for Sandy Daley's art film \"Robert Having His Nipple Pierced\", starring Mapplethorpe. The same year, Smith appeared with Jayne County in Jackie Curtis's play \"Femme Fatale\". She also starred in Anthony Ingrassia's play \"Island\". As a member of the Poetry Project, she spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing.\nIn 1969, Smith also performed in the one-act play \"Cowboy Mouth\", which she co-wrote with Sam Shepard. The published play's notes call for \"a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow\". She wrote several poems about Shepard and her relationship with him, including \"for sam shepard\" and \"Sam Shepard: 9 Random Years (7 + 2)\", that were published in \"Angel City, Curse of the Starving Class &amp; Other Plays (1976)\".\nOn February 10, 1971, Smith, accompanied by Lenny Kaye on electric guitar, opened for Gerard Malanga, which was her first public poetry performance.\nSmith was briefly considered as lead singer for Blue \u00d6yster Cult. She contributed lyrics to several Blue \u00d6yster Cult songs, including \"Debbie Denise\", which was inspired by her poems \"In Remembrance of Debbie Denise\", \"Baby Ice Dog\", \"Career of Evil\", \"Fire of Unknown Origin\", \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\", on which she performs duet vocals, and \"Shooting Shark\". At the time, she was romantically involved with Allen Lanier, Blue \u00d6yster Cult's keyboardist. During these years, Smith was also a rock music journalist, writing periodically for \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Creem\".\nThe Patti Smith Group.\nIn 1973, Smith teamed up again with musician and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later added Richard Sohl on piano. The trio developed into a full band with the addition of Ivan Kr\u00e1l on guitar and bass and Jay Dee Daugherty on drums. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded their first single, \"Hey Joe/Piss Factory\" in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about Patty Hearst, a fugitive heiress. The B-side describes the helpless alienation Smith felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she dreams of achieving by escaping to New York City. In a 1996 interview on artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, \"I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend.\"\nLater the same year, she performed \"I Wake Up Screaming\", a poem, on \"The Whole Thing Started with Rock &amp; Roll Now It's Out of Control\", an album by The Doors' Ray Manzarek.\nAlbums.\nIn March 1975, the Patti Smith Group began a two-month weekend set of shows at CBGB in New York City with the band Television. The Patti Smith Group was spotted by Clive Davis, who signed them to Arista Records.\nLater that year, the Patti Smith Group recorded their debut album, \"Horses\", produced by John Cale amid some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison's \"Gloria\", and Smith's opening words: \"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine\", an excerpt from \"Oath\", one of Smith's early poems. The austere cover photograph by Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images.\nAs punk rock grew in popularity, the Patti Smith Group toured the U.S. and Europe. The rawer sound of the group's second album, \"Radio Ethiopia\", reflected this. Considerably less accessible than \"Horses\", \"Radio Ethiopia\" initially received poor reviews. However, several songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them live. She has said that \"Radio Ethiopia\" was influenced by the band MC5.\nOn January 23, 1977, while touring in support of \"Radio Ethiopia\", Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida, and fell 15-feet onto a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several cervical vertebrae. The injury required a period of rest and physical therapy, during which she says she was able to reassess, reenergize, and reorganize her life.\nThe Patti Smith Group produced two further albums. \"Easter\", released in 1978, was their most commercially successful record. It included the band's top single \"Because the Night\", co-written with Bruce Springsteen. \"Wave\" (1979) was less successful, although the songs \"Frederick\" and \"Dancing Barefoot\" received commercial airplay.\nThrough most of the 1980s, Patti lived with her family in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and was semi-retired from music. She ultimately moved back to New York City.\nTouring and additional albums.\nIn June 1988, Smith released the album \"Dream of Life\", which included the song \"People Have the Power\".\nMichael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg, whom she had known since her early years in New York City, urged her return to live music and touring. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995, which is chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe.\nIn 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record \"Gone Again,\" featuring \"About a Boy\", a tribute to Kurt Cobain, the former lead singer of Nirvana who died by suicide in 1994.\nThe same year, she collaborated with Stipe on \"E-Bow the Letter\", a song on R.E.M.'s \"New Adventures in Hi-Fi,\" which she performed live with the band. After the release of \"Gone Again,\" Smith recorded two further albums, \"Peace and Noise\" in 1997, which included the single \"1959\" about China's invasion of Tibet, and \"Gung Ho\" in 2000, which included songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith's late father. Smith was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for two songs, \"1959\" and \"Glitter in Their Eyes\".\nA box set of Smith's work up to that time, \"The Patti Smith Masters\". was released in 1996.\nIn 2002, Smith released \"Land (1975\u20132002),\" a two-CD compilation that includes a cover of Prince's \"When Doves Cry\". Smith's solo art exhibition \"Strange Messenger\" was hosted at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002.\nOn April 27, 2004, Smith released \"Trampin\"', which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother, who died two years earlier. It was her first album on Columbia Records, which later became a sister label to her Arista Records, her previous label. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, in which she performed \"Horses\" live in its entirety for the first time. This live performance was released later in 2004 as \"Horses/Horses\".\nOn October 15, 2006, Smith performed a 3\u00bd-hour \"tour de force\" show to close out at CBGB, which was an immensely influential New York City live music venue for much of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. At the CBGB show, Smith took the stage at 9:30\u00a0p.m. (EDT) and closed her show a few minutes after 1:00\u00a0am. Her final song was \"Elegie\", after which she read a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years, representing the last public song and words performed at the iconic venue.\nIn April 2007, Smith's cover of \"Gimme Shelter\" appeared on her tenth album, \"Twelve\", an all-covers album released by Columbia Records.\nIn July 2008, a live album by Smith and Kevin Shields, \"The Coral Sea\", was released.\nOn September 10, 2009, after a week of smaller events and exhibitions in Florence, Smith played an open-air concert at Piazza Santa Croce, commemorating her performance in the same city 30 years earlier.\nSmith recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Words of Love\" for the CD \"Rave on Buddy Holly\", a tribute album tied to Holly's 75th birthday, which was released June 28, 2011.\nShe also recorded the song \"Capitol Letter\" for the of the second film of the \"Hunger Games series '.\nSmith's 11th studio album, \"Banga\", was released in June 2012. \"American Songwriter\" wrote that, \"These songs aren't as loud or frantic as those of her late 70s heyday, but they resonate just as boldly as she moans, chants, speaks and spits out lyrics with the grace and determination of Muhammad Ali in his prime. It's not an easy listen\u2014the vast majority of her music never has been\u2014but if you're a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith's storied history as a musical maverick, that's saying plenty.\" Metacritic awarded the album a score of 81, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nAlso in 2012, Smith recorded a cover of \"Io come persona\" by Italian singer-songwriter Giorgio Gaber.\nIn 2015, Smith wrote \"Aqua Teen Dream\" to commemorate the series finale of \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\". The vocal track was recorded in a hotel overlooking Lerici's Bay of Poets. On September 26, 2015, Smith performed at the American Museum of Tort Law convocation ceremony.\nOn December 6, 2015, she made an appearance at the Paris show of U2's Innocence + Experience Tour, performing \"Bad\" and \"People Have the Power\" with U2.\nIn 2016, Smith performed \"People Have the Power\" at Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Democracy Now, where she was joined by Michael Stipe. On December 10, 2016, Smith attended the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm on behalf of Bob Dylan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who could not be present due to prior commitments.\nAfter the official presentation speech for the literary prize by Horace Engdahl, the perpetual secretary of the Swedish Academy, Smith sang the Dylan song \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\". She incorrectly sung one verse, singing, \"I saw the babe that was just bleedin',\" and was momentarily unable to continue. After a brief apology, saying that she was nervous, she resumed the song and earned jubilant applause at its end.\nIn August 2025, Smith announced the rerelease of her debut album \"Horses\", slated to be released in October 2025 to celebrate the album\u2019s 50th anniversary. The album features unreleased tracks, remasters, and original recordings of several songs from the original track list.\nArt and writings.\nIn 1994, Smith began devoting time to what she terms \"pure photography\", a method of capturing still objects without using a flash.\nFrom November 2006 to January 2007, an exhibition called 'Sur les Traces' at Trolley Gallery, London, featured polaroid prints taken by Smith and donated to raise awareness and funds for the publication of \"Double Blind: Lebanon Conflict 2006,\" a book with photographs by Paolo Pellegrin, a member of Magnum Photos. She also participated in the DVD commentary for \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters\".\nFrom March 28 to June 22, 2008, the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain in Paris hosted a major exhibition of the visual artwork of \"Land 250\", drawn from pieces created by Smith between 1967 and 2007.\nIn 2009, she contributed the introduction to Jessica Lange's book \"50 Photographs\".\nIn 2010, Smith's book \"Just Kids\", a memoir of her time in Manhattan in the 1970s and her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, was published. The book won the National Book Award for Nonfiction later that year. In 2018, a new edition of \"Just Kids\", including additional photographs and illustrations, was published. Smith also headlined a benefit concert headed by bandmate Tony Shanahan, for Court Tavern in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Smith's set included \"Gloria\", \"Because the Night\", and \"People Have the Power\".\nIn 2011, Smith announced the first museum exhibition of her photography in the U.S., \"Camera Solo\". She named the project after a sign she saw in the abode of Pope Celestine V, which translates as \"a room of one's own\", and which Smith felt best described her solitary method of photography. The exhibition featured artifacts that were everyday items or places of significance to artists Smith admires, including Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, John Keats, and William Blake. In February 2012, she was a guest at the Sanremo Music Festival.\nAlso in 2011, Smith was working on a crime novel set in London. \"I've been working on a detective story that starts at the St Giles in the Fields church in London for the last two years\", she told NME, adding that she \"loved detective stories\" and was a fan of British fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and U.S. crime author Mickey Spillane in her youth.\nSmith collaborates with the experimental group Soundwalk Collective on the ongoing project \"Correspondences\". Described as \u201can ever-evolving project,\u201d it spans more than ten years and traverses different geographies and natural environments. Soundwalk Collective\u2019s founder Stephan Crasneanscki has recorded sounds in remote places to uncover traces of history and environmental change, which he later shared with Smith to inspire her poetic response. Their collaboration began after a chance encounter on a plane and developed through ongoing correspondences on life and nature. \"Correspondences\" consists of eight audiovisual pieces in which sound comes before imagery, exploring themes such as the impact of seismic airguns on the oceans, the resilience of nature after the Chernobyl disaster, the anarchist visions of Peter Kropotkin, and the final landscapes of Pier Paolo Pasolini.\nSmith announced a new memoir, \"Bread of Angels\", would be released in November 2025. In a \"Vanity Fair\" article published ahead of its release, Smith revealed that the cover photo was taken by Mapplethorpe. Her finally released third memoir book contains a lot of formerly unknown details and received some acclaim.\nFilm appearances.\nAlso in 2010, Smith made a cameo appearance in Jean-Luc Godard's \"Film Socialisme\", which was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival that year.\nIn 2017, Smith appeared as herself in \"Song to Song\" opposite Rooney Mara and Ryan Gosling, directed by Terrence Malick. She later made an appearance at the Detroit show of U2's The Joshua Tree 2017 tour and performed \"Mothers of the Disappeared\" with the band.\nIn 2018, Smith's concert-documentary film \"Horses: Patti Smith and her Band\", premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival.

Later that year, she released her latest book, \"Year of the Monkey\". \"A captivating, redemptive chronicle of a year in which Smith looked intently into the abyss\", stated \"Kirkus Reviews\".\nIn 2024, Smith appeared as herself in \"Turn in the Wound\", a documentary by Abel Ferrara about performance, poetry, music and the experience of people at war, focusing on life in Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. She composed the music of the film and read poems by Antonin Artaud, Ren\u00e9 Daumal and Arthur Rimbaud in her own voice. It was premiered at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival on February 16, 2024.\nMusical influence.\nOne of the first musicians to reference Smith was Todd Rundgren. In the liner notes of his 1972 album \"Something/Anything?\", Rundgren wrote that \"Song of the Viking\" was \"written in the feverish grip of the dreaded 'd'oyle carte,' a chronic disease dating back to my youth. Dedicated to Miss Patti Lee Smith.\" Seven years later, Rundgren produced the final Patti Smith Group album, \"Wave\".\nIn 1979, Gilda Radner portrayed a character called Candy Slice, based on Smith, on \"Saturday Night Live\".\nAnglo-Celtic rock band The Waterboys' debut single, \"A Girl Called Johnny\", is a tribute to Smith.\nHole's \"Violet\", released in 1994, features the lyrics, \"And the sky was all violet / I want it again, but violent, more violent,\" alluding to lyrics from Smith's song \"Kimberly\". In 2010, Hole singer Courtney Love said that she considered Smith's \"Rock N Roll Nigger\" the greatest rock song of all time, and credited Smith as a major influence. Love received Smith's album \"Horses\" in juvenile hall as a teenager, and \"realized that you could do something that was completely subversive that didn't involve violence [or] felonies. I stopped making trouble.\"\nIn 1998, Michael Stipe of R.E.M. published a collection of photos, titled \"Two Times Intro: On the Road with Patti Smith.\" Stipe sings backing vocals on Smith's \"Last Call\" and \"Glitter in Their Eyes\". Smith sang background vocals on R.E.M.'s \"E-Bow the Letter\" and \"Blue\". A decade later, in 2008, Stipe said that Smith's album \"Horses\" was one of his inspirations. \"I decided then that I was going to start a band,\" Stipe said about the impact of listening to \"Horses\".\nIn 2000, the Australian alternative rock band The Go-Betweens dedicated the song \"When She Sang About Angels\" on their album \"The Friends of Rachel Worth\" to Smith.\nIn 2004, Shirley Manson of Garbage spoke of Smith's influence on her in \"Rolling Stone\"'s issue \"The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", in which Smith was ranked 47th. The Smiths members Morrissey and Johnny Marr share an appreciation for Smith's \"Horses,\" and revealed that their song \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" is a reworking of one of the album's tracks, \"Kimberly\". In 2004, Sonic Youth released an album called \"Hidros 3 (to Patti Smith)\".\nIn 2005, U2 cited Smith as an influence. The same year, Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall released \"Suddenly I See\", a single, as a tribute of sorts to Smith. Canadian actor Elliot Page frequently mentions Smith as one of his idols and has done various photo shoots replicating famous Smith photos, and Irish actress Maria Doyle Kennedy often refers to Smith as a major influence.\n\"She was the epitome of a literate, intelligent woman taking charge and being respected by her peers,\" observed Maria McKee in 2005.\nIn 2012, Madonna named Smith as one of her biggest influences.\nIn 2012, Smith was awarded an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Following conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and played two songs along with long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her Pratt Institute commencement address, Smith said that when she moved to New York City in 1967, she would never have been accepted into Pratt but most of her friends, including Mapplethorpe, were students at Pratt, and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and Pratt professors that she learned many of her own artistic skills.\nIn 2018, the English band Florence and the Machine dedicated the \"High as Hope\" album song \"Patricia\" to Smith. The lyrics reference Smith as Florence Welch's \"North Star\". Canadian country musician Orville Peck cited Smith as having had a big impact on him, stating that Smith's album \"Horses\" introduced him to a new and different way to make music.\nPoetic singer songwriter Joustene Lorenz also cites Patti Smith as a 'powerful influence' on her life and music.\nIn November 2020, Smith was set to receive the International Humanities Prize from Washington University in St. Louis in November 2020; however, the ceremony was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

She led the crowd singing \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"People Have the Power\" at the campaign's rallies, and also performed at several of Nader's subsequent \"Democracy Rising\" events. Smith was a speaker and singer at the first protests against the Iraq War as U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. Smith supported Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 election. Bruce Springsteen continued performing her \"People Have the Power\" at Vote for Change campaign events. In the winter of 2004\u20132005, Smith toured again with Nader in a series of rallies against the Iraq War and called for the impeachment of Bush.\nIn September 2006, Smith premiered two new protest songs in London. Louise Jury, writing in \"The Independent\", characterized them as \"an emotional indictment of American and Israeli foreign policy\". The song \"Qana\" was about the Israeli airstrike on the Lebanese village of Qana. \"Without Chains\" is about Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen who was born and raised in Germany, held at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp for four years. Jury's article quotes Smith as saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I wrote both these songs directly in response to events that I felt outraged about. These are injustices against children and the young men and women who are being incarcerated. I'm an American, I pay taxes in my name and they are giving millions and millions of dollars to a country such as Israel and cluster bombs and defense technology and those bombs were dropped on common citizens in Qana. It's terrible. It's a human rights violation.\nIn a 2009 interview, Smith stated that Kurnaz's family had contacted her and that she wrote a short preface for the book that he was writing, which was released in March 2008.\nIn March 2003, ten days after the murder of Rachel Corrie, Smith appeared in Austin, Texas and performed an anti-war concert, and subsequently wrote \"Peaceable Kingdom\", a song inspired by and dedicated to Corrie.

Smith regards climate change as the predominant issue of our time, and performed at the opening of COP26 in 2021.\nIn May 2021, Patti Smith, signed an open letter calling for a boycott of performances in Israel.In a performance at the Capitol Theatre (Port Chester, New York), she said: \"I would be lying if I said I wasn't affected by what is happening in the world\" referencing the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier that day. \"This is what I heard in my sleep and goes through my head all day all night long like a tragic hit song. A raw translation of the Ukrainian anthem that the people are singing through defiant tears\", she wrote on Instagram on March 6, 2022.\nBeliefs.\nReligion.\nSmith was raised a Jehovah's Witness and had a strong religious upbringing and a Biblical education. She says she left organized religion as a teenager because she found it too confining. This experience inspired her lyrics, \"Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine\", which appear on her cover version of \"Gloria\" by Them. She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of 11 or 12, saying \"I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer,\" but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion and has concluded that religious dogmas are \"\u2026man-made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not.\" She also regarded herself as a Buddhist.\nIn 2014, she was invited by Pope Francis to play at Vatican Christmas concert. \"It's a Christmas concert for the people, and it's being televised. I like Pope Francis and I'm happy to sing for him. Anyone who would confine me to a line from 20 years ago is a fool! I had a strong religious upbringing, and the first word on my first LP is Jesus. I did a lot of thinking. I'm not against Jesus, but I was 20 and I wanted to make my own mistakes and I didn't want anyone dying for me. I stand behind that 20-year-old girl, but I have evolved. I'll sing to my enemy! I don't like being pinned down and I'll do what the fuck I want, especially at my age...oh, I hope there's no small children here!\" she said.\nIn 2021, she performed at the Vatican again, telling \"Democracy Now!\" that she studied Francis of Assisi when Pope Benedict XVI was still the pope. Smith called Francis of Assisi \"truly the environmentalist saint\" and said that despite not being a Catholic, she had hoped for a pope named Francis.\nFeminism.\nAccording to biographer Nick Johnstone, Smith has often been \"revered\" as a \"feminist icon\", including by \"The Guardian\" journalist Simon Hattenstone in a 2013 profile on the musician.\nIn 2014, Smith offered her opinion on the sexualization of women in music. \"Pop music has always been about the mainstream and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge.\" Smith has declined to embrace feminism, saying: \"I have a son and a daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women's rights, but I have a son too\u2014I believe in human rights.\"\nIn 2015, writer Anwen Crawford observed that Smith's \"attitude to genius seems pre-feminist, if not anti-feminist; there is no democratizing, deconstructing impulse in her work. True artists, for Smith, are remote, solitary figures of excellence, wholly dedicated to their art.\"\nPolitics.\nSmith supported Ralph Nader's campaigns for the presidency in 2000, 2004, and 2008.\nOn the front cover of Nader's 2025 book, \"Civic Self-Respect\", she is quoted: \"With the deepest concern for the fate of our country and future generations, Ralph Nader presents an indispensable guide to understanding our rights, our responsibilities and the rules of law. \nAwards and recognition.\nIn July 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture. In addition to Smith's influence on rock music, the Minister noted Smith's appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. In August 2005, Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Rimbaud and William Blake.\nOn March 12, 2007, Smith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and performed a cover of The Rolling Stones' \"Gimme Shelter\". As the closing number of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith's \"People Have the Power\" was used for the big celebrity jam that traditionally ends the program.\nIn 2008, \"\", a documentary about Smith by Steven Sebring, was released. Also in 2008, Rowan University awarded Smith with an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture.\nIn 2011, Smith was one of several Polar Music Prize winners. She made her television acting debut at age 64 on the TV series \"\", appearing in an episode titled \"Icarus\".\nIn 2024, Smith, along with Yoko Ono and Sandra Bloodworth, was awarded the Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal awarded annually to individuals who, through vision, leadership, and philanthropy, have made a lasting contribution to New York City.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1967, 20-year-old Smith left Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) and moved to Manhattan, where she began working at Scribner's bookstore with friend and poet Janet Hamill. On April 26, 1967, at age 20, Smith gave birth to her first child, a daughter, and placed her for adoption.\nWhile working at the bookstore she met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, with whom she began an intense romantic relationship as they struggled with poverty and Mapplethorpe's sexuality. Smith used Mapplethorpe's photographs as covers for her albums and wrote essays for several of his books, including his posthumous \"Flowers,\" at his request. The two remained friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989.\nSmith considers Mapplethorpe to be among the most influential and important people in her life. She calls him \"the artist of my life\" in her book \"Just Kids,\" which tells the story of their relationship. Her book and album \"The Coral Sea\" is an homage to Mapplethorpe.\nIn 1979, at approximately age 32, Smith separated from her long-time partner Allen Lanier and met Fred \"Sonic\" Smith, the former guitar player for Michigan-based rock band MC5 and Sonic's Rendezvous Band. Like Patti, Fred adored poetry. \"Dancing Barefoot\", which was inspired by Jeanne H\u00e9buterne and her tragic love for Amedeo Modigliani, and \"Frederick\" were both dedicated to him. A running joke at the time was that she married Fred only because she would not have to change her name. They had a son, Jackson (b. 1982), who went on to marry Meg White, drummer for The White Stripes, from 2009 to 2013, and a daughter, Jesse Paris (b. 1987), who is a musician and composer.\nFred Smith died of a heart attack on November 4, 1994. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the sudden death of her brother Todd.\nAwards and nominations.\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n! scope=\"row\"|ASCAP Pop Music Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=4|Grammy Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|Grammy Hall of Fame\nDiscography.\nAs Patti Smith Group.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "22996", "revid": "35807425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22996", "title": "Horses (album)", "text": "Horses is the debut studio album by American musician Patti Smith, released on November 10, 1975 by Arista Records. Smith, supported by her regular backing band, recorded the album at Electric Lady Studios in September 1975, choosing former Velvet Underground member John Cale as the album's producer.\nThe music on \"Horses\" was informed by the minimalist aesthetic of the punk rock genre, then in its formative years. Smith and her band composed the album's songs using simple chord progressions, while also breaking from punk tradition in their propensity for improvisation and embrace of ideas from avant-garde and other musical styles. With \"Horses\", Smith drew upon her backgrounds in rock music and poetry, aiming to create an album combining both forms. Her lyrics were alternately rooted in her own personal experiences, particularly with her family, and in more fantastical imagery. \"Horses\" was additionally inspired by Smith's reflections on the previous era of rock music\u2014with two of its songs being adapted in part from 1960s rock standards, and others containing lyrical allusions and tributes to past rock performers\u2014and her hopes for the music's future.\nAt the time of its release, \"Horses\" experienced modest commercial success and reached the top 50 of the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, while being widely acclaimed by music critics. Recognized as a seminal recording in the history of punk and later rock movements, \"Horses\" has appeared in numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 2009, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation into the National Recording Registry as a \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" work.\nBackground.\nPatti Smith and her backing band gave frequent live performances throughout 1974, and by the following year they had established themselves as a popular act within the New York City underground rock music scene, especially elevated in early 1975 by their highly attended two-month residency at the New York City club CBGB with the band Television. The hype surrounding the residency brought Smith to the attention of music industry executive Clive Davis, who was scouting for artists to sign to his recently launched label Arista Records. After being impressed by one of her live performances at CBGB, Davis offered Smith a seven-album recording deal with Arista, and she signed to the label in April 1975.\nSmith had written poetry for several years before becoming a musician, and entered the music industry because she thought \"the presentation of poetry wasn't vibrant enough\". For her debut album, her primary aim was to merge poetry and rock music, which then developed into a \"larger mission\" to \"pump blood back into the heart of rock'n'roll\". The title \"Horses\" reflected Smith's desire for a rejuvenation of rock music, which she found had grown \"calm\" in reaction to the social turmoil of the 1960s and the deaths of numerous prominent rock musicians of that era. \"Psychologically, somewhere in our hearts,\" she stated shortly after the album's release, \"we were all screwed up because those people died... We all had to pull ourselves together. To me, that's why our record's called \"Horses\". We had to pull the reins on ourselves to recharge ourselves... We've gotten ourselves back together. It's time to let the horses loose again. We're ready to start moving again.\"\nSmith later reflected that she had envisioned \"Horses\" as a record bridging the \"great artists that we had just lost\" and the next generation of rockers, who she hoped would \"be less materialistic, more bonded with the people and not so glamorous\", and that from a more humanistic perspective, she had also aimed \"to reach out to other disenfranchised people\" like herself. Smith said, \"I was consciously trying to make a record that would make a certain type of person not feel alone. People who were like me, different... I wasn't targeting the whole world. I wasn't trying to make a hit record.\"\nRecording.\nArista arranged for Smith to begin recording her debut album in August 1975. At Smith's suggestion, the label planned to book studio time for Smith with producer Tom Dowd at Criteria in Miami, but Dowd's close association with rival label Atlantic Records stalled these plans. Smith had a change of heart and instead set out to enlist Welsh musician John Cale, formerly of the New York City rock band the Velvet Underground, to produce \"Horses\" after she was impressed by the raw sound of his solo albums, such as 1974's \"Fear\". Cale accepted, already familiar with Smith's band and being acquainted with the band's bassist Ivan Kr\u00e1l.\n\"Horses\" was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with Smith retaining the same backing band with whom she performed live at the time\u2014Jay Dee Daugherty on drums, Lenny Kaye on guitar, Ivan Kr\u00e1l on bass guitar, and Richard Sohl on keyboards. For the album, Smith and her band recorded several songs that were already fixtures of their sets at CBGB, including \"Gloria\", \"Redondo Beach\", \"Birdland\", and \"Land\". Allen Lanier of Blue \u00d6yster Cult and Tom Verlaine of Television participated in the recording sessions as guest musicians, performing on the songs \"Elegie\" and \"Break It Up\", respectively.\nThe first studio session was held on September 2. Cale later recalled that the band initially \"sounded awful\" and played out of tune due to their use of damaged instruments, compelling him to procure the band new instruments before commencing recording. The differences between the work process of Cale, who was an experienced recording artist, and the process of Smith, who at that point was primarily a live performer, became apparent in the early stages of recording and were a source of tension between the two artists, who frequently clashed in the studio. Lenny Kaye also highlighted the irreconcilable differences between their musical visions for the album, with Cale picturing \"a more arranged record, one fleshed out with intriguing sound palettes and melodic lines\", and Smith and her band preferring a more spontaneous approach to playing their material, akin to their live performances. The final album was ultimately informed by both perspectives, making use of multitracking and overdubbing on its more structured songs, while still capturing the musical improvisation that typified the band's live act. Cale wished to augment the band's approach on certain songs with string instruments, but Smith vehemently opposed this idea. Lanier, who was Smith's boyfriend at the time, did not get along with Cale, nor\u2014particularly so\u2014with Verlaine, who had previously dated Smith. This tension culminated with Lanier and Verlaine getting into a physical altercation during the final session, held on September 18.\nFor several years after the album's release, Smith often downplayed Cale's contributions to \"Horses\" and suggested that she and her band had ignored his suggestions entirely. In a 1976 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Smith described her experience:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My picking John was about as arbitrary as picking Rimbaud. I saw the cover of \"Illuminations\" with Rimbaud's face, y'know, he looked so cool, just like Bob Dylan. So Rimbaud became my favorite poet. I looked at the cover of \"Fear\" and I said, 'Now there's a set of cheekbones.' In my mind I picked him because his records sounded good. But I hired the wrong guy. All I was really looking for was a technical person. Instead, I got a total maniac artist. I went to pick out an expensive watercolor painting and instead I got a mirror. It was really like \"A Season in Hell\", for both of us. But inspiration doesn't always have to be someone sending me half a dozen American Beauty roses. There's a lotta inspiration going on between the murderer and the victim. And he had me so nuts I wound up doing this nine-minute cut that transcended anything I ever did before.\nCale said in 1996 that Smith initially struck him as \"someone with an incredibly volatile mouth who could handle any situation\", and that as producer on \"Horses\" he wanted to capture the energy of her live performances, noting that there \"was a lot of power in Patti's use of language, in the way images collided with one another.\" He likened their working relationship during recording to \"an immutable force meeting an immovable object.\" Smith would later attribute much of the tension between herself and Cale to her inexperience with formal studio recording, recalling that she was \"very, very suspicious, very guarded and hard to work with\" and \"made it difficult for him to do some of the things he had to do.\" She expressed gratitude for Cale's persistence in working with her and her band, and found that his production made the most out of their \"adolescent and honest flaws\".\nMusical style.\nSmith characterized \"Horses\" as \"three-chord rock merged with the power of the word\". \"Consequence\"'s Lior Phillips noted that the minimalist quality of the album's music \"matched the tone of\" the nascent punk rock genre, which had emerged in New York City in the mid-1970s, and counted Smith, Television, and fellow CBGB regulars such as the Ramones as practitioners. Author Joe Tarr identified a punk sensibility in the music's reliance on simple chord progressions, and William Ruhlmann of AllMusic also cited Lenny Kaye's rudimentary guitar playing and the \"anarchic spirit\" of Smith's vocals as being representative of punk. Tarr wrote that the band \"proudly flaunted a garage rock aesthetic\" on \"Horses\", while Smith \"sang with the delirious release of an inspired amateur\", emphasizing \"honest passion\" over technical proficiency. Smith's vocals on the album alternate between being sung and spoken, an approach that, according to Peter Murphy of \"Hot Press\", \"challenged the very notion of a demarcation\" between the two forms.\nAllMusic critic Steve Huey observed that \"Horses\" borrowed ideas from the avant-garde, with the music showcasing the band's free jazz-inspired interplay and improvisation, while still remaining \"firmly rooted in primal three-chord rock &amp; roll.\" He called \"Horses\" \"essentially the first art punk album.\" Smith and her band's musical improvisation differentiated them from most of their punk contemporaries, whose songs rarely diverged from straightforward three-chord structures. Throughout \"Horses\", they also tempered their punk sound with elements of other musical styles, balancing more conventional rock songs with excursions into reggae (\"Redondo Beach\") and jazz (\"Birdland\").\nLyrics.\nFiona Sturges of \"The Guardian\" described Smith's lyrics on \"Horses\" as being steeped in \"intricate phrasing and imagery\" that \"deliberately blurred the lines between punk and poetry\", while CMJ writer Steve Klinge found that they recalled the energy of Beat poetry and the \"revolutionary spirit\" of French poet Arthur Rimbaud, one of Smith's primary influences. Smith drew on different sources of lyrical inspiration for \"Horses\", with some songs being autobiographical and others being rooted in dreams and fantastical scenarios. She left the genders of the songs' protagonists ambiguous, a stylistic choice she said was \"learnt from Joan Baez, who often sang songs that had a male point of view\", while also serving as a declaration \"that as an artist, I can take any position, any voice, that I want.\"\nSmith's experiences with her family inspired specific songs on \"Horses\". \"Redondo Beach\", whose lyrics concern a woman who commits suicide following a quarrel with the song's narrator, was written by Smith after an incident involving her and her sister Linda. The two had gotten into a heated argument, prompting Linda to leave their shared apartment and not return until the next day. \"Kimberly\" is a dedication to its namesake, Smith's younger sister, and finds the singer recounting a childhood memory of holding Kimberly in her arms during a lightning storm. In \"Free Money\", Smith describes growing up in poverty in New Jersey and recalls her mother fantasizing about winning the lottery.\nOther songs were penned by Smith about notable public figures. \"Birdland\" was inspired by \"A Book of Dreams\", a 1973 memoir of Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich by his son Peter, and revolves around a narrative in which Peter, at his father's funeral, imagines leaving on a UFO piloted by his father's spirit. \"Break It Up\" was written about Jim Morrison, lead singer of the Doors; its lyrics are based on Smith's recollection of her visit to Morrison's grave in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, as well as a dream in which she witnessed a winged Morrison stuck to a marble slab, trying and eventually succeeding in breaking free from the stone. \"Elegie\" is a requiem for rock musician Jimi Hendrix and quotes a line from his 1968 song \"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\". It was recorded, at Smith's request, on the fifth anniversary of Hendrix's death, which fell on September 18, the final day of recording. Smith said that the song was also intended to pay tribute to other deceased rock artists such as Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and Janis Joplin.\nTwo songs on \"Horses\" are partial adaptations of rock standards: \"Gloria\", a radical reimagining of the 1964 Them song incorporating verses from Smith's own poem \"Oath\", and \"Land\", which features the first verse of Chris Kenner's 1962 song \"Land of a Thousand Dances\". In \"Land\", Smith weaves the imagery of the Kenner song into an elaborate narrative about a character named Johnny\u2014an allusion to the similarly named homoerotic protagonist of the 1971 William S. Burroughs novel \"The Wild Boys\"\u2014while additionally referencing Arthur Rimbaud and, indirectly, Jimi Hendrix, whom Smith imagined to be the song's protagonist, \"dreaming a simple rock-and-roll song, and it takes him into all these other realms.\" The characterization of Johnny in \"Land\" was also inspired by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe\u2014who was a close friend of Smith and shot the picture of her used for the \"Horses\" album cover\u2014and his experiences in the New York S&amp;M scene; in her memoir \"Just Kids\" (2010), Smith refers to Mapplethorpe and Burroughs, sitting together in CBGB, as \"Johnny and the horse\".\nArtwork.\nThe cover photograph for \"Horses\" was taken by Robert Mapplethorpe at the Greenwich Village penthouse apartment of his partner Sam Wagstaff. Smith, shrouded in natural light, is seen wearing a plain white shirt, which she had purchased at a Salvation Army shop on the Bowery, and slinging a black jacket over her shoulder and her favorite black ribbon around her collar. Embedded on the jacket is a horse pin that Allen Lanier had given her. Smith described her appearance as recalling those of French poet Charles Baudelaire and, in the slinging of the jacket, American singer and actor Frank Sinatra. She recounted that Mapplethorpe \"took, like, twelve pictures, and at about the eighth one, he said, 'I have it.' I said, 'How do you know?' and he said, 'I just know,' and I said, 'Okay.' And that was it.\"\nThe black-and-white treatment and androgynous pose were a departure from the typical promotional images of female singers of the time. Arista executives wanted to make various changes to the photograph, but Smith overruled their suggestions. Clive Davis wrote in 2013 that he was initially conflicted about the image, recognizing its \"power\" but feeling that it would confuse audiences unfamiliar with Smith and her style of music. He put aside his reservations and approved the cover after realizing that he needed \"to trust her artistic instincts thoroughly\".\nFeminist writer Camille Paglia later referred to the \"Horses\" cover photograph as \"one of the greatest pictures ever taken of a woman.\" In 2017, \"World Cafe\" presenter Talia Schlanger wrote that \"Smith's unapologetic androgyny predates a time when that was an en vogue or even available option for women, and represents a seminal moment in the reversal of the female gaze. Smith is looking at you, and could care less [\"sic\"] what you think about looking at her. That was radical for a woman in 1975. It is still radical today.\" Smith herself stated that she had not intended to make a \"big statement\" with the cover, which she said simply reflected the way she dressed. \"I wasn't thinking that I was going to break any boundaries. I just like dressing like Baudelaire,\" she remarked in 1996.\nRelease.\nPromotion and sales.\nOn September 18, 1975, the same day that they finished recording \"Horses\", Smith and her band performed a promotional live concert at an Arista convention held at the New York City Center, where they were personally introduced by Clive Davis. They previewed five songs from the album: \"Birdland\", \"Redondo Beach\", \"Break It Up\", \"Land\", and, as their encore, \"Free Money\". Lisa Robinson reported afterward in \"NME\" that the \"stupendous, truly exciting\" performance was met with a highly ecstatic response from the Arista executives in attendance.\n\"Horses\" was released on November 10, 1975. Smith had originally requested for the album to be issued on October 20, the birthday of Arthur Rimbaud, but due to a shortage of vinyl, the release date was postponed, in what Smith described as a \"magical\" coincidence, to November 10, the anniversary of Rimbaud's death. Commercially, it performed respectably for a debut album, despite receiving little radio airplay. In the United States, \"Horses\" peaked at number 47 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, remaining on the chart for 17 weeks. The album also managed chart placings in Australia, where it reached number 80; Canada, where it reached number 52; and the Netherlands, where it reached number 18. To promote \"Horses\", Smith and her band toured the US and made their network television debut performing on the NBC variety show \"Saturday Night Live\", then traveled to Europe for an appearance on the BBC Two music show \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\" and a short tour. \"Gloria\" was released as a single in April 1976. Smith's cover of the Who's \"My Generation\", performed live in Cleveland, served as the single's B-side.\nCritical reception.\n\"Horses\" was met with near-universal acclaim from critics. Music journalist Mary Anne Cassata said that it was roundly hailed as \"one of the most original first albums ever recorded.\" Reviewing the album for \"Rolling Stone\", John Rockwell wrote that \"Horses\" is \"wonderful in large measure because it recognizes the overwhelming importance of words\" in Smith's work, covering a range of themes \"far beyond what most rock records even dream of.\" Rockwell highlighted Smith's adaptations of \"Gloria\" and \"Land of a Thousand Dances\" as the most striking moments on the record, finding that she had rendered the songs \"far more expansive than their original creators could have dreamed.\" In \"Creem\", Lester Bangs wrote that Smith's music \"in its ultimate moments touches deep wellsprings of emotion that extremely few artists in rock or anywhere else are capable of reaching\", and declared that with \"her wealth of promise and the most incandescent flights and stillnesses of this album she joins the ranks of people like Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, or the Dylan of 'Sad Eyed Lady' and Royal Albert Hall.\" \"The Village Voice\"'s Robert Christgau said that while the album does not capture Smith's humor, it \"gets the minimalist fury of her band and the revolutionary dimension of her singing just fine.\"\nIn the British music press, \"Horses\" had some detractors. \"Street Life\" reviewer Angus MacKinnon found that the album's minimalist sound merely reflected Smith and her band's musical incompetence. Steve Lake derided the album in \"Melody Maker\" as an embodiment of \"precisely what's wrong with rock and roll right now\", panning it as \"completely contrived 'amateurism'\" with a \"'so bad it's good' aesthetic\". Conversely, Jonh Ingham of \"Sounds\" penned a five-star review of \"Horses\", naming it \"the record of the year\" and \"one of the most stunning, commanding, engrossing platters to come down the turnpike since John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\"\". \"NME\" critic Charles Shaar Murray called it \"an album in a thousand\" and \"an important album in terms of what rock can encompass without losing its identity as a musical form, in that it introduces an artist of greater vision than has been seen in rock for far too long.\" English television host and future Factory Records co-founder Tony Wilson was so enthused by the record that he made repeated attempts to book Smith and her band for an appearance on his Granada Television program \"So It Goes\".\nAt the end of 1975, \"Horses\" was voted the second-best album of the year, behind Bob Dylan and the Band's \"The Basement Tapes\", in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published in \"The Village Voice\". \"NME\" placed \"Horses\" at number 13 on its year-end list of 1975's best albums. According to writer Philip Shaw in his 33\u2153 book profiling the album, the enthusiastic reaction to \"Horses\" from the music press quickly assuaged observers' suspicions that Smith had sold out by signing to a major label. The album's sales were aided by the positive critical reception, along with substantial promotional efforts by Arista.\nLegacy and influence.\n\"Horses\" cemented Smith's reputation as a central figure of the New York City punk rock scene. It has frequently been cited as the first punk rock album, as well as one of the key recordings of the punk movement, appearing in professional lists of the best punk albums of all time. \"Pipping the Ramones' first album to the post by five months,\" Simon Reynolds wrote in \"The Observer\", \"\"Horses\" is generally considered not just one of the most startling debuts in rock history but the spark that ignited the punk explosion.\" \"Horses\" has been described as a landmark for both punk and its offshoot genre new wave, inspiring \"a raw, almost amateurish energy for the former and critical, engaging reflexivity for the latter\", according to Chris Smith in his book \"101 Albums That Changed Popular Music\" (2009). Philip Shaw stated that the album \"created the template\" for subsequent rock music of an \"intelligent and self-conscious, yet visceral and exciting\" sensibility, identifying its influence on the alternative rock, indie rock, and grunge movements that followed the punk era. \"Variety\" critic David Sprague further noted that \"\"Horses\"\u2014which became the first major-label punk-rock album when Arista unleashed it in 1975\u2014not only helped spread the gospel of Bowery art-punk around the world, it set the tone for smart, unbending female rockers of generations to come.\" \"\"Horses\" was hard to enjoy, but I think that was the point. Having been squired by \"Rolling Stone\", whose '60s-centric sensibility was much of what Smith took aim at, I probably had a similar initial reaction... that critics swaddled in the Beatles and Stones did\", reflected NPR's Charlie Kaplan, who over time came to view it as \"a great work, even despite its weaknesses... I still feel the chill of Patti Smith's suspicious gaze when I look at the cover of \"Horses\", but now I feel like I can explain it a little better.\"\nVarious musicians have credited \"Horses\" as an influence. Viv Albertine of the Slits said that the album \"absolutely and completely changed\" her life, adding: \"Us girls never stood in front of a mirror posing as if we had a guitar because we had no role models. So, when Patti Smith came along, it was huge. She was groundbreakingly different.\" Siouxsie and the Banshees frontwoman Siouxsie Sioux, naming \"Land\" as a recording she considered particularly influential on her, remarked that \"apart from Nico, Patti was the first real female writer in rock.\" R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe bought a copy of \"Horses\" as a high school student and later stated that the album \"tore [his] limbs off and put them back on in a whole different order\", citing Smith as his primary inspiration for becoming a musician. Similarly, his R.E.M. bandmate Peter Buck cited attending the four Atlanta shows Smith played on her first US tour as the moment he started to seriously consider forming a group. Morrissey and Johnny Marr shared an appreciation for the record, and one of their early compositions for the Smiths, \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", uses a melody based on that of \"Kimberly\". Courtney Love of Hole recounted that listening to \"Horses\" as a teenager helped encourage her to pursue a career in rock music, while PJ Harvey recalled hearing the album and finding it \"brilliant\u2014not so much her music but her delivery, words, and her articulation. Her honesty.\" KT Tunstall wrote her hit single \"Suddenly I See\" (2004) about how she felt inspired to embrace her musical ambitions after seeing Smith on the cover of \"Horses\".\n\"Horses\" has often been named by music critics as one of the all-time greatest albums. Lars Brandle of \"Billboard\" wrote that the album had come to be regarded as \"one of the finest in recorded music history.\" In 2003 and 2012, \"Horses\" was ranked at number 44 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, later placing at number 26 on a 2020 updated list. \"NME\" named it the 12th-greatest album of all time in a similar list published in 2013. In 2006, \"Time\" named \"Horses\" as one of the \"All-\"Time\" 100 Albums\", and \"The Observer\" listed it as one of 50 albums that changed music history. Three years later, the album was preserved by the Library of Congress into the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". \"Horses\" was also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021.\nFor the 30th anniversary of \"Horses\", the full album was performed live by Smith on June 25, 2005 at the Royal Festival Hall, during the Meltdown festival, which Smith curated. She was backed by original band members Lenny Kaye and Jay Dee Daugherty, as well as Tony Shanahan on bass guitar and piano, Tom Verlaine on guitar, and Flea on bass guitar and trumpet. In 2015, Smith performed \"Horses\" in its entirety at a series of concerts celebrating its 40th anniversary. The 30th-anniversary performance was released on November 8, 2005 as the second disc of a double CD titled \"Horses/Horses\", with the digitally remastered version of the original 1975 album, along with the bonus track \"My Generation\", on the first disc. For the release, the live set was recorded by Emery Dobyns and mixed by Dobyns and Shanahan. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, \"Horses\" was reissued on October 10, 2025 as a double-disc set on CD and LP, with the first disc containing the remastered album and the second disc comprising previously unreleased outtakes and rarities, including demos that Smith had recorded for a 1975 audition tape for RCA Records. The original album has also been reissued in remastered form several other times, including on June 18, 1996 (both as a standalone CD and as part of the CD box set \"The Patti Smith Masters\"), and on April 21, 2012, on LP for that year's Record Store Day celebration.\nTrack listing.\nNotes\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBand\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditional personnel\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22997", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22997", "title": "Panama", "text": "Country spanning North and South America\nPanama, officially the Republic of Panama, is a country located at the southern end of Central America, bordering South America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Its capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's over million inhabitants.\nBefore the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century, Panama was inhabited by a number of different indigenous tribes. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties agreed to transfer the canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999. The surrounding territory was returned first, in 1979.\nRevenue from canal tolls has continued to represent a significant portion of Panama's GDP, especially after the Panama Canal expansion project (finished in 2016) doubled its capacity. Commerce, banking, and tourism are major sectors. Panama is regarded as having a high-income economy. In 2019, Panama ranked 57th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index. In 2018, Panama was ranked the seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. Panama was ranked 82nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2025. Covering around 40 percent of its land area, Panama's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals \u2013 some of them found nowhere else on Earth.\nPanama is a founding member of the United Nations and other international organizations such as the Organization of American States, Latin America Integration Association, Group of 77, World Health Organization, and Non-Aligned Movement.\nEtymology.\nThe exact origin of the name \"Panama\" remains uncertain, with several theories proposed.\nA widely recounted legend holds that \"Panam\u00e1\" was the name of a fishing village encountered by Spanish colonists, purportedly meaning \"abundance of fish.\" While the precise location of this village is unknown, the legend is often associated with accounts from Spanish explorer Antonio Tello de Guzm\u00e1n, who in 1515 described landing at an unnamed indigenous fishing village along the Pacific coast. Subsequently, in 1517, Spanish lieutenant Gaspar de Espinosa established a trading post at the site, and in 1519, Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila founded Panama City there, replacing the earlier settlement of Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua del Dari\u00e9n.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian period.\nThe Isthmus of Panama was formed about three\u00a0million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally became complete, and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the Americas from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.\nThe earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in Panama include Paleo-Indian projectile points. Later central Panama was home to some of the first pottery-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at Monagrillo, which date back to 2500\u20131700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500\u2013900 AD) at the Monagrillo archaeological site, and their Gran Cocl\u00e9 style polychrome pottery. The monumental monolithic sculptures at the Barriles (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.\nBefore Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by Chibchan, Chocoan, and Cueva peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed by regular regional routes of commerce. Austronesians had a trade network to Panama as there is evidence of coconuts reaching the Pacific coast of Panama from the Philippines in Precolumbian times.\nWhen Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population decline of the natives. The indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to diseases such as smallpox which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.\nConquest to 1799.\nRodrigo de Bastidas sailed westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold, and became the first European to explore the isthmus of Panama. A year later, Christopher Columbus visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the province of Darien. Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the New World. King Ferdinand II assigned Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila as Royal Governor. He arrived in June 1514 with 19 vessels and 1,500 men. In 1519, D\u00e1vila founded Panama City. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way. At 1520 the Genoese controlled the port of Panama. The Genoese obtained a concession from the Spanish to exploit the port of Panama mainly for the slave trade, until the destruction of the primeval city in 1671. In the meantime in 1635 Don Sebasti\u00e1n Hurtado de Corcuera, the then governor of Panama, had recruited Genoese, Peruvians, and Panamanians, as soldiers to wage war against Muslims in the Philippines and to found the city of Zamboanga.\nPanama was under Spanish rule for almost 300 years (1538\u20131821), and became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of \"geographic destiny\", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.\nSpanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as \"indios de guerra\" (war Indians). However, Panama was important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to ship silver mined in Peru to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed on the west coast of Panama and then taken overland to Portobello or Nombre de Dios on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. Aside from the European route, there was also an Asian-American route, which led to traders and adventurers carrying silver from Peru going over land through Panama to reach Acapulco, Mexico before sailing to Manila, Philippines using the famed Manila galleons. In 1579, the royal monopoly that Acapulco, Mexico had on trading with Manila, Philippines was relaxed and Panama was assigned as another port that was able to trade directly with Asia.\nBecause of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from \"new world\" Africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or \"palenques\" around the Camino Real in Panama's Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under Bayano, which emerged in the 1552 to 1558 period. Sir Francis Drake's famous raids on Panama in 1572\u201373 and John Oxenham's crossing to the Pacific Ocean were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.\nThe following elements helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies: the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540\u20131740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire \u2013 the first modern global empire.\nPanama was the site of the ill-fated Darien scheme, which set up a Scottish colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of England and Scotland in 1707.\nIn 1671, the privateer Henry Morgan, licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of Panama \u2013 the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the viceroyalty of New Granada (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 (the modern capital of Colombia) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Peru and even by Panama's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogot\u00e1 would persist for centuries.\nIn 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama's importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.\n1800s.\nAs the Spanish American wars of independence were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of Azuero without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both Veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.\nNevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.\nIt was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel Jos\u00e9 Pedro Antonio de F\u00e1brega y de las Cuevas (1774\u20131841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.\nWhat they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, Juan de la Cruz Murge\u00f3n, left the isthmus on a campaign in Quito and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting F\u00e1brega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, F\u00e1brega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, F\u00e1brega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.\nPost-colonial Panama.\nIn the 80 years following independence from Spain, Panama was a subdivision of Gran Colombia, after voluntarily joining the country at the end of 1821. It then became part of the Republic of New Granada in 1831 and was divided into several provinces. In 1855, the autonomous State of Panama was created within the Republic out of the New Granada provinces of Panama, Azuero, Chiriqu\u00ed, and Veraguas. It continued as a state in the Granadine Confederation (1858\u20131863) and United States of Colombia (1863\u20131886). The 1886 constitution of the modern Republic of Colombia created a new Panama Department.\nThe people of the isthmus made over 80 attempts to secede from Colombia. They came close to success in 1831, then again during the Thousand Days' War of 1899\u20131902, understood among Indigenous Panamanians as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of Victoriano Lorenzo.\nThe US intent to influence the area, especially the Panama Canal's construction and control, led to the secession of Panama from Colombia in 1903 and its political independence. When the Senate of Colombia rejected the Hay\u2013Herr\u00e1n Treaty on January 22, 1903, the United States decided to support and encourage the Panamanian secessionist movement.\nIn November 1903, Panama, tacitly supported by the United States, proclaimed its independence and concluded the Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty with the United States without the presence of a single Panamanian. Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer and lobbyist represented Panama even though Panama's president and a delegation had arrived in New York to negotiate the treaty. Bunau-Varilla was a shareholder in a French company (the \"Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama\"), which had acquired the rights of the original French company which had gone bankrupt in 1889. The treaty was quickly drafted and signed the night before the Panamanian delegation arrived in Washington. The treaty granted rights to the United States \"as if it were sovereign\" in a zone roughly wide and long. In that zone, the US would build a canal, then administer, fortify, and defend it \"in perpetuity\".\nIn 1914, the United States completed the existing canal.\nBecause of the strategic importance of the canal during World War II, the US extensively fortified access to it.\nFrom 1903 to 1968, Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a commercially oriented oligarchy. During the 1950s, the Panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy's political hegemony. The early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in Panama for the renegotiation of the Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty, including riots that broke out in early 1964, resulting in widespread looting and dozens of deaths, and the evacuation of the American embassy.\nAmid negotiations for the Robles\u2013Johnson treaty, Panama held elections in 1968. The candidates were:\nArias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo. On October 1, 1968, Arias Madrid took office as president of Panama, promising to lead a government of \"national union\" that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new Panama. A week and a half later, on October 11, 1968, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) ousted Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the United States' invasion in 1989. Arias, who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard, broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard. To preserve the Guard's and his vested interests, Lieutenant Colonel Omar Torrijos Herrera and Major Boris Mart\u00ednez commanded another military coup against the government.\nThe military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship, and promised a return to constitutional rule. In the meantime, the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup. Among them were:\nParallel to this, the military began a policy of repression against the opposition, who were labeled communists. The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that was to arrange new elections. However, the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself \"El Gobierno Revolucionario\" (The Revolutionary Government).\nPost-1970.\nUnder Omar Torrijos's control, the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country, initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education.\nThe constitution was changed in 1972. To reform the constitution, the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (Power of the People), was composed of 505 members selected by the military with no participation from political parties, which the military had eliminated. The new constitution proclaimed Omar Torrijos as the Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution, and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a fa\u00e7ade of constitutionality, Demetrio B. Lakas was appointed president for the same period.\nIn 1981, Torrijos died in a plane crash. Torrijos' death altered the tone of Panama's political evolution. Despite the 1983 constitutional amendments which proscribed a political role for the military, the Panama Defense Force (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate Panamanian political life. By this time, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government.\nIn the 1984 elections, the candidates were:\nBarletta was declared the winner of elections that had been considered to be fraudulent. Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Amid the economic crisis and Barletta's efforts to calm the country's creditors, street protests arose, and so did military repression.\nMeanwhile, Noriega's regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies, providing revenues from drugs and money laundering. Toward the end of the military dictatorship, a new wave of Chinese migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the United States. The smuggling of Chinese became an enormous business, with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega's regime (see Mon 167).\nThe military dictatorship assassinated or tortured more than one hundred Panamanians and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Z\u00e1rate 15). Noriega's regime was supported by the United States and it began playing a double role in Central America. While the Contadora group, an initiative launched by the foreign ministers of various Latin American nations including Panama's, conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied Nicaraguan Contras and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition on behalf of the CIA.\nOn June 6, 1987, the recently retired Colonel Roberto D\u00edaz Herrera, resentful that Noriega had broken the agreed-upon \"Torrijos Plan\" of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after Noriega, decided to denounce the regime. He revealed details of electoral fraud, accused Noriega of planning Torrijos's death and declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of Iran for giving the exiled Iranian leader asylum. He also accused Noriega of the assassination by decapitation of then-opposition leader, Dr. Hugo Spadafora.\nOn the night of June 9, 1987, the Cruzada Civilista (\"Civic Crusade\") was created and began organizing actions of civil disobedience. The Crusade called for a general strike. In response, the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country. On July 10, the Civic Crusade called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the \"Dobermans\", the military's special riot control unit. That day, later known as El Viernes Negro (\"Black Friday\"), left many people injured and killed.\nUnited States President Ronald Reagan began a series of sanctions against the military regime. The United States froze economic and military assistance to Panama in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in Panama and an attack on the US embassy. The sanctions failed to oust Noriega, but severely hurt Panama's economy. Panama's gross domestic product (GDP) declined almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989.\nOn February 5, 1988, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami. Human Rights Watch wrote in its 1989 report: \"Washington turned a blind eye to abuses in Panama for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [Noriega] by two grand juries in Florida in February 1988\".\nIn April 1988, US President Ronald Reagan invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, freezing Panamanian government assets in all US organizations. In May 1989 Panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti-Noriega candidates. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression.\nUS invasion (1989).\nThe United States invaded Panama on December 20, 1989, codenamed Operation Just Cause. The U.S. stated the operation was \"necessary to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama, defend democracy and human rights, combat drug trafficking, and secure the neutrality of the Panama Canal as required by the Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties\". The US reported 23 servicemen killed and 324 wounded, with the number of Panamanian soldiers killed estimated at 450. The estimates for civilians killed in the conflict ranges from 200 to 4,000. The United Nations put the Panamanian civilian death toll at 500, Americas Watch estimated 300, the United States gave a figure of 202 civilians killed and former US attorney general Ramsey Clark estimated 4,000 deaths. It represented the largest United States military operation since the Vietnam War. The number of US civilians (and their dependents), who had worked for the Panama Canal Commission and the US military, and were killed by the Panamanian Defense Forces, has never been fully disclosed.\nOn December 29, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution calling the intervention in Panama a \"flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States\". A similar resolution was vetoed in the Security Council by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Noriega was captured and flown to Miami to be tried. The conflict ended on January 31, 1990.\nThe urban population, many living below the poverty level, was greatly affected by the 1989 intervention. As pointed out in 1995 by a UN Technical Assistance Mission to Panama, the fighting displaced 20,000 people. The most heavily affected district was the El Chorrillo area of Panama City, where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed. The economic damage caused by the fighting has been estimated at between 1.5 and 2 billion dollars. Most Panamanians supported the intervention.\nPost-intervention era.\nPanama's Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calder\u00f3n.\nDuring its five-year term, the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public's high expectations. Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares was sworn in as president on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign.\nOn September 1, 1999, Mireya Moscoso, the widow of former president Arnulfo Arias Madrid, took office after defeating PRD candidate Mart\u00edn Torrijos, son of Omar Torrijos, in a free and fair election. During her administration, Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs, especially for child and youth development, protection, and general welfare. Moscoso's administration successfully handled the Panama Canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the Canal.\nThe PRD's Martin Torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the National Assembly in 2004. Torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of, among other pledges, a \"zero tolerance\" for corruption, a problem endemic to the Moscoso and Perez Balladares administrations. After taking office, Torrijos passed a number of laws which made the government more transparent. He formed a National Anti-Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government and civil society, labor organizations, and religious leadership. In addition, many of his closest Cabinet ministers were non-political technocrats known for their support for the Torrijos government's anti-corruption aims. Despite the Torrijos administration's public stance on corruption, many high-profile cases, particularly involving political or business elites, were never acted upon.\nConservative supermarket magnate Ricardo Martinelli was elected to succeed Martin Torrijos with a landslide victory in the May 2009 Panamanian general election. Martinelli's business credentials drew voters worried by slowing growth during the Great Recession. Standing for the four-party opposition Alliance for Change, Martinelli gained 60 percent of the vote, against 37 percent for the candidate of the governing left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).\nOn May 4, 2014, Vice President Juan Carlos Varela, candidate of the Partido Panamenista (Panamanian Party) won the 2014 presidential election with over 39 percent of the votes, against the party of his former political partner Ricardo Martinelli, Cambio Democr\u00e1tico, and their candidate Jos\u00e9 Domingo Arias. He was sworn in on July 1, 2014. On July 1, 2019 Laurentino Cortizo took possession of the presidency. Cortizo was the candidate of Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) in the May 2019 presidential election.\nDuring the presidency of Cortizo, numerous events happened in the country, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, and the 2022 and 2023 protests.\nOn July 1, 2024, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino was sworn in as Panama's new president. Mulino, a close ally of former president Ricardo Martinelli, won the presidential election in May 2024. In 2024, due to a rapid rise of Chinese immigration to Panama supplanting the local population and now forming 4% of the people, of which, they are accused by the United States of spying for the Chinese Communist Party, in the strategic isthmus of Panama which is crucial for the trade in the Americas, thus, American President Donald Trump has threatened to sanction Panama unless the threat of China is neutralized.\nGeography.\nPanama is located in Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, between Colombia and Costa Rica. It mostly lies between latitudes 7\u00b0 and 10\u00b0N, and longitudes 77\u00b0 and 83\u00b0W (a small area lies west of 83\u00b0).\nIts location on the Isthmus of Panama is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the Panama Canal which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the north of the Pacific Ocean. Panama's total area is .\nThe dominant feature of Panama's geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that form the continental divide. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the Andean system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.\nThe mountain range of the divide is called the Cordillera de Talamanca near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serran\u00eda de Tabasar\u00e1, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the Cordillera Central.\nThe highest point in the country is the Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa, which rises to . A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the Dari\u00e9n Gap between Panama and Colombia where Colombian guerrillas and drug dealers operate and sometimes take hostages. This, as well as unrest and forest protection movements, creates the only break in the Pan-American Highway, which otherwise forms a complete road from Alaska to Patagonia.\nWaterways.\nNearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the R\u00edo Chagres (\"Chagres River\"), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of hydroelectric power. The central part of the river is dammed by the Gatun Dam and forms Gatun Lake, an artificial lake that constitutes part of the Panama Canal. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the R\u00edo Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the R\u00edo Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.\nThe R\u00edo Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the R\u00edo Tuira, which flows into the Golfo de San Miguel and is the nation's only river that is navigable by larger vessels.\nHarbors.\nThe Caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbors. However, Crist\u00f3bal, at the Caribbean terminus of the canal, had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s. The numerous islands of the Archipi\u00e9lago de Bocas del Toro, near the Beaches of Costa Rica, provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of Almirante. The more than 350 San Blas Islands near Colombia, are strung out over more than along the sheltered Caribbean coastline.\nThe terminal ports located at each end of the Panama Canal, namely the Port of Crist\u00f3bal, Col\u00f3n, and the Port of Balboa, are ranked second and third respectively in Latin America in terms of the number of container units (TEU) handled. The Port of Balboa covers 182 hectares and contains four berths for containers and two multi-purpose berths. In total, the berths are over long with alongside depth of . The Port of Balboa has 18 super post-Panamax and Panamax quay cranes and 44 gantry cranes. The Port of Balboa also contains of warehouse space.\nThe Ports of Cristobal (encompassing the container terminals of Panama Ports Cristobal, Manzanillo International Terminal, and Colon Container Terminal) handled 2,210,720 TEU in 2009, second only to the Port of Santos, Brazil, in Latin America.\nExcellent deep water ports capable of accommodating large VLCC (Very Large Crude Oil Carriers) are located at Charco Azul, Chiriqu\u00ed (Pacific), and Chiriqu\u00ed Grande, Bocas del Toro (Atlantic) near Panama's western border with Costa Rica. The Trans-Panama pipeline, running across the isthmus, has operated between Charco Azul and Chiriqu\u00ed Grande since 1979.\nClimate.\nPanama has a tropical climate. Temperatures are uniformly high\u2014as is the relative humidity\u2014and there is little seasonal variation. Diurnal ranges are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be and the afternoon maximum . The temperature seldom exceeds for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the Cordillera de Talamanca in western Panama.\nClimatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on rainfall, which varies regionally from less than to more than per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the continental divide, due in part to occasional tropical cyclone activity nearby; Panama lies outside the Main Development Region. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Col\u00f3n.\nPanama is one of three countries in the world to be carbon-negative, meaning that it absorbs more carbon dioxide than it releases into the atmosphere. The others are Bhutan and Suriname.\nClimate change has a negative impact on Panama, reducing the water level of the Panama Canal, meaning less ships make it through and affecting its economy.\nBiodiversity.\nPanama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, deforestation is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. One of the causes of the deforestation is due to mining, and the construction of the Pan-American Highway. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practiced from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. Mangrove swamps occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied rainforest abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other. Panama had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.37/10, ranking it 78th globally out of 172 countries. Two-thirds of Panama's forests are located in indigenous territories, and 25% of Panama's territory is protected.\nPanama has 16 . Soberan\u00eda National Park has the greatest diversity of birds for birdwatching, with more than 525 birds inhabiting the area. It also has a variety of mammals such as capybaras and coyotes, reptiles like the green iguana, and amphibians such as the cane toad. Darien National Park, known for the Darien Gap, is the largest national park in Central America, and is also a UNESCO World Heritage site. There is also the Metropolitan National Park outside Panama City, and the largest island of Panama is Coiba Island Park.\nThere is a Harlequin Frog Festival every year in Panama to raise awareness, as this species is threatened by habitat destruction and pollution.\nGovernment and politics.\nPanama's politics take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Panama is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nNational elections are universal for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama's National Assembly is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections require a plurality; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.\nPanama was an electoral democracy in 2024 as classified by the Regimes of the World index.\nPolitical culture.\nSince the end of Manuel Noriega's military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and various smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former president Mart\u00edn Torrijos is the son of the general Omar Torrijos. He succeeded Mireya Moscoso, the widow of the former president Arnulfo Arias. Panama's most recent national elections took place on May 5, 2024.\nAdministrative divisions.\nBocasdel Toro \nCocl\u00e9 \nCol\u00f3n \nChiriqu\u00ed \nDari\u00e9n \nHerrera \nLos Santos \nPanam\u00e1Oeste \nPanam\u00e1 \nVeraguas \nGuna Yala \nEmber\u00e1 \nEmber\u00e1 \nNasoTj\u00ebr Di \nNg\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 \nMadungand\u00ed \nWargand\u00ed \nPanama is divided into ten provinces with their respective local authorities (governors).

Also, there are six \"Comarcas\" (literally: \"Shires\") populated by a variety of indigenous groups.\nProvinces\nComarcas\nForeign relations.\nThe United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training.\nPanama is the 96th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.\nMilitary.\nShortly after its independence from Colombia in 1903, Panama abolished its army. It maintained police operations throughout the nation. During the 1940s, the Chief of Police of Panama City, Jos\u00e9 Rem\u00f3n, exercised pronounced political power in Panama. He removed and appointed several presidents. In 1952 he ran for president. The campaign was marred by police brutality and persecution of the opposition. In an election questioned by independent observers, Rem\u00f3n was declared the president. Less than three years later Rem\u00f3n was assassinated. He was the only president to be assassinated in Panamanian history. Today the Panamanian Public Forces are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being Costa Rica) to permanently abolish its standing army. Panama maintains armed police and security forces, and small air and maritime forces. They are tasked with law enforcement and can perform limited military actions.\nIn 2017, Panama signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nEconomy.\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, as of 2012[ [update]] Panama had an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent. A food surplus was registered in August 2008. On the Human Development Index, Panama ranked 60th in 2015. In more recent years, Panama's economy has experienced a boom, with growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) averaging over 10.4 percent in 2006\u20132008. Panama's economy was among the fastest growing and best managed in Latin America. The Latin Business Chronicle predicted that Panama would be the fastest growing economy in Latin America during the five-year period from 2010 to 2014, matching Brazil's 10 percent rate.\nThe expansion project on the Panama Canal is expected to boost and extend economic expansion for some time. Panama also signed the Panama\u2013United States Trade Promotion Agreement which eliminates tariffs to US services.\nEven though Panama is regarded as a high-income country, it still remains a country of stark contrasts perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities. Between 2015 and 2017, poverty at less than US$5.5 a day fell from 15.4 to an estimated 14.1 percent.\nEconomic sectors.\nPanama's economy, because of its key geographic location, is mainly based on a well-developed service sector, especially commerce, tourism, and trading. The handover of the Canal and military installations by the United States has given rise to large construction projects.\nA project to build a third set of locks for the Panama Canal was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum (with low voter turnout, however) on October 22, 2006. The official estimated cost of the project is US$5.25 billion, but the canal is of major economic importance because it provides millions of dollars of toll revenue to the national economy and provides massive employment. Transfer of control of the Canal to the Panamanian government completed in 1999, after 85 years of US control.\nCopper and gold deposits are being developed by foreign investors, to the dismay of some environmental groups, as all of the projects are located within protected areas.\nPanama as a tax haven.\nSince the early 20th century, Panama has with the revenues from the canal built the largest Regional Financial Center (IFC) in Central America, with consolidated assets being more than three times that of Panama's GDP. The banking sector employs more than 24,000 people directly. Financial intermediation contributed 9.3 percent of GDP. Stability has been a key strength of Panama's financial sector, which has benefited from the country's favorable economic and business climate. Banking institutions report sound growth and solid financial earnings. The banking supervisory regime is largely compliant with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. As a regional financial center, Panama exports some banking services, mainly to Latin America, and plays an important role in the country's economy. However, Panama still cannot compare to the position held by Hong Kong or Singapore as financial centers in Asia.\nPanama still has a reputation worldwide for being a tax haven but has agreed to enhanced transparency, especially since the release in 2016 of the Panama Papers. Significant progress has been made to improve full compliance with anti-money laundering recommendations. Panama was removed from the FATF gray list in February 2016. The European Union also removed Panama from its tax haven blacklist in 2018. However efforts remain to be made, and the IMF repeatedly mentions the need to strengthen financial transparency and fiscal structure.\nTransportation.\nPanama is home to Tocumen International Airport, Central America's largest airport and the hub for Copa Airlines, the flag carrier of Panama. Additionally, there are more than 20 smaller airfields in the country. (See list of airports in Panama).\nPanama's roads, traffic and transportation systems are generally safe, though night driving is difficult and in some cases, restricted by local authorities. This usually occurs in informal settlements. Traffic in Panama moves on the right, and Panamanian law requires that drivers and passengers wear seat belts. Highways are generally well-developed for a Latin American country. The Pan-American Highway travels from north to south through the country, starting at the border with Costa Rica, but ending short of Colombia at an area called the Dari\u00e9n Gap.\nThe Panama City area is well served by the nearly 150 bus routes publicly operated MiBus system along with the two rapid transit lines of the Panama Metro. Prior to the government operation of bus routes, Panama was served by privately operated buses called \"diablo rojos\" (English: red devils), which were typically retired school buses from the United States painted in bright colours by their operators. The \"diablo rojos\" that remain are now mainly used in rural areas.\nIn May 2022, in order to increase the supply of lower-carbon aviation fuel, the government of Panama and energy companies announced its plan to develop a major and advanced biorefinery of aviation fuel in the country.\nTourism.\nTourism in Panama has maintained its growth over the past five years due to government tax and price discounts to foreign guests and retirees. These economic incentives have caused Panama to be regarded as a relatively good place to retire. Real estate developers in Panama have increased the number of tourism destinations in the past five years because of interest in these visitor incentives.\nThe number of tourists from Europe grew by 23.1 percent during the first nine months of 2008. According to the Tourism Authority of Panama (ATP), from January to September, 71,154 tourists from Europe entered Panama, 13,373 more than in same period the previous year. Most of the European tourists were Spaniards (14,820), followed by Italians (13,216), French (10,174) and British (8,833). There were 6997 from Germany, the most populous country in the European Union. Europe has become one of the key markets to promote Panama as a tourist destination.\nIn 2012, 4.585 billion US dollars entered into the Panamanian economy as a result of tourism. This accounted for 11.34 percent of the gross national product of the country, surpassing other productive sectors. The number of tourists who arrived that year was 2.2 million.\nPanama enacted Law No. 80 in 2012 to promote foreign investment in tourism. Law 80 replaced an older Law\u00a08 of 1994. Law\u00a080 provides 100 percent exemption from income tax and real estate taxes for 15 years, duty-free imports for construction materials and equipment for five years, and a capital gains tax exemption for five years.\nCurrency.\nThe Panamanian currency is officially the balboa, fixed at a rate of 1:1 with the United States dollar since Panamanian independence in 1903. In practice, Panama is dollarized: U.S. dollars are legal tender and used for all paper currency, and whilst Panama has its own coinage, U.S. coins are widely used. Because of the tie to US dollars, Panama has traditionally had low inflation. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Panama's inflation in 2006 was 2.0 percent as measured by a weighted Consumer Price Index.\nThe balboa replaced the Colombian peso in 1904 after Panama's independence. Balboa banknotes were printed in 1941 by President Arnulfo Arias. They were recalled several days later, giving them the name \"The Seven Day Dollars\". The notes were burned by the new government, but occasionally balboa notes can be found in collections. These were the only banknotes ever issued by Panama and US notes have circulated both before and since.\nOn April 28, 2022, Panama's lawmakers approved a bill that would legalize and regulate the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The bill covers using cryptocurrency, trading it, tokenizing precious metals, and issuing digital securities, among other related topics. Its passing will also allow citizens to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay taxes. On July 14, 2023, the Supreme Court of Justice declared the bill unenforceable.\nInternational trade.\nThe high levels of Panamanian trade are in large part from the Col\u00f3n Free Trade Zone, the largest free trade zone in the Western Hemisphere. Last year the zone accounted for 92 percent of Panama's exports and 64 percent of its imports, according to an analysis of figures from the Colon zone management and estimates of Panama's trade by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Panama's economy is also very much supported by the trade and export of coffee and other agricultural products.\nThe Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the governments of the United States and Panama was signed on October 27, 1982. The treaty protects US investment and assists Panama in its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more favorable for US private investment and thereby strengthening the development of its private sector. The BIT was the first such treaty signed by the US in the Western Hemisphere. A Panama\u2013United States Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) was signed in 2007, approved by Panama on July 11, 2007, and by US President Obama on October 21, 2011, and the agreement entered into force on October 31, 2012.\nDemographics.\nPanama had an estimated population of in . The proportion of the population aged less than 15 in 2010 was 29 percent. 64.5 percent of the population was between 15 and 65, with 6.6 percent of the population 65 years or older.\nMore than half the population lives in the Panama City\u2013Col\u00f3n metropolitan corridor, which spans several cities. Panama's urban population exceeds 75 percent, making Panama's population the most urbanized in Central America.\nLargest cities.\nThese are the 10 largest Panamanian cities and towns. Most of Panama's largest cities are part of the Panama City Metropolitan Area.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEthnic groups.\nIn 2010 the population was 65 percent Mestizo (mixed White, Indigenous), 12.3 percent Indigenous, 9.2 percent Black or African descent, 6.8 percent Mulatto, and 6.7 percent White.\nThe Amerindian population includes seven ethnic groups: the Ng\u00e4be, Guna, Ember\u00e1, Bugl\u00e9, Wounaan, Naso Tjerdi (Teribe), and Bri Bri.\nMost Afro-Panamanians live on the Panama\u2013Col\u00f3n metropolitan area, the Dari\u00e9n Province, La Palma, and Bocas del Toro Province. Areas in Panama City with significant Afro-Panamian influence Rio Abajo and Casco Viejo. Black Panamanians are descendants of African slaves brought to the Americas in the Atlantic slave trade. The second wave of black people brought to Panama came from the Caribbean during the construction of the Panama Canal.\nPanama also has a considerable Chinese and Indian population brought to work on the canal during its construction. Most Chinese Panamanians reside in the province of Chiriqu\u00ed and Chinese Panamanians compose 4% of the population of Panama. Europeans and White Panamanians are a minority in Panama forming 6.7% of the population. Panama is also home to a small Arab community that has mosques and practices Islam, as well as a Jewish community and many synagogues.\nLanguages.\nSpanish is the official and dominant language. The Spanish spoken in Panama is known as Panamanian Spanish. About 93 percent of the population speak Spanish as their first language. Many citizens who hold jobs at international levels, or at business corporations, speak both English and Spanish. About 14 percent of Panamanians speak English; this number is expected to rise because Panama now requires English classes in its public schools. Native languages, such as Ng\u00e4bere, are spoken throughout the country, mostly in their native territories. Over 400,000 Panamanians keep their native languages and customs. About 4 percent speak French and 1 percent speak Arabic. There was also a French creole spoken in Panama, San Miguel Creole French, which has since gone extinct.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChristianity is the main religion in Panama. An official survey carried out by the government estimated in 2015 that 63.2% of the population, or 2,549,150 people, identifies itself as Roman Catholic, and 25% as evangelical Protestant, or 1,009,740.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith community in Panama is estimated at 2% of the national population, or about 60,000 including about 10% of the Guaym\u00ed population.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses were the next largest congregation comprising the 1.4% of the population, followed by the Adventist Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 0.6%. Smaller groups include the Buddhist, Jewish, Episcopalian, Muslim and Hindu communities. Indigenous religions include Ibeorgun (among Guna) and Mamatata (among Ng\u00e4be). There are also a small number of Rastafarians.\nEducation.\nDuring the 16th century, education in Panama was provided by Jesuits. Public education began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by a paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, \"The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.\" This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.\nIn 2010, it was estimated that 94.1 percent of the population was literate (94.7 percent of males and 93.5 percent of females). Education in Panama is compulsory for all children between ages 6 and 15. In recent decades, school enrollment at all levels, but especially at upper levels, has increased significantly. Panama participates in the PISA exams, but due to debts and unsatisfactory exam results, it postponed participation until 2018.\nCulture.\nThe culture of Panama derives from European music, art and traditions brought by the Spanish to Panama. Hegemonic forces have created hybrid forms blending African and Indigenous Panamanian culture with European culture. For example, the \"tamborito\" is a Spanish dance with African rhythms, themes and dance moves.\nDance is typical of the diverse cultures in Panama. The local folklore can be experienced at a multitude of festivals, through dances and traditions handed down from generation to generation. Local cities host live \"reggae en espa\u00f1ol\", \"reggaeton\", \"haitiano (compas)\", jazz, blues, \"salsa\", reggae, and rock music performances.\nHolidays and festivities.\nThe Christmas parade, known as \"El desfile de Navidad\", is celebrated in the capital, Panama City. This holiday is celebrated on December 25. The floats in the parade are decorated in the Panamanian colors, and women wear dresses called \"pollera\" and men dress in traditional montuno. In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.\nLiterature.\nThe first literature relating to Panama can be dated to 1535, with a modern literary movement appearing from the mid-19th century onwards.\nHandicraft.\nOutside Panama City, regional festivals take place throughout the year featuring local musicians and dancers. Panama's blended culture is reflected in traditional products, such as woodcarvings, ceremonial masks and pottery, as well as in Panama's architecture, cuisine and festivals. In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists.\nAn example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the Guna who are known for \"molas\". \"Mola\" is the Guna word for blouse, but the term \"mola\" has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman's blouse. They are several layers of cloth, varying in color, that are loosely stitched together, made using a reverse appliqu\u00e9 process.\nClothing.\nPanamanian men's traditional clothing, called \"montuno\", consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats.\nThe traditional women's clothing is the \"pollera\". It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (\"De Zarate\" 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women.\nA \"pollera\" is made of \"cambric\" or \"fine linen\" (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material.\nThe original \"pollera\" consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock's tail or a \"mantilla\" fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching pom poms (\"mota\") are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (\"caberstrillos\") hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a choker, and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (\"zaricillos\") are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the \"pollera\". Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (\"tembleques\") worn like a crown. Quality \"pollera\" can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete.\nToday, there are different types of \"polleras\"; the \"pollera de gala\" consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a petticoat. Girls wear \"tembleques\" in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The \"pollera montuna\" is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.\nTraditional clothing in Panama can be worn in parades, where the females and males do a traditional dance. Females gently sway and twirl their skirts, while men hold their hats in their hands and dance behind the females.\nCuisine.\nSince Panama's cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:\na mix of Spanish, Indigenous Panamanian, and African techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.\nThe famous fish market known as the \"Mercado de Mariscos\" offers fresh seafood and Ceviche, a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and Empanada, which is a typical Latin American pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry is the pastelito, with the only difference in comparison to empanadas is that they are bigger.\nTypical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are maize, rice, wheat flour, plantains, \"yuca\" (cassava), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.\nSports.\nIn a 2024 survey, 48% of Panamanians said baseball was their favorite sport, 30% said football (soccer), 4% boxing, chess and tennis.\nBaseball is the most popular sport in Panama. The Panamanian Professional Baseball League is the country's professional winter league. It was first held in 1946, but had multiple interruptions spanning several decades. The Panama national baseball team has earned one silver medal and two bronze medals at the Baseball World Cup. At least 140 Panamanian players have played professional baseball in the United States, more than any other Central American country.\nFootball is the second most popular sport in Panama. The top tier of domestic Panamanian football, Liga Paname\u00f1a de F\u00fatbol, was founded in 1988. The men's national team appeared at the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 2018, appearing in group G, facing Belgium, England and Tunisia. However, the team lost all three games, failing to advance past the group stage.\nClub competition is played in the Liga de F\u00fatbol Femenino. The women's national team debuted in the World Cup in 2023 as the final team to qualify. They joined Group F with Brazil, Jamaica, and France, where they finished last with three losses but scored three goals against France. Marta Cox scored Panama's first ever goal at a World Cup.\nBasketball is also popular in Panama. There are regional teams as well as a squad that competes internationally.\nOther popular sports include volleyball, taekwondo, golf, and tennis. A long-distance hiking trail called the TransPanama Trail is being built from Colombia to Costa Rica. Panama's women's national volleyball team competes in Central America's AFECAVOL (Asociaci\u00f3n de Federaciones CentroAmericanas de Voleibol) zone.\nOther non-traditional sports in the country have had great importance such as the triathlon that has captured the attention of many athletes nationwide and the country has hosted international competitions. Flag football has also been growing in popularity in both men and women and with international participation in world of this discipline being among the best teams in the world, the sport was introduced by Americans residing in the Canal Zone for veterans and retirees who even had a festival called the Turkey Ball. Other popular sports are American football, rugby, field hockey, softball, and other amateur sports, including skateboarding, BMX, and surfing, because the many beaches of Panama such as Santa Catalina and Venao that have hosted events the likes of ISA World Surfing Games.\nProfessional boxers from Panama to be inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame include the first Latin American to be a world boxing champion, Panama Al Brown, as well as ismael Laguna, Roberto Duran, Eusebio Pedroza and Hilario Zapata.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate formula_1 is formula_2. An example with three indeterminates is formula_3.\nPolynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, they are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary word problems to complicated scientific problems; they are used to define polynomial functions, which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science; and they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions. In advanced mathematics, polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings and algebraic varieties, which are central concepts in algebra and algebraic geometry.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"polynomial\" joins two diverse roots: the Greek \"poly\", meaning \"many\", and the Latin \"nomen\", or \"name\". It was derived from the term \"binomial\" by replacing the Latin root \"bi-\" with the Greek \"poly-\". That is, it means a sum of many terms (many monomials). The word \"polynomial\" was first used in the 17th century.\nNotation and terminology.\nThe formula_1 occurring in a polynomial is commonly called a \"variable\" or an \"indeterminate\". When the polynomial is considered as an expression, formula_1 is a fixed symbol which does not have any value (its value is \"indeterminate\"). However, when one considers the function defined by the polynomial, then formula_1 represents the argument of the function, and is therefore called a \"variable\". Many authors use these two words interchangeably.\nA polynomial formula_7 in the indeterminate formula_1 is commonly denoted either as formula_7 or as formula_10. Formally, the name of the polynomial is formula_7, not formula_10, but the use of the functional notation formula_10 dates from a time when the distinction between a polynomial and the associated function was unclear. Moreover, the functional notation is often useful for specifying, in a single phrase, a polynomial and its indeterminate. For example, \"let formula_10 be a polynomial\" is a shorthand for \"let formula_7 be a polynomial in the indeterminate formula_1\". On the other hand, when it is not necessary to emphasize the name of the indeterminate, many formulas are much simpler and easier to read if the name(s) of the indeterminate(s) do not appear at each occurrence of the polynomial.\nThe ambiguity of having two notations for a single mathematical object may be formally resolved by considering the general meaning of the functional notation for polynomials. \nIf formula_17 denotes a number, a variable, another polynomial, or, more generally, any expression, then formula_18 denotes, by convention, the result of substituting formula_17 for formula_1 in formula_7. Thus, the polynomial formula_7 defines the function\nformula_23\nwhich is the \"polynomial function\" associated to formula_7.\nFrequently, when using this notation, one supposes that formula_17 is a number. However, one may use it over any domain where addition and multiplication are defined (that is, any ring). In particular, if formula_17 is a polynomial then formula_18 is also a polynomial.\nMore specifically, when formula_17 is the indeterminate formula_1, then the image of formula_1 by this function is the polynomial formula_7 itself (substituting formula_1 for formula_1 does not change anything). In other words,\nformula_34\nwhich justifies formally the existence of two notations for the same polynomial.\nDefinition.\nA \"polynomial expression\" is an expression that can be built from constants and symbols called \"variables\" or \"indeterminates\" by means of addition, multiplication and exponentiation to a non-negative integer power. The constants are generally numbers, but may be any expression that do not involve the indeterminates, and represent mathematical objects that can be added and multiplied. Two polynomial expressions are considered as defining the same \"polynomial\" if they may be transformed, one to the other, by applying the usual properties of commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example formula_35 and formula_36 are two polynomial expressions that represent the same polynomial; so, one has the equality formula_37.\nA polynomial in a single indeterminate \"x\" can always be written (or rewritten) in the form\nformula_38\nwhere formula_39 are constants that are called the \"coefficients\" of the polynomial, and formula_1 is the indeterminate. The word \"indeterminate\" means that formula_1 represents no particular value, although any value may be substituted for it. The mapping that associates the result of this substitution to the substituted value is a function, called a \"polynomial function\".\nThis can be expressed more concisely by using summation notation:\nformula_42\nThat is, a polynomial can either be zero or can be written as the sum of a finite number of non-zero terms. Each term consists of the product of a number\u00a0\u2013 called the coefficient of the term\u00a0\u2013 and a finite number of indeterminates, raised to non-negative integer powers.\nClassification.\nThe exponent on an indeterminate in a term is called the degree of that indeterminate in that term; the degree of the term is the sum of the degrees of the indeterminates in that term, and the degree of a polynomial is the largest degree of any term with nonzero coefficient. Because formula_43, the degree of an indeterminate without a written exponent is one.\nA term with no indeterminates and a polynomial with no indeterminates are called, respectively, a constant term and a constant polynomial. The degree of a constant term and of a nonzero constant polynomial is formula_44. The degree of the zero polynomial formula_44 (which has no terms at all) is generally treated as not defined (but see below).\nFor example:\nformula_46\nis a term. The coefficient is formula_47, the indeterminates are formula_1 and formula_49, the degree of formula_1 is two, while the degree of formula_49 is one. The degree of the entire term is the sum of the degrees of each indeterminate in it, so in this example the degree is formula_52.\nForming a sum of several terms produces a polynomial. For example, the following is a polynomial:\nformula_53\nIt consists of three terms: the first is degree two, the second is degree one, and the third is degree zero.\nPolynomials of small degree have been given specific names. A polynomial of degree zero is a \"constant polynomial\", or simply a \"constant\". Polynomials of degree one, two or three are respectively \"linear polynomials,\" \"quadratic polynomials\" and \"cubic polynomials\". For higher degrees, the specific names are not commonly used, although \"quartic polynomial\" (for degree four) and \"quintic polynomial\" (for degree five) are sometimes used. The names for the degrees may be applied to the polynomial or to its terms. For example, the term formula_54 in formula_55 is a linear term in a quadratic polynomial.\nThe polynomial formula_44, which may be considered to have no terms at all, is called the zero polynomial. Unlike other constant polynomials, its degree is not zero. Rather, the degree of the zero polynomial is either left explicitly undefined, or defined as negative (either \u22121 or formula_57). The zero polynomial is also unique in that it is the only polynomial in one indeterminate that has an infinite number of roots. The graph of the zero polynomial, formula_58, is the formula_1-axis.\nIn the case of polynomials in more than one indeterminate, a polynomial is called \"homogeneous\" of degree formula_60 if \"all\" of its non-zero terms have degree formula_60. The zero polynomial is homogeneous, and, as a homogeneous polynomial, its degree is undefined. For example, formula_62 is homogeneous of degree formula_63. For more details, see homogeneous polynomials.\nThe commutative law of addition can be used to rearrange terms into any preferred order. In polynomials with one indeterminate, the terms are usually ordered according to degree, either in \"descending powers of formula_1\", with the term of largest degree first, or in \"ascending powers of formula_1\". The polynomial formula_66 is written in descending powers of formula_1. The first term has coefficient formula_68, indeterminate formula_1, and exponent formula_70. In the second term, the coefficient is formula_47. The third term is a constant. Because the \"degree\" of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term, this polynomial has degree two.\nTwo terms with the same indeterminates raised to the same powers are called \"similar terms\" or \"like terms\", and they can be combined, using the distributive law, into a single term whose coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of the terms that were combined. It may happen that this makes the coefficient formula_44. \nPolynomials can be classified by the number of terms with nonzero coefficients, so that a one-term polynomial is called a monomial, a two-term polynomial is called a binomial, and a three-term polynomial is called a trinomial. A polynomial with two or more terms is also called a multinomial.\nA real polynomial is a polynomial with real coefficients. When it is used to define a function, the domain is not so restricted. However, a real polynomial function is a function from the reals to the reals that is defined by a real polynomial. Similarly, an integer polynomial is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and a complex polynomial is a polynomial with complex coefficients.\nA polynomial in one indeterminate is called a univariate polynomial, a polynomial in more than one indeterminate is called a multivariate polynomial. A polynomial with two indeterminates is called a bivariate polynomial. These notions refer more to the kind of polynomials one is generally working with than to individual polynomials; for instance, when working with univariate polynomials, one does not exclude constant polynomials (which may result from the subtraction of non-constant polynomials), although strictly speaking, constant polynomials do not contain any indeterminates at all. It is possible to further classify multivariate polynomials as \"bivariate\", \"trivariate\", and so on, according to the maximum number of indeterminates allowed. Again, so that the set of objects under consideration be closed under subtraction, a study of trivariate polynomials usually allows bivariate polynomials, and so on. It is also common to say simply \"polynomials in formula_73, and formula_74\", listing the indeterminates allowed.\nOperations.\nAddition and subtraction.\nPolynomials can be added using the associative law of addition (grouping all their terms together into a single sum), possibly followed by reordering (using the commutative law) and combining of like terms. For example, if\nformula_75 and formula_76\nthen the sum\nformula_77\ncan be reordered and regrouped as\nformula_78\nand then simplified to\nformula_79\nWhen polynomials are added together, the result is another polynomial.\nSubtraction of polynomials is similar.\nMultiplication.\nPolynomials can also be multiplied. To expand the product of two polynomials into a sum of terms, the distributive law is repeatedly applied, which results in each term of one polynomial being multiplied by every term of the other. For example, if\nformula_80\nthen\nformula_81\nCarrying out the multiplication in each term produces\nformula_82\nCombining similar terms yields\nformula_83\nwhich can be simplified to\nformula_84\nAs in the example, the product of polynomials is always a polynomial.\nComposition.\nGiven a polynomial formula_85 of a single variable and another polynomial formula_86 of any number of variables, the composition formula_87 is obtained by substituting each copy of the variable of the first polynomial by the second polynomial. For example, if formula_88 and formula_89 then\nformula_90\nA composition may be expanded to a sum of terms using the rules for multiplication and division of polynomials. The composition of two polynomials is another polynomial.\nDivision.\nThe division of one polynomial by another is not typically a polynomial. Instead, such ratios are a more general family of objects, called \"rational fractions\", \"rational expressions\", or \"rational functions\", depending on context. This is analogous to the fact that the ratio of two integers is a rational number, not necessarily an integer. For example, the fraction formula_91 is not a polynomial, and it cannot be written as a finite sum of powers of the variable formula_1.\nFor polynomials in one variable, there is a notion of Euclidean division of polynomials, generalizing the Euclidean division of integers. This notion of the division formula_93 results in two polynomials, a \"quotient\" formula_94 and a \"remainder\" formula_95, such that formula_96 and formula_97, where formula_98 is the degree of formula_99. The quotient and remainder may be computed by any of several algorithms, including polynomial long division and synthetic division.\nWhen the denominator formula_100 is monic and linear, that is, formula_101 for some constant formula_102, then the polynomial remainder theorem asserts that the remainder of the division of formula_103 by formula_100 is the evaluation formula_105. In this case, the quotient may be computed by Ruffini's rule, a special case of synthetic division.\nFactoring.\nAll polynomials with coefficients in a unique factorization domain (for example, the integers or a field) also have a factored form in which the polynomial is written as a product of irreducible polynomials and a constant. This factored form is unique up to the order of the factors and their multiplication by an invertible constant. In the case of the field of complex numbers, the irreducible factors are linear. Over the real numbers, they have the degree either one or two. Over the integers and the rational numbers the irreducible factors may have any degree. For example, the factored form offormula_106\nis\nformula_107\nover the integers and the reals, and\nformula_108\nover the complex numbers.\nThe computation of the factored form, called \"factorization\" is, in general, too difficult to be done by hand-written computation. However, efficient polynomial factorization algorithms are available in most computer algebra systems.\nCalculus.\nCalculating derivatives and integrals of polynomials is particularly simple, compared to other kinds of functions.\nThe derivative of the polynomial formula_109 with respect to formula_1 is the polynomial \nformula_111\nSimilarly, the general antiderivative (or indefinite integral) of formula_7 is\nformula_113\nwhere formula_102 is an arbitrary constant. For example, antiderivatives of formula_115 have the form formula_116.\nFor polynomials whose coefficients come from more abstract settings (for example, if the coefficients are integers modulo some prime number formula_99, or elements of an arbitrary ring), the formula for the derivative can still be interpreted formally, with the coefficient formula_118 understood to mean the sum of formula_119 copies of formula_120. For example, over the integers modulo formula_99, the derivative of the polynomial formula_122 is the polynomial formula_123.\nPolynomial functions.\nA \"polynomial function\" is a function that can be defined by evaluating a polynomial. More precisely, a function formula_85 of one argument from a given domain is a polynomial function if there exists a polynomial\nformula_125\nthat evaluates to formula_126 for all x in the domain of formula_85 (here, formula_60 is a non-negative integer and formula_129 are constant coefficients).\nGenerally, unless otherwise specified, polynomial functions have complex coefficients, arguments, and values. In particular, a polynomial, restricted to have real coefficients, defines a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers. If the domain of this function is also restricted to the reals, the resulting function is a real function that maps reals to reals.\nFor example, the function formula_85, defined by\nformula_131\nis a polynomial function of one variable. Polynomial functions of several variables are similarly defined, using polynomials in more than one indeterminate, as in\nformula_132\nAccording to the definition of polynomial functions, there may be expressions that obviously are not polynomials but nevertheless define polynomial functions. An example is the expression formula_133 which takes the same values as the polynomial formula_134 on the interval formula_135, and thus both expressions define the same polynomial function on this interval.\nEvery polynomial function is continuous, smooth, and entire.\nThe evaluation of a polynomial is the computation of the corresponding polynomial function; that is, the evaluation consists of substituting a numerical value to each indeterminate and carrying out the indicated multiplications and additions.\nFor polynomials in one indeterminate, the evaluation is usually more efficient (lower number of arithmetic operations to perform) using Horner's method, which consists of rewriting the polynomial as\nformula_136\nGraphs.\nA polynomial function in one real variable can be represented by a graph.\nA non-constant polynomial function tends to infinity when the variable increases indefinitely (in absolute value). If the degree is higher than one, the graph does not have any asymptote. It has two parabolic branches with vertical direction (one branch for positive \"x\" and one for negative \"x\").\nPolynomial graphs are analyzed in calculus using intercepts, slopes, concavity, and end behavior.\nEquations.\nA \"polynomial equation\", also called an \"algebraic equation\", is an equation of the form\nformula_137\nFor example,\nformula_138is a polynomial equation.\nWhen considering equations, the indeterminates (variables) of polynomials are also called unknowns, and the \"solutions\" are the possible values of the unknowns for which the equality is true (in general more than one solution may exist). A polynomial equation stands in contrast to a \"polynomial identity\" like formula_139, where both expressions represent the same polynomial in different forms, and as a consequence any evaluation of both members gives a valid equality.\nIn elementary algebra, methods such as the quadratic formula are taught for solving all first degree and second degree polynomial equations in one variable. There are also formulas for the cubic and quartic equations. For higher degrees, the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem asserts that there can not exist a general formula in radicals. However, root-finding algorithms may be used to find numerical approximations of the roots of a polynomial expression of any degree.\nThe number of solutions of a polynomial equation with real coefficients may not exceed the degree, and equals the degree when the complex solutions are counted with their multiplicity. This fact is called the fundamental theorem of algebra.\nSolving equations.\nA \"root\" of a nonzero univariate polynomial \"P\" is a value a of x such that \"P\"(\"a\") \n 0. In other words, a root of P is a solution of the polynomial equation \"P\"(\"x\") \n 0 or a zero of the polynomial function defined by \"P\". In the case of the zero polynomial, every number is a zero of the corresponding function, and the concept of root is rarely considered.\nA number \"a\" is a root of a polynomial \"P\" if and only if the linear polynomial \"x\" \u2212 \"a\" divides \"P\", that is if there is another polynomial \"Q\" such that \"P\" = (\"x\" \u2212 \"a\") Q. It may happen that a power (greater than 1) of \"x\" \u2212 \"a\" divides \"P\"; in this case, \"a\" is a \"multiple root\" of \"P\", and otherwise \"a\" is a simple root of \"P\". If \"P\" is a nonzero polynomial, there is a highest power \"m\" such that (\"x\" \u2212 \"a\")\"m\" divides \"P\", which is called the \"multiplicity\" of \"a\" as a root of \"P\". The number of roots of a nonzero polynomial \"P\", counted with their respective multiplicities, cannot exceed the degree of \"P\", and equals this degree if all complex roots are considered (this is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of algebra).\nThe coefficients of a polynomial and its roots are related by Vieta's formulas.\nSome polynomials, such as \"x\"2 + 1, do not have any roots among the real numbers. If, however, the set of accepted solutions is expanded to the complex numbers, every non-constant polynomial has at least one root; this is the fundamental theorem of algebra. By successively dividing out factors \"x\" \u2212 \"a\", one sees that any polynomial with complex coefficients can be written as a constant (its leading coefficient) times a product of such polynomial factors of degree\u00a01; as a consequence, the number of (complex) roots counted with their multiplicities is exactly equal to the degree of the polynomial.\nThere may be several meanings of \"solving an equation\". One may want to express the solutions as explicit numbers; for example, the unique solution of 2\"x\" \u2212 1 = 0 is 1/2. This is, in general, impossible for equations of degree greater than one, and, since the ancient times, mathematicians have searched to express the solutions as algebraic expressions; for example, the golden ratio is the unique positive solution of \"x\"2 \u2212 \"x\" \u2212 1 \n 0 In the ancient times, they succeeded only for degrees one and two. For quadratic equations, the quadratic formula provides such expressions of the solutions. Since the 16th century, similar formulas (using cube roots in addition to square roots), although much more complicated, are known for equations of degree three and four (see cubic equation and quartic equation). But formulas for degree 5 and higher eluded researchers for several centuries. In 1824, Niels Henrik Abel proved the striking result that there are equations of degree 5 whose solutions cannot be expressed by a (finite) formula, involving only arithmetic operations and radicals (see Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem). In 1830, \u00c9variste Galois proved that most equations of degree higher than four cannot be solved by radicals, and showed that for each equation, one may decide whether it is solvable by radicals, and, if it is, solve it. This result marked the start of Galois theory and group theory, two important branches of modern algebra. Galois himself noted that the computations implied by his method were impracticable. Nevertheless, formulas for solvable equations of degrees 5 and 6 have been published (see quintic function and sextic equation).\nWhen there is no algebraic expression for the roots, and when such an algebraic expression exists but is too complicated to be useful, the unique way of solving it is to compute numerical approximations of the solutions. There are many methods for that; some are restricted to polynomials and others may apply to any continuous function. The most efficient algorithms allow solving easily (on a computer) polynomial equations of degree higher than 1,000 (see \"Root-finding algorithm\").\nFor polynomials with more than one indeterminate, the combinations of values for the variables for which the polynomial function takes the value zero are generally called \"zeros\" instead of \"roots\". The study of the sets of zeros of polynomials is the object of algebraic geometry. For a set of polynomial equations with several unknowns, there are algorithms to decide whether they have a finite number of complex solutions, and, if this number is finite, for computing the solutions. See System of polynomial equations.\nThe special case where all the polynomials are of degree one is called a system of linear equations, for which another range of different solution methods exist, including the classical Gaussian elimination.\nA polynomial equation for which one is interested only in the solutions which are integers is called a Diophantine equation. Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general algorithm for solving them, or even for deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see Hilbert's tenth problem). Some of the most famous problems that have been solved during the last fifty years are related to Diophantine equations, such as Fermat's Last Theorem.\nPolynomial expressions.\nPolynomials where indeterminates are substituted for some other mathematical objects are often considered, and sometimes have a special name.\nTrigonometric polynomials.\nA trigonometric polynomial is a finite linear combination of functions sin(\"nx\") and cos(\"nx\") with \"n\" taking on the values of one or more natural numbers. The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions.\nIf sin(\"nx\") and cos(\"nx\") are expanded in terms of sin(\"x\") and cos(\"x\"), a trigonometric polynomial becomes a polynomial in the two variables sin(\"x\") and cos(\"x\") (using the multiple-angle formulae). Conversely, every polynomial in sin(\"x\") and cos(\"x\") may be converted, with Product-to-sum identities, into a linear combination of functions sin(\"nx\") and cos(\"nx\"). This equivalence explains why linear combinations are called polynomials.\nFor complex coefficients, there is no difference between such a function and a finite Fourier series.\nTrigonometric polynomials are widely used, for example in trigonometric interpolation applied to the interpolation of periodic functions. They are also used in the discrete Fourier transform.\nMatrix polynomials.\nA matrix polynomial is a polynomial with square matrices as variables. Given an ordinary, scalar-valued polynomial\nformula_140\nthis polynomial evaluated at a matrix \"A\" is\nformula_141\nwhere \"I\" is the identity matrix.\nA matrix polynomial equation is an equality between two matrix polynomials, which holds for the specific matrices in question. A matrix polynomial identity is a matrix polynomial equation which holds for all matrices \"A\" in a specified matrix ring \"Mn\"(\"R\").\nExponential polynomials.\nA bivariate polynomial where the second variable is substituted for an exponential function applied to the first variable, for example \"P\"(\"x\", \"e\"\"x\"), may be called an exponential polynomial.\nRelated concepts.\nRational functions.\nA rational fraction is the quotient (algebraic fraction) of two polynomials. Any algebraic expression that can be rewritten as a rational fraction is a rational function.\nWhile polynomial functions are defined for all values of the variables, a rational function is defined only for the values of the variables for which the denominator is not zero.\nThe rational fractions include the Laurent polynomials, but do not limit denominators to powers of an indeterminate.\nLaurent polynomials.\nLaurent polynomials are like polynomials, but allow negative powers of the variable(s) to occur.\nPower series.\nFormal power series are like polynomials, but allow infinitely many non-zero terms to occur, so that they do not have finite degree. Unlike polynomials they cannot in general be explicitly and fully written down (just like irrational numbers cannot), but the rules for manipulating their terms are the same as for polynomials. Non-formal power series also generalize polynomials, but the multiplication of two power series may not converge.\nPolynomial ring.\nA \"polynomial\" \"f\" over a commutative ring \"R\" is a polynomial all of whose coefficients belong to \"R\". It is straightforward to verify that the polynomials in a given set of indeterminates over \"R\" form a commutative ring, called the \"polynomial ring\" in these indeterminates, denoted formula_142 in the univariate case and formula_143 in the multivariate case.\nOne has \nformula_144\nSo, most of the theory of the multivariate case can be reduced to an iterated univariate case.\nThe map from \"R\" to \"R\"[\"x\"] sending \"r\" to itself considered as a constant polynomial is an injective ring homomorphism, by which \"R\" is viewed as a subring of \"R\"[\"x\"]. In particular, \"R\"[\"x\"] is an algebra over \"R\".\nOne can think of the ring \"R\"[\"x\"] as arising from \"R\" by adding one new element \"x\" to \"R\", and extending in a minimal way to a ring in which \"x\" satisfies no other relations than the obligatory ones, plus commutation with all elements of \"R\" (that is \"xr\" \n \"rx\"). To do this, one must add all powers of \"x\" and their linear combinations as well.\nFormation of the polynomial ring, together with forming factor rings by factoring out ideals, are important tools for constructing new rings out of known ones. For instance, the ring (in fact field) of complex numbers, which can be constructed from the polynomial ring \"R\"[\"x\"] over the real numbers by factoring out the ideal of multiples of the polynomial \"x\"2 + 1. Another example is the construction of finite fields, which proceeds similarly, starting out with the field of integers modulo some prime number as the coefficient ring \"R\" (see modular arithmetic).\nIf \"R\" is commutative, then one can associate with every polynomial \"P\" in \"R\"[\"x\"] a \"polynomial function\" \"f\" with domain and range equal to \"R\". (More generally, one can take domain and range to be any same unital associative algebra over \"R\".) One obtains the value \"f\"(\"r\") by substitution of the value \"r\" for the symbol \"x\" in \"P\". One reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that, over some rings, different polynomials may give rise to the same polynomial function (see Fermat's little theorem for an example where \"R\" is the integers modulo \"p\"). This is not the case when \"R\" is the real or complex numbers, whence the two concepts are not always distinguished in analysis. An even more important reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that many operations on polynomials (like Euclidean division) require looking at what a polynomial is composed of as an expression rather than evaluating it at some constant value for \"x\".\nDivisibility.\nIf \"R\" is an integral domain and \"f\" and \"g\" are polynomials in \"R\"[\"x\"], it is said that \"f\" \"divides\" \"g\" or \"f\" is a divisor of \"g\" if there exists a polynomial \"q\" in \"R\"[\"x\"] such that \"f\" \"q\" \n \"g\". If formula_145 then a is a root of f if and only formula_146 divides f. In this case, the quotient can be computed using the polynomial long division.\nIf \"F\" is a field and \"f\" and \"g\" are polynomials in \"F\"[\"x\"] with \"g\" \u2260 0, then there exist unique polynomials \"q\" and \"r\" in \"F\"[\"x\"] with\nformula_147and such that the degree of \"r\" is smaller than the degree of \"g\" (using the convention that the polynomial 0 has a negative degree). The polynomials \"q\" and \"r\" are uniquely determined by \"f\" and \"g\". This is called \"Euclidean division, division with remainder\" or \"polynomial long division\" and shows that the ring \"F\"[\"x\"] is a Euclidean domain.\nAnalogously, \"prime polynomials\" (more correctly, \"irreducible polynomials\") can be defined as \"non-zero polynomials which cannot be factorized into the product of two non-constant polynomials\". In the case of coefficients in a ring, \"non-constant\" must be replaced by \"non-constant or non-unit\" (both definitions agree in the case of coefficients in a field). Any polynomial may be decomposed into the product of an invertible constant by a product of irreducible polynomials. If the coefficients belong to a field or a unique factorization domain this decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors and the multiplication of any non-unit factor by a unit (and division of the unit factor by the same unit). When the coefficients belong to integers, rational numbers or a finite field, there are algorithms to test irreducibility and to compute the factorization into irreducible polynomials (see \"Factorization of polynomials\"). These algorithms are not practicable for hand-written computation, but are available in any computer algebra system. Eisenstein's criterion can also be used in some cases to determine irreducibility.\nApplications.\nPositional notation.\nIn modern positional numbers systems, such as the decimal system, the digits and their positions in the representation of an integer, for example, 45, are a shorthand notation for a polynomial in the radix or base, in this case, 4 \u00d7 101 + 5 \u00d7 100. As another example, in radix 5, a string of digits such as 132 denotes the (decimal) number 1 \u00d7 52 + 3 \u00d7 51 + 2 \u00d7 50 = 42. This representation is unique. Let \"b\" be a positive integer greater than 1. Then every positive integer \"a\" can be expressed uniquely in the form\nformula_148\nwhere \"m\" is a nonnegative integer and the \"r\"'s are integers such that\n0 &lt; \"r\"\"m\" &lt; \"b\" and 0 \u2264 \"r\"\"i\" &lt; \"b\" for \"i\" = 0, 1, . . . , \"m\" \u2212 1.\nInterpolation and approximation.\nThe simple structure of polynomial functions makes them quite useful in analyzing general functions using polynomial approximations. An important example in calculus is Taylor's theorem, which roughly states that every differentiable function locally looks like a polynomial function, and the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, which states that every continuous function defined on a compact interval of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial function. Practical methods of approximation include polynomial interpolation and the use of splines.\nOther applications.\nPolynomials are frequently used to encode information about some other object. The characteristic polynomial of a matrix or linear operator contains information about the operator's eigenvalues. The minimal polynomial of an algebraic element records the simplest algebraic relation satisfied by that element. The chromatic polynomial of a graph counts the number of proper colourings of that graph.\nThe term \"polynomial\", as an adjective, can also be used for quantities or functions that can be written in polynomial form. For example, in computational complexity theory the phrase \"polynomial time\" means that the time it takes to complete an algorithm is bounded by a polynomial function of some variable, such as the size of the input.\nHistory.\nDetermining the roots of polynomials, or \"solving algebraic equations\", is among the oldest problems in mathematics. However, the elegant and practical notation we use today only developed beginning in the 15th century. Before that, equations were written out in words. For example, an algebra problem from the Chinese Arithmetic in Nine Sections, c.\u2009200\u00a0BCE, begins \"Three sheafs of good crop, two sheafs of mediocre crop, and one sheaf of bad crop are sold for 29 dou.\" We would write 3\"x\" + 2\"y\" + \"z\" \n 29.\nHistory of the notation.\nThe earliest known use of the equal sign is in Robert Recorde's \"The Whetstone of Witte\", 1557. The signs + for addition, \u2212 for subtraction, and the use of a letter for an unknown appear in Michael Stifel's \"Arithemetica integra\", 1544. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, in \"La g\u00e9ometrie\", 1637, introduced the concept of the graph of a polynomial equation. He popularized the use of letters from the beginning of the alphabet to denote constants and letters from the end of the alphabet to denote variables, as can be seen above, in the general formula for a polynomial in one variable, where the \"a\"s denote constants and \"x\" denotes a variable. Descartes introduced the use of superscripts to denote exponents as well.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23001", "revid": "203434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23001", "title": "Polymer", "text": "Substance composed of macromolecules with repeating structural units\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n IUPAC definition\n A polymer is a substance composed of macromolecules. A macromolecule is a molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises the multiple repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass.\nA polymer () is a substance or material that consists of very large molecules, or macromolecules, that are constituted by many repeating subunits derived from one or more species of monomers. Due to their broad spectrum of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass, relative to small molecule compounds, produces unique physical properties including toughness, high elasticity, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form amorphous and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals.\nPolymers are studied in the fields of polymer science (which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics), biophysics and materials science and engineering. Historically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science. An emerging important area now focuses on supramolecular polymers formed by non-covalent links. Polyisoprene of latex rubber is an example of a natural polymer, and the polystyrene of styrofoam is an example of a synthetic polymer. In biological contexts, essentially all biological macromolecules\u2014i.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharides\u2014are purely polymeric, or are composed in large part of polymeric components.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"polymer\" derives from el \" \"\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2\" (polus)\"\u00a0'many, much' and \" \"\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (meros)\"\u00a0'part'. The term was coined in 1833 by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius, though with a definition distinct from the modern IUPAC definition. The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger, who spent the next decade finding experimental evidence for this hypothesis.\nCommon examples.\nPolymers are of two types: naturally occurring and synthetic or \"man made\".\nNatural.\nNatural polymeric materials such as hemp, shellac, amber, wool, silk, and natural rubber have been used for centuries. A variety of other natural polymers exist, such as cellulose, which is the main constituent of wood and paper.\nSpace polymer.\nHemoglycin (previously termed hemolithin) is a space polymer that is the first polymer of amino acids found in meteorites.\nSynthetic.\nThe list of synthetic polymers, roughly in order of worldwide demand, includes polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, synthetic rubber, phenol formaldehyde resin (or Bakelite), neoprene, nylon, polyacrylonitrile, PVB, silicone, and many more. More than 330 million tons of these polymers are made every year (2015).\nMost commonly, the continuously linked backbone of a polymer used for the preparation of plastics consists mainly of carbon atoms. A simple example is polyethylene ('polythene' in British English), whose repeat unit or monomer is ethylene. Many other structures do exist; for example, elements such as silicon form familiar materials such as silicones, examples being Silly Putty and waterproof plumbing sealant. Oxygen is also commonly present in polymer backbones, such as those of polyethylene glycol, polysaccharides (in glycosidic bonds), and DNA (in phosphodiester bonds).\nSynthesis.\nPolymerization is the process of combining many small molecules known as monomers into a covalently bonded chain or network. During the polymerization process, some chemical groups may be lost from each monomer. This happens in the polymerization of PET polyester. The monomers are terephthalic acid (HOOC\u2014C6H4\u2014COOH) and ethylene glycol (HO\u2014CH2\u2014CH2\u2014OH) but the repeating unit is \u2014OC\u2014C6H4\u2014COO\u2014CH2\u2014CH2\u2014O\u2014, which corresponds to the combination of the two monomers with the loss of two water molecules. The distinct piece of each monomer that is incorporated into the polymer is known as a repeat unit or monomer residue.\nSynthetic methods are generally divided into two categories, step-growth polymerization and chain polymerization. The essential difference between the two is that in chain polymerization, monomers are added to the chain one at a time only, such as in polystyrene, whereas in step-growth polymerization chains of monomers may combine with one another directly, such as in polyester. Step-growth polymerization can be divided into polycondensation, in which low-molar-mass by-product is formed in every reaction step, and polyaddition.\nNewer methods, such as plasma polymerization do not fit neatly into either category. Synthetic polymerization reactions may be carried out with or without a catalyst. Laboratory synthesis of biopolymers, especially of proteins, is an area of intensive research.\nBiological synthesis.\nThere are three main classes of biopolymers: polysaccharides, polypeptides, and polynucleotides.\nIn living cells, they may be synthesized by enzyme-mediated processes, such as the formation of DNA catalyzed by DNA polymerase. The synthesis of proteins involves multiple enzyme-mediated processes to transcribe genetic information from the DNA to RNA and subsequently translate that information to synthesize the specified protein from amino acids. The protein may be modified further following translation in order to provide appropriate structure and functioning. There are other biopolymers such as rubber, suberin, melanin, and lignin.\nModification of natural polymers.\nNaturally occurring polymers such as cotton, starch, and rubber were familiar materials for years before synthetic polymers such as polyethene and perspex appeared on the market. Many commercially important polymers are synthesized by chemical modification of naturally occurring polymers. Prominent examples include the reaction of nitric acid and cellulose to form nitrocellulose and the formation of vulcanized rubber by heating natural rubber in the presence of sulfur. Ways in which polymers can be modified include oxidation, cross-linking, and end-capping.\nStructure.\nThe structure of a polymeric material can be described at different length scales, from the sub-nm length scale up to the macroscopic one. There is in fact a hierarchy of structures, in which each stage provides the foundations for the next one.\nThe starting point for the description of the structure of a polymer is the identity of its constituent monomers. Next, the microstructure essentially describes the arrangement of these monomers within the polymer at the scale of a single chain. The microstructure determines the possibility for the polymer to form phases with different arrangements, for example through crystallization, the glass transition or microphase separation.\nThese features play a major role in determining the physical and chemical properties of a polymer.\nMonomers and repeat units.\nThe identity of the repeat units (monomer residues, also known as \"mers\") comprising a polymer is its first and most important attribute. Polymer nomenclature is generally based upon the type of monomer residues comprising the polymer. A polymer which contains only a single type of repeat unit is known as a homopolymer, while a polymer containing two or more types of repeat units is known as a copolymer. A terpolymer is a copolymer which contains three types of repeat units.\nPolystyrene is composed only of styrene-based repeat units, and is classified as a homopolymer. Polyethylene terephthalate, even though produced from two different monomers (ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid), is usually regarded as a homopolymer because only one type of repeat unit is formed. Ethylene-vinyl acetate contains more than one variety of repeat unit and is a copolymer. Some biological polymers are composed of a variety of different but structurally related monomer residues; for example, polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of four types of nucleotide subunits.\nA polymer containing ionizable subunits (e.g., pendant carboxylic groups) is known as a polyelectrolyte or ionomer, when the fraction of ionizable units is large or small respectively.\nMicrostructure.\nThe microstructure of a polymer (sometimes called configuration) relates to the physical arrangement of monomer residues along the backbone of the chain. These are the elements of polymer structure that require the breaking of a covalent bond in order to change. Various polymer structures can be produced depending on the monomers and reaction conditions: A polymer may consist of linear macromolecules containing each only one unbranched chain. In the case of unbranched polyethylene, this chain is a long-chain \"n\"-alkane. There are also branched macromolecules with a main chain and side chains, in the case of polyethylene the side chains would be alkyl groups. In particular unbranched macromolecules can be in the solid state semi-crystalline, crystalline chain sections highlighted red in the figure below.\nWhile branched and unbranched polymers are usually thermoplastics, many elastomers have a wide-meshed cross-linking between the \"main chains\". Close-meshed crosslinking, on the other hand, leads to thermosets. Cross-links and branches are shown as red dots in the figures. Highly branched polymers are amorphous and the molecules in the solid interact randomly.\nPolymer architecture.\nAn important microstructural feature of a polymer is its architecture and shape, which relates to the way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain with one or more substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, polymer brushes, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers (2DP) which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass-transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example living polymerization.\nChain length.\nA common means of expressing the length of a chain is the degree of polymerization, which quantifies the number of monomers incorporated into the chain. As with other molecules, a polymer's size may also be expressed in terms of molecular weight. Since synthetic polymerization techniques typically yield a statistical distribution of chain lengths, the molecular weight is expressed in terms of weighted averages. The number-average molecular weight (\"M\"n) and weight-average molecular weight (\"M\"w) are most commonly reported. The ratio of these two values (\"M\"w / \"M\"n) is the dispersity (\"\u0110\"), which is commonly used to express the width of the molecular weight distribution.\nThe physical properties of polymer strongly depend on the length (or equivalently, the molecular weight) of the polymer chain. One important example of the physical consequences of the molecular weight is the scaling of the viscosity (resistance to flow) in the melt. The influence of the weight-average molecular weight (formula_1) on the melt viscosity (formula_2) depends on whether the polymer is above or below the onset of entanglements. Below the entanglement molecular weight, formula_3, whereas above the entanglement molecular weight, formula_4. In the latter case, increasing the polymer chain length 10-fold would increase the viscosity over 1000 times. Increasing chain length furthermore tends to decrease chain mobility, increase strength and toughness, and increase the glass-transition temperature (Tg). This is a result of the increase in chain interactions such as van der Waals attractions and entanglements that come with increased chain length. These interactions tend to fix the individual chains more strongly in position and resist deformations and matrix breakup, both at higher stresses and higher temperatures.\nMonomer arrangement in copolymers.\nCopolymers are classified either as statistical copolymers, alternating copolymers, block copolymers, graft copolymers or gradient copolymers. In the schematic figure below, \u24b6 and \u24b7 symbolize the two repeat units.\nMonomers within a copolymer may be organized along the backbone in a variety of ways. A copolymer containing a controlled arrangement of monomers is called a sequence-controlled polymer. Alternating, periodic and block copolymers are simple examples of sequence-controlled polymers.\nTacticity.\nTacticity describes the relative stereochemistry of chiral centers in neighboring structural units within a macromolecule. There are three types of tacticity: isotactic (all substituents on the same side), atactic (random placement of substituents), and syndiotactic (alternating placement of substituents).\nMorphology.\nPolymer morphology generally describes the arrangement and microscale ordering of polymer chains in space. The macroscopic physical properties of a polymer are related to the interactions between the polymer chains.\nThe type and arrangement of (functional) residues of the repeat units effects or determines the crystallinity and strength of the secondary valence bonds. In isotactic polypropylene, the molecules form a helix. Like the zigzag conformation, such helices allow a dense chain packing. Particularly strong intermolecular interactions occur when the residues of the repeating units allow the formation of hydrogen bonds, as in the case of \"p\"-aramid. The formation of strong intramolecular associations may produce diverse folded states of single linear chains with distinct circuit topology. Crystallinity and superstructure are always dependent on the conditions of their formation, see also: crystallization of polymers. Compared to amorphous structures, semi-crystalline structures lead to a higher stiffness, density, melting temperature and higher resistance of a polymer.\nCrystallinity.\nWhen applied to polymers, the term \"crystalline\" has a somewhat ambiguous usage. In some cases, the term \"crystalline\" finds identical usage to that used in conventional crystallography. For example, the structure of a crystalline protein or polynucleotide, such as a sample prepared for x-ray crystallography, may be defined in terms of a conventional unit cell composed of one or more polymer molecules with cell dimensions of hundreds of angstroms or more. A synthetic polymer may be loosely described as crystalline if it contains regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic (rather than macromolecular) length scales, usually arising from intramolecular folding or stacking of adjacent chains. Synthetic polymers may consist of both crystalline and amorphous regions; the degree of crystallinity may be expressed in terms of a weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material. Few synthetic polymers are entirely crystalline. The crystallinity of polymers is characterized by their degree of crystallinity, ranging from zero for a completely non-crystalline polymer to one for a theoretical completely crystalline polymer. Polymers with microcrystalline regions are generally tougher (can be bent more without breaking) and more impact-resistant than totally amorphous polymers. Polymers with a degree of crystallinity approaching zero or one will tend to be transparent, while polymers with intermediate degrees of crystallinity will tend to be opaque due to light scattering by crystalline or glassy regions. For many polymers, crystallinity may also be associated with decreased transparency.\nChain conformation.\nThe space occupied by a polymer molecule is generally expressed in terms of radius of gyration, which is an average distance from the center of mass of the chain to the chain itself. Alternatively, it may be expressed in terms of pervaded volume, which is the volume spanned by the polymer chain and scales with the cube of the radius of gyration. \nThe simplest theoretical models for polymers in the molten, amorphous state are ideal chains.\nProperties.\nPolymer properties depend of their structure and they are divided into classes according to their physical bases. Many physical and chemical properties describe how a polymer behaves as a continuous macroscopic material. They are classified as bulk properties, or intensive properties according to thermodynamics.\nMechanical properties.\nThe bulk properties of a polymer are those most often of end-use interest. These are the properties that dictate how the polymer actually behaves on a macroscopic scale.\nTensile strength.\nThe tensile strength of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the material will endure before failure. This is very important in applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For example, a rubber band with a higher tensile strength will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, tensile strength increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.\nYoung's modulus of elasticity.\nYoung's modulus quantifies the elasticity of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as the ratio of rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus is strongly dependent on temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the stress-strain curve when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.\nTransport properties.\nTransport properties such as diffusivity describe how rapidly molecules move through the polymer matrix. These are very important in many applications of polymers for films and membranes.\nThe movement of individual macromolecules occurs by a process called reptation in which each chain molecule is constrained by entanglements with neighboring chains to move within a virtual tube. The theory of reptation can explain polymer molecule dynamics and viscoelasticity.\nPhase behavior.\nCrystallization and melting.\nDepending on their chemical structures, polymers may be either semi-crystalline or amorphous. Semi-crystalline polymers can undergo crystallization and melting transitions, whereas amorphous polymers do not. In polymers, crystallization and melting do not suggest solid-liquid phase transitions, as in the case of water or other molecular fluids. Instead, crystallization and melting refer to the phase transitions between two solid states (\"i.e.\", semi-crystalline and amorphous). Crystallization occurs above the glass-transition temperature (\"T\"g) and below the melting temperature (\"T\"m).\nGlass transition.\nAll polymers (amorphous or semi-crystalline) go through glass transitions. The glass-transition temperature (\"T\"g) is a crucial physical parameter for polymer manufacturing, processing, and use. Below \"T\"g, molecular motions are frozen and polymers are brittle and glassy. Above \"T\"g, molecular motions are activated and polymers are rubbery and viscous. The glass-transition temperature may be engineered by altering the degree of branching or crosslinking in the polymer or by the addition of plasticizers.\nWhereas crystallization and melting are first-order phase transitions, the glass transition is not. The glass transition shares features of second-order phase transitions (such as discontinuity in the heat capacity, as shown in the figure), but it is generally not considered a thermodynamic transition between equilibrium states.\nMixing behavior.\nIn general, polymeric mixtures are far less miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials. This effect results from the fact that the driving force for mixing is usually entropy, not interaction energy. In other words, miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles (or moles) being mixed. Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The energetics of mixing, on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thereby making solvation less favorable, and thereby making the availability of concentrated solutions of polymers far rarer than those of small molecules.\nFurthermore, the phase behavior of polymer solutions and mixtures is more complex than that of small molecule mixtures. Whereas most small molecule solutions exhibit only an upper critical solution temperature phase transition (UCST), at which phase separation occurs with cooling, polymer mixtures commonly exhibit a lower critical solution temperature phase transition (LCST), at which phase separation occurs with heating.\nIn dilute solutions, the properties of the polymer are characterized by the interaction between the solvent and the polymer. In a good solvent, the polymer appears swollen and occupies a large volume. In this scenario, intermolecular forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular interactions. In a bad solvent or poor solvent, intramolecular forces dominate and the chain contracts. In the theta solvent, or the state of the polymer solution where the value of the second virial coefficient becomes 0, the intermolecular polymer-solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular monomer-monomer attraction. Under the theta condition (also called the Flory condition), the polymer behaves like an ideal random coil. The transition between the states is known as a coil\u2013globule transition.\nInclusion of plasticizers.\nInclusion of plasticizers tends to lower Tg and increase polymer flexibility. Addition of the plasticizer will also modify dependence of the glass-transition temperature Tg on the cooling rate. The mobility of the chain can further change if the molecules of plasticizer give rise to hydrogen bonding formation. Plasticizers are generally small molecules that are chemically similar to the polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and fewer interchain interactions. A good example of the action of plasticizers is related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. A uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no plasticizers in it, because it needs to remain strong and heat-resistant. Plasticized PVC is used in clothing for a flexible quality. Plasticizers are also put in some types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.\nChemical properties.\nThe attractive forces between polymer chains play a large part in determining the polymer's properties. Because polymer chains are so long, they have many such interchain interactions per molecule, amplifying the effect of these interactions on the polymer properties in comparison to attractions between conventional molecules. Different side groups on the polymer can lend the polymer to ionic bonding or hydrogen bonding between its own chains. These stronger forces typically result in higher tensile strength and higher crystalline melting points.\nThe intermolecular forces in polymers can be affected by dipoles in the monomer units. Polymers containing amide or carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds between adjacent chains; the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms in N-H groups of one chain are strongly attracted to the partially negatively charged oxygen atoms in C=O groups on another. These strong hydrogen bonds, for example, result in the high tensile strength and melting point of polymers containing urethane or urea linkages. Polyesters have dipole-dipole bonding between the oxygen atoms in C=O groups and the hydrogen atoms in H-C groups. Dipole bonding is not as strong as hydrogen bonding, so a polyester's melting point and strength are lower than Kevlar's (Twaron), but polyesters have greater flexibility. Polymers with non-polar units such as polyethylene interact only through weak Van der Waals forces. As a result, they typically have lower melting temperatures than other polymers.\nWhen a polymer is dispersed or dissolved in a liquid, such as in commercial products like paints and glues, the chemical properties and molecular interactions influence how the solution flows and can even lead to self-assembly of the polymer into complex structures. When a polymer is applied as a coating, the chemical properties will influence the adhesion of the coating and how it interacts with external materials, such as superhydrophobic polymer coatings leading to water resistance. Overall the chemical properties of a polymer are important elements for designing new polymeric material products.\nOptical properties.\nPolymers such as PMMA and HEMA:MMA are used as matrices in the gain medium of solid-state dye lasers, also known as solid-state dye-doped polymer lasers. These polymers have a high surface quality and are also highly transparent so that the laser properties are dominated by the laser dye used to dope the polymer matrix. These types of lasers, that also belong to the class of organic lasers, are known to yield very narrow linewidths which is useful for spectroscopy and analytical applications. An important optical parameter in the polymer used in laser applications is the change in refractive index with temperature\nalso known as dn/dT. For the polymers mentioned here the (dn/dT) ~ \u22121.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 in units of K\u22121 in the 297 \u2264 T \u2264 337 K range.\nElectrical properties.\nMost conventional polymers such as polyethylene are electrical insulators, but the development of polymers containing \u03c0-conjugated bonds has led to a wealth of polymer-based semiconductors, such as polythiophenes. This has led to many applications in the field of organic electronics.\nApplications.\nNowadays, synthetic polymers are used in almost all walks of life. Modern society would look very different without them. The spreading of polymer use is connected to their unique properties: low density, low cost, good thermal/electrical insulation properties, high resistance to corrosion, low-energy demanding polymer manufacture and facile processing into final products. For a given application, the properties of a polymer can be tuned or enhanced by combination with other materials, as in composites. Their application allows to save energy (lighter cars and planes, thermally insulated buildings), protect food and drinking water (packaging), save land and lower use of fertilizers (synthetic fibres), preserve other materials (coatings), protect and save lives (hygiene, medical applications). A representative, non-exhaustive list of applications is given below.\nStandardized nomenclature.\nThere are multiple conventions for naming polymer substances. Many commonly used polymers, such as those found in consumer products, are referred to by a common or trivial name. The trivial name is assigned based on historical precedent or popular usage rather than a standardized naming convention. Both the American Chemical Society (ACS) and IUPAC have proposed standardized naming conventions; the ACS and IUPAC conventions are similar but not identical. Examples of the differences between the various naming conventions are given in the table below:\nIn both standardized conventions, the polymers' names are intended to reflect the monomer(s) from which they are synthesized (source based nomenclature) rather than the precise nature of the repeating subunit. For example, the polymer synthesized from the simple alkene ethene is called polyethene, retaining the \"-ene\" suffix even though the double bond is removed during the polymerization process:\nHowever, IUPAC structure based nomenclature is based on naming of the preferred constitutional repeating unit.\nIUPAC has also issued guidelines for abbreviating new polymer names. 138 common polymer abbreviations are also standardized in the standard ISO 1043\u20131.\nCharacterization.\nPolymer characterization spans many techniques for determining the chemical composition, molecular weight distribution, and physical properties. Select common techniques include the following:\nDegradation.\nPolymer degradation is a change in the properties\u2014tensile strength, color, shape, or molecular weight\u2014of a polymer or polymer-based product under the influence of one or more environmental factors, such as heat, light, and the presence of certain chemicals, oxygen, and enzymes. This change in properties is often the result of bond breaking in the polymer backbone (chain scission) which may occur at the chain ends or at random positions in the chain.\nAlthough such changes are frequently undesirable, in some cases, such as biodegradation and recycling, they may be intended to prevent environmental pollution. Degradation can also be useful in biomedical settings. For example, a copolymer of polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid is employed in hydrolysable stitches that slowly degrade after they are applied to a wound.\nThe susceptibility of a polymer to degradation depends on its structure. Epoxies and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially susceptible to UV degradation while polyesters are susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis. Polymers containing an unsaturated backbone degrade via ozone cracking. Carbon based polymers are more susceptible to thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane and are therefore not ideal for most high-temperature applications.\nThe degradation of polyethylene occurs by random scission\u2014a random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer together. When heated above 450\u00a0\u00b0C, polyethylene degrades to form a mixture of hydrocarbons. In the case of chain-end scission, monomers are released and this process is referred to as unzipping or depolymerization. Which mechanism dominates will depend on the type of polymer and temperature; in general, polymers with no or a single small substituent in the repeat unit will decompose via random-chain scission.\nThe sorting of polymer waste for recycling purposes may be facilitated by the use of the resin identification codes developed by the Society of the Plastics Industry to identify the type of plastic.\nProduct failure.\nFailure of safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire in the case of cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines. Chlorine-induced cracking of acetal resin plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties, especially in the US in the 1990s. Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked polymers present in the plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded. Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting where there is stress concentration.\nPolymer oxidation has caused accidents involving medical devices. One of the oldest known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.\nNylon 66 is susceptible to acid hydrolysis, and in one accident, a fractured fuel line led to a spillage of diesel into the road. If diesel fuel leaks onto the road, accidents to following cars can be caused by the slippery nature of the deposit, which is like black ice. Furthermore, the asphalt concrete road surface will suffer damage as a result of the diesel fuel dissolving the asphaltenes from the composite material, this resulting in the degradation of the asphalt surface and structural integrity of the road.\nHistory.\nPolymers have been essential components of commodities since the early days of humankind. The use of wool (keratin), cotton and linen fibres (cellulose) for garments, paper reed (cellulose) for paper are just a few examples of how ancient societies exploited polymer-containing raw materials to obtain artefacts. The latex sap of \"caoutchouc\" trees (natural rubber) reached Europe in the 16th century from South America long after the Olmec, Maya and Aztec had started using it as a material to make balls, waterproof textiles and containers.\nThe chemical manipulation of polymers dates back to the 19th century, although at the time the nature of these species was not understood. The behaviour of polymers was initially rationalised according to the theory proposed by Thomas Graham which considered them as colloidal aggregates of small molecules held together by unknown forces.\nNotwithstanding the lack of theoretical knowledge, the potential of polymers to provide innovative, accessible and cheap materials was immediately grasped. The work carried out by Braconnot, Parkes, Ludersdorf, Hayward and many others on the modification of natural polymers determined many significant advances in the field. Their contributions led to the discovery of materials such as celluloid, galalith, parkesine, rayon, vulcanised rubber and, later, Bakelite: all materials that quickly entered industrial manufacturing processes and reached households as garments components (\"e.g.\", fabrics, buttons), crockery and decorative items.\nIn 1920, Hermann Staudinger published his seminal work \"\u00dcber Polymerisation\", in which he proposed that polymers were in fact long chains of atoms linked by covalent bonds. His work was debated at length, but eventually it was accepted by the scientific community. Because of this work, Staudinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953.\nAfter the 1930s polymers entered a golden age during which new types were discovered and quickly given commercial applications, replacing naturally-sourced materials. This development was fuelled by an industrial sector with a strong economic drive and it was supported by a broad academic community that contributed innovative syntheses of monomers from cheaper raw material, more efficient polymerisation processes, improved techniques for polymer characterisation and advanced, theoretical understanding of polymers.\nSince 1953, six Nobel prizes have been awarded in the area of polymer science, excluding those for research on biological macromolecules. This further testifies to its impact on modern science and technology. As Lord Todd summarised in 1980, \"I am inclined to think that the development of polymerization is perhaps the biggest thing that chemistry has done, where it has had the biggest effect on everyday life\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23002", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23002", "title": "Perfect competition", "text": "Market structure in which firms are price takers for a homogeneous product\nIn economics, specifically general equilibrium theory, a perfect market, also known as an atomistic market, is defined by several idealizing conditions, collectively called perfect competition, or atomistic competition. In theoretical models where conditions of perfect competition hold, it has been demonstrated that a market will reach an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied for every product or service, including labor, equals the quantity demanded at the current price. This equilibrium would be a Pareto optimum.\nPerfect competition provides both allocative efficiency and productive efficiency:\nThe theory of perfect competition has its roots in late-19th century economic thought. L\u00e9on Walras gave the first rigorous definition of perfect competition and derived some of its main results. In the 1950s, the theory was further formalized by Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu.\nImperfect competition was a theory created to explain the more realistic kind of market interaction that lies in between perfect competition and a monopoly. Edward Chamberlin wrote \"Monopolistic Competition\" in 1933 as \"a challenge to the traditional viewpoint that competition and monopolies are alternatives and that individual prices are to be explained in either terms of one or the other\" (Dewey,88.) In this book, and for much of his career, he \"analyzed firms that do not produce identical goods, but goods that are close substitutes for one another\" (Sandmo,300.)\nAnother key player in understanding imperfect competition is Joan Robinson, who published her book \"The Economics of Imperfect Competition\" the same year Chamberlain published his. While Chamberlain focused much of his work on product development, Robinson focused heavily on price formation and discrimination (Sandmo,303.) The act of price discrimination under imperfect competition implies that the seller would sell their goods at different prices depending on the characteristic of the buyer to increase revenue (Robinson,204.) Joan Robinson and Edward Chamberlain came to many of the same conclusions regarding imperfect competition while still adding a bit of their twist to the theory. Despite their similarities or disagreements about who discovered the idea, both were extremely helpful in allowing firms to understand better how to center their goods around the wants of the consumer to achieve the highest amount of revenue possible.\nReal markets are never perfect. Those economists who believe in perfect competition as a useful approximation to real markets may classify those as ranging from close-to-perfect to very imperfect. The real estate market is an example of a very imperfect market. In such markets, the theory of the second best proves that if one optimality condition in an economic model cannot be satisfied, it is possible that the next-best solution involves changing other variables away from the values that would otherwise be optimal.\nIn modern conditions, the theory of perfect competition has been modified from a quantitative assessment of competitors to a more natural atomic balance (equilibrium) in the market. There may be many competitors in the market, but if there is hidden collusion between them, the competition will not be maximally perfect. But if the principle of atomic balance operates in the market, then even between two equal forces perfect competition may arise. If we try to artificially increase the number of competitors and to reduce honest local big business to small size, we will open the way for unscrupulous monopolies from outside.\nIdealizing conditions of perfect competition.\nThe definition of perfect competition is when the following conditions all hold:\nWhile no real market is perfect, many markets are considered to be near enough to perfect for predictions from economic theory to be reasonably accurate. It has been proven that if the above conditions hold, that every participant will be a price taker and will not have market power to set prices, and all sellers will operate such that their marginal costs equal their marginal revenue.\nThere are many instances in which there exist \"similar\" products that are close substitutes (such as butter and margarine), which are relatively easily interchangeable, so that a rise in the price of one good will cause a significant shift to the consumption of the close substitute. If the cost of changing a firm's manufacturing process to produce the substitute is also relatively \"immaterial\" in relationship to the firm's overall profit and cost, this is sufficient to ensure that an economic situation isn't significantly different from a perfectly competitive economic market.\nNormal profit.\nIn a perfect market the sellers operate at zero economic surplus: sellers make a level of return on investment known as normal profits.\n\"Normal\" profit is a component of (implicit) costs and not a component of business profit at all. It represents all the opportunity cost, as the time that the owner spends running the firm could be spent on running a different firm. The enterprise component of normal profit is thus the profit that a business owner considers necessary to make running the business worth while: that is, it is comparable to the next best amount the entrepreneur could earn doing another job. Particularly if enterprise is not included as a factor of production, it can also be viewed a return to capital for investors including the entrepreneur, equivalent to the return the capital owner could have expected (in a safe investment), plus compensation for risk. In other words, the cost of normal profit varies both within and across industries; it is commensurate with the riskiness associated with each type of investment, as per the risk\u2013return spectrum.\nIn circumstances of perfect competition, only normal profits arise when the long run economic equilibrium is reached; there is no incentive for firms to either enter or leave the industry.\nIn competitive and contestable markets.\nEconomic profit does not occur in perfect competition in long run equilibrium; if it did, there would be an incentive for new firms to enter the industry, aided by a lack of barriers to entry until there was no longer any economic profit. As new firms enter the industry, they increase the supply of the product available in the market, and these new firms are forced to charge a lower price to entice consumers to buy the additional supply these new firms are supplying as the firms all compete for customers (See \"Persistence\" in the \"Monopoly Profit\" discussion). Incumbent firms within the industry face losing their existing customers to the new firms entering the industry, and are therefore forced to lower their prices to match the lower prices set by the new firms. New firms will continue to enter the industry until the price of the product is lowered to the point that it is the same as the average cost of producing the product, and all of the economic profit disappears. When this happens, economic agents outside of the industry find no advantage to forming new firms that enter into the industry, the supply of the product stops increasing, and the price charged for the product stabilizes, settling into an equilibrium.\nThe same is likewise true of the long run equilibria of monopolistically competitive industries and, more generally, any market which is held to be contestable. Normally, a firm that introduces a differentiated product can initially secure a \"temporary\" market power for a \"short while\" (See \"Persistence\" in \"Monopoly Profit\"). At this stage, the initial price the consumer must pay for the product is high, and the demand for, as well as the availability of the product in the market, will be limited. In the long run, however, when the profitability of the product is well established, and because there are few barriers to entry, the number of firms that produce this product will increase until the available supply of the product eventually becomes relatively large, the price of the product shrinks down to the level of the average cost of producing the product. When this finally occurs, all monopoly profit associated with producing and selling the product disappears, and the initial monopoly turns into a competitive industry. In the case of contestable markets, the cycle is often ended with the departure of the former \"hit and run\" entrants to the market, returning the industry to its previous state, just with a lower price and no economic profit for the incumbent firms.\nProfit can, however, occur in competitive and contestable markets in the short run, as firms jostle for market position. Once risk is accounted for, long-lasting economic profit in a competitive market is thus viewed as the result of constant cost-cutting and performance improvement ahead of industry competitors, allowing costs to be below the market-set price.\nIn non-competitive markets.\nEconomic profit is, however, much more prevalent in uncompetitive markets such as in a perfect monopoly or oligopoly situation. In these scenarios, individual firms have some element of market power: Though monopolists are constrained by consumer demand, they are not price takers, but instead either price-setters or quantity setters. This allows the firm to set a price that is higher than that which would be found in a similar but more competitive industry, allowing them economic profit in both the long and short run.\nThe existence of economic profits in the long run depends on the prevalence of barriers to entry: these stop other firms from entering into the industry and sapping away profits, as they would in a more competitive market. In cases where barriers are present, but more than one firm, firms can collude to limit production, thereby restricting supply in order to ensure that the price of the product remains high enough for all firms in the industry to achieve an economic profit.\nHowever, some economists, for instance Steve Keen, a professor at the University of Western Sydney, argue that even an infinitesimal amount of market power can allow a firm to produce a profit and that the absence of economic profit in an industry, or even merely that some production occurs at a loss, in and of itself constitutes a barrier to entry.\nIn a single-goods case, a positive economic profit happens when the firm's average cost is less than the price of the product or service at the profit-maximizing output. The economic profit is equal to the quantity of output multiplied by the difference between the average cost and the price.\nGovernment intervention.\nOften, governments will try to intervene in uncompetitive markets to make them more competitive. Antitrust (US) or competition (elsewhere) laws were created to prevent powerful firms from using their economic power to artificially create the barriers to entry they need to protect their economic profits. This includes the use of predatory pricing toward smaller competitors. For example, in the United States, Microsoft Corporation was initially convicted of breaking Anti-Trust Law and engaging in anti-competitive behavior in order to form one such barrier in \"United States v. Microsoft\"; after a successful appeal on technical grounds, Microsoft agreed to a settlement with the Department of Justice in which they were faced with stringent oversight procedures and explicit requirements designed to prevent this predatory behaviour. With lower barriers, new firms can enter the market again, making the long run equilibrium more like that of a competitive industry, with no economic profit for firms.\nIf a government feels it is impractical to have a competitive market\u00a0\u2013 such as in the case of a natural monopoly\u00a0\u2013 it will sometimes try to regulate the existing uncompetitive market by controlling the price firms charge for their product. For example, the old AT&amp;T (regulated) monopoly, which existed before the courts ordered its breakup, had to get government approval to raise its prices. The government examined the monopoly's costs to determine whether the monopoly should be able raise its price, and could reject the monopoly's application for a higher price if the cost did not justify it. Although a regulated firm will not have an economic profit as large as it would in an unregulated situation, it can still make profits well above a competitive firm in a truly competitive market.\nResults.\nIn a perfectly competitive market, the demand curve facing a firm is perfectly elastic.\nAs mentioned above, the perfect competition model, if interpreted as applying also to short-period or very-short-period behaviour, is approximated only by markets of homogeneous products produced and purchased by very many sellers and buyers, usually organized markets for agricultural products or raw materials. In real-world markets, assumptions such as perfect information cannot be verified and are only approximated in organized double-auction markets where most agents wait and observe the behaviour of prices before deciding to exchange (but in the long-period interpretation perfect information is not necessary, the analysis only aims at determining the average around which market prices gravitate, and for gravitation to operate one does not need perfect information).\nIn the absence of externalities and public goods, perfectly competitive equilibria are Pareto-efficient, i.e. no improvement in the utility of a consumer is possible without a worsening of the utility of some other consumer. This is called the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. The basic reason is that no productive factor with a non-zero marginal product is left unutilized, and the units of each factor are so allocated as to yield the same indirect marginal utility in all uses, a basic efficiency condition (if this indirect marginal utility were higher in one use than in other ones, a Pareto improvement could be achieved by transferring a small amount of the factor to the use where it yields a higher marginal utility).\nA simple proof assuming differentiable utility functions and production functions is the following. Let formula_1 be the 'price' (the rental) of a certain factor formula_2, let formula_3 and formula_4 be its marginal product in the production of goods formula_5 and formula_6, and let formula_7 and formula_8 be these goods' prices. In equilibrium these prices must equal the respective marginal costs formula_9 and formula_10; remember that marginal cost equals factor 'price' divided by factor marginal productivity (because increasing the production of good by one very small unit through an increase of the employment of factor formula_2 requires increasing the factor employment by formula_12 and thus increasing the cost by formula_13, and through the condition of cost minimization that marginal products must be proportional to factor 'prices' it can be shown that the cost increase is the same if the output increase is obtained by optimally varying all factors). Optimal factor employment by a price-taking firm requires equality of factor rental and factor marginal revenue product, formula_14, so we obtain formula_15, formula_16.\nNow choose any consumer purchasing both goods, and measure his utility in such units that in equilibrium his marginal utility of money (the increase in utility due to the last unit of money spent on each good), formula_17, is 1. Then formula_18, formula_19. The indirect marginal utility of the factor is the increase in the utility of our consumer achieved by an increase in the employment of the factor by one (very small) unit; this increase in utility through allocating the small increase in factor utilization to good formula_5 is formula_21, and through allocating it to good formula_6 it is formula_23 again. With our choice of units the marginal utility of the amount of the factor consumed directly by the optimizing consumer is again w, so the amount supplied of the factor too satisfies the condition of optimal allocation.\nMonopoly violates this optimal allocation condition, because in a monopolized industry market price is above marginal cost, and this means that factors are underutilized in the monopolized industry, they have a higher indirect marginal utility than in their uses in competitive industries. Of course, this theorem is considered irrelevant by economists who do not believe that general equilibrium theory correctly predicts the functioning of market economies; but it is given great importance by neoclassical economists and it is the theoretical reason given by them for combating monopolies and for antitrust legislation.\nProfit.\nIn contrast to a monopoly or oligopoly, in perfect competition it is impossible for a firm to earn economic profit in the long run, which is to say that a firm cannot make any more money than is necessary to cover its economic costs. In order not to misinterpret this zero-long-run-profits thesis, it must be remembered that the term 'profit' is used in different ways: \nThus, if one leaves aside risk coverage for simplicity, the neoclassical zero-long-run-profit thesis would be re-expressed in classical parlance as profits coinciding with interest in the long period (i.e. the rate of profit tending to coincide with the rate of interest). Profits in the classical meaning do not necessarily disappear in the long period but tend to normal profit. \nWith this terminology, if a firm is earning abnormal profit in the short term, this will act as a trigger for other firms to enter the market. As other firms enter the market, the market supply curve will shift out, causing prices to fall. Existing firms will react to this lower price by adjusting their capital stock downward. This adjustment will cause their marginal cost to shift to the left causing the market supply curve to shift inward. However, the net effect of entry by new firms and adjustment by existing firms will be to shift the supply curve outward. The market price will be driven down until all firms are earning normal profit only.\nIt is important to note that perfect competition is a sufficient condition for allocative and productive efficiency, but it is not a necessary condition. Laboratory experiments in which participants have significant price setting power and little or no information about their counterparts consistently produce efficient results given the proper trading institutions.\nShutdown point.\nIn the short run, a firm operating at a loss [formula_24 (revenue less than total cost) or formula_25 (price less than unit cost)] must decide whether to continue to operate or temporarily shut down. The shutdown rule states \"in the short run a firm should continue to operate if price exceeds average variable costs\". Restated, the rule is that for a firm to continue producing in the short run it must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs. The rationale for the rule is straightforward: By shutting down a firm avoids all variable costs. However, the firm must still pay fixed costs. Because fixed costs must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down. Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs (formula_26) rather than total costs (formula_27). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its total variable cost (formula_28), then the firm is covering all variable costs and there is additional revenue (\"contribution\"), which can be applied to fixed costs. (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a sunk cost. The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand, if formula_29 then the firm is not covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent (if one divides both sides of inequality formula_30 by formula_31 gives formula_32). If the firm decides to operate, the firm will continue to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure not only profit maximization (loss minimization) but also maximum contribution.\nAnother way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down and select the option that produces the greater profit. A firm that is shut down is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs. However, the firm still has to pay fixed cost. So the firm's profit equals fixed costs or formula_33. An operating firm is generating revenue, incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs. The operating firm's profit is formula_34. The firm should continue to operate if formula_35, which simplified is formula_36. The difference between revenue, formula_37, and variable costs, formula_26, is the contribution to fixed costs and any contribution is better than none. Thus, if formula_36 then firm should operate. If formula_40 the firm should shut down.\nA decision to shut down means that the firm is temporarily suspending production. It does not mean that the firm is going out of business (exiting the industry). If market conditions improve, and prices increase, the firm can resume production. Shutting down is a short-run decision. A firm that has shut down is not producing. The firm still retains its capital assets; however, the firm cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run. Exit is a long-term decision. A firm that has exited an industry has avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises.\nHowever, a firm cannot continue to incur losses indefinitely. In the long run, the firm will have to earn sufficient revenue to cover all its expenses and must decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere. The long-run decision is based on the relationship of the price and long-run average costs. If formula_41 then the firm will not exit the industry. If formula_42, then the firm will exit the industry. These comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments. In the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs.\nShort-run supply curve.\nThe short-run (formula_43) supply curve for a perfectly competitive firm is the marginal cost (formula_44) curve at and above the shutdown point. Portions of the marginal cost curve below the shutdown point are not part of the formula_43 supply curve because the firm is not producing any positive quantity in that range. Technically the formula_43 supply curve is a discontinuous function composed of the segment of the formula_44 curve at and above minimum of the average variable cost curve and a segment that runs on the vertical axis from the origin to but not including a point at the height of the minimum average variable cost.\nCriticisms.\nThe use of the assumption of perfect competition as the foundation of price theory for product markets is often criticized as representing all agents as passive, thus removing the active attempts to increase one's welfare or profits by price undercutting, product design, advertising, innovation, activities that \u2013 the critics argue \u2013 characterize most industries and markets. These criticisms point to the frequent lack of realism of the assumptions of product homogeneity and impossibility to differentiate it, but apart from this, the accusation of passivity appears correct only for short-period or very-short-period analyses, in long-period analyses the inability of price to diverge from the natural or long-period price is due to active reactions of entry or exit.\nSome economists have a different kind of criticism concerning perfect competition model. They are not criticizing the price taker assumption because it makes economic agents too \"passive\", but because it then raises the question of who sets the prices. Indeed, if everyone is price taker, there is the need for a benevolent planner who gives and sets the prices, in other word, there is a need for a \"price maker\". Therefore, it makes the perfect competition model appropriate not to describe a decentralized \"market\" economy but a centralized one. This in turn means that such kind of model has more to do with communism than capitalism.\nAnother frequent criticism is that it is often not true that in the short run differences between supply and demand cause changes in price; especially in manufacturing, the more common behaviour is alteration of production without nearly any alteration of price.\nThe critics of the assumption of perfect competition in product markets seldom question the basic neoclassical view of the working of market economies for this reason. The Austrian School insists strongly on this criticism, and yet the neoclassical view of the working of market economies as fundamentally efficient, reflecting consumer choices and assigning to each agent his contribution to social welfare, is esteemed to be fundamentally correct. Some non-neoclassical schools, like Post-Keynesians, reject the neoclassical approach to value and distribution, but not because of their rejection of perfect competition as a reasonable approximation to the working of most product markets; the reasons for rejection of the neoclassical 'vision' are different views of the determinants of income distribution and of aggregated demand.\nIn particular, the rejection of perfect competition does not generally entail the rejection of free competition as characterizing most product markets; indeed it has been argued that competition is stronger nowadays than in 19th century capitalism, owing to the increasing capacity of big conglomerate firms to enter any industry: therefore the classical idea of a tendency toward a uniform rate of return on investment in all industries owing to free entry is even more valid today; and the reason why General Motors, Exxon or Nestl\u00e9 do not enter the computers or pharmaceutical industries is not insurmountable barriers to entry but rather that the rate of return in the latter industries is already sufficiently in line with the average rate of return elsewhere as not to justify entry. On this few economists, it would seem, would disagree, even among the neoclassical ones. Thus when the issue is normal, or long-period, product prices, differences on the validity of the perfect competition assumption do not appear to imply important differences on the existence or not of a tendency of rates of return toward uniformity as long as entry is possible, and what is found fundamentally lacking in the perfect competition model is the absence of marketing expenses and innovation as causes of costs that do enter normal average cost.\nThe issue is different with respect to factor markets. Here the acceptance or denial of perfect competition in labour markets does make a big difference to the view of the working of market economies. One must distinguish neoclassical from non-neoclassical economists. For the former, absence of perfect competition in labour markets, e.g. due to the existence of trade unions, impedes the smooth working of competition, which if left free to operate would cause a decrease of wages as long as there were unemployment, and would finally ensure the full employment of labour: labour unemployment is due to absence of perfect competition in labour markets. Most non-neoclassical economists deny that a full flexibility of wages would ensure the full employment of labour and find a stickiness of wages an indispensable component of a market economy, without which the economy would lack the regularity and persistence indispensable to its smooth working. This was, for example, John Maynard Keynes's opinion.\nParticularly radical is the view of the Sraffian school on this issue: the labour demand curve cannot be determined hence a level of wages ensuring the equality between supply and demand for labour does not exist, and economics should resume the viewpoint of the classical economists, according to whom competition in labour markets does not and cannot mean indefinite price flexibility as long as supply and demand are unequal, it only means a tendency to equality of wages for similar work, but the level of wages is necessarily determined by complex sociopolitical elements; custom, feelings of justice, informal allegiances to classes, as well as overt coalitions such as trade unions, far from being impediments to a smooth working of labour markets that would be able to determine wages even without these elements, are on the contrary indispensable because without them there would be no way to determine wages.\nEquilibrium in perfect competition.\nEquilibrium in perfect competition is the point where market demands will be equal to market supply. A firm's price will be determined at this point. In the short run, equilibrium will be affected by demand. In the long run, both demand and supply of a product will affect the equilibrium in perfect competition. A firm will receive only normal profit in the long run at the equilibrium point.\nAs it is well known, requirements for a firm's cost-curve under perfect competition is for the slope to move upwards after a certain amount is produced. This amount is small enough to leave a sufficiently large number of firms in the field (for any given total outputs in the industry) for the conditions of perfect competition to be preserved. For the short-run, the supply of some factors are assumed to be fixed and as the price of the other factors are given, costs per unit must necessarily rise after a certain point. From a theoretical point of view, given the assumptions that there will be a tendency for continuous growth in size for firms, long-period static equilibrium alongside perfect competition may be incompatible.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Philosophical discussions on such topics date from ancient times, and appear in the earliest known texts concerning philosophy. The field involves many other branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.\nThe philosophy of religion differs from religious philosophy in that it seeks to discuss questions regarding the nature of religion as a whole, rather than examining the problems brought forth by a particular belief-system. The philosophy of religion differs from theology in that it aims to examine religious concepts from an objective philosophical perspective rather than from the perspective of a specific religious tradition. The philosophy of religion also differs from religious studies in that it seeks to evaluate the truth of religious worldviews. It can be carried out dispassionately by those who identify as believers or non-believers.\nOverview.\nPhilosopher William L. Rowe characterized the philosophy of religion as: \"the critical examination of basic religious beliefs and concepts.\" Philosophy of religion covers alternative beliefs about God, gods, demons, spirits or all, the varieties of religious experience, the interplay between science and religion, the nature and scope of good and evil, and religious treatments of birth, history, and death. The field also includes the ethical implications of religious commitments, the relation between faith, reason, experience and tradition, concepts of the miraculous, the sacred revelation, mysticism, power, and salvation.\nThe term \"philosophy of religion\" did not come into general use in the West until the nineteenth century, and most pre-modern and early modern philosophical works included a mixture of religious themes and non-religious philosophical questions. In Asia, examples include texts such as the Hindu Upanishads, the works of Daoism and Confucianism and Buddhist texts. Greek philosophies like Pythagoreanism and Stoicism included religious elements and theories about deities, and Medieval philosophy was strongly influenced by the big three monotheistic Abrahamic religions. In the Western world, early modern philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley discussed religious topics alongside secular philosophical issues as well.\nThe philosophy of religion has been distinguished from theology by pointing out that, for theology, \"its critical reflections are based on religious convictions\". Also, \"theology is responsible to an authority that initiates its thinking, speaking, and witnessing ... [while] philosophy bases its arguments on the ground of timeless evidence.\"\nSome aspects of philosophy of religion have classically been regarded as a part of metaphysics. In Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\", the necessarily prior cause of eternal motion was an unmoved mover, who, like the object of desire, or of thought, inspires motion without itself being moved. Today, however, philosophers have adopted the term \"philosophy of religion\" for the subject, and typically it is regarded as a separate field of specialization, although it is also still treated by some, particularly Catholic philosophers, as a part of metaphysics.\nBasic themes and problems.\nUltimate reality.\nDifferent religions have different ideas about ultimate reality, its source or ground (or lack thereof) and also about what is the \"Maximal Greatness\". Paul Tillich's concept of 'Ultimate Concern' and Rudolf Otto's 'Idea of the Holy' are concepts which point to concerns about the ultimate or highest truth which most religious philosophies deal with in some way. One of the main differences among religions is whether the ultimate reality is a personal god or an impersonal reality.\nIn Western religions, various forms of theism are the most common conceptions, while in Eastern religions, there are theistic and also various non-theistic conceptions of the Ultimate. Theistic vs non-theistic is a common way of sorting the different types of religions.\nThere are also several philosophical positions with regard to the existence of God that one might take including various forms of theism (such as monotheism and polytheism), agnosticism and different forms of atheism.\nMonotheism.\nKeith Yandell outlines roughly three kinds of historical monotheisms: Greek, Semitic and Hindu. Greek monotheism holds that the world has always existed and does not believe in creationism or divine providence, while Semitic monotheism believes the world was created by a God at a particular point in time and that this God acts in the world. Indian monotheism teaches that the world is beginningless, but that there is God's act of creation which sustains the world.\nThe attempt to provide proofs or arguments for the existence of God is one aspect of what is known as natural theology or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief in God by independent grounds. Perhaps most of the philosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology's assumption that the existence of God can be justified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological debate about the kinds of proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this discourse.\nNon-theistic conceptions.\nEastern religions have included both theistic and other alternative positions about the ultimate nature of reality. One such view is Jainism, which holds a dualistic view that all that exists is matter and a multiplicity of souls (\"jiva\"), without depending on a supreme deity for their existence. There are also different Buddhist views, such as the Theravada Abhidharma view, which holds that the only ultimately existing things are transitory phenomenal events (\"dharmas\") and their interdependent relations. Madhyamaka Buddhists such as Nagarjuna hold that ultimate reality is emptiness (\"shunyata\") while the Yogacara holds that it is \"vij\u00f1apti\" (mental phenomena). In Indian philosophical discourses, monotheism was defended by Hindu philosophers (particularly the Nyaya school), while Buddhist thinkers argued against their conception of a creator god (Sanskrit: Ishvara).\nThe Hindu view of Advaita Vedanta, as defended by Adi Shankara, is a total non-dualism. Although Advaitins do believe in the usual Hindu gods, their view of ultimate reality is a radically monistic oneness (Brahman without qualities) and anything which appears (like persons and gods) is illusory (\"maya\").\nThe various philosophical positions of Taoism can also be viewed as non-theistic about the ultimate reality (Tao). Taoist philosophers have conceived of different ways of describing the ultimate nature of things. For example, while the Taoist Xuanxue thinker Wang Bi argued that everything is \"rooted\" in\"Wu\" (non-being, nothingness), Guo Xiang rejected \"Wu\" as the ultimate source of things, instead arguing that the ultimate nature of the Tao is \"spontaneous self-production\" (\"zi sheng\") and \"spontaneous self-transformation\" (\"zi hua\").\nTraditionally, Jains and Buddhists did not rule out the existence of limited deities or divine beings, they only rejected the idea of a single all-powerful creator God or First cause posited by monotheists.\nKnowledge and belief.\nAll religious traditions make knowledge claims which they argue are central to religious practice and to the ultimate solution to the main problem of human life. These include epistemic, metaphysical and ethical claims.\nEvidentialism is the position that may be characterized as \"a belief is rationally justified only if there is sufficient evidence for it\". Many theists and non-theists are evidentialists, for example, Aquinas and Bertrand Russell agree that belief in God is rational only if there is sufficient evidence, but disagree on whether such evidence exists. These arguments often stipulate that subjective religious experiences are not reasonable evidence and thus religious truths must be argued based on non-religious evidence. One of the strongest positions of evidentialism is that by William Kingdon Clifford who wrote: \"It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\". His view of evidentialism is usually read in tandem with William James's article \"A Will to Believe\" (1896), which argues against Clifford's principle. More recent supporters of evidentialism include Antony Flew (\"The Presumption of Atheism\", 1972) and Michael Scriven (Primary philosophy, 1966). Both of them rely on the Ockhamist view that in the absence of evidence for X, belief in X is not justified. Many modern Thomists are also evidentialists in that they hold they can demonstrate there is evidence for the belief in God. Another move is to argue in a Bayesian way for the probability of a religious truth like God, not for total conclusive evidence.\nSome philosophers, however, argue that religious belief is warranted \"without evidence\" and hence are sometimes called \"non-evidentialists\". They include fideists and reformed epistemologists. Alvin Plantinga and other reformed epistemologists are examples of philosophers who argue that religious beliefs are \"properly basic beliefs\" and that it is not irrational to hold them even though they are not supported by any evidence. The rationale here is that some beliefs we hold must be foundational and not be based on further rational beliefs. If this is not so, then we risk an infinite regress. This is qualified by the proviso that they can be defended against objections (this differentiates this view from fideism). A properly basic belief is a belief that one can reasonably hold without evidence, such as a memory, a basic sensation or a perception. Plantinga's argument is that belief in God is of this type because within every human mind there is a natural awareness of divinity.\nWilliam James in his essay \"The Will to Believe\" argues for a pragmatic conception of religious belief. For James, religious belief is justified if one is presented with a question which is rationally undecidable and if one is presented with genuine and live options which are relevant for the individual. For James, religious belief is defensible because of the pragmatic value it can bring to one's life, even if there is no rational evidence for it.\nSome work in recent epistemology of religion goes beyond debates over evidentialism, fideism, and reformed epistemology to consider contemporary issues deriving from new ideas about knowledge-how and practical skill; how practical factors can affect whether one could know whether theism is true; from formal epistemology's use of probability theory; or from social epistemology (particularly the epistemology of testimony, or the epistemology of disagreement).\nFor example, an important topic in the epistemology of religion is that of religious disagreement, and the issue of what it means for intelligent individuals of the same epistemic parity to disagree about religious issues. Religious disagreement has been seen as possibly posing first-order or higher-order problems for religious belief. A first order problem refers to whether that evidence directly applies to the truth of any religious proposition, while a higher order problem instead applies to \"whether one has rationally assessed\" the first order evidence. One example of a first order problem is the Argument from nonbelief. Higher order discussions focus on whether religious disagreement with epistemic peers (someone whose epistemic ability is equal to our own) demands us to adopt a skeptical or agnostic stance or whether to reduce or change our religious beliefs.\nFaith and reason.\nWhile religions resort to rational arguments to attempt to establish their views, they also claim that religious belief is at least partially to be accepted through faith, confidence or trust in one's religious belief. There are different conceptions or models of faith, including:\nThere are also different positions on how faith relates to reason. One example is the belief that faith and reason are compatible and work together, which is the view of Thomas Aquinas and the orthodox view of Catholic natural theology. According to this view, reason establishes certain religious truths and faith (guided by reason) gives us access to truths about the divine which, according to Aquinas, \"exceed all the ability of human reason.\"\nAnother position on is Fideism, the view that faith is \"in some sense independent of, if not outright adversarial toward, reason.\" Modern philosophers such as Kierkegaard, William James, and Wittgenstein have been associated with this label. Kierkegaard in particular, argued for the necessity of the religious to take a non-rational leap of faith to bridge the gulf between man and God. Wittgensteinian fideism meanwhile sees religious language games as being incommensurate with scientific and metaphysical language games, and that they are autonomous and thus may only be judged on their own standards. The obvious criticism to this is that many religions clearly put forth metaphysical claims.\nSeveral contemporary New Atheist writers which are hostile to religion hold a related view that says that religious claims and scientific claims are opposed to each other and that therefore religions are false.\nThe Protestant theologian Karl Barth (1886\u20131968) argued that religious believers have no need to prove their beliefs through reason and thus rejected the project of natural theology. According to Barth, human reason is corrupt and God is utterly different from his creatures, thus we can only rely on God's own revelation for religious knowledge. Barth's view has been termed Neo-orthodoxy. Similarly, D.Z. Phillips argues that God is not intelligible through reason or evidence because God is not an empirical object or a 'being among beings'.\nAs Brian Davies points out, the problem with positions like Barth's is that they do not help us in deciding between inconsistent and competing revelations of the different religions.\nScience.\nThe topic of whether religious beliefs are compatible with science and in what way is also another important topic in the philosophy of religion as well as in theology. This field draws the historical study of their interactions and conflicts, such as the debates in the United States over the teaching of evolution and creationism. There are different models of interaction that have been discussed in the philosophical literature, including:\nThe field also draws the scientific study of religion, particularly by psychologists and sociologists as well as cognitive scientists. Various theories about religion have arisen from these various disciplines. One example is the various evolutionary theories of religion which see the phenomenon as either adaptive or a by-product. Another can be seen in the various theories put forth by the Cognitive science of religion. Some argued that evolutionary or cognitive theories undermine religious belief.\nReligious experience.\nClosely related to knowledge and belief is how to interpret religious experiences and their potential for providing knowledge. Religious experiences have been recorded throughout all cultures and are widely diverse. These personal experiences tend to be highly important to individuals who undergo them. Discussions about religious experiences can be said to be informed in part by the question: \"what sort of information about what there is might religious experience provide, and how could one tell?\"\nOne could interpret these experiences either veridically, neutrally or as delusions. Both monotheistic and non-monotheistic religious thinkers and mystics have appealed to religious experiences as evidence for their claims about ultimate reality. Philosophers such as Richard Swinburne and William Alston have compared religious experiences to everyday perceptions, that is, both are noetic and have a perceptual object, and thus religious experiences could logically be veridical unless we have a good reason to disbelieve them. Other philosophers such as Eleonore Stump and Matthew Benton argue for an interpersonal epistemology on which one can experience and know God in a relational or personal sense.\nAccording to Brian Davies common objections against the veridical force of religious experiences include the fact that experience is frequently deceptive and that people who claim an experience of a god may be \"mistakenly identifying an object of their experience\", or be insane or hallucinating. However, he argues that we cannot deduce from the fact that our experiences are \"sometimes\" mistaken, hallucinations or distorted to the conclusion that all religious experiences are mistaken etc. Indeed, a drunken or hallucinating person could still perceive things correctly, therefore these objections cannot be said to \"necessarily\" disprove all religious experiences.\nAccording to C. B. Martin, \"there are no tests agreed upon to establish genuine experience of God and distinguish it decisively from the ungenuine\", and therefore all that religious experiences can establish is the reality of these psychological states.\nNaturalistic explanations for religious experiences are often seen as undermining their epistemic value. Explanations such as the fear of death, suggestion, infantile regression, sexual frustration, neurological anomalies (\"it's all in the head\") as well as the socio-political power that having such experiences might grant to a mystic have been put forward. More recently, some argued that religious experiences are caused by cognitive misattributions akin to hallucinations, although this was denied by others. A contrary position was taken by Bertrand Russell who compared the veridical value of religious experiences to the hallucinations of a drunk person: \"From a scientific point of view, we can make no distinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks much and sees snakes. Each is in an abnormal physical condition, and therefore has abnormal perceptions.\" However, as William L. Rowe notes:\nThe hidden assumption in Russell's argument is that bodily and mental states that interfere with reliable perceptions of the physical world also interfere with reliable perceptions of a spiritual world beyond the physical, if there is such a spiritual world to be perceived. Perhaps this assumption is reasonable, but it certainly is not obviously true.\nIn other words, as argued by C.D. Broad, \"one might need to be slightly 'cracked'\" or at least appear to be mentally and physically abnormal in order to perceive the supranormal spiritual world.\nWilliam James meanwhile takes a middle course between accepting mystical experiences as veridical or seeing them as delusional. He argues that for the individual who experiences them, they are authoritative and they break down the authority of the rational mind. Not only that, but according to James, the mystic is justified in this. But when it comes to the non-mystic, the outside observer, they have no reason to regard them as either veridical nor delusive.\nThe study of religious experiences from the perspective of the field of phenomenology has also been a feature of the philosophy of religion. Key thinkers in this field include William Brede Kristensen and Gerard van der Leeuw.\nTypes.\nJust like there are different religions, there are different forms of religious experience. One could have \"subject/content\" experiences (such as a euphoric meditative state) and \"subject/consciousness/object\" experiences (such as the perception of having seen a god, i.e. theophany). Experiences of theophany are described in ancient Mediterranean religious works and myths and include the story of Semele who died due to her seeing Zeus and the Biblical story of the Burning bush. Indian texts like the Bhagavad Gita also contain theophanic events. The diversity (sometimes to the point of contradiction) of religious experiences has also been used as an argument against their veridical nature, and as evidence that they are a purely subjective psychological phenomenon.\nIn Western thought, religious experience (mainly a theistic one) has been described by the likes of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Rudolf Otto and William James. According to Schleiermacher, the distinguishing feature of a religious experience is that \"one is overcome by the feeling of absolute dependence.\" Otto meanwhile, argued that while this was an important element, the most basic feature of religious experiences is that it is \"numinous\". He described this as \"non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self\" as well as having the qualities of being a mystery, terrifying and fascinating.\nRowe meanwhile defined a religious experience as \"an experience in which one senses the immediate presence of the divine.\" According to Rowe, religious experiences can be divided in the following manner:\nNon-monotheistic religions meanwhile also report different experiences from theophany, such as non-dual experiences of oneness and deeply focused meditative states (termed \"samadhi\" in Indian religion) as well as experiences of enlightenment in Buddhism, liberation in Hinduism, and kevala in Jainism.\nAnother typology, offered by Chad Meister, differentiates between three major experiences:\nPerennialism vs Constructivism.\nAnother debate on this topic is whether all religious cultures share common core mystical experiences (Perennialism) or whether these experiences are in some way socially and culturally constructed (Constructivism or Contextualism). According to Walter Stace all cultures share mystical experiences of oneness with the external world, as well as introverted \"Pure Conscious Events\" which is empty of all concepts, thoughts, qualities, etc. except pure consciousness. Similarly Ninian Smart argued that monistic experiences were universal. Perennialists tend to distinguish between the experience itself, and its post experience interpretation to make sense of the different views in world religions.\nSome constructivists like Steven T. Katz meanwhile have argued against the common core thesis, and for either the view that every mystical experience contains at least some concepts (soft constructivism) or that they are strongly shaped and determined by one's religious ideas and culture (hard constructivism). In this view, the conceptual scheme of any mystic strongly shapes their experiences and because mystics from different religions have very different schemas, there cannot be any universal mystical experiences.\nReligion and ethics.\nAll religions argue for certain values and ideas of the moral Good. Non-monotheistic Indian traditions like Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta find the highest Good in nirvana or moksha which leads to release from suffering and the rounds of rebirth and morality is a means to achieve this, while for monotheistic traditions, God is the source or ground of all morality and heaven in the highest human good. The world religions also offer different conceptions of the source of evil and suffering in the world, that is, what is wrong with human life and how to solve and free ourselves from these dilemmas. For example, for Christianity, sin is the source of human problems, while for Buddhism, it is craving and ignorance.\nA general question which philosophy of religion asks is what is the relationship, if any, between morality and religion. Brian Davies outlines four possible theses:\nMonotheistic religions who seek to explain morality and its relationship to God must deal with what is termed the Euthyphro dilemma, famously stated in the Platonic dialogue \"Euthyphro\" as: \"Is the pious (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, i.e. what is morally good) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?\" Those who hold that what is moral is so \"because\" it is what God commands are defending a version of the Divine command theory.\nAnother important topic which is widely discussed in Abrahamic monotheistic religious philosophy is the problem of human Free will and God's omniscience. God's omniscience could presumably include perfect knowledge of the future, leading to Theological determinism and thus possibly contradicting with human free will. There are different positions on this including libertarianism (free will is true) and Predestination.\nMiracles.\nBelief in miracles and supernatural events or occurrences is common among world religions. A miracle is an event which cannot be explained by rational or scientific means. The Resurrection of Jesus and the Miracles of Muhammad are examples of miracles claimed by religions.\nSkepticism towards the supernatural can be found in early philosophical traditions like the Indian Carvaka school and Greco-Roman philosophers like Lucretius. David Hume, who defined a miracle as \"a violation of the laws of nature\", famously argued against miracles in Of Miracles, Section X of \"An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding\" (1748). For Hume, the probability that a miracle has not occurred is always greater than the probability that it has because \"as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws [of nature], the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined\" (\"Enquiry\". X. p.\u00a0173). Hume does not argue that a miracle is impossible, only that it is unreasonable to believe in any testimony of a miracle's occurrence, for evidence for the regularity of natural laws is much stronger than human testimony (which is often in error).\nAccording to Rowe, there are two weaknesses with Hume's argument. First, there could be other forms of indirect evidence for the occurrence of a miracle that does not include testimony of someone's direct experience of it. Secondly, Rowe argues that Hume overestimates \"the weight that should be given to past experience in support of some principle thought to be a law of nature.\" For it is a common occurrence that currently accepted ideas of natural laws are revised due to an observed exception but Hume's argument would lead one to conclude that these exceptions do not occur. Rowe adds that \"It remains true, however, that a reasonable person will require quite strong evidence before believing that a law of nature has been violated. It is easy to believe the person who claimed to see water run downhill, but quite difficult to believe that someone saw water run uphill.\"\nAnother definition of a miracle is possible however, which is termed the Epistemic theory of miracles and was argued for by Spinoza and St. Augustine. This view rejects that a miracle is a transgression of natural laws, but is simply a transgression of our current \"understanding\" of natural law. In the \"Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\", Spinoza writes: \"miracles are only intelligible as in relation to human opinions, and merely mean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained by a reference to any ordinary occurrence, either by us, or at any rate, by the writer and narrator of the miracle\" (\"Tractatus\" p.\u00a084). Similarly, R.F. Holland has defined miracle in a naturalistic way in a widely cited paper. For Holland, a miracle need only be an extraordinary and beneficial coincidence interpreted religiously.\nBrian Davies notes that even if we can establish that a miracle has occurred, it is hard to see what this is supposed to prove. For it is possible that they arise due to agencies which are unusual and powerful, but not divine.\nAfterlife.\nWorld religions put forth various theories which affirm life after death and different kinds of postmortem existence. This is often tied to belief in an immortal individual soul or self (Sanskrit: atman) separate from the body which survives death, as defended by Plato, Descartes, Monotheistic religions like Christianity and many Indian philosophers. This view is also a position on the mind body problem, mainly, dualism. This view then must show not only that dualism is true and that souls exist, but also that souls survive death. As Kant famously argued, the mere existence of a soul does not prove its immortality, for one could conceive that a soul, even if it is totally simple, could still fade away or lose its intensity. H. H. Price is one modern philosopher who has speculated at length about what it would be like to be a disembodied soul after death.\nOne major issue with soul beliefs is that since personhood is closely tied to one's physical body, it seems difficult to make sense of a human being existing apart from their body. A further issue is with continuity of personal identity, that is, it is not easy to account for the claim that the person that exists after bodily death is the \"same\" person that existed before.\nBertrand Russell put forth the general scientific argument against the afterlife as follows:\nPersons are part of the everyday world with which science is concerned, and the conditions which determine their existence are discoverable...we know that the brain is not immortal, and that the organized energy of a living body becomes, as it were, demobilized at death and therefore not available for collective action. All the evidence goes to show that what we regard as our mental life is bound up with brain structure and organized bodily energy. Therefore it is rational to suppose that mental life ceases when bodily life ceases. The argument is only one of probability, but it is as strong as those upon which most scientific conclusions are based.\nContra Russell, J. M. E. McTaggart argues that people have no scientific proof that the mind is dependent on the body in this particular way. As Rowe notes, the fact that the mind depends on the functions of the body while one is alive is not necessarily proof that the mind will cease functioning after death just as a person trapped in a room while depending on the windows to see the outside world might continue to see even after the room ceases to exist.\nBuddhism is one religion which, while affirming postmortem existence (through rebirth), denies the existence of individual souls and instead affirms a deflationary view of personal identity, termed \"not-self\" (anatta).\nWhile physicalism has generally been seen as hostile to notions of an afterlife, this need not be the case. Abrahamic religions like Christianity have traditionally held that life after death will include the element of bodily resurrection. One objection to this view is that it seems difficult to account for personal continuity, at best, a resurrected body is a replica of the resurrected person not the same person. One response is the constitution view of persons, which says persons are constituted by their bodies and by a \"first-person perspective\", the capacity to think of oneself \"as oneself\". In this view, what is resurrected is that first person perspective, or both the person's body and that perspective. An objection to this view is that it seems difficult to differentiate one person's first person perspective from another person's without reference to temporal and spatial relations. Peter van Inwagen meanwhile, offers the following theory:\nPerhaps at the moment of each man's death, God removes his corpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or rots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He removes for \"safekeeping\" only the \"core person\"\u2014the brain and central nervous system\u2014or even some special part of it. These are details. (van Inwagen 1992: 245\u201346)\nThis view shows how some positions on the nature of the afterlife are closely tied to and sometimes completely depend upon theistic positions. This close connection between the two views was made by Kant, who argued that one can infer an afterlife from belief in a just God who rewards persons for their adherence to moral law.\nOther discussions on the philosophy of the afterlife deal with phenomena such as near death experiences, reincarnation research, and other parapsychological events and hinge on whether naturalistic explanations for these phenomena is enough to explain them or not. Such discussions are associated with philosophers like William James, Henry Sidgwick, C.D. Broad, and H.H. Price.\nDiversity and pluralism.\nThe issue of how one is to understand religious diversity and the plurality of religious views and beliefs has been a central concern of the philosophy of religion.\nThere are various philosophical positions regarding how one is to make sense of religious diversity, including exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism, relativism, atheism or antireligion and agnosticism.\nReligious exclusivism is the claim that only one religion is true and that others are wrong. To say that a religion is exclusivistic can also mean that salvation or human freedom is only attainable by the followers of one's religion. This view tends to be the orthodox view of most monotheistic religions, such as Christianity and Islam, though liberal and modernist trends within them might differ. The philosopher William L Rowe outlines two problems with this view. The first problem is that it is easy to see that if this is true, a large portion of humanity is excluded from salvation and it is hard to see how a loving god would desire this. The second problem is that once we become acquainted with the saintly figures and virtuous people in other religions, it can be difficult to see how we could say they are excluded from salvation just because they are not part of our religion.\nA different view is inclusivism, which is the idea that \"one's own tradition alone has the whole truth but that this truth is nevertheless partially reflected in other traditions.\" An inclusivist might maintain that their religion is privileged, they can also hold that other religious adherents have fundamental truths and even that they will be saved or liberated. The Jain view of Anekantavada ('many-sidedness') has been interpreted by some as a tolerant view which is an inclusive acceptance of the partial truth value of non-Jain religious ideas. As Paul Dundas notes, the Jains ultimately held the thesis that Jainism is the final truth, while other religions only contain partial truths. Other scholars such as Kristin Beise Kiblinger have also argued that some of the Buddhist traditions include inclusivist ideas and attitudes.\nIn the modern Western study of religion, the work of Ninian Smart has also been instrumental in representing a more diverse understanding of religion and religious pluralism. Smart's view is that there are genuine differences between religions.\nPluralism is the view that all religions are equally valid responses to the divine and that they are all valid paths to personal transformation. This approach is taken by John Hick, who has developed a pluralistic view which synthesizes components of various religious traditions. Hick promotes an idea of a noumenal sacred reality which different religions provide us access to. Hick defines his view as \"the great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions of, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real or the Ultimate.\" For Hick, all religions are true because they all allow us to encounter the divine reality, even if they have different deities and conceptions of it. Rowe notes that a similar idea is proposed by Paul Tillich's concept of \"Being-itself\".\nThe view of perennialism is that there is a single or core truth or experience which is shared by all religions even while they use different terms and language to express it. This view is espoused by the likes of Aldous Huxley, the thinkers of the Traditionalist School as well as Neo-Vedanta.\nYet another way of responding to the conflicting truth claims of religions is Relativism. Joseph Runzo., one of its most prominent defenders, has argued for \"henofideism\" which states that the truth of a religious worldview is relative to each community of adherents. Thus while religions have incompatible views, each one is individually valid as they emerge from individual experiences of a plurality of phenomenal divine realities. According to Runzo, this view does not reduce the incompatible ideas and experiences of different religions to mere interpretations of the Real and thus preserves their individual dignity.\nAnother response to the diversity and plurality of religious beliefs and deities throughout human history is one of skepticism towards all of them (or even antireligion), seeing them as illusions or human creations which serve human psychological needs. Sigmund Freud was a famous proponent of this view, in various publications such as \"The Future of an Illusion\" (1927) and \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1930). According to Freud, \"Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires.\"\nWhile one can be skeptical towards the claims of religion, one need not be hostile towards religion. Don Cupitt is one example of someone who, while disbelieving in the metaphysical and cosmological claims of his religion, holds that one can practice it with a \"non-realist\" perspective which sees religious claims as human inventions and myths to live by.\nReligious language.\nThe question of religious language and in what sense it can be said to be meaningful has been a central issue of the philosophy of religion since the work of the Vienna circle, a group of philosophers who, influenced by Wittgenstein, put forth the theory of Logical positivism. Their view was that religious language, such as any talk of God cannot be verified empirically and thus was ultimately meaningless. This position has also been termed theological noncognitivism. A similar view can be seen in David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, where he famously wrote that any work which did not include either (1) abstract reasoning on quantity or number or (2) reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence was \"nothing but sophistry and illusion\".\nIn a similar vein, Antony Flew, questioned the validity of religious statements because they do not seem to be falsifiable, that is, religious claims do not seem to allow any counter evidence to count against them and thus they seem to be lacking in content. While such arguments were popular in the 1950s and 60s, the verification principle and falsifiability as a criterion for meaning are no longer as widely held. The main problem with verificationism is that it seems to be self refuting, for it is a claim which does not seem to be supported by its own criterion.\nAs noted by Brian Davies, when talking about God and religious truths, religious traditions tend to resort to metaphor, negation and analogy. The via negativa has been defended by thinkers such as Maimonides who denied that positive statements about God were helpful and wrote: \"you will come nearer to the knowledge and comprehension of God by the negative attributes.\" Similar approaches based on negation can be seen in the Hindu doctrine of Neti neti and the Buddhist philosophy of Madhyamaka.\nWittgenstein's theory of language games also shows how one can use analogical religious language to describe God or religious truths, even if the words one is using do not in this case refer to their everyday sense, i.e. when we say God is wise, we do not mean he is wise in the same sense that a person is wise, yet it can still make sense to talk in this manner. However, as Patrick Sherry notes, the fact that this sort of language may make sense does not mean that one is warranted in ascribing these terms to God, for there must be some connection between the relevant criteria we use in ascribing these terms to conventional objects or subjects and to God. As Chad Meister notes though, for Wittgenstein, a religion's language game need not reflect some literal picture of reality (as a picture theory of meaning would hold) but is useful simply because its ability to \"reflect the practices and forms of life of the various religious adherents.\" Following Wittgenstein, philosophers of religion like Norman Malcolm, B. R. Tilghman, and D. Z. Phillips have argued that instead of seeing religious language as referring to some objective reality, we should instead see it as referring to \"forms of life\". This approach is generally termed non-realist.\nAgainst this view, realists respond that non-realism subverts religious belief and the intelligibility of religious practice. It is hard to see for example, how one can pray to a God without believing that they really exist. Realists also argue that non-realism provides no normative way to choose between competing religions.\nAnalytic philosophy of religion.\nIn \"Analytic Philosophy of Religion\", James Franklin Harris noted that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;analytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have actually provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.\nAs with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of philosophy of religion, largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists view) the subject as part of metaphysics and therefore meaningless. The collapse of logical positivism renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like William Alston, John Mackie, Alvin Plantinga, Robert Merrihew Adams, Richard Swinburne, and Antony Flew not only to introduce new problems, but to re-open classical topics such as the nature of miracles, theistic arguments, the problem of evil, the rationality of belief in God, concepts of the nature of God, and many more.\nPlantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the \"free will defense\" as a way to solve the problem of evil. Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic philosophy of language, worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality. Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the reformed epistemologists like Plantinga.\nAnalytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with Ludwig Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's philosophy of religion. Using first-hand remarks (which would later be published in \"Philosophical Investigations\", \"Culture and Value\", and other works), philosophers such as Peter Winch and Norman Malcolm developed what has come to be known as \"contemplative philosophy\", a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the \"Swansea tradition\" and which includes Wittgensteinians such as Rush Rhees, Peter Winch and D. Z. Phillips, among others. The name \"contemplative philosophy\" was first coined by D. Z. Phillips in \"Philosophy's Cool Place\", which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's \"Culture and Value\". This interpretation was first labeled, \"Wittgensteinian Fideism\", by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D. Z. Phillips. Responding to this interpretation, Kai Nielsen and D.Z. Phillips became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23004", "revid": "16495000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23004", "title": "Precedent", "text": "Rule established in an earlier legal case\nPrecedent is a judicial decision that serves as an authority for courts when deciding subsequent identical or similar cases. Fundamental to common law legal systems, precedent operates under the principle of \"stare decisis\" (\"to stand by things decided\"), where past judicial decisions serve as case law to guide future rulings, thus promoting consistency and predictability.\nPrecedent is a defining feature that sets common law systems apart from civil law systems. In common law, precedent can either be something courts must follow (binding) or something they can consider but do not have to follow (persuasive). Civil law systems, in contrast, are characterized by comprehensive codes and detailed statutes, with little emphasis on precedent (see, jurisprudence constante), and where judges primarily focus on fact-finding and applying the codified law.\nCourts in common law systems rely heavily on case law, which refers to the collection of precedents and legal principles established by previous judicial decisions on specific issues or topics. The development of case law depends on the systematic publication and indexing of these decisions in law reports, making them accessible to lawyers, courts, and the general public.\nGenerally speaking, a legal precedent may be:\nPrinciples.\n\"Stare decisis\".\n\"Stare decisis\" () is a judicial doctrine under which courts follow the principles, rules, or standards established in their prior decisions (or those of higher courts) when deciding cases involving the same or closely related issues. The term originates from the Latin phrase meaning to \"stand by the thing decided and do not disturb the calm.\"\nThe doctrine operates both horizontally and vertically. Vertical \"stare decisis\" binds lower courts to strictly follow the decisions of higher courts within the same jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals applying a precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court is an example of vertical \"stare decisis\". Horizontal \"stare decisis\" refers the principle that a court adheres to its own previous rulings.\nIn the modern era, the U.S. Supreme Court adheres to its prior decisions unless there is a &lt;q&gt;special justification&lt;/q&gt; to overrule precedent. By taking this approach, the Court has rejected a strict view of \"stare decisis\" that would require it to uphold past rulings regardless of their merits or the practical consequences of maintaining or overturning them.\n\"Ratio decidendi\" and \"obiter dicta\".\n\"Ratio decidendi\" (\"the reason for the decision\") refers to the key factual element or line of reasoning in a case that forms the basis for the court's final judgment. It forms the basis for a court decision and creates binding precedent. This distinguishes it from other parts of a judicial opinion, such as \"obiter dicta\" (non-binding observations or comments).\nIn contrast, \"obiter dicta\" (\"something said in passing\") refers to comments, suggestions, or observations made by a judge in an opinion that are not necessary to resolve the case at hand. While not legally binding on other courts, such statements may be cited as persuasive authority in subsequent litigation.\nHierarchy of courts.\nFederalism and parallel state and federal courts.\nIn federal systems the division between federal and state law may result in complex interactions. In the United States, state courts are not considered inferior to federal courts but rather constitute a parallel court system.\nIn practice, however, judges in one system will almost always choose to follow relevant case law in the other system to prevent divergent results and to minimize forum shopping.\nTypes of precedent.\nBinding precedent.\nBinding precedent, based on the legal principle of \"stare decisis,\" requires lower courts to follow the decisions of appellate courts in the same jurisdiction. In other words, when an appellate court resolves a question of law, its determination, or \"holding,\" serves as precedent that lower courts are bound to apply in cases involving similar facts or legal issues.\nFor example, in the United States, decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, as the nation's highest court, are binding on all other courts nationwide.\nPersuasive precedent.\nPersuasive precedent refers to legal decisions that a court may consider but is not obligated to follow when deciding a case, as they are not binding. Examples include decisions from courts in neighboring jurisdictions and \"dicta\" from rulings by higher courts. In Australia, decisions of superior overseas courts, such as those from the United Kingdom, serve as persuasive precedent.\nAlthough not binding precedent, a court may choose to rely on persuasive precedent if the reasoning is compelling. Courts often turn to decisions from other jurisdictions for guidance, particularly when interpreting unclear laws or addressing \"cases of first impression\"\u2014situations in which no prior binding authority exists and the court must determine the applicable law for the first time.\nNonprecedential decisions.\nNonpublication of opinions, or unpublished opinions, are those decisions of courts that are not available for citation as precedent because the judges making the opinion deem the cases as having less precedential value. Selective publication is the legal process which a judge or justices of a court decide whether a decision is to be or not published in a reporter. \"Unpublished\" federal appellate decisions are published in the Federal Appendix. Depublication is the power of a court to make a previously published order or opinion unpublished.\nLitigation that is settled out of court generates no written decision, thus has no precedential effect. As one practical effect, the U.S. Department of Justice settles many cases against the federal government simply to avoid creating adverse precedent.\nPrecedent in civil law and mixed systems.\nCivil law systems.\n\"Stare decisis\" is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the legislative positivist principle that only the legislature may make law. Instead, the civil law system relies on the doctrine of \"jurisprudence constante\", according to which if a court has adjudicated a consistent line of cases that arrive at the same holdings using sound reasoning, then the previous decisions are highly persuasive but not controlling on issues of law. This doctrine is similar to \"stare decisis\" insofar as it dictates that a court's decision must condone a cohesive and predictable result. In theory, lower courts are generally not bound by the precedents of higher courts. In practice, the need for predictability means that lower courts generally defer to the precedent of higher courts. As a result, the precedent of courts of last resort, such as the French Cassation Court and the Council of State, is recognized as being \"de facto\" binding on lower courts.\nThe doctrine of \"jurisprudence constante\" also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of common law jurisdictions give a sufficient \"ratio decidendi\" as to guide future courts. The ratio is used to justify a court decision on the basis of previous case law as well as to make it easier to use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently France) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the \"ratio decidendi\" in any great detail. This is the result of the legislative positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, \"ratio decidendi\" is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in common law jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.\nIn other civil law jurisdictions, such as the German-speaking countries, \"ratio decidendi\" tend to be much more developed than in France, and courts will frequently cite previous cases and doctrinal writers. However, some courts (such as German courts) have less emphasis on the particular facts of the case than common law courts, but have more emphasis on the discussion of various doctrinal arguments and on finding what the correct interpretation of the law is.\nThe mixed systems of the Nordic countries are sometimes considered a branch of the civil law, but they are sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In Sweden, for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the Supreme Court () and the Supreme Administrative Court (), have the right to set precedent which has persuasive authority on all future application of the law. Appellate courts, be they judicial () or administrative (), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions are persuasive, not controlling, and may therefore be overturned by higher courts.\nMixed or bijuridical systems.\nSome mixed systems, such as Scots law in Scotland, South African law, Laws of the Philippines, and the law of Quebec and Louisiana, do not fit into the civil vs. common law dichotomy because they mix portions of both. Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the common law tradition; however, their private law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition. Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as \"mixed\" systems of law. Louisiana courts, for instance, operate under both \"stare decisis\" and \"jurisprudence constante\". In South Africa, the precedent of higher courts is absolutely or fully binding on lower courts, whereas the precedent of lower courts only has persuasive authority on higher courts; horizontally, precedent is \"prima facie\" or presumptively binding between courts.\nRole of academics in civil law jurisdictions.\nLaw professors in common law traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called doctrine and may be published in treatises or in journals such as \"Recueil Dalloz\" in France. Historically, common law courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as Coke and Blackstone). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as persuasive authority; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent.\nCritical analysis.\nCourt formulations.\nJustice Louis Brandeis, in a heavily footnoted dissent to \"Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.\", , 405\u2013411 (1932), explained (citations and quotations omitted):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Stare decisis\" is not ... a universal, inexorable command. \"The rule of \"stare decisis\", though one tending to consistency and uniformity of decision, is not inflexible. Whether it shall be followed or departed from is a question entirely within the discretion of the court, which is again called upon to consider a question once decided.\" \"Stare decisis\" is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function. ... In cases involving the Federal Constitution the position of this Court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of \"stare decisis\" was formulated and is strictly applied to all classes of cases. Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be promptly invoked.\nThe reasons why this Court should refuse to follow an earlier constitutional decision which it deems erroneous are particularly strong where the question presented is one of applying, as distinguished from what may accurately be called interpreting, the Constitution. In the cases which now come before us there is seldom any dispute as to the interpretation of any provision. The controversy is usually over the application to existing conditions of some well-recognized constitutional limitation. This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause when the question is whether a statute is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; of cases under the equal protection clause when the question is whether there is any reasonable basis for the classification made by a statute; and of cases under the commerce clause when the question is whether an admitted burden laid by a statute upon interstate commerce is so substantial as to be deemed direct. ...\nIn his \"landmark dissent\" in \"Burnet\", Brandeis \"catalogued the Court's actual overruling practices in such a powerful manner that his attendant stare decisis analysis immediately assumed canonical authority.\"\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A judicial precedent attaches a specific legal consequence to a detailed set of facts in an adjudged case or judicial decision, which is then considered as furnishing the rule for the determination of a subsequent case involving identical or similar material facts and arising in the same court or a lower court in the judicial hierarchy.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Stare decisis is the policy of the court to stand by precedent; the term is but an abbreviation of \u2014\"to stand by and adhere to decisions and not disturb what is settled\". Consider the word \"decisis\". The word means, literally and legally, the decision. Under the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" a case is important only for what it decides\u2014for the \"what\", not for the \"why\", and not for the \"how\". Insofar as precedent is concerned, \"stare decisis\" is important only for the decision, for the detailed legal consequence following a detailed set of facts.\nLord Hodge of the UK Supreme Court quoted Lord Wright in 1938 saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]hat is the way of the common law, the judges preferring to go from case to case, like the ancient Mediterranean mariners, hugging the coast from point to point, and avoiding the dangers of the open sea of system or science.\nAcademic study.\nPrecedent viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still. The existence of submerged precedent (reasoned opinions not made available through conventional legal research sources) has been identified as a potentially distorting force in the evolution of law.\nScholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedent in order to establish which precedent is most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.\nApplication.\nDevelopment.\nEarly English common law did not have or require the \"stare decisis\" doctrine for a range of legal and technological reasons:\nThese features changed over time, opening the door to the doctrine of \"stare decisis\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; By the end of the eighteenth century, the common law courts had absorbed most of the business of their nonroyal competitors, although there was still internal competition among the different common law courts themselves. During the nineteenth century, legal reform movements in both England and the United States brought this to an end as well by merging the various common law courts into a unified system of courts with a formal hierarchical structure. This and the advent of reliable private case reporters made adherence to the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" practical and the practice soon evolved of holding judges to be bound by the decisions of courts of superior or equal status in their jurisdiction.\nUnited States legal system.\nOver time courts in the United States and especially its Supreme Court developed a large body of judicial decisions which are called \"precedents\". These \"[r]ules and principles established in prior cases inform the Court's future decisions.\" The adherence to rules and principles created in past cases as a foundation for future decisions by the courts is called \"stare decisis\". The United States Supreme Court considers stare decisis not only as an important doctrine, but also \"the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion.\" \"Stare decisis\" aims to bolster the legitimacy of the judicial process and foster the rule of law. It does so by strengthening stability, certainty, predictability, consistency and uniformity in the application of the law to cases and litigants. By adhering to \"stare decisis\" the Supreme Court attempts to preserve its role \"as a careful, unbiased, and predictable decisionmaker that decides cases according to the law rather than the Justices' individual policy preferences.\" In \"Vasquez v. Hillery\" (1986) the Supreme Court stated succinctly that stare decisis \"contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact\" by maintaining the notion \"that bedrock principles are founded in the law, rather than in the proclivities of individuals.\"\n\"Stare decisis\" reduces the number and scope of legal questions that the court must resolve in litigation. It is therefore a time saver for judges and litigants. Once a court has settled a particular question of law it has established a precedent. Thanks to \"stare decisis\" lawsuits can be quickly and efficiently dismissed because legal battles can be resolved through recourse to rules and principles established prior decisions. \"Stare decisis\" can thus encourage parties to settle cases out of court and thereby enhance judicial efficiency.\nSeveral Supreme Court decisions were overruled by subsequent decisions since 1798. In doing so the Supreme Court has time and time again made several statements regarding stare decisis. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of these statements:\n\"Stare decisis\" applies to the holding of a case, rather than to obiter dicta (\"things said by the way\"). As the United States Supreme Court has put it: \"dicta may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but are not binding\".\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court, the principle of stare decisis is most flexible in constitutional cases, as observed by Justice Brandeis in his landmark dissent in \"Burnet\" (as quoted at length above). For example, in the years 1946\u20131992, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in about 130 cases. The U.S. Supreme Court has further explained as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[W]hen convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment, and not upon legislative action, this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.\u2014\u200a\nThe Court has stated that where a court gives multiple reasons for a given result, each alternative reason that is \"explicitly\" labeled by the court as an \"independent\" ground for the decision is not treated as \"simply a dictum\".\nAs Colin Starger has pointed out, the contemporary rule of stare decisis descended from Brandeis's landmark dissent in \"Burnet\" would later split into strong and weak conceptions as a result of the disagreement between Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall in \"Payne v. Tennessee\" (1991). The strong conception requires a \"special justification\" to overrule challenged precedent beyond the fact the precedent was \"wrongly decided\", while the weak conception holds that a precedent can be overruled if it suffers from \"bad reasoning\".\nThe opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts in the case \"June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo\" provides a clear statement of the strong conception of \"stare decisis\". In this case, the Court upheld, by a 5\u20134 margin, their 2016 decision in \"Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\" that struck down a similar Texas law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have the right to admit patients at a nearby hospital. Roberts wrote, \"The legal doctrine of \"stare decisis\" requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike.\" Roberts provided the fifth vote to uphold the 2016 decision, even though he felt it was wrongly decided.\nEnglish legal system.\nThe doctrine of binding precedent or \"stare decisis\" is basic to the English legal system. Special features of the English legal system include the following:\nThe Supreme Court's ability to override its own precedent.\nThe British House of Lords, as the court of last appeal outside Scotland before it was replaced by the UK Supreme Court, was not strictly bound to always follow its own decisions until the case \"London Street Tramways v London County Council\" [1898] AC 375. After this case, once the Lords had given a ruling on a point of law, the matter was closed unless and until Parliament made a change by statute. This is the most strict form of the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" (one not applied, previously, in common law jurisdictions, where there was somewhat greater flexibility for a court of last resort to review its own precedent).\nThis situation changed, however, after the House of Lords issued the Practice Statement of 1966. The House of Lords decided to allow itself to adapt English law to meet changing social conditions. In \"R v G\" [2003] UKHL 50, the House of Lords overruled its 1981 decision in \"R v Caldwell\", which had allowed the Lords to establish mens rea (\"guilty mind\") by measuring a defendant's conduct against that of a \"reasonable person\", regardless of the defendant's actual state of mind.\nHowever, the Practice Statement was seldom applied by the House of Lords, usually only as a last resort. Up to 2005, the House of Lords rejected its past decisions no more than 20 times. They were reluctant to use it because they feared to introduce uncertainty into the law. In particular, the Practice Statement stated that the Lords would be especially reluctant to overrule themselves in criminal cases because of the importance of certainty of that law. The first case involving criminal law to be overruled with the Practice Statement was \"Anderton v Ryan\" (1985), which was overruled by \"R v Shivpuri\" (1986), two decades after the Practice Statement. Remarkably, the precedent overruled had been made only a year before, but it had been criticised by several academic lawyers. As a result, Lord Bridge stated he was \"undeterred by the consideration that the decision in \"Anderton v Ryan\" was so recent. The Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretension to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better.\" Still, the House of Lords has remained reluctant to overrule itself in some cases; in \"R v Kansal\" (2002), the majority of House members adopted the opinion that \"R v Lambert\" had been wrongly decided and agreed to depart from their earlier decision.\nDistinguishing precedent on legal (rather than fact) grounds.\nA precedent does not bind a court if it finds there was a lack of care in the original \"Per Incuriam\". For example, if a statutory provision or precedent had not been brought to the previous court's attention before its decision, the precedent would not be binding.\nBinding Obiter Dicta.\nAs of \"R v Barton and Booth\" according to the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court has the apparent ability to issue binding precedent through otherwise non-binding \"obiter dicta\". This may only occur when, in deciding another matter, the Supreme Court directs that otherwise binding precedent should no longer be followed and proposes new authority, albeit the proposal is \"obiter\". The existence of binding \"obiter\", the soundness of the proposition that the Supreme Court did so alter the rules of precedent, and the soundness of the proposition that the Supreme Court could so alter the rules of precedent without first addressing how and why it is doing so have all been subject to academic criticism.\nRules of statutory interpretation.\nOne of the most important roles of precedent is to resolve ambiguities in other legal texts, such as constitutions, statutes, and regulations. The process involves, first and foremost, consultation of the plain language of the text, as enlightened by the legislative history of enactment, subsequent precedent, and experience with various interpretations of similar texts.\nStatutory interpretation in the UK.\nA judge's normal aids include access to all previous cases in which a precedent has been set, and a good English dictionary.\nJudges and barristers in the UK use three primary rules for interpreting the law.\nUnder the literal rule, the judge should do what the actual legislation states rather than trying to do what the judge thinks that it means. The judge should use the plain everyday ordinary meaning of the words, even if this produces an unjust or undesirable outcome. A good example of problems with this method is \"R v Maginnis\" (1987), in which several judges in separate opinions found several different dictionary meanings of the word \"supply\". Another example is \"Fisher v Bell\", where it was held that a shopkeeper who placed an illegal item in a shop window with a price tag did not make an offer to sell it, because of the specific meaning of \"offer for sale\" in contract law, merely an invitation to treat. As a result of this case, Parliament amended the statute concerned to end this discrepancy.\nThe golden rule is used when use of the literal rule would obviously create an absurd result. There are two ways in which the golden rule can be applied: a narrow method, and a broad method. Under the narrow method, when there are apparently two contradictory meanings to the wording of a legislative provision, or the wording is ambiguous, the least absurd is to be preferred. Under the broad method, the court modifies the literal meaning in such a way as to avoid the absurd result. An example of the latter approach is \"Adler v George\" (1964). Under the Official Secrets Act 1920 it was an offence to obstruct HM Forces \"in the vicinity of\" a prohibited place. Adler argued that he was not in the \"vicinity\" of such a place but was actually \"in\" it. The court chose not to read the statutory wording in a literal sense to avoid what would otherwise be an absurd result, and Adler was convicted.\nThe mischief rule is the most flexible of the interpretation methods. Stemming from \"Heydon's Case\" (1584), it allows the court to enforce what the statute is intended to remedy rather than what the words actually say. For example, in \"Corkery v Carpenter\" (1950), a man was found guilty of being drunk in charge of a carriage, although in fact he only had a bicycle. The final rule; although will no longer be used after the UK fully transitions out of the European Union. Known as the Purposive approach- this considers the intention of the European Court of Justice when the act was passed.\nStatutory interpretation in the United States.\nIn the United States, the courts have stated consistently that the text of the statute is read as it is written, using the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute.\nHowever, most legal texts have some lingering ambiguity\u2014inevitably, situations arise in which the words chosen by the legislature do not address the precise facts in issue, or there is some tension among two or more statutes. In such cases, a court must analyze the various available sources, and reach a resolution of the ambiguity. The \"Canons of statutory construction\" are discussed in a separate article. Once the ambiguity is resolved, that resolution has binding effect as described in the rest of this article.\nPractical application.\nAlthough inferior courts are bound in theory by superior court precedent, in practice a judge may believe that justice requires an outcome at some variance with precedent, and may distinguish the facts of the individual case on reasoning that does not appear in the binding precedent. On appeal, the appellate court may either adopt the new reasoning, or reverse on the basis of precedent. On the other hand, if the losing party does not appeal (typically because of the cost of the appeal), the lower court decision may remain in effect, at least as to the individual parties.\nJudicial resistance.\nOccasionally, lower court judges may explicitly state a personal disagreement with the rendered judgment, but are required to rule a particular way because of binding precedent. Inferior courts cannot evade binding precedent of superior courts, but a court can depart from its own prior decisions.\nStructural considerations.\nIn the United States, \"stare decisis\" can interact in counterintuitive ways with the federal and state court systems. On an issue of federal law, a state court is not bound by an interpretation of federal law at the district or circuit level, but is bound by an interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. On an interpretation of state law, whether common law or statutory law, the federal courts are bound by the interpretation of a state court of last resort, and are required normally to defer to the precedent of intermediate state courts as well.\nCourts may choose to obey precedent of international jurisdictions, but this is not an application of the doctrine of \"stare decisis\", because foreign decisions are not binding. Rather, a foreign decision that is obeyed on the basis of the soundness of its reasoning will be called \"persuasive authority\"\u2014indicating that its effect is limited to the persuasiveness of the reasons it provides.\nOriginalism.\nOriginalism is an approach to interpretation of a legal text in which controlling weight is given to the intent of the original authors (at least the intent as inferred by a modern judge). In contrast, a non-originalist looks at other cues to meaning, including the current meaning of the words, the pattern and trend of other judicial decisions, changing context and improved scientific understanding, observation of practical outcomes and \"what works\", contemporary standards of justice, and \"stare decisis\". Both are directed at \"interpreting\" the text, not changing it\u2014interpretation is the process of resolving ambiguity and choosing from among possible meanings, not changing the text.\nThe two approaches look at different sets of underlying facts that may or may not point in the same direction\u2014\"stare decisis\" gives most weight to the newest understanding of a legal text, while originalism gives most weight to the oldest. While they do not necessarily reach different results in every case, the two approaches are in direct tension. Originalists such as Justice Antonin Scalia argue that \"\"Stare decisis\" is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the principle that only the legislature may make law.\" Justice Scalia argues that America is a civil law nation, not a common law nation. By principle, originalists are generally unwilling to defer to precedent when precedent seems to come into conflict with the originalist's own interpretation of the Constitutional text or inferences of original intent (even in situations where there is no original source statement of that original intent). However, there is still room within an originalist paradigm for \"stare decisis\"; whenever the plain meaning of the text has alternative constructions, past precedent is generally considered a valid guide, with the qualifier being that it cannot change what the text actually says.\nOriginalists vary in the degree to which they defer to precedent. In his confirmation hearings, Justice Clarence Thomas answered a question from Senator Strom Thurmond, qualifying his willingness to change precedent in this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think overruling a case or reconsidering a case is a very serious matter. Certainly, you would have to be of the view that a case is incorrectly decided, but I think even that is not adequate. There are some cases that you may not agree with that should not be overruled. Stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision-making, I think it is a very important and critical concept. A judge that wants to reconsider a case and certainly one who wants to overrule a case has the burden of demonstrating that not only is the case incorrect, but that it would be appropriate, in view of stare decisis, to make that additional step of overruling that case.\u2014\u200a\nPossibly he has changed his mind, or there are a very large body of cases which merit \"the additional step\" of ignoring the doctrine; according to Scalia, \"Clarence Thomas doesn't believe in stare decisis, period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say, let's get it right.\"\nCaleb Nelson, a former clerk for Justice Thomas and law professor at the University of Virginia, has elaborated on the role of \"stare decisis\" in originalist jurisprudence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;American courts of last resort recognize a rebuttable presumption against overruling their own past decisions. In earlier eras, people often suggested that this presumption did not apply if the past decision, in the view of the court's current members, was demonstrably erroneous. But when the Supreme Court makes similar noises today, it is roundly criticized. At least within the academy, conventional wisdom now maintains that a purported demonstration of error is not enough to justify overruling a past decision.\u00a0... [T]he conventional wisdom is wrong to suggest that any coherent doctrine of stare decisis must include a presumption against overruling precedent that the current court deems demonstrably erroneous. The doctrine of stare decisis would indeed be no doctrine at all if courts were free to overrule a past decision simply because they would have reached a different decision as an original matter. But when a court says that a past decision is demonstrably erroneous, it is saying not only that it would have reached a different decision as an original matter, but also that the prior court went beyond the range of indeterminacy created by the relevant source of law.\u00a0... Americans from the Founding on believed that court decisions could help \"liquidate\" or settle the meaning of ambiguous provisions of written law. Later courts generally were supposed to abide by such \"liquidations\".\u00a0... To the extent that the underlying legal provision was determinate, however, courts were not thought to be similarly bound by precedent that misinterpreted it.\u00a0... Of the Court's current members, Justices Scalia and Thomas seem to have the most faith in the determinacy of the legal texts that come before the Court. It should come as no surprise that they also seem the most willing to overrule the Court's past decisions.\u00a0... Prominent journalists and other commentators suggest that there is some contradiction between these Justices' mantra of \"judicial restraint\" and any systematic re-examination of precedent. But if one believes in the determinacy of the underlying legal texts, one need not define \"judicial restraint\" solely in terms of fidelity to precedent; one can also speak of fidelity to the texts themselves.\nCriticism of precedent.\nOne of the most prominent critics of the development of legal precedent on a case-by-case basis as both overly reactive and unfairly retroactive was philosopher Jeremy Bentham. He famously attacked the common law as \"dog law\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn a 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed overreliance by American lawyers on precedent \u2014 especially persuasive authority of marginal relevance \u2014 rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of legal costs during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive authority from outside their jurisdiction and force lawyers and parties to argue only from binding precedent, subject to two exceptions:\nThe disadvantages of \"stare decisis\" include its rigidity, the complexity of learning law, the fact that differences between certain cases may be very small and thereby appear illogical and arbitrary, and the slow growth or incremental changes to the law that are in need of major overhaul.\nAn argument often leveled against precedent is that it is undemocratic because it allows judges, who may or may not be elected, to make law.\nAgreement with precedent.\nA counter-argument (in favor of the advantages of \"stare decisis\") is that if the legislature wishes to alter the case law (other than constitutional interpretations) by statute, the legislature is empowered to do so. Critics sometimes accuse particular judges of applying the doctrine selectively, invoking it to support precedent that the judge supported anyway, but ignoring it in order to change precedent with which the judge disagreed.\nThere is much discussion about the virtue of using \"stare decisis\". Supporters of the system, such as minimalists, argue that obeying precedent makes decisions \"predictable\". For example, a business person can be reasonably assured of predicting a decision where the facts of his or her case are sufficiently similar to a case decided previously. This parallels the arguments against retroactive (ex post facto) laws banned by the U.S. Constitution .\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23005", "revid": "1152308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23005", "title": "Philip K. Dick", "text": "American science fiction author (1928\u20131982)\nPhilip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 \u2013 March 2, 1982) was an American science fiction short story writer and novelist. He wrote 45 novels and about 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines. His fiction explored varied philosophical and social questions such as the nature of reality, perception, human nature, and identity, and commonly featured characters struggling against alternate realities, illusory environments, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness. He is considered one of the most important figures in 20th-century science fiction.\nBorn in Chicago, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel \"The Man in the High Castle\" (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel, when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (1968) and \"Ubik\" (1969). His 1974 novel \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\" won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.\nFollowing years of drug use and a series of mystical experiences in 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality, as in the novels \"A Scanner Darkly\" (1977), \"VALIS\" (1981), and \"The Transmigration of Timothy Archer\" (1982). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as \"The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick\" (2011). He died in 1982 at the age of 53 due to complications of a stroke. Following his death, he became \"widely regarded as a master of imaginative, paranoid fiction in the vein of Franz Kafka and Thomas Pynchon\".\nDick's posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking. Popular films based on his works include \"Blade Runner\" (1982), \"Total Recall\" (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), \"Screamers\" (1995), \"Minority Report\" (2002), \"A Scanner Darkly\" (2006), \"The Adjustment Bureau\" (2011), and \"Radio Free Albemuth\" (2010). Beginning in 2015, Amazon Prime Video produced the multi-season television adaptation \"The Man in the High Castle\", based on Dick's 1962 novel; and in 2017 Channel 4 produced the anthology series \"Electric Dreams\", based on various Dick stories.\nIn 2005, \"Time\" magazine named \"Ubik\" (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923. In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer included in The Library of America series.\nEarly life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPhilip Kindred Dick and his twin sister, Jane Charlotte Dick, were born six weeks prematurely on December 16, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (n\u00e9e Kindred; 1900\u20131978) and Joseph Edgar Dick (1899\u20131985), who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture. His paternal grandparents were Irish. Jane's death on January 26, 1929, six weeks after their birth, profoundly affected Philip's life, leading to the recurrent motif of the \"phantom twin\" in his books.\nDick's family later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. When he was five, his father was transferred to Reno, Nevada, and when Dorothy refused to move, she and Joseph divorced. Both fought for custody of Philip, which was awarded to Dorothy. Determined to raise Philip alone, she took a job in Washington, D.C., and moved there with her son. Philip was enrolled at John Eaton Elementary School (1936\u20131938), completing the second through fourth grades. His lowest grade was a \"C\" in Written Composition, although a teacher said he \"shows interest and ability in story telling\". He was educated in Quaker schools. In June 1938, Dorothy and Philip returned to California, and it was around this time that he became interested in science fiction. Dick stated that he read his first science fiction magazine, \"Stirring Science Stories,\" in 1940.\nDick attended Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. He and fellow science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin were members of the class of 1947 but did not know each other at the time. He claimed to have hosted a classical music program on KSMO Radio in 1947. From 1948 to 1952, he worked at Art Music Company, a record store on Telegraph Avenue.\nHe attended the University of California, Berkeley, from September 1949 to November 11, 1949, ultimately receiving an honorable dismissal dated January 1, 1950. He did not declare a major and took classes in history, psychology, philosophy, and zoology. Dick dropped out because of ongoing anxiety problems, according to his third wife Anne's memoir. She also says he disliked the mandatory ROTC training. At Berkeley, he befriended poet Robert Duncan and poet and linguist Jack Spicer, who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language.\nThrough his studies in philosophy, he believed that existence is based on internal human perception, which does not necessarily correspond to external reality. He described himself as \"an acosmic panentheist\", which he explained as meaning that \"I don't believe that the universe exists. I believe that the only thing that exists is God and he is more than the universe. The universe is an extension of God into space and time. That's the premise I start from in my work, that so-called 'reality' is a mass delusion that we've all been required to believe for reasons totally obscure\". After reading the works of Plato and pondering the possibilities of metaphysical realms, he came to the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the world is not entirely real and there is no way to confirm whether it is truly there. That question was a theme in many of his novels.\nCareer.\nEarly writing.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDick sold his first story, \"Roog\"\u2014about \"a dog who imagined that the garbagemen who came every Friday morning were stealing valuable food which the family had carefully stored away in a safe metal container\"\u2014in 1951, when he was 22. From then on he wrote full-time. During 1952, his first speculative fiction publications appeared in July and September numbers of \"Planet Stories\", edited by Jack O'Sullivan, and in \"If\" and \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" (\"F&amp;SF\") that year. By 1953, \"F&amp;SF\" described Dick as \"one of the most prolific new professionals in the field\", joking that \"the editors of \"Whizzing Star Patrol\" and of the \"Quaint Quality Publication\" are in complete agreement upon Mr. Dick as a singularly satisfactory contributor\". His debut novel, \"Solar Lottery\", was published in 1955 as half of Ace Double #D-103 alongside \"The Big Jump\" by Leigh Brackett. The 1950s were a difficult and impoverished time for Dick, who once lamented, \"We couldn't even pay the late fees on a library book.\" He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre but dreamed of a career in mainstream fiction. During the 1950s, he produced a series of non-genre, relatively conventional novels.\nIn 1960, Dick wrote that he was willing to \"take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer\". The dream of mainstream success formally died in January 1963 when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency returned all of his unsold mainstream novels. Only one of them, \"Confessions of a Crap Artist\", was published during Dick's lifetime, in 1975 by Paul Williams' Entwhistle Books.\nIn 1963, Dick won the Hugo Award for \"The Man in the High Castle\". Although he was hailed as a genius in the science fiction world, the mainstream literary world was unappreciative, and he could publish books only through low-paying science fiction publishers such as Ace. He said in a 1977 interview that were it not for the interest of a French publishing company in the mid-1960s, which decided to publish all of his catalog to date, he would not have been able to continue as a writer. But even in his later years, he continued to have financial troubles. In the introduction to the 1980 short story collection, \"The Golden Man\", he wrote:\nFlight to Canada, mental health and suicide attempt.\nIn 1971, Dick's marriage to Nancy Hackett broke down, and she moved out of their house in Santa Venetia, California. He had abused amphetamine for much of the previous decade, stemming in part from his need to maintain a prolific writing regimen due to the financial exigencies of the science fiction field. He allowed other drug users to move into the house. Following the release of 21 novels between 1960 and 1970, these developments were exacerbated by unprecedented periods of writer's block, with Dick ultimately failing to publish new fiction until 1974.\nOne day, in November 1971, Dick returned to his home to discover it had been burglarized, with his safe blown open and personal papers missing. The police could not determine the culprit, and even suspected Dick of having done it himself. Shortly thereafter, he was invited to be the guest of honor at the Vancouver Science Fiction Convention in February 1972. Within a day of arriving at the conference and giving his speech, \"The Android and the Human\", he informed people that he had fallen in love with a woman named Janis whom he had met there and announced that he would be remaining in Vancouver. A conference attendee, Michael Walsh, movie critic for the local newspaper \"The Province\", invited Dick to stay in his home, but asked him to leave two weeks later due to his erratic behavior. Janis then ended their relationship and moved away. On March 23, 1972, Dick attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the sedative potassium bromide. Subsequently, after deciding to seek help, Dick became a participant in X-Kalay (a Canadian Synanon-type recovery program), and was well enough by April to return to California. In October 1972, Dick wrote a letter to the FBI about science fiction writer Thomas Disch. Dick said he had been approached by a covert Anti-American organization which attempted to recruit him. Dick said he recognized their ideology in a book Disch wrote.\nOn relocating to Orange County, California at the behest of California State University, Fullerton professor Willis McNelly (who initiated a correspondence with Dick during his X-Kalay stint), he donated manuscripts, papers and other materials to the university's Special Collections Library, where they are in the Philip K. Dick Science Fiction Collection in the Pollak Library. During this period, Dick befriended a circle of Fullerton State students that included several aspiring science fiction writers, including K. W. Jeter, James Blaylock and Tim Powers. Jeter would later continue Dick's Bladerunner series with three sequels.\nDick returned to the events of these months while writing his novel \"A Scanner Darkly\" (1977), which contains fictionalized depictions of the burglary of his home, his time using amphetamines and living with addicts, and his experiences of X-Kalay (portrayed in the novel as \"New-Path\"). A factual account of his recovery program participation was portrayed in his posthumously released book \"The Dark Haired Girl\", a collection of letters and journals from the period.\nParanormal experiences.\nOn February 20, 1974, while recovering from the effects of sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth, Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman. When he opened the door, he was struck by the dark-haired girl's beauty, and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. As she was leaving, she replied: \"This is a sign used by the early Christians.\" Dick called the symbol the \"vesicle pisces\". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile), which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.\nDick recounted that as the sun glinted off the gold pendant, the reflection caused the generation of a \"pink beam\" of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, he was startled by a separate recurrence of the pink beam, which imparted the information that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where the illness was confirmed by professional diagnosis.\nAfter the woman's departure, Dick began experiencing strange hallucinations. Although initially attributing them to side effects from medication, he considered this explanation implausible after weeks of continued hallucination. He told Charles Platt: \"I experienced an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind, as if I had been insane all my life and suddenly I had become sane.\"\nThroughout February and March 1974, Dick experienced a series of hallucinations which he referred to as \"2-3-74\", shorthand for February\u2013March 1974. Aside from the \"pink beam\", he described the initial hallucinations as geometric patterns, and, occasionally, brief pictures of Jesus and ancient Rome. As the hallucinations increased in duration and frequency, Dick claimed he began to live two parallel lives\u2014one as himself, \"Philip K. Dick\", and one as \"Thomas\", a Christian persecuted by Romans in the first century AD. He referred to the \"transcendentally rational mind\" as \"Zebra\", \"God\" and \"VALIS\" (an acronym for \"Vast Active Living Intelligence System\"). He wrote about the experiences, first in the semi-autobiographical novel \"Radio Free Albemuth\", then in \"VALIS\", \"The Divine Invasion\", \"The Transmigration of Timothy Archer\" and the unfinished \"The Owl in Daylight\" (the VALIS trilogy).\nIn 1974, Dick wrote a letter to the FBI, accusing various people, including University of California, San Diego professor Fredric Jameson, of being foreign agents of Warsaw Pact powers. He also wrote that Stanis\u0142aw Lem was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the Communist party to gain control over public opinion.\nAt one point, Dick felt he had been taken over by the spirit of the prophet Elijah. He believed that an episode in his novel \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\" was a detailed retelling of a biblical story from the Book of Acts, which he had never read. He documented and discussed his experiences and faith in a private journal he called his \"exegesis\", portions of which were later published as \"The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick\". The last novel he wrote was \"The Transmigration of Timothy Archer\"; it was published shortly after his death in 1982.\nPersonal life.\nDick was married five times:\nDick had three children, Laura Archer Dick (born February 25, 1960, to Dick and his third wife, Anne Williams Rubenstein), Isolde Freya Dick (now Isa Dick Hackett) (born March 15, 1967, to Dick and his fourth wife, Nancy Hackett), and Christopher Kenneth Dick (born July 25, 1973, to Dick and his fifth wife, Leslie \"Tessa\" Busby).\nIn 1955, Dick and his second wife, Kleo Apostolides, received a visit from the FBI, which they believed to be the result of Kleo's socialist views and left-wing activities.\nHe physically fought with Anne Williams Rubinstein, his third wife. Dick wrote to a friend that he and Anne had \"dreadful violent fights...slamming each other around, smashing every object in the house.\" In 1963, Dick told his neighbors that his wife was attempting to kill him and had her involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution for two weeks. After filing for divorce in 1964, Dick moved to Oakland to live with a fan, author and editor Grania Davis. Shortly after, he attempted suicide by driving off the road while she was a passenger.\nPolitics.\nEarly in life, Dick attended Communist Party USA meetings but later shifted more towards anti-communism and libertarianism as time passed. In an interview, Dick once described himself as a \"religious anarchist\". Dick generally tried to stay out of the political scene because of high societal turmoil from the Vietnam War. Still, he showed some anti-Vietnam War and anti-governmental sentiments. In 1968, he joined the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\", an anti-war pledge to pay no U.S. federal income tax, which resulted in the confiscation of his car by the IRS.\nDick was a critic of the U.S. federal government, regarding it to be just as \"bad as the Soviet Union\", and cheered on \"a great decentralization of the government\". Dick's politics occasionally influenced his literature. Dick's 1967 short story \"Faith of Our Fathers\" is critical of communism. Dick's 1968 novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" condemns the eugenics movement. In 1974, as a response to the \"Roe v. Wade\" decision, Dick published \"The Pre-persons\", a satirical anti-abortion and anti-Malthusianism short story. Following the story's publication, Dick stated that he received death threats from feminists.\nDeath.\nOn February\u00a017, 1982, after completing an interview, Dick contacted his therapist, complaining of failing eyesight, and was advised to go to a hospital immediately, but did not. The following day, he was found unconscious on the floor of his Santa Ana, California, home, having suffered a stroke. On February\u00a025, 1982, Dick suffered another stroke in the hospital, which led to brain death. Five days later, on March\u00a02, 1982, he was disconnected from life support.\nAfter his death, Dick's father, Joseph, took his son's ashes to Riverside Cemetery in Fort Morgan, Colorado (section\u00a0K, block\u00a01, lot\u00a056), where they were buried next to his twin sister Jane, who died in infancy. Her tombstone had been inscribed with both of their names at the time of her death, 53\u00a0years earlier. Philip died four months before the release of \"Blade Runner\", the film based on his novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\"\nStyle and works.\nThemes.\nDick's stories typically focus on the fragile nature of what is real and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies, as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion assembled by powerful external entities, such as the suspended animation in \"Ubik\", vast political conspiracies or the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. \"All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality\", writes science fiction author Charles Platt. \"Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.\"\nAlternate universes and simulacra are common plot devices, with fictional worlds inhabited by common, working people, rather than galactic elites. \"There are no heroes in Dick's books\", Ursula K. Le Guin wrote, \"but there are heroics. One is reminded of Dickens: what counts is the honesty, constancy, kindness and patience of ordinary people.\" Dick made no secret that much of his thinking and work was heavily influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. The Jungian constructs and models that most concerned Dick seem to be the archetypes of the collective unconscious, group projection/hallucination, synchronicities, and personality theory. Many of Dick's protagonists overtly analyze reality and their perceptions in Jungian terms (see \"Lies, Inc.\").\nDick identified one major theme of his work as the question, \"What constitutes the authentic human being?\" In works such as \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", beings can appear totally human in every respect while lacking soul or compassion, while completely alien beings such as Glimmung in \"Galactic Pot-Healer\" may be more humane and complex than their human peers. Understood correctly, said Dick, the term \"human being\" applies \"not to origin or to any ontology but to a way of being in the world.\" This authentic way of being manifests itself in compassion that recognizes the oneness of all life. \"In Dick's vision, the moral imperative calls on us to care for all sentient beings, human or nonhuman, natural or artificial, regardless of their place in the order of things. And Dick makes clear that this imperative is grounded in empathy, not reason, whatever subsequent role reason may play.\" The figure of the android depicts those who are deficient in empathy, who are alienated from others and are becoming more mechanical (emotionless) in their behaviour. \"In general, then, it can be said that for Dick robots represent machines that are becoming more like humans, while androids represent humans that are becoming more like machines.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Dick's third major theme is his fascination with war and his fear and hatred of it. One hardly sees critical mention of it, yet it is as integral to his body of work as oxygen is to water.\n\u2014Steven Owen Godersky\nMental illness was a constant interest of Dick's, and themes of mental illness permeate his work. The character Jack Bohlen in the 1964 novel \"Martian Time-Slip\" is an \"ex-schizophrenic\". The novel \"Clans of the Alphane Moon\" centers on an entire society made up of descendants of lunatic asylum inmates. In 1965, he wrote the essay titled \"Schizophrenia and the Book of Changes\".\nDrug use (including religious, recreational, and abuse) was also a theme in many of Dick's works, such as \"A Scanner Darkly\" and \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\". Dick himself was a drug user for much of his life. According to a 1975 interview in \"Rolling Stone\", Dick wrote all of his books published before 1970 while on amphetamines. \"\"A Scanner Darkly\" (1977) was the first complete novel I had written without speed\", said Dick in the interview. He also experimented briefly with psychedelics, but wrote \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" (1965), which \"Rolling Stone\" dubs \"the classic LSD novel of all time\", before he had ever tried them. Despite his heavy amphetamine use, however, Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him, that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain.\nSumming up all these themes in \"Understanding Philip K. Dick\", Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or \"ideas and motifs\": Epistemology and the Nature of Reality, Know Thyself, The Android and the Human, Entropy and Pot Healing, The Theodicy Problem, Warfare and Power Politics, The Evolved Human, and \"Technology, Media, Drugs and Madness\".\nPen names.\nDick had two professional stories published under the pen names Richard Phillipps and Jack Dowland. \"Some Kinds of Life\" was published in October 1953 in \"Fantastic Universe\" under byline Richard Phillipps, apparently because the magazine had a policy against publishing multiple stories by the same author in the same issue; \"Planet for Transients\" was published in the same issue under his own name.\nThe short story \"Orpheus with Clay Feet\" was published under the pen name Jack Dowland. The protagonist desires to be the muse for fictional author Jack Dowland, considered the greatest science fiction author of the 20th century. In the story, Dowland publishes a short story titled \"Orpheus with Clay Feet\" under the pen name Philip K. Dick.\nThe surname Dowland refers to Renaissance composer John Dowland, who is featured in several works. The title \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\" directly refers to Dowland's best-known composition, \"Flow, my tears\". In the novel \"The Divine Invasion\", the character Linda Fox, created specifically with Linda Ronstadt in mind, is an intergalactically famous singer whose entire body of work consists of recordings of John Dowland compositions.\nSelected works.\n\"The Man in the High Castle\" (1962) is set in an alternative history in which the United States is ruled by the victorious Axis powers. It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award. In 2015 this was adapted into a television series by Amazon Studios.\n\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" (1965) utilizes an array of science fiction concepts and features several layers of reality and unreality. It is also one of Dick's first works to explore religious themes. The novel takes place in the 21st century, when, under UN authority, mankind has colonized the Solar System's every habitable planet and moon. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies. Most entertain themselves using \"Perky Pat\" dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth-based \"P.P. Layouts\". The company also secretly creates \"Can-D\", an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to \"translate\" into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat's boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.\n\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (1968) is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population. It occurs on a dying, poisoned Earth de-populated of almost all animals and all \"successful\" humans; the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off-world. The 1968 novel is the literary source of the film \"Blade Runner\" (1982). It is both a conflation and an intensification of the pivotally Dickian question: \"What is real, what is fake? What crucial factor defines humanity as distinctly 'alive', versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance?\"\n\"Ubik\" (1969) employs extensive psychic telepathy and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality. A group of psychics is sent to investigate a rival organisation, but several of them are apparently killed by a saboteur's bomb. Much of the following novel flicks between different equally plausible realities and the \"real\" reality, a state of half-life and psychically manipulated realities. In 2005, \"Time\" magazine listed it among the \"All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels\" published since 1923.\n\"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\" (1974) concerns Jason Taverner, a television star living in a dystopian near-future police state. After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in a dingy Los Angeles hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet, but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience, as security checkpoints (staffed by \"pols\" and \"nats\", the police and National Guard) are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID. Jason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his innate charm and social graces to help him as he tries to find out what happened to his past while avoiding the attention of the pols. The novel was Dick's first published novel after years of silence, during which time his critical reputation had grown, and this novel was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. It is the only Philip K. Dick novel nominated for both a Hugo and a Nebula Award.\nIn an essay written two years before his death, Dick described how he learned from his Episcopal priest that an important scene in \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\" \u2013 involving its other main character, the eponymous Police General Felix Buckman, was very similar to a scene in \"Acts of the Apostles\", a book of the New Testament. Film director Richard Linklater discusses this novel in his film \"Waking Life\", which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, \"Time Out of Joint\".\n\"A Scanner Darkly\" (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and police procedural novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to Substance D, the same permanently mind-altering drug he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater.\n\"The Philip K. Dick Reader\" is an introduction to the variety of Dick's short fiction.\n\"VALIS\" (1980) is perhaps Dick's most postmodern and autobiographical novel, examining his own unexplained experiences. It may also be his most academically studied work, and was adapted as an opera by Tod Machover. Later works like the VALIS trilogy were heavily autobiographical, many with \"two-three-seventy-four\" (2-3-74) references and influences. The word VALIS is the acronym for \"Vast Active Living Intelligence System\". Later, Dick theorized that VALIS was both a \"reality generator\" and a means of extraterrestrial communication. A fourth VALIS manuscript, \"Radio Free Albemuth\", although composed in 1976, was posthumously published in 1985. This work is described by the publisher (Arbor House) as \"an introduction and key to his magnificent VALIS trilogy\".\nRegardless of the feeling that he was somehow experiencing a divine communication, Dick was never fully able to rationalize the events. For the rest of his life, he struggled to comprehend what was occurring, questioning his own sanity and perception of reality. He transcribed what thoughts he could into an eight-thousand-page, one-million-word journal dubbed the \"Exegesis\". From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick spent many nights writing in this journal. A recurring theme in \"Exegesis\" is Dick's hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century AD, and that \"the Empire never ended\". He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism and despotism, which, after forcing the Gnostics underground, had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had communicated with him, and anonymously others, to induce the impeachment of U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor of Rome incarnate.\nIn a 1968 essay titled \"Self Portrait\", collected in the 1995 book \"The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick\", Dick reflects on his work and lists which books he feels \"might escape World War Three\": \"Eye in the Sky\", \"The Man in the High Castle\", \"Martian Time-Slip\", \"Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb\", \"The Zap Gun\", \"The Penultimate Truth\", \"The Simulacra\", \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" (which he refers to as \"the most vital of them all\"), \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", and \"Ubik\". In a 1976 interview, Dick cited \"A Scanner Darkly\" as his best work, feeling that he \"had finally written a true masterpiece, after 25 years of writing\".\nAdaptations.\nFilms.\nSeveral of Dick's stories have been made into films. Dick himself wrote a screenplay for an intended film adaptation of \"Ubik\" in 1974, but the film was never made. Many film adaptations have not used Dick's original titles. When asked why this was, Dick's ex-wife Tessa said, \"Actually, the books rarely carry Phil's original titles, as the editors usually wrote new titles after reading his manuscripts. Phil often commented that he couldn't write good titles. If he could, he would have been an advertising writer instead of a novelist.\" Films based on Dick's writing had accumulated a total revenue of over US$1\u00a0billion by 2009.\nFuture films based on Dick's writing include a film adaptation of \"Ubik\" which, according to Dick's daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, is in advanced negotiation. Ubik was set to be made into a film by Michel Gondry. In 2014, however, Gondry told French outlet Telerama (via Jeux Actu), that he was no longer working on the project. In November 2021, it was announced that Francis Lawrence will direct a film adaptation of \"Vulcan's Hammer\", with Lawrence's about:blank production company, alongside New Republic Pictures and Electric Shepherd Productions, producing.\nAn animated adaptation of \"The King of the Elves\" from Walt Disney Animation Studios was in production and was set to be released in the spring of 2016 but it was cancelled following multiple creative problems.\nThe \"Terminator\" series prominently features the theme of humanoid assassination machines first portrayed in \"Second Variety\". The Halcyon Company, known for developing the \"Terminator\" franchise, acquired right of first refusal to film adaptations of the works of Philip K. Dick in 2007. In May 2009, they announced plans for an adaptation of \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\".\nTelevision.\nIt was reported in 2010 that Ridley Scott would produce an adaptation of \"The Man in the High Castle\" for the BBC, in the form of a miniseries. A pilot episode was released on Amazon Prime Video in January 2015 and season 1 was fully released in ten episodes of about 60 minutes each on November 20, 2015. Premiering in January 2015, the pilot was Amazon's \"most-watched since the original series development program began.\" The next month Amazon ordered episodes to fill out a ten-episode season, which was released in November, to positive reviews. A second season of ten episodes premiered in December 2016, and a third season was released on October 5, 2018. The fourth and final season premiered on November 15, 2019.\nIn late 2015, Fox aired \"Minority Report\", a television series sequel adaptation to the 2002 film of the same name based on Dick's short story \"The Minority Report\" (1956). The show was cancelled after one 10-episode season.\nIn May 2016, it was announced that a 10-part anthology series was in the works. Titled \"Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams\", the series was distributed by Sony Pictures Television and premiered on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and Amazon Prime Video in the United States. It was written by executive producers Ronald D. Moore and Michael Dinner, with executive input from Dick's daughter Isa Dick Hackett, and stars Bryan Cranston, also an executive producer.\nStage and radio.\nFour of Dick's works have been adapted for the stage.\nOne was the opera \"VALIS\", composed and with libretto by Tod Machover, which premiered at the Pompidou Center in Paris on December 1, 1987, with a French libretto. It was subsequently revised and readapted into English, and was recorded and released on CD (Bridge Records BCD9007) in 1988.\nAnother was \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\", adapted by Linda Hartinian and produced by the New York-based avant-garde company Mabou Mines. It premiered in Boston at the Boston Shakespeare Theatre (June 18\u201330, 1985) and was subsequently staged in New York and Chicago. Productions of \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\" were also staged by the Evidence Room in Los Angeles in 1999 and by the Fifth Column Theatre Company at the Oval House Theatre in London in the same year.\nA play based on \"Radio Free Albemuth\" also had a brief run in the 1980s.\nIn November 2010, a production of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", adapted by Edward Einhorn, premiered at the 3LD Art and Technology Center in Manhattan.\nA radio drama adaptation of Dick's short story \"Mr. Spaceship\" was aired by the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yleisradio) in 1996 under the name \"Menolippu Paratiisiin\". Radio dramatizations of Dick's short stories \"Colony\" and \"The Defenders\" were aired by NBC in 1956 as part of the series \"X Minus One\".\nIn January 2006, a theatre adaptation of \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" (English for ) premiered in Stary Teatr in Krak\u00f3w, with an extensive use of lights and laser choreography.\nIn June 2014, the BBC broadcast a two-part adaptation of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" on BBC Radio 4, starring James Purefoy as Rick Deckard.\nComics.\nMarvel Comics adapted Dick's short story \"The Electric Ant\" as a limited series which was released in 2009. The comic was produced by writer David Mack (\"Daredevil\") and artist Pascal Alixe (\"Ultimate X-Men\"), with covers provided by artist Paul Pope. \"The Electric Ant\" had earlier been loosely adapted by Frank Miller and Geof Darrow in their 3-issue mini-series \"Hard Boiled\" published by Dark Horse Comics in 1990\u20131992.\nIn 2009, BOOM! Studios started publishing a 24-issue miniseries comic book adaptation of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" \"Blade Runner\", the 1982 film adapted from \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", had previously been adapted to comics as \"\".\nIn 2011, Dynamite Entertainment published a four-issue miniseries \"Total Recall\", a sequel to the 1990 film \"Total Recall\", inspired by Philip K. Dick's short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\". In 1990, DC Comics published the official adaptation of the original film as a \"DC Movie Special: Total Recall\".\nAlternative formats.\nIn response to a 1975 request from the National Library for the Blind for permission to make use of \"The Man in the High Castle\", Dick responded, \"I also grant you a general permission to transcribe any of my former, present or future work, so indeed you can add my name to your 'general permission' list.\" Some of his books and stories are available in braille and other specialized formats through the NLS.\nAs of December 2012, thirteen of Philip K. Dick's early works in the public domain in the United States are available in ebook form from Project Gutenberg. As of December 2019, Wikisource has three of Philip K. Dick's early works in the public domain in the United States available in ebook form which is not from Project Gutenberg.\nInfluence and legacy.\nLawrence Sutin wrote a 1989 biography of Dick, titled \"Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick\".\nIn 1993, French writer Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re published \"\" (), which the author describes in his preface in this way:The book you hold in your hands is a very peculiar book. I have tried to depict the life of Philip K. Dick from the inside, in other words, with the same freedom and empathy \u2013 indeed with the same truth \u2013 with which he depicted his own characters. The book omits fact checking, sourcing, notes and index. It can be considered a non-fiction novel about his life.\nDick has influenced many writers, including Jonathan Lethem and Ursula K. Le Guin. The prominent literary critic Fredric Jameson proclaimed Dick the \"Shakespeare of Science Fiction\", and praised his work as \"one of the most powerful expressions of the society of spectacle and pseudo-event\". The author Roberto Bola\u00f1o also praised Dick, describing him as \"Thoreau plus the death of the American dream\". Dick has also influenced filmmakers, his work being compared to films such as the Wachowskis' \"The Matrix\", David Cronenberg's \"Videodrome\", \"eXistenZ\", and \"Spider\", Spike Jonze's \"Being John Malkovich\", \"Adaptation\", Michel Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", Alex Proyas's \"Dark City\", Peter Weir's \"The Truman Show\", Andrew Niccol's \"Gattaca\", \"In Time\", Terry Gilliam's \"12 Monkeys\", Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's \"Open Your Eyes\", David Fincher's \"Fight Club\", Cameron Crowe's \"Vanilla Sky\", Darren Aronofsky's \"Pi\", Richard Kelly's \"Donnie Darko\" and \"Southland Tales\", Rian Johnson's \"Looper\", Duncan Jones' \"Source Code\", Christopher Nolan's \"Memento\" and \"Inception,\" and Owen Dennis' \"Infinity Train\".\nThe Philip K. Dick Society was an organization dedicated to promoting the literary works of Dick and was led by Dick's longtime friend and music journalist Paul Williams. Williams also served as Dick's literary executor for several years after Dick's death and wrote one of the first biographies of Dick, entitled \"\".\nThe Philip K. Dick estate owns and operates the production company Electric Shepherd Productions, which has produced the film \"The Adjustment Bureau\" (2011), the TV series \"The Man in the High Castle\" and also a Marvel Comics 5-issue adaptation of \"Electric Ant\".\nDick was recreated by his fans in the form of a simulacrum or remote-controlled android designed in his likeness. Such simulacra had been themes of many of Dick's works. The Philip K. Dick simulacrum was included on a discussion panel in a San Diego Comic Con presentation about the film adaptation of the novel, \"A Scanner Darkly\". In February 2006, an America West Airlines employee misplaced the android's head, and it has not yet been found. In January 2011, it was announced that Hanson Robotics had built a replacement.\nContemporary philosophy.\nPostmodernists such as Jean Baudrillard and Laurence Rickels have commented on Dick's writing's foreshadowing of postmodernity. Jean Baudrillard offers this interpretation:\n\"It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move 'through the mirror' to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.\"\nDick's anti-government skepticism was referred to in \"Mythmakers and Lawbreakers\", a collection of interviews about fiction by anarchist authors. Noting his early authorship of \"The Last of the Masters\", an anarchist-themed novelette, author Margaret Killjoy expressed that while Dick never fully sided with anarchism, his opposition to government centralization and organized religion has influenced anarchist interpretations of gnosticism.\nAwards and honors.\nThe Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Dick in 2005.\nDuring his lifetime he received numerous annual literary awards and nominations for particular works.\nPhilip K. Dick Award.\nThe Philip K. Dick Award is a science fiction award that annually recognizes the previous year's best SF paperback original published in the U.S. It is conferred at Norwescon, sponsored by the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society, and since 2005 supported by the Philip K. Dick Trust. Winning works are identified on their covers as \"Best Original SF Paperback\". It is currently administered by, John Silbersack, and Gordon Van Gelder.\nThe award was inaugurated in 1983, the year after Dick's death. It was founded by Thomas Disch with assistance from David G. Hartwell, Paul S. Williams, and Charles N. Brown. Past administrators include Algis J. Budrys.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cruz remembers \"playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them. I would think of a character and pretend to be someone else.\"\nInitially, Cruz focused on dance: she studied classical ballet for nine years at Spain's National Conservatory. She took three years of Spanish ballet training and four years of theatre at Cristina Rota's school. She said that ballet instilled discipline that proved important in her acting career. When she became a cinephile at ten or eleven, her father bought a Betamax machine, which was then quite rare in her neighborhood.\nAs a teenager, Cruz became interested in acting after seeing the film \"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!\" (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected several times because the agent felt that she was too young. Cruz commented on the experience, \"I was very extroverted as a kid... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years.\" In 1989, at the age of fifteen, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency at which more than 300 other girls had applied. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, \"She was absolutely magic [at the audition]. It was obvious there was something ... impressive about this kid... She was ... green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within.\"\nHer father, Eduardo, died at his home in Spain in 2015, aged sixty two, from a heart attack.\nCareer.\n1989\u20131997: Early work.\nIn 1989, 15-year-old Cruz made her acting debut in a music video for the Spanish pop group Mecano's song \"La Fuerza del Destino\". Between 1990 and 1991, she hosted the Spanish TV channel Telecinco's talk show \"La Quinta Marcha\", a programme that was hosted by teenagers, aimed at a teenage audience. She also played in the \"Elle et lui\" episode of an erotic French TV series called \"S\u00e9rie rose\" in 1991, where she appeared nude. In 1991, Cruz made her feature film debut as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film \"Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n\". In the film, she portrayed Silvia, a young woman who is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem's character to seduce her. \"People\" magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became \"a major sex symbol\". In an interview with the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" in 1999, Cruz commented that \"it was a great part, but...I wasn't really ready for the nudity. [...] But I have no regrets because I wanted to start working and it changed my life.\" Charlie Rose of \"60 Minutes\" noted that Cruz \"became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent\". When Rose asked Cruz if she was concerned about how she would be perceived after her role in the film, Cruz replied, \"I just knew I had to do the complete opposite.\" \"Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n\" received favorable reviews, with Chris Hicks of the \"Deseret News\" describing Cruz's portrayal of Silvia as \"enchanting\". Writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", film critic Roger Ebert wrote \"it stars actors of considerable physical appeal, most particularly Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Silvia\". For her performance, Cruz was nominated for a Spanish Actors Union Newcomer Award and a Goya Award for Best Actress. The same year she appeared in the Academy Award-winning \"Belle \u00c9poque\" as the virginal Luz. \"People\" magazine noted that Cruz's role as Luz showed that she was versatile.\nFrom 1993 to 1996, Cruz appeared in ten Spanish and Italian films. At 20, she went to live in New York for two years at Christopher and Greenwich to study ballet and English between films. She recalls learning English \"kind of late\", previously knowing only the dialogue she had learned for the casting and the phrases \"How are you?\" and \"Thank you\".\nIn 1997, Cruz appeared in the Spanish comedy film \"Love Can Seriously Damage Your Health\". She portrays Diana, a fan of the Beatles band member John Lennon; she tries unsuccessfully to meet him. Years later, after many failed relationships, Diana re-unites with an acquaintance under unusual circumstances. That same year, she appeared in the opening scene of Pedro Almod\u00f3var's \"Live Flesh\" as a prostitute who gives birth on a bus and in \"Et hj\u00f8rne af paradis\" (A Corner of Paradise) as Do\u00f1a Helena. Cruz's final appearance in 1997 was the Amenabar-directed Spanish sci-fi drama, \"Abre Los Ojos\"/ \"Open Your Eyes\". She plays Sofia, the love interest of Eduardo Noriega's lead character. \"Open Your Eyes\" received positive reviews, and was later remade by U.S. director Cameron Crowe as \"Vanilla Sky\" (who cast Cruz in the same role and Tom Cruise in Noriega's role), but \"Open Your Eyes\" was not commercially successful. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal commented in his September 2002 review that Cruz \"has been getting some really bad reviews for her recent American work, but I personally think that she's a more than decent actress, especially here, where she's charming, moving and always believable. [...] There's one shot in particular, where Cruz enters a room in a greenish glow, which is right out of Hitchcock's picture [\"Vertigo\"].\"\n1998\u20132000: Early American film roles.\nIn 1998, Cruz appeared in her first American film as Billy Crudup's consolation-prize Mexican girlfriend in Stephen Frears' western film \"The Hi-Lo Country\". Cruz stated that she had difficulties understanding people speaking English while she was filming \"The Hi-Lo Country\". The film was critically and commercially unsuccessful. Kevin Lally of the \"Film Journal International\" commented in his review for the film that \"in an ironic casting twist, the Spanish actress Pen\u00e9lope Cruz [...] is much more appealing as Josepha [than in her previous roles]\". For her performance in the film, she was nominated for an ALMA Award for Best Actress.\nAlso in 1998, Cruz appeared in \"Don Juan\" and the Spanish period drama \"The Girl of Your Dreams\". In \"The Girl of Your Dreams\" (La ni\u00f1a de tus ojos), Cruz portrayed Macarena Granada, a singer who is in an on-and-off relationship with Antonio Resines's character Blas. They are part of a Francoist film troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz's performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of \"Variety\" magazine writing \"if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first and a pretty face second, then here it is\". A writer for \"Film4\" commented that \"Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film\" but noted that overall the film \"looks great\". Cruz's role as Macarena has been viewed as her \"largest role to date\". For her performance, Cruz received a Goya Award and Spanish Actors' Union Award, and was nominated for a European Film Award. In 1999, Cruz worked with Almod\u00f3var again in \"All About My Mother\", playing Sister Mar\u00eda Rosa Sanz, a pregnant nun with AIDS. The film received favorable reviews, and was commercially successful, grossing over $67\u00a0million worldwide, although it performed better at the box office internationally than domestically.\nIn 2000, she appeared in \"Woman on Top\" in the lead female role as Isabelle, a world-class chef who suffered from motion sickness since birth, her first American lead role. Lisa Nesselson of \"Variety\" magazine praised the performances of both Cruz and her co-star, Harold Perrineau, saying they \"burst off the screen\", and added that Cruz has a charming accent. BBC News film critic Jane Crowther said that \"Cruz is wonderfully ditzy as the innocent abroad\" but remarked that \"it's Harold Perrineau Jr as Monica who pockets the movie\". Annlee Ellingson of \"Box Office\" magazine wrote \"Cruz is stunning in the role\u2014innocent and vulnerable yet possessing a mature grace and determined strength, all while sizzling with unchecked sensuality.\" Also in 2000, she played Alejandra Villarreal, who is Matt Damon's love interest in Billy Bob Thornton's film adaptation of the western bestselling novel \"All the Pretty Horses\". Susan Stark of \"The Detroit News\" commented that in the film Thornton was able to guide Damon, Henry Thomas and Cruz to \"their most impressive performances in a major movie yet\". However, Bob Longigo of \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution \" was less enthusiastic about Cruz's and Damon's performance, saying that their \"resulting onscreen chemistry would hardly warm a can of beans\".\n2001\u20132005: Breakthrough.\n2001 marked a turning point year when Cruz starred in the feature films \"Vanilla Sky\" and \"Blow\". In \"Vanilla Sky\", Cameron Crowe's interpretation of \"Open Your Eyes\", she played Sofia Serrano, the love interest of Tom Cruise's character. The film received mixed reviews, but made $200\u00a0million worldwide. Her performance was well received by critics, with BBC film critic Brandon Graydon saying that Cruz \"is an enchanting screen presence\", and Ethan Alter of the \"Film Journal International\" noting that Cruz and her co-star Cruise were \"able to generate some actual chemistry\". Her next film was \"Blow\", adapted from Bruce Porter's 1993 book \"Blow: How a Small Town Boy Made $100\u00a0million with the Medell\u00edn Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All\". She had a supporting role as Mirtha Jung, the wife of Johnny Depp's character. The film received mixed reviews, but made $80\u00a0million worldwide. Nina Willdorf of the \"Boston Phoenix\" described Cruz as \"multi-talented\" and Mark Salvo of \"The Austin Chronicle\" wrote \"I may be one of the last male holdouts to join the Cruz-Rules camp, but her tour de force performance here sucks you right in.\"\nIn 2001, she also appeared in \"Don't Tempt Me\", playing Carmen Ramos. The film received negative reviews. Jeff Vice of the \"Deseret News\" commented that \"unfortunately, casting Cruz as a tough girl is a hilariously bad [idea]\" and Michael Miller of the \"Village Voice\" writing that \"as Satan's helper Carmen, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz doesn't hold a candle to her cocaine-huffing enabler in \"Blow\"\". Cruz's last film in 2001 was \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\", film adaption of the novel of the same name. She played Pelagia, who falls in love with another man while her fianc\u00e9 is in battle during the Second World War. \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\" was not well received by critics, but made $62\u00a0million worldwide. In 2002, she had a minor role in \"Waking Up in Reno\". It had negative reviews and was a box office failure. The following year, Cruz had a supporting role in the horror film \"Gothika\" as Chloe Sava, a patient at a mental hospital. David Rooney of \"Variety\" wrote that Cruz \"adds a serviceably malevolent edge to Chloe's apparent madness\". Cruz's performance in \"Fanfan la Tulipe\", also in 2003, was not well received, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" commenting that Cruz \"deserves a special Cannes Razzie for a performance of purest teak\".\nIn 2004, Cruz appeared in the Christmas film \"Noel\" as Nina, the girlfriend of Paul Walker's character and as Mia in the 1930s set romantic drama \"Head in the Clouds\", set in the 1930s. \nBruce Birkland of \"Jam! Canoe\" wrote, \"The story feels forced and the performances dreary, with the notable exception of Cruz, who seems to be in a different film from the rest of the cast.\" Desson Thompson of \"The Washington Post\" was more critical; his comment about the character's \"pronounced limp\" was that \"Cruz (hardly the world's greatest actress) can't even perform without looking fake\". The film performed poorly at the box office. She also starred in Sergio Castellitto's melodrama \"Don't Move\", competing with Sabrina Impacciatore for the leading role Cruz, who learned Italian for the role, won the David di Donatello for her performance. She also won the European Film Award for Best Actress for the film in 2004.\nIn 2005, Cruz appeared as Dr. Eva Rojas in the action adventure \"Sahara\". She earned $1.6\u00a0million for her supporting role. The film grossed $110\u00a0million worldwide but did not recoup its $160\u00a0million budget. Moviefone dubbed the film \"one of the most famous flops in history\" and in 2007, listed it at 24 on its list of \"Biggest Box-Office Turkeys of All Time\". Lori Hoffman of the \"Atlantic City Weekly\" felt Cruz put her \"considerable [acting] skills on cruise control as Dr Eva Rojas\" and James Berardnelli of ReelViews described Cruz's performance as a \"black hole\", that she \"lacks screen presence\". Also in 2005, Cruz appeared in \"Chromophobia\", screened at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival and released the following year. Mathew Turner of \"View London\" said Cruz's character Gloria, a cancer-riddled prostitute, is \"actually more interesting than the main storyline\" while Time Evan's of \"Sky Movies\" wrote, \"The Cruz/Ifans storyline\u2014featuring the only two remotely sympathetic characters\u2014never really fuses with the main plot.\" Her final 2005 film was \"Don't Move\" playing Italia. Eric Harrison of the \"Houston Chronicle\" noted that Cruz \"goes all out\" with her appearance and Patrick Peters of \"Empire\" magazine commented that the film's director, who also appears in the film, was able to draw a \"sensitive performance\" from Cruz.\n2006\u20132009: Worldwide recognition.\nCruz appeared alongside her good friend Salma Hayek in the 2006 Western comedy film \"Bandidas\". Randy Cordova of \"The Arizona Republic\" said the film \"sports\" Cruz and her co-star Salma Hayek as the \"lusty dream team\" and that they were the \"marketing fantasy\" for the film. Also in 2006, Cruz received favourable reviews for her performance as Raimunda, a working-class woman forced to go to great lengths to protect her 14-year-old daughter Paula, in Pedro Almod\u00f3var's \"Volver\". A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" remarked, \"With this role Ms. Cruz inscribes her name near the top of any credible list of present-day flesh-and-blood screen goddesses, in no small part because she manages to be earthy, unpretentious and a little vulgar without shedding an ounce of her natural glamour.\" Likewise, Carina Chocano of \"The Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Cruz, who has remarked that in Hollywood she's rarely allowed to be anything more than pretty, instills her with an awesome resoluteness and strength of character.\" She shared a Best Actress award at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival with five of her co-stars, as well as receiving a Goya Award and European Film Award, and was nominated for the Golden Globe, the Screen Actors Guild Award, the BAFTA Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a leading role. With this nomination, Cruz became the first Spanish actress ever nominated for an Academy Award.\nIn 2007, Cruz appeared in the lead female role in \"Manolete\", a biopic of bullfighter Manuel Laureano Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez, playing Anto\u00f1ita \"Lupe\" Sino. The film was critically panned, and \"Variety\" felt that Cruz has \"clearly been cast to play the kind of red-hot drama queen she's pulled off infinitely better in the films of Pedro Almodovar\". After being shelved since 2007, \"Manolete\" (originally shot in 2005) released on demand via cable, satellite, telco and online on 7 June 2011 under the title \"A Matador's Mistress\". She also appeared in \"The Good Night\", playing two characters, Anna and Melody. TV Guide film critic Maitland McDonagh noted that in the film Cruz \"expertly mines the contrast between chic, compliant, white-clad Anna and funky, street-wise Melody, who treats [Martin Freeman's character] Gary like the world-class drag he is\".\nIn 2008, Cruz starred alongside Ben Kingsley in Isabel Coixet's film \"Elegy\", which was based on the Philip Roth story \"The Dying Animal\", as the lead female role, Consuela Castillo. Ray Bennett of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described Cruz's performance as being \"outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy [film]\". That same year, Cruz appeared in Woody Allen's \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\" as Mar\u00eda Elena, a mentally unstable woman, which was received with critical acclaim. Writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle noted, \"But the revelation is Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, who has never been better in an American film. Suddenly, and for the first time, her stardom makes sense. As Maria Elena, Jos\u00e9 Antonio's gifted and neurotic ex-wife, Cruz is on fire \u2013 hysterically funny, abandoned, passionate, poignant, with a performance full of shading and wide in range. She's as fun and as powerful as Anna Magnani, and beautiful besides. Cruz just needed somebody to turn her loose.\" Likewise, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" singled her out for praise, writing: \"Cruz, playing Maria Elena, the passionate and crazy ex-wife of a moody Picasso-ish artist, looks as if she has wandered in from a more hefty film entirely; everything she does and says seems to mean more, count for more. This isn't to say that she gets bigger laughs, or perhaps any laughs, but she certainly walks off with the film\". Cruz received a Goya Award and her first Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also received a Golden Globe and SAG nomination. With her Oscar win, Cruz became the first, and to date only, Spanish actress to ever be awarded an Academy Award, as well as the sixth Hispanic performer to have received the award.\nCruz's next film was the kid-friendly \"G-Force\", voicing a guinea pig spy named Juarez. \"G-Force\" was a commercial success, making over $290\u00a0million worldwide. Also in 2009, she appeared in the film \"Broken Embraces\" as Lena. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com noted in her review for the film that Cruz \"doesn't coast on her beauty in \"Broken Embraces\", and she has the kind of role that can be difficult to flesh out\". Cruz received nominations from the Satellite Awards and European Film Awards for her performance in \"Broken Embraces\". Cruz's final 2009 film was the film version of the musical \"Nine\", playing the character Carla Albanese, the lead character's mistress. \"Variety\" reported that Cruz originally auditioned for the role of the film within a film's star, Claudia, which eventually went to Nicole Kidman. Cruz said that she trained for three months for the dance routine in the film. Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" commented that while Cruz \"does a steamy song and dance\", her \"acting is strangely caricatured\". Cruz's performance as Carla was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, and SAG Awards.\n2010\u20132015: Established actress.\nCruz's only film in 2010 was \"Sex and the City 2\", the sequel to the 2008 film, in which she appeared as a banker in a cameo role. A commercial success, the comedy film was largely panned by critics. Cruz appeared in her biggest Hollywood turn to date in Rob Marshall's \"\", the fourth installment of the film series, opposite Johnny Depp. In the film, Cruz portrayed Angelica, a former love interest of Jack Sparrow, who blames him for her corruption. Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit Marshall's description. He invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of \"Nine\". The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role. During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic, and the producers to hire her sister M\u00f3nica Cruz to double for Pen\u00e9lope in risky scenes. \"On Stranger Tides\" ranks among the highest-grossing films of all time, grossing more than $1.046\u00a0billion in box-office receipts worldwide. On 1 April 2011, prior to the film's release, Cruz received the 2,436th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the El Capitan Theatre. She became the first Spanish actress to receive a Star.\nIn 2012, Cruz appeared in the first ever Nintendo commercial to promote \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" and the Nintendo 3DS XL in which she played the role of Mario in the ad. She spoke Italian again, this time in Woody Allen's romantic ensemble comedy film \"To Rome with Love\", in which she portrayed a street-smart prostitute who agrees to pretend to be the wife of a newlywed. Fond to work with her again, Allen compared Cruz's play in the film with that of Italian icons Anna Magnani and Sophia Loren. While the film received mixed reviews, Cruz was reviewed favourably for her \"exuberantly, cartoonishly sexy\" performance, which \"The Week\" cited as a stand out. The same year, Cruz also reunited with Italian director Sergio Castellitto in his war tale \"Twice Born\" about an infertile Italian woman who returns to relive her past in Sarajevo. An adaptation of Castellitto's wife Margaret Mazzantini's same-titled bestseller, Cruz portrayed the transitional character at different phases in her life, ranging from her early twenties to her late forties. Despite receiving little praise from critics, Cruz's performance opposite Emile Hirsch earned positive reviews.\nIn 2013, Cruz appeared in Ridley Scott's \"The Counselor\", featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Michael Fassbender, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, and husband Javier Bardem. The crime thriller follows a lawyer who, tempted by the lure of quick money, finds himself involved in drug dealing with ruthless Mexican cartels. Cruz plays his girlfriend, Laura, the only innocent character in the story. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and became a moderate commercial success at the international box offices. The same year, Cruz, along with Antonio Banderas, made a cameo appearance in Pedro Almod\u00f3var's farcical comedy \"I'm So Excited\", which marked a return to the director's light, campy comedies of the 1980s and 1990s. The film received mixed reviews, but earned a worldwide gross of more than US$11\u00a0million.\nIn 2015, Cruz co-produced and starred in the Spanish drama film \"Ma Ma\", directed by Julio Medem. In it, she plays Magda, a gutsy mother and unemployed teacher, who is diagnosed with breast cancer, a role which Cruz later cited as \"one of the most complex, beautiful characters I've ever been offered, the most difficult.\" The melodrama was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received generally negative reviews for its weepie story line. However, Cruz was praised for her \"aces performance\", which earned her an eighth Goya nomination at the 30th awards ceremony.\n2016\u2013present.\nCruz's first film of 2016 was the American comedy \"Zoolander 2\", co-starring and directed by Ben Stiller. In the sequel film, Cruz portrayed a secret Interpol agent who enlists models Derek Zoolander (Stiller) and Hansel McDonald, played by Owen Wilson, to help find out who is killing the world's most beautiful people. Specifically written for her persona, Cruz, a fan of the original 2001 film, was one of the first actors to be cast in their parts. Upon its release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that it had \"more celebrity cameos than laughs.\" Cruz's other film that year was Louis Leterrier's British spy comedy \"Grimsby\", in which she played a powerful philanthropist, opposite Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong. Cruz was reportedly offered $400,000 for her role. The film received mixed reviews, with critics suggesting that Cruz was highly underused and \"looking even less invested here than she did in \"Zoolander 2\"\". Also in 2016, Cruz rejoined Fernando Trueba on his Spanish-language period pic \"The Queen of Spain\", a sequel to Trueba's 1998 drama \"The Girl of Your Dreams\". Set in the 1950s, twenty years after the events of the original, Cruz reprised the role of an actress who becomes a Hollywood star and returns to Spain to film a blockbuster about Queen Isabella I of Castile. Selected to be shown in the Berlinale Special section of the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, the Spanish comedy drama was screened to lukewarm reviews, but received five nominations at the 31st Goya Awards, earning Cruz her ninth nomination.\n\"Loving Pablo\", a Spanish drama film directed by Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa was released in 2017, starring Cruz in the role of Virginia Vallejo, and her husband, Javier Bardem, in the role of Pablo Escobar. Based on Vallejo's bestselling memoir \"Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar\", the film was launched to mixed reviews during the 74th Venice International Film Festival. In order to play the role of the Colombian journalist, Cruz studied hundreds of interviews of Vallejo. Cruz had a supporting role in Kenneth Branagh's mystery film \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (2017), the fourth adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1934 novel of the same name. The mystery\u2013drama ensemble film follows world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot, who seeks to solve a murder on the famous European train in the 1930s. Cruz plays missionary and passenger Pilar Estravados, a Hispanic version of the novel's Swedish Greta Ohlsson. The film was a financial success but received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with praise for the cast's performances, but criticism for not adding anything new to previous adaptations. In 2018, Cruz made her television debut by co-starring in the role of Donatella Versace in the second season of the FX anthology series \"American Crime Story\" entitled \"\". Her performance was highly praised by critics and she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

The film opened the 2018 Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews. Justin Chang of \"The Los Angeles Times\" praised the performances from the two leads writing, \"Bardem and Cruz have such a natural, unforced chemistry\".\nIn 2021, Cruz starred alongside Antonio Banderas in Gast\u00f3n Duprat &amp; Mariano Cohn's film \"Official Competition\" and reunited with Almod\u00f3var for the film \"Parallel Mothers\", in which she played Janis, a professional photographer entangled in a relationship with a married man, leading to an affair and resulting in her pregnancy.

Her performance in the film was lauded, winning the Volpi Cup for Best Actress and receiving her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, her fourth nomination overall. Stephanie Zacharek from \"Time\" stated that \"Cruz is astonishing here, in what may be the best performance of her career so far. Janis' fragility and her fortitude are two sides of one coin, and Cruz can shift from one to the other in the merest breath.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Variety\" mentioned that \"Cruz acts this part with a mood-shifting immediacy that leaves you breathless\", with David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" describing her performance as \"one of the best roles of her career\" and \"her most outstanding work since Volver.\" Following the release of these films, she was honoured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for her career and achievements in film.

Guy Lodge of \"Variety\" praised her performance in \"L'immensit\u00e0\" writing, \"If it was through the lens of Pedro Almod\u00f3var that Cruz really established herself as her generation\u2019s stand-in for Sophia Loren, Crialese takes the likeness one step further, planting the Spaniard in Loren\u2019s hometown of Rome, as the kind of beautifully wounded housewife that the Italian icon perfected in the films of Crialese\u2019s youth.\" She portrayed Laura, Enzo Ferrari's wife, alongside Adam Driver and Shailene Woodley in the biopic \"Ferrari\", directed by Michael Mann. The film chronicled the life of Enzo Ferrari, founder of the Ferrari brand.\nIn 2023, Cruz became a brand ambassador for Emirates appearing in advertisements for the airline, as well as Geox.

That trip inspired Cruz to help start a foundation to support homeless girls in India, where she sponsors two young women. She donated her salary from her first Hollywood film, \"The Hi-Lo Country\", to Mother Teresa's mission. In the early 2000s, she spent time in Nepal photographing Tibetan children for an exhibition attended by the Dalai Lama. She also photographed residents at the Pacific Lodge Boys' Home, most of whom are former gang members and recovering substance abusers. She said: \"These kids break my heart. I have to control myself not to cry. Not out of pity, but seeing how tricky life is and how hard it is to make the right choices.\" A pregnant Cruz showed her support for the battle against AIDS by lighting up the Empire State Building with red lights in New York City on 1 December 2010 on International AIDS Day, as part of (RED)'s new awareness campaign, 'An AIDS Free Generation is Due in 2015,' which aims to eradicate the HIV virus from pregnant mothers to their babies.

At such a hearing, the defendant may be assisted by a lawyer.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, a preliminary hearing is sometimes referred to as a preliminary inquiry. During the preliminary inquiry, a hearing is held by the court to determine if there is enough evidence to justify a trial. Preliminary inquiries are only held when a person is charged with an indictable offence where the accused is liable to a period of imprisonment greater than 14 years. The Crown Attorney may call witnesses. If there is not enough evidence, the court will dismiss the charge(s).\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 Jordan decision, in which the Supreme Court of Canada imposed time limits on the Crown to bring criminal cases to trial, the Crown has started to use the direct indictment procedure more frequently.\nUnited Kingdom.\nScotland.\nIn Scotland, a preliminary hearing is a non-evidential pre-trial diet in cases to be tried before the High Court of Justiciary, conducted to enable the court to determine whether both parties, the prosecution and the defence, are ready to proceed to trial. The hearing may also address ancillary procedural matters.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, at a preliminary hearing the judge must find that such evidence provides probable cause to believe that the crime was committed and that the crime was committed by the defendant. There is a right to counsel at the preliminary hearing.\nThe conduct of the preliminary hearing as well as the specific rules regarding the admissibility of evidence vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If the court decides that there is probable cause, a formal charging instrument (called the information in some jurisdictions) will be issued, and the prosecution will continue. If the court does not find probable cause, then typically the prosecution will cease. Many jurisdictions, however, allow the prosecution to seek a new preliminary hearing or to seek a bill of indictment from a grand jury.\nThe key questions normally addressed at a preliminary hearing are:\nIf a judge determines that there is sufficient evidence to believe that the defendant committed the crime, then it is said that the defendant is \"bound over\".\nTerminology.\nIn criminal prosecutions, the court schedules an arraignment at which the charges are formally presented to the defendant. Several procedures must be done before the arraignment can happen. For example, in most states, the prosecutor first files an \u201cinformation\u201d document with the court. This filing describes the basic elements (the facts or factors) that make up the alleged criminal offense. Relatedly, the filing enumerates the criminal law(s) that the defendant allegedly violated. Finally, the defendant is scheduled for an arraignment which is when the charge is formally and openly presented. If the defendant pleads not guilty at the arraignment, the court schedules a preliminary hearing.\nWhere an indictment is obtained through means other than an information document, such as through grand jury proceedings or after an arrest when the defendant is first brought to court, the arraignment may be referred to as an \"initial hearing\", or \"preliminary arraignment\", which is different from a preliminary hearing. Those other hearings are not probable cause hearings.\nState law.\nA preliminary hearing is not always required, and some jurisdictions do not require it. Some states hold preliminary hearings in every serious criminal case. Other states only have a preliminary hearing if the defense requests it; Alternatively, some states only have them for felony cases.\nFederal law.\nIf the defendant is charged with a felony under federal law, the defendant has the right to an indictment by a grand jury, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and Title 18 of the United States Code. At grand jury proceedings, the defendant is not entitled to have counsel present in the grand jury room (although witnesses may consult with counsel outside of the presence of the grand jury). In some cases, the defendant may not even know that a grand jury is considering the case.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23010", "revid": "39494085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23010", "title": "Paul Ehrlich", "text": "German physician and scientist (1854\u20131915)\nPaul Ehrlich (; 14 March 1854 \u2013 20 August 1915) was a Nobel Prize-winning German physician and scientist who worked in the fields of hematology, immunology and antimicrobial chemotherapy. Among his foremost achievements were finding a cure for syphilis in 1909 and inventing an important modification of the technique for Gram staining bacteria. The methods he developed for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the ability to diagnose numerous blood diseases.\nHis laboratory discovered arsphenamine (Salvarsan), the first antimicrobial drug and first effective medicinal treatment for syphilis, thereby initiating and also naming the concept of chemotherapy. Ehrlich introduced the concept of a magic bullet. He also made a decisive contribution to the development of an antiserum to combat diphtheria and conceived a method for standardising therapeutic serums.\nIn 1908, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology. He was the founder and first director of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a German research institution and medical regulatory body named for him in 1947, that is the nation's federal institute for vaccines and biomedicines. A genus of Rickettsiales bacteria, \"Ehrlichia\", is named after him.\nEhrlich has been called \"father of immunology\".\nLife and career.\nEhrlich was born 14 March 1854 in Strehlen in the Prussian province of Lower Silesia (now Strzelin, Poland). He was the second child of Rosa (Weigert) and Ismar Ehrlich, the leader of the local Jewish community. His father was an innkeeper and distiller of liqueurs and the royal lottery collector in Strehlen, a town of some 5,000 inhabitants. His grandfather, Heymann Ehrlich, had been a fairly successful distiller and tavern manager. Ehrlich was the uncle of Fritz Weigert and cousin of Karl Weigert.\nAfter elementary school, Paul attended the time-honoured secondary school Maria-Magdalenen-Gymnasium in Breslau, where he met Albert Neisser, who later became a colleague. As a schoolboy (inspired by his cousin Karl Weigert who owned one of the first microtomes), he became fascinated by the process of staining microscopic tissue substances. He retained that interest during his subsequent medical studies.\nEhrlich studied medicine in Breslau and Strasbourg from 1872, with a short stay in Freiburg, and received his doctorate in Leipzig in 1878, where his doctoral advisor, Julius Cohnheim, had moved.\nAfter obtaining his doctorate, he worked at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin as an assistant medical director under Theodor Frerichs, the founder of experimental clinical medicine, focusing on histology, hematology and colour chemistry (dyes).\nHe married Hedwig Pinkus (1864\u20131948) in 1883 in the synagogue in Neustadt (now Prudnik, Poland). The couple had two daughters, Stephanie and Marianne. Hedwig was a sister of Max Pinkus, who was an owner of the textile factory in Neustadt (later known as ZPB \"Frotex\"). He settled in the villa of the Fr\u00e4nkel family on Wiesenerstrasse in Neustadt.\nAfter completing his clinical education and habilitation at the prominent Charit\u00e9 medical school and teaching hospital in Berlin in 1886, Ehrlich travelled to Egypt and other countries in 1888 and 1889, in part to cure a case of tuberculosis which he had contracted in the laboratory. Upon his return he established a private medical practice and small laboratory in Berlin-Steglitz. In 1891, Robert Koch invited Ehrlich to join the staff at his Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases, where in 1896 a new branch, the Institute for Serum Research and Testing (\"Institut f\u00fcr Serumforschung und Serumpr\u00fcfung\"), was established for Ehrlich's specialisation. Ehrlich was named its founding director.\nIn 1899 his institute moved to Frankfurt am Main and was renamed the Institute of Experimental Therapy (\"Institut f\u00fcr experimentelle Therapie\"). One of his important collaborators there was Max Neisser. In 1904, Ehrlich received a full position of honorary professor from the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1906 Ehrlich became the director of the Georg Speyer House in Frankfurt, a private research foundation affiliated with his institute. Here he discovered in 1909 the first drug to be targeted against a specific pathogen: Salvarsan, a treatment for syphilis, which was at that time one of the most lethal and infectious diseases in Europe. In 1914, Ehrlich was awarded the Cameron Prize of the University of Edinburgh. Among the foreign guest scientists working with Ehrlich at his institute were two Nobel Prize winners, Henry Hallett Dale and Paul Karrer. The institute was renamed Paul Ehrlich Institute in Ehrlich's honour in 1947.\nIn 1914, Ehrlich signed the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three which was a defence of Germany's World War I politics and militarism. On 17 August 1915 Ehrlich suffered a heart attack and died on 20 August in the Hessian town of Bad Homburg. Wilhelm II the German emperor, wrote in a telegram of condolence, \"I, along with the entire civilized world, mourn the death of this meritorious researcher for his great service to medical science and suffering humanity; his life's work ensures undying fame and the gratitude of both his contemporaries and posterity\".\nEhrlich was buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery in Frankfurt (Block 114 N).\nResearch.\nHematological staining.\nIn the early 1870s, Ehrlich's cousin Karl Weigert was the first person to stain bacteria with dyes and to introduce aniline pigments for histological studies and bacterial diagnostics. During his studies in Strassburg under the anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer, Ehrlich continued the research started by his cousin in dyes and staining tissues for microscopic study. He spent his eighth university semester in Freiburg im Breisgau investigating primarily the red dye dahlia (monophenylrosanilin), giving rise to his first publication.\nIn 1878 he followed his dissertation supervisor Julius Friedrich Cohnheim to Leipzig, and obtained a doctorate with a dissertation entitled \"Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Histological Staining\" (\"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie und Praxis der histologischen F\u00e4rbung\").\nOne of the most outstanding results of his dissertation investigations was the discovery of a new cell type. Ehrlich discovered in the protoplasm of supposed plasma cells a granulate which could be made visible with the help of an alkaline dye. He thought this granulate was a sign of good nourishment, and accordingly named these cells mast cells, (from the German word for an animal-fattening feed, \"Mast\"). This focus on chemistry was unusual for a medical dissertation. In it, Ehrlich presented the entire spectrum of known staining techniques and the chemistry of the pigments employed.\nWhile he was at the Charit\u00e9, Ehrlich elaborated upon the differentiation of white blood cells according to their different granules. A precondition was a dry specimen technique, which he also developed. A drop of blood placed between two glass slides and heated over a Bunsen burner fixed the blood cells while still allowing them to be stained. Ehrlich used both alkaline and acid dyes, and also created new \"neutral\" dyes. For the first time this made it possible to differentiate the lymphocytes among the leucocytes (white blood cells). By studying their granulation he could distinguish between nongranular lymphocytes, mono- and poly-nuclear leucocytes, eosinophil granulocytes and mast cells.\nStarting in 1880, Ehrlich also studied red blood cells. He demonstrated the existence of nucleated red blood cells, which he subdivided into normoblasts, megaloblasts, microblasts and poikiloblasts; he had discovered the precursors of erythrocytes. Ehrlich thus also laid the basis for the analysis of anemias, after he had created the basis for systematising leukemias with his investigation of white blood cells.\nHis duties at the Charit\u00e9 included analysing patients' blood and urine specimens. In 1881 he published a new urine test which could be used to distinguish different types of typhoid from simple cases of diarrhea. The intensity of staining made possible a disease prognosis. The pigment solution he used became known as Ehrlich's reagent.\nEhrlich's great achievement, but also a source of problems during his further career, was that he had initiated a new field of study interrelating chemistry, biology and medicine. Much of his work was rejected by the medical profession, which lacked the requisite chemical knowledge. It also meant that there was no suitable professorship in sight for Ehrlich.\nSerum research.\nFriendship with Robert Koch.\nWhen a student in Breslau, Ehrlich was given an opportunity by the pathologist Julius Friedrich Cohnheim to conduct extensive research and was also introduced to Robert Koch, who was at the time a district physician in Wollstein, Posen Province. In his spare time, Koch had clarified the life cycle of the anthrax pathogen and had contacted Ferdinand Cohn, who was quickly convinced by Koch's work and introduced him to his Breslau colleagues. From 30 April to 2 May 1876, Koch presented his investigations in Breslau, which the student Ehrlich was able to attend.\nOn 24 March 1882, Ehrlich was present when Koch, working since 1880 at the Imperial Public Health Office (\"Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt\") in Berlin, presented the lecture in which he reported how he was able to identify the tuberculosis pathogen. Ehrlich later described this lecture as his \"greatest experience in science\". The day after Koch's lecture, Ehrlich had already made an improvement to Koch's staining method, which Koch unreservedly welcomed. From this date on, the two men were bound in friendship.\nIn 1887 Ehrlich became an unsalaried lecturer in internal medicine (\"Privatdozent f\u00fcr Innere Medizin\") at Berlin University, and in 1890 took over the tuberculosis station at a public hospital in Berlin-Moabit at Koch's request. This was where Koch's hoped-for tuberculosis therapeutic agent tuberculin was under study; and Ehrlich had even injected himself with it. In the ensuing tuberculin scandal, Ehrlich tried to support Koch and stressed the value of tuberculin for diagnostic purposes. In 1891 Koch invited Ehrlich to work at the newly founded \"Institut f\u00fcr Infektionskrankheiten\" (Institute of Infectious Diseases, which became the Robert Koch Institute) at \"Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t\" (Humboldt University) in Berlin. Koch was unable to give him any remuneration, but did offer him full access to laboratory staff, patients, chemicals and laboratory animals, which Ehrlich always remembered with gratitude.\nFirst work on immunity.\nEhrlich had started his first experiments on immunisation already in his private laboratory. He accustomed mice to the poisons ricin and abrin. After feeding them with small but increasing dosages of ricin he ascertained that they had become \"ricin-proof\". Ehrlich interpreted this as immunisation and observed that it was abruptly initiated after a few days and was still in existence after several months, but mice immunised against ricin were just as sensitive to abrin as untreated animals.\nThis was followed by investigations on the \"inheritance\" of acquired immunity. It was already known that in some cases after a smallpox or syphilis infection, specific immunity was transmitted from the parents to their offspring. Ehrlich rejected inheritance in the genetic sense because the offspring of a male mouse immunised against abrin and an untreated female mouse were not immune to abrin. He concluded that the foetus was supplied with antibodies via the pulmonary circulation of the mother. This idea was supported by the fact that this \"inherited immunity\" decreased after a few months. In another experiment he exchanged the offspring of treated and untreated female mice. The mice which were nursed by the treated females were protected from the poison, providing the proof that antibodies can also be conveyed in milk.\nEhrlich also researched autoimmunity, but he specifically rejected the possibility that an organism's immune system could attack the organism's own tissue calling it \"horror autotoxicus\". It was Ehrlich's student, Ernest Witebsky, who demonstrated that autoimmunity could cause disease in humans. Ehrlich was the first to propose that regulatory mechanisms existed to protect an organism from autoimmunity, saying in 1906 that \"the organism possesses certain contrivances by means of which the immunity reaction, so easily produced by all kinds of cells, is prevented from acting against the organism's own elements\".\nWork with Behring on a diphtheria serum.\nEmil Behring had worked at the Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases until 1893 on developing an antiserum for treating diphtheria and tetanus but with inconsistent results. Koch suggested that Behring and Ehrlich cooperate on the project. This joint work was successful to the extent that Ehrlich was quickly able to increase the level of immunity of the laboratory animals based on his experience with mice. Clinical tests with diphtheria serum early in 1894 were successful and in August the chemical company Hoechst started to market Behring's \"Diphtheria Remedy synthesised by Behring-Ehrlich\". The two discoverers had originally agreed to share any profits after the Hoechst share had been subtracted. Their contract was changed several times and finally Ehrlich was eventually pressured into accepting a profit share of only eight percent. Ehrlich resented what he considered as unfair treatment, and his relationship with Behring was thereafter problematic, a situation which later escalated over the issue of the valency of tetanus serum. Ehrlich recognised that the principle of serum therapy had been developed by Behring and Kitasato. But he was of the opinion that he had been the first to develop a serum which could also be used on humans, and that his role in developing the diphtheria serum had been insufficiently acknowledged. Behring, for his part, schemed against Ehrlich at the Prussian Ministry of Culture, and from 1900 on Ehrlich refused to collaborate with him. Von Behring was the sole recipient of the first Nobel Prize in Medicine, in 1901, for contributions to research on diphtheria.\nThe valency of serums.\nSince antiserums were an entirely new type of medicine whose quality was highly variable, a government system was established to guarantee their safety and effectiveness. Beginning 1 April 1895, only government-approved serum could be sold in the German Reich. The testing station for diphtheria serum was provisionally housed at the Institute of Infectious Diseases. At the initiative of Friedrich Althoff, an Institute of Serum Research and Testing (\"Institut f\u00fcr Serumforschung und Serumpr\u00fcfung\") was established in 1896 in Berlin-Steglitz, with Ehrlich as director (which required him to cancel all his contracts with Hoechst). In this function and as honorary professor at Berliner University he had annual earnings of 6,000 marks, approximately the salary of a university professor. In addition to a testing department the institute had a research department.\nIn order to determine the effectiveness of diphtheria antiserum, a stable concentration of diphtheria toxin was required. Ehrlich discovered that the toxin being used was perishable, in contrast to what had been assumed, which for him led to two consequences: he did not use the toxin as a standard, but instead a serum powder developed by Behring, which had to be dissolved in liquid shortly before use. The strength of a test toxin was first determined in comparison with this standard. The test toxin could then be used as a reference for testing other serums. For the test itself, toxin and serum were mixed in a ratio so that their effects just cancelled each other when injected into a guinea pig. But since there was a large margin in determining whether symptoms of illness were present, Ehrlich established an unambiguous target: the death of the animal. The mixture was to be such that the test animal would die after four days. If it died earlier, the serum was too weak and was rejected. Ehrlich claimed to have made the determination of the valency of serum as accurate as it would be with chemical titration. This again demonstrates his tendency to quantify the life sciences.\nInfluenced by the mayor of Frankfurt am Main, Franz Adickes, who endeavored to establish science institutions in Frankfurt in preparation of the founding of a university, Ehrlich's institute moved to Frankfurt in 1899 and was renamed the Royal Prussian Institute of Experimental Therapy (\"K\u00f6niglich Preu\u00dfisches Institut f\u00fcr Experimentelle Therapie\"). The German quality-control methodology was copied by government serum institutes all over the world, and they also obtained the standard serum from Frankfurt. After diphtheria antiserum, tetanus serum and various bactericide serums for use in veterinary medicine were developed in rapid sequence. These were also evaluated at the institute, as was tuberculin and later on various vaccines. Ehrlich's most important colleague at the institute was the Jewish physician and biologist Julius Morgenroth.\nEhrlich's side-chain theory.\nEhrlich postulated that cell protoplasm contains structures which have chemical \"side chains\" (macromolecules) to which the toxin binds, affecting function. If the organism survives the effects of the toxin, the blocked side-chains are replaced by new ones. This regeneration can be trained, the name for this phenomenon being \"immunisation\". If the cell produces a surplus of side chains, these might also be released into the blood as antibodies.\nIn the following years Ehrlich expanded his side chain theory using concepts (\"amboceptors\", \"receptors of the first, second and third order\", etc.) which are no longer customary. Between the antigen and the antibody he assumed there was an additional immune molecule, which he called an \"additive\" or a \"complement\". For him, the side chain contained at least two functional groups.\nFor providing a theoretical basis for immunology as well as for his work on serum valency, Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1908 together with \u00c9lie Metchnikoff. Metchnikoff, who had researched the cellular branch of immunity, Phagocytosis, at the Pasteur Institute had previously sharply attacked Ehrlich.\nCancer research.\nIn 1901, the Prussian Ministry of Finance criticised Ehrlich for exceeding his budget and as a consequence reduced his income. In this situation Althoff arranged a contact with Georg Speyer, a Jewish philanthropist and joint owner of the bank house Lazard Speyer-Ellissen. The cancerous disease of Princess Victoria, the widow of the German Emperor Friedrich III, had received much public attention and prompted a collection among wealthy Frankfurt citizens, including Speyer, in support of cancer research. Ehrlich had also received from the German Emperor Wilhelm II a personal request to devote all his energy to cancer research. Such efforts led to the founding of a department for cancer research affiliated with the Institute of Experimental Therapy. The chemist Gustav Embden, among others, worked there. Ehrlich informed his sponsors that cancer research meant basic research, and that a cure could not be expected soon.\nAmong the results achieved by Ehrlich and his research colleagues was the insight that when tumors are cultivated by transplanting tumor cells, their malignancy increases from generation to generation. If the primary tumor is removed, then metastasis precipitously increases. Ehrlich applied bacteriological methods to cancer research. In analogy to vaccination, he attempted to generate immunity to cancer by injecting weakened cancer cells. Both in cancer research and chemotherapy research (see below) he introduced the methodologies of Big Science.\nChemotherapy.\n\"In vivo\" staining.\nIn 1885 Ehrlich's monograph \"The Need of the Organism for Oxygen\" (\"Das Sauerstoffbed\u00fcrfnis des Organismus \u2013 Eine farbenanalytische Studie\") appeared, which he also submitted as a habilitation thesis. In it he introduced the new technology of in vivo staining. One of his findings was that pigments can only be easily assimilated by living organisms if they are in granular form. He injected the dyes alizarin blue and indophenol blue into laboratory animals and established after their death that various organs had been coloured to different degrees. In organs with high oxygen saturation, indophenol was retained; in organs with medium saturation, indophenol was reduced, but not alizarin blue. And in areas with low oxygen saturation, both pigments were reduced. With this work, Ehrlich also formulated the conviction which guided his research: that all life processes can be traced to processes of physical chemistry occurring in the cell.\nMethylene blue.\nIn the course of his investigations Ehrlich came across methylene blue, which he regarded as particularly suitable for staining bacteria. Later, Robert Koch also used methylene blue as a dye in his research on the tuberculosis pathogen. In Ehrlich's view, an added benefit was that methylene blue also stained the long appendages of nerve cells, the axons. He initiated a doctoral dissertation on the subject, but did not follow up the topic himself. It was the opinion of the neurologist Ludwig Edinger that Ehrlich had thereby opened up a major new topic in the field of neurology.\nAfter mid-1889, when Ehrlich was unemployed, he privately continued his research on methylene blue. His work on in vivo staining gave him the idea of using it therapeutically. Since the parasite family of \"Plasmodiidae\" \u2013 which includes the malaria pathogen \u2013 can be stained with methylene blue, he thought it could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria. In the case of two patients so treated at the city hospital in Berlin-Moabit, their fever indeed subsided and the malaria plasmodia disappeared from their blood. Ehrlich obtained methylene blue from the company Meister Lucius &amp; Br\u00fcning AG (later renamed Hoechst AG), which started a long collaboration with this company.\nThe search for a \"chemotherapia specifica\".\nBefore the Institute of Experimental Therapy had moved to Frankfurt, Ehrlich had already resumed work on methylene blue. After the death of Georg Speyer, his widow Franziska Speyer endowed the Georg-Speyer House in his memory which was erected next door to Ehrlich's institute. As director of the Georg-Speyer House, Ehrlich transferred his chemotherapeutic research there. He was looking for an agent which was as effective as methylene blue, but without its side effects. His model was on the one hand the impact of quinine on malaria, and on the other hand, in analogy to serum therapy, he thought there must also be chemical pharmaceuticals which would have just as specific an effect on individual diseases. His goal was to find a \"Therapia sterilisans magna\", in other words a treatment that could kill all disease pathogens.\nAs a model for experimental therapy Ehrlich used a guinea pig disease trypanosoma and tested out various chemical substances on laboratory animals. The trypanosomes could indeed be successfully killed with the dye trypan red. Beginning in 1906, he intensively investigated atoxyl and had it tested by Robert Koch along with other arsenic compounds during Koch's sleeping sickness expedition of 1906/07. Although the name literally means \"nonpoisonous\", atoxyl does cause damage, especially to the optic nerve. Ehrlich elaborated the systematic testing of chemical compounds in the sense of screening as later practiced in the pharmaceutical industry. He discovered that Compound 418 - Arsenophenylglycine - had an impressive therapeutic effect and had it tested in Africa.\nWith the support of his assistant Sahachiro Hata Ehrlich discovered in 1909 that Compound 606, Arsphenamine, effectively combatted \"spirillum\" spirochaetes bacteria, one of whose subspecies causes syphilis. The compound proved to have few side effects in human trials, and the spirochetes disappeared in seven syphilis patients after this treatment.\nAfter extensive clinical testing (all the research participants had the negative example of tuberculin in mind) the Hoechst company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan. This was the first agent with a specific therapeutic effect to be created on the basis of theoretical considerations. Salvarsan proved to be amazingly effective, particularly when compared with the conventional therapy of mercury salts. Manufactured by Hoechst AG, Salvarsan became the most widely prescribed drug in the world. It was the most effective drug for treating syphilis until penicillin became available in the 1940s. Salvarsan required improvement as to side effects and solubility and was replaced in 1911 with Neosalvarsan. Ehrlich's work illuminated the existence of the blood-brain barrier, although he himself never believed in such a barrier, with Lina Stern later coining the phrase.\nThe medication triggered the so-called \"Salvarsan war\". On one side there was hostility on the part of those who feared a resulting moral breakdown of sexual inhibitions. Ehrlich was also accused, with clearly anti-Semitic undertones, of excessively enriching himself. In addition, Ehrlich's associate, Paul Uhlenhuth claimed priority in discovering the drug.\nBecause some people died during the clinical testing, Ehrlich was accused of \"stopping at nothing.\" In 1914, one of the most prominent accusers was convicted of criminal libel at a trial for which Ehrlich was called to testify. Though Ehrlich was thereby exonerated, the ordeal threw him into a depression from which he never fully recovered.\nMagic bullet.\nEhrlich reasoned that if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. Hence, a \"magic bullet\" (\"Zauberkugel\", his term for an ideal therapeutic agent) would be created that killed only the organism targeted. The concept of a \"magic bullet\" has to some extent been realised by the development of antibody-drug conjugates (a monoclonal antibody linked to a cytotoxic biologically active drug), as they enable cytotoxic drugs to be selectively delivered to their designated targets (e.g. cancer cells).\nLegacy.\nIn 1910, a street was named after Ehrlich in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen. In Nazi Germany, Ehrlich's achievements were ignored while Emil Adolf von Behring was stylised as the ideal Aryan scientist, and the street named after Ehrlich was given another name. Shortly after the end of the war the name Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse was reinstated, and numerous German cities have since had streets named after Ehrlich.\nWest Germany issued a postage stamp in 1954 on the 100th anniversary of the births of Ehrlich (14 March 1854) and Emil von Behring (15 March 1854).\nThe 200 Deutsche Mark bank note, issued until 2001, featured Ehrlich.\nThe German Paul Ehrlich Institute, the successor to the Steglitz Institute for Serum Research and Serum Testing and the Frankfurt Royal Institute for Experimental Therapy, was named in 1947 after Ehrlich, its first director.\nEhrlich's name is also borne by many schools and pharmacies, by the Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Chemotherapie e. V. (PEG) in Frankfurt am Main, and the Paul-Ehrlich-Klinik in Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he. The Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize is the most distinguished German award for biomedical research. A European network of PhD studies in Medicinal Chemistry has been named after him (Paul Ehrlich MedChem Euro PhD Network).\nThe Anti-Defamation League awards a Paul Ehrlich\u2013G\u00fcnther K. Schwerin Human Rights Prize.\nA crater of the moon was named after Ehrlich in 1970.\nEhrlich's life and work was featured in the 1940 U.S. film \"Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet\" with Edward G. Robinson in the title role. It focused on Salvarsan (arsphenamine, \"compound 606\"), his cure for syphilis. Since the Nazi government was opposed to this tribute to a Jewish scientist, attempts were made to keep the film a secret in Germany. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Methods of philosophy are procedures for conducting research, creating new theories, and selecting between competing theories. In addition to the description of methods, philosophical methodology also compares and evaluates them.\nPhilosophers have employed a great variety of methods. Methodological skepticism tries to find principles that cannot be doubted. The geometrical method deduces theorems from self-evident axioms. The phenomenological method describes first-person experience. Verificationists study the conditions of empirical verification of sentences to determine their meaning. Conceptual analysis decomposes concepts into fundamental constituents. Common-sense philosophers use widely held beliefs as their starting point of inquiry, whereas ordinary language philosophers extract philosophical insights from ordinary language. Intuition-based methods, like thought experiments, rely on non-inferential impressions. The method of reflective equilibrium seeks coherence among beliefs, while the pragmatist method assesses theories by their practical consequences. The transcendental method studies the conditions without which an entity could not exist. Experimental philosophers use empirical methods.\nThe choice of method can significantly impact how theories are constructed and the arguments used to support them. As a result, methodological disagreements can lead to philosophical disagreements.\nDefinition.\nThe term \"philosophical methodology\" refers either to the methods used to philosophize or to the branch of metaphilosophy studying these methods. A method is a way of doing things, such as a set of actions or decisions, in order to achieve a certain goal, when used under the right conditions. In the context of inquiry, a method is a way of conducting one's research and theorizing, like inductive or axiomatic methods in logic or experimental methods in the sciences. Philosophical methodology studies the methods of philosophy. It is not primarily concerned with whether a philosophical position, such as metaphysical dualism or utilitarianism, is true or false. Instead, it asks how one can determine which position should be adopted.\nIn the widest sense, any principle for choosing between competing theories may be considered as part of the methodology of philosophy. In this sense, the philosophical methodology is \"the general study of criteria for theory selection\". For example, Occam\u2019s Razor is a methodological principle of theory selection favoring simple over complex theories. A closely related aspect of philosophical methodology concerns the question of which conventions one needs to adopt necessarily to succeed at theory making. But in a more narrow sense, only guidelines that help philosophers learn about facts studied by philosophy qualify as philosophical methods. This is the more common sense, which applies to most of the methods listed in this article. In this sense, philosophical methodology is closely related to epistemology in that it consists in epistemological methods that enable philosophers to arrive at knowledge. Because of this, the problem of the methods of philosophy is central to how philosophical claims are to be justified.\nAn important difference in philosophical methodology concerns the distinction between descriptive and normative questions. Descriptive questions ask what methods philosophers \"actually use or used\" in the past, while normative questions ask what methods they \"should use\". The normative aspect of philosophical methodology expresses the idea that there is a difference between good and bad philosophy. In this sense, philosophical methods either articulate the standards of evaluation themselves or the practices that ensure that these standards are met. Philosophical methods can be understood as tools that help the theorist do \"good\" philosophy and arrive at knowledge. The normative question of philosophical methodology is quite controversial since different schools of philosophy often have very different views on what constitutes good philosophy and how to achieve it.\nMethods.\nA great variety of philosophical methods has been proposed. Some of these methods were developed as a reaction to other methods, for example, to counter skepticism by providing a secure path to knowledge. In other cases, one method may be understood as a development or a specific application of another method. Some philosophers or philosophical movements give primacy to one specific method, while others use a variety of methods depending on the problem they are trying to solve. It has been argued that many of the philosophical methods are also commonly used implicitly in more crude forms by regular people and are only given a more careful, critical, and systematic exposition in philosophical methodology.\nMethodological skepticism.\nMethodological skepticism, also referred to as Cartesian doubt, uses systematic doubt as a method of philosophy. It is motivated by the search for an absolutely certain foundation of knowledge. The method for finding these foundations is doubt: only that which is indubitable can serve this role. While this approach has been influential, it has also received various criticisms. One problem is that it has proven very difficult to find such absolutely certain claims if the doubt is applied in its most radical form. Another is that while absolute certainty may be desirable, it is by no means necessary for knowledge. In this sense, it excludes too much and seems to be unwarranted and arbitrary, since it is not clear why very certain theorems justified by strong arguments should be abandoned just because they are not absolutely certain. This can be seen in relation to the insights discovered by the empirical sciences, which have proven very useful even though they are not indubitable.\nGeometrical method.\nThe geometrical method came to particular prominence through rationalists like Baruch Spinoza. It starts from a small set of self-evident axioms together with relevant definitions and tries to deduce a great variety of theorems from this basis, thereby mirroring the methods found in geometry. Historically, it can be understood as a response to methodological skepticism: it consists in trying to find a foundation of certain knowledge and then expanding this foundation through deductive inferences. The theorems arrived at this way may be challenged in two ways. On the one hand, they may be derived from axioms that are not as self-evident as their defenders proclaim and thereby fail to inherit the status of absolute certainty. For example, many philosophers have rejected the claim of self-evidence concerning one of Ren\u00e9 Descartes's first principles stating that \"he can know that whatever he perceives clearly and distinctly is true only if he first knows that God exists and is not a deceiver\". Another example is the causal axiom of Spinoza's system that \"the knowledge of an effect depends on and involves knowledge of its cause\", which has been criticized in various ways. In this sense, philosophical systems built using the geometrical method are open to criticisms that reject their basic axioms. A different form of objection holds that the inference from the axioms to the theorems may be faulty, for example, because it does not follow a rule of inference or because it includes implicitly assumed premises that are not themselves self-evident.\nPhenomenological method.\nPhenomenology is the science of appearances - broadly speaking, the science of phenomenon, given that almost all phenomena are perceived. The phenomenological method aims to study the appearances themselves and the relations found between them. This is achieved through the so-called phenomenological reduction, also known as epoch\u00e9 or bracketing: the researcher suspends their judgments about the natural external world in order to focus exclusively on the experience of how things appear to be, independent of whether these appearances are true or false. One idea behind this approach is that our presuppositions of what things are like can get in the way of studying how they appear to be and thereby mislead the researcher into thinking they know the answer instead of looking for themselves. The phenomenological method can also be seen as a reaction to methodological skepticism since its defenders traditionally claimed that it could lead to absolute certainty and thereby help philosophy achieve the status of a rigorous science. But phenomenology has been heavily criticized because of this overly optimistic outlook concerning the certainty of its insights. A different objection to the method of phenomenological reduction holds that it involves an artificial stance that gives too much emphasis on the theoretical attitude at the expense of feeling and practical concerns.\nAnother phenomenological method is called \"eidetic variation\". It is used to study the essences of things. This is done by imagining an object of the kind under investigation. The features of this object are then varied in order to see whether the resulting object still belongs to the investigated kind. If the object can survive the change of a certain feature then this feature is inessential to this kind. Otherwise, it belongs to the kind's \"essence\". For example, when imagining a triangle, one can vary its features, like the length of its sides or its color. These features are inessential since the changed object is still a triangle, but it ceases to be a triangle if a fourth side is added.\nVerificationism.\nThe method of verificationism consists in understanding sentences by analyzing their characteristic conditions of verification, i.e. by determining which empirical observations would prove them to be true. A central motivation behind this method has been to distinguish meaningful from meaningless sentences. This is sometimes expressed through the claim that \"[the] meaning of a statement is the method of its verification\". Meaningful sentences, like the ones found in the natural sciences, have clear conditions of empirical verification. But since most metaphysical sentences cannot be verified by empirical observations, they are deemed to be non-sensical by verificationists. Verificationism has been criticized on various grounds. On the one hand, it has proved very difficult to give a precise formulation that includes all scientific claims, including the ones about unobservables. This is connected to the problem of underdetermination in the philosophy of science: the problem that the observational evidence is often insufficient to determine which theory is true. This would lead to the implausible conclusion that even for the empirical sciences, many of their claims would be meaningless. But on a deeper level, the basic claim underlying verificationism seems itself to be meaningless by its own standards: it is not clear what empirical observations could verify the claim that the meaning of a sentence is the method of its verification. In this sense, verificationism would be contradictory by directly refuting itself. These and other problems have led some theorists, especially from the sciences, to adopt falsificationism instead. It is a less radical approach that holds that serious theories or hypotheses should at least be falsifiable, i.e. there should be some empirical observations that could prove them wrong.\nConceptual analysis.\nThe goal of conceptual analysis is to decompose or \"analyze\" a given concept into its fundamental constituents. It consists in considering a philosophically interesting concept, like knowledge, and determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for whether the application of this concept is true. The resulting claim about the relation between the concept and its constituents is normally seen as knowable a priori since it is true only in virtue of the involved concepts and thereby constitutes an analytic truth. Usually, philosophers use their own intuitions to determine whether a concept is applicable to a specific situation to test their analyses. But other approaches have also been utilized by using not the intuitions of philosophers but of regular people, an approach often defended by experimental philosophers.\nG. E. Moore proposed that the correctness of a conceptual analysis can be tested using the open question method. According to this view, asking whether the decomposition fits the concept should result in a closed or pointless question. If it results in an open or intelligible question, then the analysis does not exactly correspond to what we have in mind when we use the term. This can be used, for example, to reject the utilitarian claim that \"goodness\" is \"whatever maximizes happiness\". The underlying argument is that the question \"Is what is good what maximizes happiness?\" is an open question, unlike the question \"Is what is good what is good?\", which is a closed question. One problem with this approach is that it results in a very strict conception of what constitutes a correct conceptual analysis, leading to the conclusion that many concepts, like \"goodness\", are simple or indefinable.\nWillard Van Orman Quine criticized conceptual analysis as part of his criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction. This objection is based on the idea that all claims, including how concepts are to be decomposed, are ultimately based on empirical evidence. Another problem with conceptual analysis is that it is often very difficult to find an analysis of a concept that really covers all its cases. For this reason, Rudolf Carnap has suggested a modified version that aims to cover only the most paradigmatic cases while excluding problematic or controversial cases. While this approach has become more popular in recent years, it has also been criticized based on the argument that it tends to change the subject rather than resolve the original problem. In this sense, it is closely related to the method of conceptual engineering, which consists in redefining concepts in fruitful ways or developing new interesting concepts. This method has been applied, for example, to the concepts of gender and race.\nCommon sense.\nThe method of common sense is based on the fact that we already have a great variety of beliefs that seem very certain to us, even if we do not believe them based on explicit arguments. Common sense philosophers use these beliefs as their starting point of philosophizing. This often takes the form of criticism directed against theories whose premises or conclusions are very far removed from how the average person thinks about the issue in question. G. E. Moore, for example, rejects J. M. E. McTaggart's sophisticated argumentation for the unreality of time based on his common-sense impression that time exists. He holds that his simple common-sense impression is much more certain than that McTaggart's arguments are sound, even though Moore was unable to pinpoint where McTaggart's arguments went wrong. According to his method, common sense constitutes an evidence base. This base may be used to eliminate philosophical theories that stray too far away from it, that are abstruse from its perspective. This can happen because either the theory itself or consequences that can be drawn from it violate common sense. For common sense philosophers, it is not the task of philosophy to question common sense. Instead, they should analyze it to formulate theories in accordance with it.\nOne important argument against this method is that common sense has often been wrong in the past, as is exemplified by various scientific discoveries. This suggests that common sense is in such cases just an antiquated theory that is eventually eliminated by the progress of science. For example, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity constitutes a radical departure from the common-sense conception of space and time, and quantum physics poses equally serious problems to how we tend to think about how elementary particles behave. This puts into question that common sense is a reliable source of knowledge. Another problem is that for many issues, there is no one universally accepted common-sense opinion. In such cases, common sense only amounts to the majority opinion, which should not be blindly accepted by researchers. This problem can be approached by articulating a weaker version of the common-sense method. One such version is defended by Roderick Chisholm, who allows that theories violating common sense may still be true. He contends that, in such cases, the theory in question is \"prima facie\" suspect and the burden of proof is always on its side. But such a shift in the burden of proof does not constitute a blind belief in common sense since it leaves open the possibility that, for various issues, there is decisive evidence against the common-sense opinion.\nOrdinary language philosophy.\nThe method of ordinary language philosophy consists in tackling philosophical questions based on how the related terms are used in ordinary language. In this sense, it is related to the method of common sense but focuses more on linguistic aspects. Some types of ordinary language philosophy only take a negative form in that they try to show how philosophical problems are not real problems at all. Instead, it is aimed to show that false assumptions, to which humans are susceptible due to the confusing structure of natural language, are responsible for this false impression. Other types take more positive approaches by defending and justifying philosophical claims, for example, based on what sounds insightful or odd to the average English speaker.\nOne problem for ordinary language philosophy is that regular speakers may have many different reasons for using a certain expression. Sometimes they intend to express what they believe, but other times they may be motivated by politeness or other conversational norms independent of the truth conditions of the expressed sentences. This significantly complicates ordinary language philosophy, since philosophers have to take the specific context of the expression into account, which may considerably alter its meaning. This criticism is partially mitigated by J. L. Austin's approach to ordinary language philosophy. According to him, ordinary language already has encoded many important distinctions and is our point of departure in theorizing. But \"ordinary language is not the last word: in principle, it can everywhere be supplemented and improved upon and superseded\". However, it also falls prey to another criticism: that it is often not clear how to distinguish ordinary from non-ordinary language. This makes it difficult in all but the paradigmatic cases to decide whether a philosophical claim is or is not supported by ordinary language.\nIntuition and thought experiments.\nMethods based on intuition, like ethical intuitionism, use intuitions to evaluate whether a philosophical claim is true or false. In this context, intuitions are seen as a non-inferential source of knowledge: they consist in the impression of correctness one has when considering a certain claim. They are intellectual seemings that make it appear to the thinker that the considered proposition is true or false without the need to consider arguments for or against the proposition. This is sometimes expressed by saying that the proposition in question is \"self-evident\". Examples of such propositions include \"torturing a sentient being for fun is wrong\" or \"it is irrational to believe both something and its opposite\". But not all defenders of intuitionism restrict intuitions to self-evident propositions. Instead, often weaker non-inferential impressions are also included as intuitions, such as a mother's intuition that her child is innocent of a certain crime.\nIntuitions can be used in various ways as a philosophical method. On the one hand, philosophers may consult their intuitions in relation to very general principles, which may then be used to deduce further theorems. Another technique, which is often applied in ethics, consists in considering concrete scenarios instead of general principles. This often takes the form of thought experiments, in which certain situations are imagined with the goal of determining the possible consequences of the imagined scenario. These consequences are assessed using intuition and counterfactual thinking. For this reason, thought experiments are sometimes referred to as intuition pumps: they activate the intuitions concerning the specific situation, which may then be generalized to arrive at universal principles. In some cases, the imagined scenario is physically possible but it would not be feasible to make an actual experiment due to the costs, negative consequences, or technological limitations. But other thought experiments even work with scenarios that defy what is physically possible. It is controversial to what extent thought experiments merit to be characterized as \"real\" experiments and whether the insights they provide are reliable.\nOne problem with intuitions in general and thought experiments in particular consists in assessing their epistemological status, i.e. whether, how much, and in which circumstances they provide justification in comparison to other sources of knowledge. Some of its defenders claim that intuition is a reliable source of knowledge just like perception, with the difference being that it happens without the sensory organs. Others compare it not to perception but to the cognitive ability to evaluate counterfactual conditionals, which may be understood as the capacity to answer what-if questions. But the reliability of intuitions has been contested by its opponents. For example, wishful thinking may be the reason why it intuitively seems to a person that a proposition is true without providing any epistemological support for this proposition. Another objection, often raised in the empirical and naturalist tradition, is that intuitions do not constitute a reliable source of knowledge since the practitioner restricts themselves to an inquiry from their armchair instead of looking at the world to make empirical observations.\nReflective equilibrium.\nReflective equilibrium is a state in which a thinker has the impression that they have considered all the relevant evidence for and against a theory and have made up their mind on this issue. It is a state of coherent balance among one's beliefs. This does not imply that all the evidence has really been considered, but it is tied to the impression that engaging in further inquiry is unlikely to make one change one's mind, i.e. that one has reached a stable \"equilibrium\". In this sense, it is the endpoint of the deliberative process on the issue in question. The philosophical method of reflective equilibrium aims at reaching this type of state by mentally going back and forth between all relevant beliefs and intuitions. In this process, the thinker may have to let go of some beliefs or deemphasize certain intuitions that do not fit into the overall picture in order to progress.\nIn this wide sense, reflective equilibrium is connected to a form of coherentism about epistemological justification and is thereby opposed to foundationalist attempts at finding a small set of fixed and unrevisable beliefs from which to build one's philosophical theory. One problem with this wide conception of the reflective equilibrium is that it seems trivial: it is a truism that the rational thing to do is to consider all the evidence before making up one's mind and to strive towards building a coherent perspective. But as a method to guide philosophizing, this is usually too vague to provide specific guidance.\nWhen understood in a more narrow sense, the method aims at finding an equilibrium between particular intuitions and general principles. On this view, the thinker starts with intuitions about particular cases and formulates general principles that roughly reflect these intuitions. The next step is to deal with the conflicts between the two by adjusting both the intuitions and the principles to reconcile them until an equilibrium is reached. One problem with this narrow interpretation is that it depends very much on the intuitions one started with. This means that different philosophers may start with very different intuitions and may therefore be unable to find a shared equilibrium. For example, the narrow method of reflective equilibrium may lead some moral philosophers towards utilitarianism and others towards Kantianism.\nPragmatic method.\nThe pragmatic method assesses the truth or falsity of theories by looking at the consequences of accepting them. In this sense, \"[t]he test of truth is utility: it's true if it works\". Pragmatists approach intractable philosophical disputes in a down-to-earth fashion by asking about the concrete consequences associated, for example, with whether an abstract metaphysical theory is true or false. This is also intended to clarify the underlying issues by spelling out what would follow from them. Another goal of this approach is to expose pseudo-problems, which involve a merely verbal disagreement without any genuine difference on the level of the consequences between the competing standpoints.\nSuccinct summaries of the pragmatic method base it on the pragmatic maxim, of which various versions exist. An important version is due to Charles Sanders Peirce: \"Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of those effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\" Another formulation is due to William James: \"To develop perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider what effects of a conceivable practical kind the object may involve \u2013 what sensations we are to expect from it and what reactions we must prepare\". Various criticisms to the pragmatic method have been raised. For example, it is commonly rejected that the terms \"true\" and \"useful\" mean the same thing. A closely related problem is that believing in a certain theory may be useful to one person and useless to another, which would mean the same theory is both true and false.\nTranscendental method.\nThe transcendental method () is used to study phenomena by reflecting on the conditions of possibility of these phenomena. This method usually starts out with an obvious fact, often about our mental life, such as what we know or experience. It then goes on to argue that for this fact to obtain, other facts also have to obtain: they are its conditions of possibility. This type of argument is called \"transcendental argument\": it argues that these additional assumptions also have to be true because otherwise, the initial fact would not be the case. For example, it has been used to argue for the existence of an external world based on the premise that the experience of the temporal order of our mental states would not be possible otherwise. Another example argues in favor of a description of nature in terms of concepts such as motion, force, and causal interaction based on the claim that an objective account of nature would not be possible otherwise.\nTranscendental arguments have faced various challenges. On the one hand, the claim that the belief in a certain assumption is necessary for the experience of a certain entity is often not obvious. So in the example above, critics can argue against the transcendental argument by denying the claim that an external world is necessary for the experience of the temporal order of our mental states. But even if this point is granted, it does not guarantee that the assumption itself is true. So even if the belief in a given proposition is a psychological necessity for a certain experience, it does not automatically follow that this belief itself is true. Instead, it could be the case that humans are just wired in such a way that they have to believe in certain false assumptions.\nExperimental philosophy.\nExperimental philosophy is the most recent development of the methods discussed in this article: it began only in the early years of the 21st century. Experimental philosophers try to answer philosophical questions by gathering empirical data. It is an interdisciplinary approach that applies the methods of psychology and the cognitive sciences to topics studied by philosophy. This usually takes the form of surveys probing the intuitions of ordinary people and then drawing conclusions from the findings. For example, one such inquiry came to the conclusion that justified true belief may be sufficient for knowledge despite various Gettier cases claiming to show otherwise. The method of experimental philosophy can be used both in a negative or a positive program. As a negative program, it aims to challenge traditional philosophical movements and positions. This can be done, for example, by showing how the intuitions used to defend certain claims vary a lot depending on factors such as culture, gender, or ethnicity. This variation casts doubt on the reliability of the intuitions and thereby also on theories supported by them. As a positive program, it uses empirical data to support its own philosophical claims. It differs from other philosophical methods in that it usually studies the intuitions of ordinary people and uses them, and not the experts' intuitions, as philosophical evidence.\nOne problem for both the positive and the negative approaches is that the data obtained from surveys do not constitute hard empirical evidence since they do not directly express the intuitions of the participants. The participants may react to subtle pragmatic cues in giving their answers, which brings with it the need for further interpretation in order to get from the given answers to the intuitions responsible for these answers. Another problem concerns the question of how reliable the intuitions of ordinary people on the often very technical issues are. The core of this objection is that, for many topics, the opinions of ordinary people are not very reliable since they have little familiarity with the issues themselves and the underlying problems they may pose. For this reason, it has been argued that they cannot replace the expert intuitions found in trained philosophers. Some critics have even argued that experimental philosophy does not really form part of \"philosophy\". This objection does not reject that the method of experimental philosophy has value, it just rejects that this method belongs to philosophical methodology.\nOthers.\nVarious other philosophical methods have been proposed. The Socratic method or Socratic debate is a form of cooperative philosophizing in which one philosopher usually first states a claim, which is then scrutinized by their interlocutor by asking them questions about various related claims, often with the implicit goal of putting the initial claim into doubt. It continues to be a popular method for teaching philosophy. Plato and Aristotle emphasize the role of wonder in the practice of philosophy. On this view, \"philosophy begins in wonder\" and \"[i]t was their wonder, astonishment, that first led men to philosophize and still leads them\". This position is also adopted in the more recent philosophy of Nicolai Hartmann. Various other types of methods were discussed in ancient Greek philosophy, like analysis, synthesis, dialectics, demonstration, definition, and reduction to absurdity. The medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas identifies composition and division as ways of forming propositions while he sees invention and judgment as forms of reasoning from the known to the unknown.\nVarious methods for the selection between competing theories have been proposed. They often focus on the theoretical virtues of the involved theories. One such method is based on the idea that, everything else being equal, the simpler theory is to be preferred. Another gives preference to the theory that provides the best explanation. According to the method of epistemic conservatism, we should, all other things being equal, prefer the theory which, among its competitors, is the most conservative, i.e. the one closest to the beliefs we currently hold. One problem with these methods of theory selection is that it is usually not clear how the different virtues are to be weighted, often resulting in cases where they are unable to resolve disputes between competing theories that excel at different virtues.\nMethodological naturalism holds that all philosophical claims are synthetic claims that ultimately depend for their justification or rejection on empirical observational evidence. In this sense, philosophy is continuous with the natural sciences in that they both give priority to the scientific method for investigating all areas of reality.\nAccording to truthmaker theorists, every true proposition is true because another entity, its truthmaker, exists. This principle can be used as a methodology to critically evaluate philosophical theories. In particular, this concerns theories that accept certain truths but are unable to provide their truthmaker. Such theorists are derided as \"ontological cheaters\". For example, this can be applied to philosophical presentism, the view that nothing outside the present exists. Philosophical presentists usually accept the very common belief that dinosaurs existed but have trouble in providing a truthmaker for this belief since they deny existence to past entities.\nIn philosophy, the term \"genealogical method\" refers to a form of criticism that tries to expose commonly held beliefs by uncovering their historical origin and function. For example, it may be used to reject specific moral claims or the status of truth by giving a concrete historical reconstruction of how their development was contingent on power relations in society. This is usually accompanied by the assertion that these beliefs were accepted and became established, because of non-rational considerations, such as because they served the interests of a predominant class.\nDisagreements and influence.\nThe disagreements within philosophy do not only concern which first-order philosophical claims are true, they also concern the second-order issue of which philosophical methods to use. One way to evaluate philosophical methods is to assess how well they do at solving philosophical problems. The question of the nature of philosophy has important implications for which methods of inquiry are appropriate to philosophizing. Seeing philosophy as an empirical science brings its methods much closer to the methods found in the natural sciences. Seeing it as the attempt to clarify concepts and increase understanding, on the other hand, usually leads to a methodology much more focused on apriori reasoning. In this sense, philosophical methodology is closely tied up with the question of how philosophy is to be defined. Different conceptions of philosophy often associated it with different goals, leading to certain methods being more or less suited to reach the corresponding goal.\nThe interest in philosophical methodology has risen a lot in contemporary philosophy. But some philosophers reject its importance by emphasizing that \"preoccupation with questions about methods tends to distract us from prosecuting the methods themselves\". However, such objections are often dismissed by pointing out that philosophy is at its core a reflective and critical enterprise, which is perhaps best exemplified by its preoccupation with its own methods. This is also backed up by the arguments to the effect that one's philosophical method has important implications for how one does philosophy and which philosophical claims one accepts or rejects. Since philosophy also studies the methodology of other disciplines, such as the methods of science, it has been argued that the study of its own methodology is an essential part of philosophy.\nIn several instances in the history of philosophy, the discovery of a new philosophical method, such as Cartesian doubt or the phenomenological method, has had important implications both on how philosophers conducted their theorizing and what claims they set out to defend. In some cases, such discoveries led the involved philosophers to overly optimistic outlooks, seeing them as historic breakthroughs that would dissolve all previous disagreements in philosophy.\nRelation to other fields.\nScience.\nThe methods of philosophy differ in various respects from the methods found in the natural sciences. One important difference is that philosophy does not use experimental data obtained through measuring equipment like telescopes or cloud chambers to justify its claims. For example, even philosophical naturalists emphasizing the close relation between philosophy and the sciences mostly practice a form of armchair theorizing instead of gathering empirical data. Experimental philosophers are an important exception: they use methods found in social psychology and other empirical sciences to test their claims.\nOne reason for the methodological difference between philosophy and science is that philosophical claims are usually more speculative and cannot be verified or falsified by looking through a telescope. This problem is not solved by citing works published by other philosophers, since it only defers the question of how their insights are justified. An additional complication concerning testimony is that different philosophers often defend mutually incompatible claims, which poses the challenge of how to select between them. Another difference between scientific and philosophical methodology is that there is wide agreement among scientists concerning their methods, testing procedures, and results. This is often linked to the fact that science has seen much more progress than philosophy.\nEpistemology.\nAn important goal of philosophical methods is to assist philosophers in attaining knowledge. This is often understood in terms of evidence. In this sense, philosophical methodology is concerned with the questions of what constitutes philosophical evidence, how much support it offers, and how to acquire it. In contrast to the empirical sciences, it is often claimed that empirical evidence is not used in justifying philosophical theories, that philosophy is less about the empirical world and more about how we think about the empirical world. In this sense, philosophy is often identified with conceptual analysis, which is concerned with explaining concepts and showing their interrelations. Philosophical naturalists often reject this line of thought and hold that empirical evidence can confirm or disconfirm philosophical theories, at least indirectly.\nPhilosophical evidence, which may be obtained, for example, through intuitions or thought experiments, is central for justifying basic principles and axioms. These principles can then be used as premises to support further conclusions. Some approaches to philosophical methodology emphasize that these arguments have to be deductively valid, i.e. that the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion. In other cases, philosophers may commit themselves to working hypotheses or norms of investigation even though they lack sufficient evidence. Such assumptions can be quite fruitful in simplifying the possibilities the philosopher needs to consider and by guiding them to ask interesting questions. But the lack of evidence makes this type of enterprise vulnerable to criticism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The various episodes of Punch comedy\u2014often provoking shocked laughter\u2014are dominated by the clowning of Mr Punch.\nThe show is performed by a single puppeteer inside the booth, known since Victorian times as a \"professor\" or \"punchman\", and assisted sometimes by a \"bottler\" who corrals the audience outside the booth, introduces the performance, and collects the money (\"the bottle\"). The bottler might also play accompanying music or sound effects on a drum or guitar, and engage in back chat with the puppets, sometimes repeating lines that may have been difficult for the audience to understand. In the Victorian era, the drum and pan pipes were the instruments of choice. Today, most professors work solo, since the need for a bottler became less important when street performing with the show gave way to paid engagements at private parties or public events. In modern shows the audience is encouraged to participate, calling out to the characters on the stage\u2014typically shouting \"He's behind you!\"\u2014to warn them of danger or clue them in to what is going on behind their backs.\nHistory.\nThe Punch and Judy show, labelled an \"English entertainment icon\" by the London Museum, has roots in the 17th century Italian commedia dell'arte. The figure of Punch is derived from the Neapolitan stock character of Pulcinella, which was anglicised to \"Punchinello\". He is a variation on the same themes as the Lord of Misrule and the many Trickster figures found in mythologies across the world. Punch's wife was originally called \"Joan\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Pulcinella] went down particularly well with Restoration British audiences, fun-starved after years of Puritanism. We soon changed Punch's name, transformed him from a marionette to a hand puppet, and he became, really, a spirit of Britain \u2013 a subversive maverick who defies authority, a kind of puppet equivalent to our political cartoons. \u2014\u200a\nThe figure who became the anarchic Mr Punch made his first recorded appearance in England on 9 May 1662, which is traditionally reckoned as Punch's UK birthday. Punch and Judy began to emerge during the Restoration Period (beginning in 1660), a period during which art and theatre thrived. King Charles II took the throne in 1660 and replaced Puritan leaders Oliver Cromwell and Richard Cromwell, and theatre culture was revived. Cromwell strictly adhered to the Puritan belief that theatre was immoral and should be banned, resulting in their closure in 1642. The repressive regime also saw street entertainers jailed. Charles II's ascension to the throne ended the interregnum, Puritan legislation was declared null and void, and a more tolerant period of art and culture was ushered in. William Langley of \"The Telegraph\" writes Punch and Judy \"owes much of its original success to the bleak killjoyism of Cromwell's England. Charles II's resumption of the throne in 1660 unleashed a huge public demand for popular entertainment\". The diarist Samuel Pepys observed a marionette show featuring an early version of the Punch character in Covent Garden in London. It was performed by Italian puppet showman Pietro Gimonde, a.k.a. \"Signor Bologna\", one of many entertainers from continental Europe who came to England following the restoration. Pepys described the event in his diary as \"an Italian puppet play, that is within the rails there, which is very pretty\". \nIn the Punch and Judy show, Punch speaks in a distinctive squawking voice, produced by a contrivance known as a \"swazzle\" or \"swatchel\" which the professor holds in his mouth, transmitting his gleeful cackle. This gives Punch a vocal quality as though he were speaking through a kazoo. Joan's name was changed to Judy because \"Judy\" was easier to enunciate with the swazzle than \"Joan\". So important is Punch's signature sound that it is a matter of some controversy within Punch and Judy circles as to whether a \"non-swazzled\" show can be considered a true Punch and Judy Show. Other characters do not use the swazzle, so the Punchman has to switch back and forth while still holding the device in his mouth.\nPunch and Judy shows were traditionally marionette shows when they were brought over from Italy, but were later reinvented in the glove puppet style to accommodate the characters' violent movements without the obstruction of marionette strings. Glove puppets were often operated by placing the thumb in one arm, the middle, ring, and little fingers in the other arm, and the index finger in the head.\nIn the early 18th century, the puppet theatre starring Punch was at its height, with showman Martin Powell attracting sizable crowds at both his \"Punch's Theatre\" at Covent Garden and earlier in provincial Bath, Somerset. Powell has been credited with being \"largely responsible for the form taken by the drama of Punch and Judy\". In 1721, a puppet theatre opened in Dublin that ran for decades. The cross-dressing actress Charlotte Charke ran the successful but short-lived Punch's Theatre in the Old Tennis Court at St. James's, Westminster, presenting adaptations of Shakespeare as well as plays by herself, her father Colley Cibber, and her friend Henry Fielding. Fielding eventually ran his own puppet theatre under the pseudonym Madame de la Nash to avoid the censorship concomitant with the theatre Licensing Act 1737.\nPunch was extremely popular in Paris and, by the end of the 18th century, he was also playing in Britain's former American colonies, where George Washington, a fan of the show, bought tickets. However, marionette productions were expensive and cumbersome to mount and transport, presented in empty halls, the back rooms of taverns, or within large tents at England's yearly agricultural events at Bartholomew Fair and Mayfair. In the latter half of the 18th century, marionette companies began to give way to glove-puppet shows, performed from within a narrow, lightweight booth by one puppeteer, usually with an assistant, or \"bottler\", to gather a crowd and collect money. These shows might travel through country towns or move from corner to corner along busy London streets, giving many performances in a single day. The character of Punch adapted to the new format, going from a stringed comedian who might say outrageous things to a more aggressive glove-puppet who could do outrageous\u2014and often violent\u2014things to the other characters. \nThe mobile puppet booth of the late 18th- and early 19th-century Punch and Judy glove-puppet show could be easily fitted-up and was originally covered in checked bed ticking or whatever inexpensive cloth might come to hand. Later Victorian booths were gaudier affairs, particularly those used for Christmas parties and other indoor performances. In the 20th century, however, red-and-white-striped puppet booths became iconic features on the beaches of many English seaside and summer holiday resorts.\nA more substantial change came over time to the show's target audience. The show was originally intended for adults, but it changed into primarily a children's entertainment in the late Victorian era. Ancient members of the show's cast ceased to be included, such as the Devil and Punch's mistress \"Pretty Polly\", when they came to be seen as inappropriate for young audiences.\nThe story changes, but some phrases remain the same for decades or even centuries. For example, Punch dispatches his foes each in turn and still squeaks his famous catchphrase: \"\"That's\" the way to do it!\" The term \"pleased as Punch\" is derived from Punch and Judy; specifically, Mr Punch's characteristic sense of gleeful self-satisfaction.\nModern British performances of Punch and Judy are no longer exclusively the traditional seaside children's entertainments which they had become. They can now be seen at carnivals, festivals, birthday parties, and other celebratory occasions. The association of Punch with the seaside, however, is still very strong, as demonstrated by Wisbech Town council's annual Wis-BEACH day each summer: \"all the seaside favourites are on show, including a donkey, deck chairs, Punch and Judy and fish and chips\".\nCharacters.\nThe characters in a Punch and Judy show are not fixed. They are similar to the cast of a soap opera or a folk tale such as Robin Hood: the principal characters must appear, but the lesser characters are included at the discretion of the performer. New cast may be added and older cast dropped as the tradition changes.\nAlong with Punch and Judy, the cast of characters usually includes their baby, a hungry crocodile, a clown, an officious policeman, and a prop string of sausages. The devil and the generic hangman Jack Ketch may still make their appearances but, if so, Punch will always get the better of them. The cast of a typical Punch and Judy show today will include:\nCharacters once regular but now occasional include:\nOther characters included Boxers, Chinese Plate Spinners, topical figures, a trick puppet with an extending neck (the \"Courtier\"), and a monkey. A live Toby the Dog was once a regular featured novelty routine, sitting on the playboard and performing \"with\" the puppets.\nPunch wears a brightly coloured (traditionally red) jester's motley and sugarloaf hat with a tassel. He is a hunchback whose hooked nose almost meets his curved, jutting chin. He carries a stick (called a slapstick) as large as himself, which he freely uses upon most of the other characters in the show. Judy wears an apron, a blue dress, and a bonnet and frequently tries to tell Punch off when he uses the slapstick.\nStory.\nGlyn Edwards has likened the story of Punch and Judy to the story of Cinderella. He points out that there are parts of the Cinderella story which everyone knows, namely the cruel step sisters, the invitation to the ball, the handsome prince, the fairy godmother, Cinderella's dress turning to rags at midnight, the glass slipper left behind, the prince searching for its owner, and the happy ending. None of these elements can be omitted and the famous story still be told. The same principle applies to Punch and Judy. Everyone knows that Punch mishandles the baby, that Punch and Judy quarrel and fight, that a policeman comes for Punch and gets a taste of his stick, that Punch has a gleeful run-in with a variety of other figures and takes his stick to them all, that eventually he faces his final foe (which might be a hangman, the devil, a crocodile, or a ghost). Edwards contends that a proper Punch and Judy show requires these elements or the audience will feel let down.\nPeter Fraser writes, \"the drama developed as a succession of incidents which the audience could join or leave at any time, and much of the show was impromptu.\" This was elaborated by George Speaight, who explained that the plotline \"is like a story compiled in a parlour game of Consequences\u00a0... the show should, indeed, not be regarded as a story at all but a succession of encounters.\" Robert Leach makes it clear that \"the story is a conceptual entity, not a set text: the means of telling it, therefore, are always variable.\" Rosalind Crone asserts that the story needed to be episodic so that passersby on the street could easily join or leave the audience during a performance.\nMuch emphasis is often placed on the first printed script of Punch and Judy, in 1827. It was based on a show by travelling performer Giovanni Piccini, illustrated by George Cruikshank, and written by John Payne Collier. This is the only surviving script of a performance, and its accuracy is questioned. The performance was stopped frequently to allow Collier and Cruikshank to write and sketch and, in the words of Speaight, Collier is someone of whom \"the full list of his forgeries has not yet been reckoned, and the myths he propagated are still being repeated. (His) 'Punch and Judy' is to be warmly welcomed as the first history of puppets in England, but it is also sadly to be examined as the first experiment of a literary criminal.\"\nThe tale of Punch and Judy varies from puppeteer to puppeteer, as previously with Punchinello and Joan, and it has changed over time. Nonetheless, the skeletal outline is often recognizable. It typically involves Punch behaving outrageously, struggling with his wife Judy and the baby, and then triumphing in a series of encounters with the forces of law and order (and often the supernatural), interspersed with jokes and songs.\nTypical 21st-century performance.\nA typical show as performed currently in the UK will start with the arrival of Mr. Punch, followed by the introduction of Judy. They may well kiss and dance before Judy requests Mr. Punch to look after the baby. Punch will fail to carry out this task appropriately. It is rare for Punch to hit his baby these days, but he may well sit on it in a failed attempt to \"babysit\", or drop it, or even let it go through a sausage machine. In any event, Judy will return, will be outraged, will fetch a stick, and the knockabout will commence. A policeman will arrive in response to the mayhem and will himself be felled by Punch's stick. All this is carried out at breakneck farcical speed with much involvement from a gleefully shouting audience. From here on anything goes.\nJoey the Clown might appear and suggest, \"It's dinner time.\" This will lead to the production of a string of sausages, which Mr. Punch must look after, although the audience will know that this really signals the arrival of a crocodile whom Mr. Punch might not see until the audience shouts out and lets him know. Punch's subsequent comic struggle with the crocodile might then leave him in need of a Doctor who will arrive and attempt to treat Punch by walloping him with a stick until Punch turns the tables on him. Punch may next pause to count his \"victims\" by laying puppets on the stage, only for Joey the Clown to move them about behind his back in order to frustrate him. A ghost might then appear and give Mr. Punch a fright before it too is chased off with a stick.\nIn older productions, a hangman would arrive to punish Mr. Punch, only to himself be tricked into sticking his head in the noose. \"Do you do the hanging?\" is a question often asked of performers. Some will include it where circumstances warrant (such as for an adult audience) but most do not. Finally, the show will often end with the Devil arriving for Mr. Punch (and possibly threatening his audience as well). Punch\u2014in his final gleefully triumphant moment\u2014will win his fight with the Devil, bring the show to a rousing conclusion, and earn a round of applause.\nPlots reflect their own era.\nPunch and Judy might follow no fixed storyline, as with the tales of Robin Hood, but there are episodes common to many recorded versions. It is these set piece encounters or \"routines\" which are used by performers to construct their own Punch and Judy shows. A visit to a Punch and Judy Festival at Punch's \"birthplace\" in London's Covent Garden will reveal a whole variety of changes that are wrung by puppeteers from this basic material. Scripts have been published at different times since the early 19th century, but none can be claimed as the definitive traditional script of Punch and Judy. Each printed script reflects the era in which it was performed and the circumstances under which it was printed.\nThe various episodes of the show are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy\u2014often provoking shocked laughter\u2014and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Just as the Victorian version of the show drew on the morality of its day, so also the Punch &amp; Judy College of Professors considers that the 20th- and 21st-century versions of the tale is used as a vehicle for grotesque visual comedy and a sideways look at contemporary society.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In my opinion the street Punch is one of those extravagant reliefs from the realities of life which would lose its hold upon the people if it were made moral and instructive. I regard it as quite harmless in its influence, and as an outrageous joke which no one in existence would think of regarding as an incentive to any kind of action or as a model for any kind of conduct. It is possible, I think, that one secret source of pleasure very generally derived from this performance\u2026 is the satisfaction the spectator feels in the circumstance that likenesses of men and women can be so knocked about, without any pain or suffering.\u2014\u200a\nAn awareness of the prevalence of domestic abuse, and how Punch and Judy could be seen to make light of this, has caused changes in Punch and Judy performances in the UK and other English-speaking countries. The show continues to be seen in England, Wales, and Ireland\u2014and also in Canada, the United States, the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In 2001, the characters were honoured in the UK with a set of British commemorative postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. In a 2006 UK poll, the public voted Punch and Judy onto the list of icons of England. In 2024, a new version of the show was staged at London's Covent Garden. It was developed as part of the Judy Project, a three year study of the roles that women have played in the tradition of puppetry, by a University of Exeter team. The violence in this version of the show is directed more towards institutions of authority rather than any individuals, and Judy questions the treatment she has received from Punch over hundreds of years.\nComedy.\nDespite Punch's unapologetic murders throughout the performances, it is still considered a comedy. The humour is aided by a few things. Rosalind Crone suggests that, since the puppets are carved from wood, their facial expressions cannot change, but are stuck in the same exaggerated pose, which helps to deter any sense of realism and to distance the audience. The use of the swazzle also helps to create humour, and that the swazzled sound of Punch's voice takes the cruelty out of Punch. According to Crone, a third aspect that helped make the violence humorous was that Punch's violence toward his wife was prompted by her own violence toward him. In this aspect, he retains some of his previous hen-pecked persona. This would suggest that, since Punch was merely acting violently out of self-defence, it was okay. This is a possible explanation for the humour of his violence toward his wife, and even towards others who may have somehow \"had it coming.\" This suggestion better explains the humour of the violence toward the baby. Other characters that had to incur the wrath of Punch varied depending on the punchman, but the most common were the foreigner, the blind man, the publican, the constable, and the devil.\nPublished scripts.\nPunch is primarily an oral tradition, adapted by a succession of exponents from live performances rather than authentic scripts, and in constant evolution. They exist, however, in some early published scripts of varying authenticity.\nIn 1828, the critic John Payne Collier published a Punch and Judy script under the title \"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy\". The script was illustrated by the well-known caricaturist George Cruikshank. Collier said his script was based on the version performed by the \"professor\" Giovanni Piccini in the early 19th century, and Piccini himself had begun performing in the streets of London in the late 18th century. The Collier/Cruickshank \"Punch\" has been republished in facsimile several times. Collier's later career as a literary forger has cast some doubt on the authenticity of the script, which is rather literary in style and may well have been tidied up from the rough-and-tumble street-theatre original.\nA transcript of a typical Punch and Judy show in London may be found in Henry Mayhew's \"London Labour and the London Poor\".\nLegacy.\nLiterature.\nThe editors of the British satirical magazine \"Punch\", established in 1841, took the anarchic Mr Punch as their mascot, with the character also an inspiration for the magazine's name.\nThe 1913 short story \"The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance\" by M. R. James features supernatural events around a Punch and Judy show.\nRussell Hoban's 1980 novel \"Riddley Walker\" features a post-apocalyptic version of a Punch and Judy show.\nTerry Pratchett's 1993 short murder mystery story \"Theatre of Cruelty\" was inspired by Punch and Judy. It is set in his Discworld fantasy universe, and a Punch and Judy show is also referenced briefly in the 2003 Discworld novel \"Monstrous Regiment\".\nJasper Fforde's 2006 novel \"The Fourth Bear\" features Mr Punch and his wife Judy as major characters.\nThe 2011 novel \"Rivers of London\" (\"Midnight Riot\" in the US) by Ben Aaronovitch is embedded in the story of Punch and Judy to tell a story of a ghostly serial killer.\nMusical theatre.\nIn 2013, a musical inspired by the Punch and Judy characters premiered in Sweden at Arbisteatern in Norrk\u00f6ping, \"Carnival Tale ()\" written by Johan Christher Sch\u00fctz and Johan Pettersson. With a storyline loosely inspired by Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", a travelling carnival arrives in a small town and the foreign carnival's star jester Punch falls in love with the Mayor's daughter Judy. The original Swedish cast recording is freely available online and features Disney Channel Scandinavia presenter Linn\u00e9a K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m as Judy. The story and songs originate from a pop band called \"Punch and Judy Show\", started by Sch\u00fctz and Pettersson in the late 1990s.\nFilm.\nGeorge Pal would adapt the Punch and Judy archetypes for two \"Puppetoon\" shorts in the form of two younger characters named \"Punchy and Judy.\" In there first short \"A Hatful of Dreams,\" Punchy receives a magical hat from a talking horse that he uses to dazzle Judy, and in there second short \"Together in the Weather,\" the two are reimagined as figures on a \"weather clock\" who live in two different houses. Punchy and Judy would also appear regularly in numerous \"Puppetoon\" comic books.\nA performance of Punch and Judy features prominently in the 1963 film \"Charade\" directed by Stanley Donen starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn with the two lead characters watching the show while the inspector lurks nearby. The film's composer Henry Mancini also recorded a song titled \"Punch and Judy\" for the film soundtrack.\n\"Judy and Punch\" is a 2019 Australian film written and directed by Mirrah Foulkes which retells the plot of the puppet show as a black comedy-drama. It stars Damon Herriman as \"Punch\" and Mia Wasikowska as \"Judy\". The film first premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The plot reimagines the classic puppet show as a revenge tale, in which Judy and Punch are married puppeteers in the fictional town of Seaside, with a popular show about themselves. Following the traditional element of the show, Punch's carelessness leads to the death of their baby, prompting a fight between him and Judy. Having been thought dead after Punch's beating, Judy survives with the help of village outcasts and decides to enact her revenge on her husband, who has scapegoated their servants. The film took Best Original Music Score and Best Actor (Herriman) at the 9th AACTA Awards, and had seven other nominations.\nSong.\nPunch is faithfully celebrated in the 1977 UK novelty hit \"Naughty Naughty Naughty\", in which Joy Sarney interacts romantically with an authentic Mr Punch, complete with swazzle, stick, and his traditional catch phrases including \"That's the way to do it\" and \"Oh no it isn't\". The song made it into the top 30 of the UK Singles Chart and was performed on the BBC television series \"Top of the Pops\". \"Naughty Naughty Naughty\" remains Sarney's only hit.\nThe British band Marillion had a UK Top 40 single called \"Punch and Judy\" in 1984. American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith included a song titled after the show on his 1997 album, \"Either/Or\". The show is also referenced in Jack Stauber's \"Good Morning Blondie\", Blondie resembling a puppet and having an unhealthy relationship with the singing character. The show provides the title for XTC's unreleased 1981 single which treats the traditional Punch and Judy narrative as a metaphor for real life domestic abuse.\nTelevision.\nPunch and Judy appear as Joker's oversized henchmen in \"The Batman\" television series. They made their first appearance in DC Comics in 1945, in \"Batman\" #31.\nIn Japanese anime \"Cowboy Bebop\", there is a show called \"Big Shot\" where the two anchors are named Punch and Judy.\nPunch and Judy make a small appearance in the 1983 Doctor Who episode Snake Dance. In which Mr. Punch is attacked by a snake.\nVideo games.\nA video game called \"Punchy\" was released for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 home computers in the 1980s. In the game, Punch holds Judy hostage in the booth, and the player takes the role of Bobby the policeman who has to rescue her, overcoming custard pies, tomatoes and pits, as well as tackling Mr Punch himself.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23014", "revid": "9505858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23014", "title": "Poker", "text": "Card game\nPoker is a family of comparing card games in which players wager over which hand is best according to that specific game's rules. It is played worldwide, with varying rules in different places. While the earliest known form of the game was played with just 20 cards, today it is usually played with a standard 52-card deck, although in countries where short packs are common, it may be played with 32, 40 or 48 cards. Thus poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number dealt face up or face down and the number shared by all players, but all have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting.\nIn most modern poker games, the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the \"blind\" or \"ante\"). In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or \"call\") the maximum previous bet, or fold, losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also \"raise\" (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.\nWith the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has a positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability, psychology and game theory.\nPoker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the 21st century, and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.\nHistory.\nWhile poker's exact origin is the subject of debate, many game scholars point to the French game Poque and the Iranian game As-Nas as possible early inspirations. For example, in the 1937 edition of Foster's Complete Hoyle, R. F. Foster wrote that \"the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of As-Nas.\" However, in the 1990s the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas began to be challenged by gaming historians including David Parlett. What is certain, however, is that poker was popularized in the American South in the early 19th century, as gambling riverboats in the Mississippi River and around New Orleans during the 1830s helped spread the game. One early description of poker that was played on a steamboat in 1829 is recorded by the English actor, Joe Cowell. The game was played with twenty cards ranking from Ace (high) to Ten (low).\nIn contrast to this version of poker, seven-card stud only appeared in the middle of the 19th century, and was largely spread by the US military. It became a staple in many casinos following World War II and grew in popularity with the advent of the World Series of Poker in the 1970s.\nTexas hold 'em and other community card games began to dominate the gambling scenes over the next couple of decades. The televising of poker was a particularly strong influence increasing the popularity of the game during the turn of the millennium, resulting in the poker boom a few years later between 2003 and 2006. Today the game has grown to become an extremely popular pastime worldwide.\nGameplay.\nStraight flush\nFour of a kind\n Examples of top poker hand categories\nIn casual play, the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a \"dealer button\" (or \"buck\"). In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table, one at a time.\nOne or more players are usually required to make forced bets, usually either an \"ante\" or a \"blind bet\" (sometimes both). The dealer shuffles the cards, the player on the chair to their right cuts, and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to their left. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.\nAt any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to \"call\" (match) the bet, and all opponents instead \"fold\", the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes bluffing possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, distinguishing it from other vying games and from other games that use poker hand rankings.\nAt the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown, in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts. There are 10 different kinds of poker hands, such as straight flush and four of a kind.\nVariants.\nPoker has many variations, all following a similar pattern of play and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy. There are four main families of variants, largely grouped by the protocol of card-dealing and betting:\nThere are several methods for defining the structure of betting during a hand of poker. The three most common structures are known as \"fixed-limit,\" \"pot-limit,\" and \"no-limit.\" In fixed-limit poker, betting and raising must be done by standardized amounts. For instance, if the required bet is X, an initial bettor may only bet X; if a player wishes to raise a bet, they may only raise by X. In pot-limit poker, a player may bet or raise any amount up to the size of the pot. When calculating the maximum raise allowed, all previous bets and calls, including the intending raiser's call, are first added to the pot. The raiser may then raise the previous bet by the full amount of the pot. In no-limit poker, a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet. In all games, if a player does not have enough betting chips to fully match a bet, they may go \"all-in,\" allowing them to show down their hand for the number of chips they have remaining.\nWhile typical poker games award the pot to the highest hand as per the standard ranking of poker hands, there are variations where the lowest ranked hand wins. In such games the best hand contains the lowest cards rather than the highest cards; some variations may be further complicated by whether or not hands such as flushes and straights are considered in the hand rankings. There are also games where the highest and lowest hands divide the pot between them, known as \"high low split\" games.\nOther games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as \"poker\". Video poker is a single-player video game that functions much like a slot machine; most video poker machines play draw poker, where the player bets, a hand is dealt, and the player can discard and replace cards. Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player's initial bet.\nStrip poker is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets. Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds, strip poker can be played with any form of poker; however, it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds, like five card draw.\nAnother game with the \"poker\" name, but with a vastly different mode of play, is called \"acey deucey\" or \"red dog\" poker. This game is more similar to blackjack in its layout and betting; each player bets against the house, and then is dealt two cards. For the player to win, the third card dealt (after an opportunity to raise the bet) must have a value in-between the first two. Payout is based on the odds that this is possible, based on the difference in values of the first two cards.

The authors claimed that Cepheus would lose at most 0.001 big blinds per game on average against its worst-case opponent, and the strategy is thus so \"close to optimal\" that \"it can't be beaten with statistical significance within a lifetime of human poker playing.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are two main approaches for implementing a programming language \u2013 compilation, where programs are compiled ahead-of-time to machine code, and interpretation, where programs are directly executed. In addition to these two extremes, some implementations use hybrid approaches such as just-in-time compilation and bytecode interpreters.\nThe design of programming languages has been strongly influenced by computer architecture, with most imperative languages designed around the ubiquitous von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, modern languages often hide hardware details via abstraction in an effort to enable better software with less effort.\nRelated.\nProgramming languages have some similarity to natural languages in that they can allow communication of ideas between people. That is, programs are generally human-readable and can express complex ideas. However, the kinds of ideas that programming languages can express are ultimately limited to the domain of computation.\nThe term \"computer language\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"programming language\" but some contend they are different concepts. Some contend that programming languages are a subset of computer languages. Some use \"computer language\" to classify a language used in computing that is not considered a programming language. Some regard a programming language as a theoretical construct for programming an abstract machine, and a computer language as the subset thereof that runs on a physical computer, which has finite hardware resources. \nJohn C. Reynolds emphasizes that a formal specification language is as much a programming language as is a language intended for execution. He argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.\nHistory.\nEarly developments.\nThe first programmable computers were invented during the 1940s, and with them, the first programming languages. The earliest computers were programmed in first-generation programming languages (1GLs), machine language (simple instructions that could be directly executed by the processor). This code was very difficult to debug and was not portable between different computer systems. In order to improve the ease of programming, assembly languages (or second-generation programming languages\u20142GLs) were invented, diverging from the machine language to make programs easier to understand for humans, although they did not increase portability.\nInitially, hardware resources were scarce and expensive, while human resources were cheaper. Therefore, cumbersome languages that were time-consuming to use, but were closer to the hardware for higher efficiency were favored. The introduction of high-level programming languages (third-generation programming languages\u20143GLs)\u2014revolutionized programming. These languages abstracted away the details of the hardware, instead being designed to express algorithms that could be understood more easily by humans. For example, arithmetic expressions could now be written in symbolic notation and later translated into machine code that the hardware could execute. In 1957, Fortran (FORmula TRANslation) was invented. Often considered the first compiled high-level programming language, Fortran has remained in use into the twenty-first century.\n1960s and 1970s.\nAround 1960, the first mainframes\u2014general purpose computers\u2014were developed, although they could only be operated by professionals and the cost was extreme. The data and instructions were input by punch cards, meaning that no input could be added while the program was running. The languages developed at this time therefore are designed for minimal interaction. After the invention of the microprocessor, computers in the 1970s became dramatically cheaper. New computers also allowed more user interaction, which was supported by newer programming languages.\nLisp, implemented in 1958, was the first functional programming language. Unlike Fortran, it supported recursion and conditional expressions, and it also introduced dynamic memory management on a heap and automatic garbage collection. For the next decades, Lisp dominated artificial intelligence applications. In 1978, another functional language, ML, introduced inferred types and polymorphic parameters.\nAfter ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language) was released in 1958 and 1960, it became the standard in computing literature for describing algorithms. Although its commercial success was limited, most popular imperative languages\u2014including C, Pascal, Ada, C++, Java, and C#\u2014are directly or indirectly descended from ALGOL 60. Among its innovations adopted by later programming languages included greater portability and the first use of context-free, BNF grammar. Simula, the first language to support object-oriented programming (including subtypes, dynamic dispatch, and inheritance), also descends from ALGOL and achieved commercial success. C, another ALGOL descendant, has sustained popularity into the twenty-first century. C allows access to lower-level machine operations more than other contemporary languages. Its power and efficiency, generated in part with flexible pointer operations, comes at the cost of making it more difficult to write correct code.\nProlog, designed in 1972, was the first logic programming language, communicating with a computer using formal logic notation. With logic programming, the programmer specifies a desired result and allows the interpreter to decide how to achieve it.\n1980s to 2000s.\nDuring the 1980s, the invention of the personal computer transformed the roles for which programming languages were used. New languages introduced in the 1980s included C++, a superset of C that can compile C programs but also supports classes and inheritance. Ada and other new languages introduced support for concurrency. The Japanese government invested heavily into the so-called fifth-generation languages that added support for concurrency to logic programming constructs, but these languages were outperformed by other concurrency-supporting languages.\nDue to the rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the 1990s, new programming languages were introduced to support Web pages and networking. Java, based on C++ and designed for increased portability across systems and security, enjoyed large-scale success because these features are essential for many Internet applications. Another development was that of dynamically typed scripting languages\u2014Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby\u2014designed to quickly produce small programs that coordinate existing applications. Due to their integration with HTML, they have also been used for building web pages hosted on servers.\n2000s to present.\nDuring the 2000s, there was a slowdown in the development of new programming languages that achieved widespread popularity. One innovation was service-oriented programming, designed to exploit distributed systems whose components are connected by a network. Services are similar to objects in object-oriented programming, but run on a separate process. C# and F# cross-pollinated ideas between imperative and functional programming. After 2010, several new languages\u2014Rust, Go, Swift, Zig and Carbon \u2014competed for the performance-critical software for which C had historically been used. Most of the new programming languages use static typing while a few numbers of new languages use dynamic typing like Ring and Julia.\nSome of the new programming languages are classified as visual programming languages like Scratch, LabVIEW and PWCT. Also, some of these languages mix between textual and visual programming usage like Ballerina. Also, this trend lead to developing projects that help in developing new VPLs like Blockly by Google. Many game engines like Unreal and Unity added support for visual scripting too.\nDefinition.\nA language can be defined in terms of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), and often is defined via a formal language specification. \nSyntax.\nA programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, some programming languages are graphical, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.\nThe syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.\nThe programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions (for lexical structure) and Backus\u2013Naur form (for grammatical structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on Lisp:\nexpression ::= atom | list\natom ::= number | symbol\nnumber ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+\nsymbol ::= ['A'-'Z\"a'-'z'].*\nlist ::= '(' expression* ')'\nThis grammar specifies the following:\nThe following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3.\nNot all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit undefined behavior. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.\nUsing natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:\nThe following C language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation codice_4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and codice_5 is not defined because the value of codice_6 is the null pointer):\ncomplex *p = NULL;\ncomplex abs_p = sqrt(*p \u00bb 4 + p-&gt;im);\nIf the type declaration on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on the undefined variable codice_6 during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.\nThe grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are context-free grammars. Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution. In contrast to Lisp's macro system and Perl's codice_8 blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.\nSemantics.\n B, A \\downarrow B, \\overline{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;\n | XNOR | formula_1\n | \u2514 equivalent | formula_2\n | XOR | formula_3\n | \u2514 nonequivalent | formula_4\n | implies | formula_5\n | nonimplication\u00a0(NIMPLY) | formula_6\n | converse | formula_7\n | converse nonimplication | formula_8\n\"Semantics\" refers to the meaning of content that conforms to a language's syntax.\nStatic semantics.\nStatic semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms. For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct. Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system. Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics. Programming languages such as Java and C# have definite assignment analysis, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their respective static semantics.\nDynamic semantics.\nOnce data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements. The \"dynamic semantics\" (also known as \"execution semantics\") of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research goes into formal semantics of programming languages, which allows execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.\nFeatures.\nA language provides features for the programmer for develop software. Some notable features are described below.\nType system.\nA data type is a set of allowable values and operations that can be performed on these values. Each programming language's type system defines which data types exist, the type of an expression, and how type equivalence and type compatibility function in the language.\nAccording to type theory, a language is fully typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable. In contrast, an untyped language, such as most assembly languages, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths. In practice, while few languages are fully typed, most offer a degree of typing. \nBecause different types (such as integers and floats) represent values differently, unexpected results will occur if one type is used when another is expected. Type checking will flag this error, usually at compile time (runtime type checking is more costly). With strong typing, type errors can always be detected unless variables are explicitly cast to a different type. Weak typing occurs when languages allow implicit casting\u2014for example, to enable operations between variables of different types without the programmer making an explicit type conversion. The more cases in which this type coercion is allowed, the fewer type errors can be detected. \nCommonly supported types.\nEarly programming languages often supported only built-in, numeric types such as the integer (signed and unsigned) and floating point (to support operations on real numbers that are not integers). Most programming languages support multiple sizes of floats (often called float and double) and integers depending on the size and precision required by the programmer. Storing an integer in a type that is too small to represent it leads to integer overflow. The most common way of representing negative numbers with signed types is twos complement, although ones complement is also used. Other common types include Boolean\u2014which is either true or false\u2014and character\u2014traditionally one byte, sufficient to represent all ASCII characters. \nArrays are a data type whose elements, in many languages, must consist of a single type of fixed length. Other languages define arrays as references to data stored elsewhere and support elements of varying types. Depending on the programming language, sequences of multiple characters, called strings, may be supported as arrays of characters or their own primitive type. Strings may be of fixed or variable length, which enables greater flexibility at the cost of increased storage space and more complexity. Other data types that may be supported include lists, associative (unordered) arrays accessed via keys, records in which data is mapped to names in an ordered structure, and tuples\u2014similar to records but without names for data fields. Pointers store memory addresses, typically referencing locations on the heap where other data is stored.\nThe simplest user-defined type is an ordinal type, often called an enumeration, whose values can be mapped onto the set of positive integers. Since the mid-1980s, most programming languages also support abstract data types, in which the representation of the data and operations are hidden from the user, who can only access an interface. The benefits of data abstraction can include increased reliability, reduced complexity, less potential for name collision, and allowing the underlying data structure to be changed without the client needing to alter its code.\nStatic and dynamic typing.\nIn static typing, all expressions have their types determined before a program executes, typically at compile-time. Most widely used, statically typed programming languages require the types of variables to be specified explicitly. In some languages, types are implicit; one form of this is when the compiler can infer types based on context. The downside of implicit typing is the potential for errors to go undetected. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with functional languages such as Haskell and ML. \nWith dynamic typing, the type is not attached to the variable but only the value encoded in it. A single variable can be reused for a value of a different type. Although this provides more flexibility to the programmer, it is at the cost of lower reliability and less ability for the programming language to check for errors. Some languages allow variables of a union type to which any type of value can be assigned, in an exception to their usual static typing rules.\nConcurrency.\nIn computing, multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously. Many programming languages support instruction-level and subprogram-level concurrency. By the twenty-first century, additional processing power on computers was increasingly coming from the use of additional processors, which requires programmers to design software that makes use of multiple processors simultaneously to achieve improved performance. Interpreted languages such as Python and Ruby do not support the concurrent use of multiple processors. Other programming languages do support managing data shared between different threads by controlling the order of execution of key instructions via the use of semaphores, controlling access to shared data via monitor, or enabling message passing between threads.\nException handling.\nMany programming languages include exception handlers, a section of code triggered by runtime errors that can deal with them in two main ways:\nSome programming languages support dedicating a block of code to run regardless of whether an exception occurs before the code is reached; this is called finalization.\nThere is a tradeoff between increased ability to handle exceptions and reduced performance. For example, even though array index errors are common C does not check them for performance reasons. Although programmers can write code to catch user-defined exceptions, this can clutter a program. Standard libraries in some languages, such as C, use their return values to indicate an exception. Some languages and their compilers have the option of turning on and off error handling capability, either temporarily or permanently.\nDesign and implementation.\nOne of the most important influences on programming language design has been computer architecture. Imperative languages, the most commonly used type, were designed to perform well on von Neumann architecture, the most common computer architecture. In von Neumann architecture, the memory stores both data and instructions, while the CPU that performs instructions on data is separate, and data must be piped back and forth to the CPU. The central elements in these languages are variables, assignment, and iteration, which is more efficient than recursion on these machines. \nMany programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. The birth of programming languages in the 1950s was stimulated by the desire to make a universal programming language suitable for all machines and uses, avoiding the need to write code for different computers. By the early 1960s, the idea of a universal language was rejected due to the differing requirements of the variety of purposes for which code was written. \nTradeoffs.\nDesirable qualities of programming languages include readability, writability, and reliability. These features can reduce the cost of training programmers in a language, the amount of time needed to write and maintain programs in the language, the cost of compiling the code, and increase runtime performance. \nProgramming language design often involves tradeoffs. For example, features to improve reliability typically come at the cost of performance. Increased expressivity due to a large number of operators makes writing code easier but comes at the cost of readability.\nNatural-language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. Edsger W. Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs. Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea.\nSpecification.\nThe specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be.\nA programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:\nImplementation.\nAn implementation of a programming language is the conversion of a program into machine code that can be executed by the hardware. The machine code then can be executed with the help of the operating system. The most common form of interpretation in production code is by a compiler, which translates the source code via an intermediate-level language into machine code, known as an executable. Once the program is compiled, it will run more quickly than with other implementation methods. Some compilers are able to provide further optimization to reduce memory or computation usage when the executable runs, but increasing compilation time.\nAnother implementation method is to run the program with an interpreter, which translates each line of software into machine code just before it executes. Although it can make debugging easier, the downside of interpretation is that it runs 10 to 100 times slower than a compiled executable. Hybrid interpretation methods provide some of the benefits of compilation and some of the benefits of interpretation via partial compilation. One form this takes is just-in-time compilation, in which the software is compiled ahead of time into an intermediate language, and then into machine code immediately before execution.\nProprietary languages.\nAlthough most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain-specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.\nSome programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language, and Microsoft's C# programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a closed environment.\nMany proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include MATLAB, VBScript, and Wolfram Language. Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, Erlang was originally Ericsson's internal programming language.\nOpen source programming languages are particularly helpful for open science applications, enhancing the capacity for replication and code sharing.\nUse.\nThousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.\nIndividual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.\nProgramming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly what they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.\nA programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called primitives). \"Programming\" is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.\nPrograms for a computer might be executed in a batch process without any human interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the \"commands\" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface), without compiling, it is called a scripting language.\nMeasuring language usage.\nDetermining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes; Fortran in scientific and engineering applications; Ada in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time, and embedded applications; and C in embedded applications and operating systems. Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.\nVarious methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:\nCombining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify.com reported the ten most popular programming languages (in descending order by overall popularity): Java, C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, VB .NET, R, PHP, and MATLAB.\nAs of June 2024, the top five programming languages as measured by TIOBE index are Python, C++, C, Java and C#. TIOBE provides a list of top 100 programming languages according to popularity and update this list every month.\nAccording to IEEE Spectrum staff, today's most popular programming languages may remain dominant because of how AI works. As a result, new languages will have a harder time gaining popularity since coders will not write many programs in them.\nDialects, flavors and implementations.\nA dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as Scheme and Forth, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate, or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new dialect. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a domain-specific language, often a subset. In the Lisp world, most languages that use basic S-expression syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly as do, say, Racket and Clojure. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The BASIC language has many dialects.\nClassifications.\nProgramming languages can be described per the following high-level yet sometimes overlapping classifications:\nAn imperative programming language supports implementing logic encoded as a sequence of ordered operations. Most popularly used languages are classified as imperative.\nA functional programming language supports successively applying functions to the given parameters. Although appreciated by many researchers for their simplicity and elegance, problems with efficiency have prevented them from being widely adopted.\nA logic programming language is designed so that the software, rather than the programmer, decides what order in which the instructions are executed.\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is characterized by features such as data abstraction, inheritance, and dynamic dispatch. OOP is supported by most popular imperative languages and some functional languages.\nAlthough a markup language is not a programming language per se, it might support integration with a programming language.\nThere are special-purpose languages that are not easily compared to other programming languages.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Poland has the extensive public services characteristic of most developed economies and is one of few countries in Europe to require no tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate education and with universal public healthcare that is free at a point of use. Since 1988, Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalisation but retained an advanced public welfare system. It ranks 19th worldwide in terms of GDP (PPP), 20th in terms of GDP (nominal), and 21st in the 2023 Economic Complexity Index. Among OECD nations, Poland has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 22.7% of GDP.\nThe largest component of Poland's economy is the service sector (62.3%), followed by industry (34.2%) and agriculture (3.5%). Following the economic reform of 1989, Poland's external debt has increased from $42.2 billion in 1989 to $365.2 billion in 2014. Poland shipped US$224.6 billion worth of goods around the globe in 2017, while exports increased to US$221.4 billion. The country's top export goods include machinery, electronic equipment, vehicles, furniture, and plastics. Poland was the only economy in the EU to avoid a recession during the 2008 financial crisis.\nAs of 2019, the Polish economy had been developing steadily for 28 years, a record high in the EU. This record was only surpassed by Australia in the world economy. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity has grown on average by 6% p.a. over the last 20 years, the highest in Central Europe. Poland's GDP has increased seven-fold since 1990. Poland's nominal GDP has increased by 500% since 2000. Poland became a one trillion dollar economy in September 2025.\nHistory.\nPoland has seen the largest increase in GDP per capita (more than 100%) both among the former Eastern Bloc countries, and compared to the EU-15 (around 45%). It has had uninterrupted economic growth since 1992, even after the 2008 financial crisis.\nBefore 1989.\nThis article discusses the economy of post-1989 Poland. For a historical overview see:\n1990\u20132009.\nThe Polish state steadfastly pursued a policy of economic liberalization throughout the 1990s, with positive results for economic growth but negative results for some sectors of the population. The privatization of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms has encouraged the development of the private business sector, which has been the main drive for Poland's economic growth. The agricultural sector remained constrained by structural problems, surplus labour, inefficient small farms, and a lack of investment. Restructuring and privatization of \"sensitive sectors\" (e.g. coal), has also been slow, but foreign investments in energy and steel have begun to turn the tide. Also, reforms in healthcare, education, the pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger than expected fiscal pressures. Improving this account deficit and tightening monetary policy, with a focus on inflation, are priorities for the Polish government. Further progress in public finance depends mainly on the reduction of public sector employment, and an overhaul of the tax code to incorporate farmers, who currently pay significantly lower taxes than other people with similar income levels.\n2008 financial crisis and Great Recession.\nSince the Great Recession, Poland's GDP has continued to grow. In 2009, the GDP for the European Union as a whole dropped by 4.5% while Polish GDP increased by 1.6%. As of November 2013, the size of the EU's economy remains below the pre-crisis level, while Poland's economy increased by a cumulative 16%. The major reasons for its success appear to be a large internal market (in terms of population it is sixth in the EU) and a business-friendly political climate. The economic reforms implemented after the fall of communism in the 1990s have also played a role; between 1989 and 2007 Poland's economy grew by 177%, faster than other countries in Eastern and Central Europe, while at the same time millions were left without work.\nHowever, the economic fluctuations of the business cycle did affect Poland's unemployment rate, which by early 2013 reached almost 11%. This level was still below European average and has begun falling subsequently. As of October 2017, Poland's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% according to Eurostat.\nEconomic growth.\nIn the period from 1989 to 2018, Poland's GDP increased by 826.96% and it was the best result in Europe. In the same period, Ireland's GDP grew by 789.43%, Slovakia's by 783.83% and the Czech Republic by 549.47%. In 1990, the Polish national income amounted to USD 65.978 billion, and by 2017 it had increased to USD 524.5 billion. Achieving these results was possible thanks to the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, the development of private entrepreneurship, but also the rapid increase in work efficiency and openness to foreign direct investments. In 2018, the Polish economy grew by 5.1% compared to 4.8% in 2017. Economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 in Poland amounted to 4.9% on an annual basis and compared to the third quarter, where GDP increased by 5.1%, it was slightly lower. During this period, investments increased by 6.7%, private consumption also increased by 4.3%, and domestic demand increased by 4.8%. The PMI index in January 2019 was 48.2 points and was higher than in December 2018 when it amounted to 47.6 points.\nData.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132024 (with IMF staff estimates in 2024\u20132030). Inflation under 5% is in green.\nLabour market and wages.\nUnemployment in Poland became a major problem after the Revolutions of 1989, which collapsed communism in Poland, although the economy previously had high levels of hidden unemployment. The unemployment rate then fell to 10% by the late 1990s and then increased again in the first few years of the 21st century, reaching a peak of 20% in 2002. It has since decreased, although unevenly. Since 2008 the unemployment rate in Poland has consistently been below European average.\nThe rate fell below 8% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2019 leading to a labour deficit.\nForeign trade and FDI.\nWith the collapse of the ruble-based COMECON trade bloc in 1991, Poland reoriented its trade. As early as 1996, 70% of its trade was with EU members. Neighbouring Germany is Poland's main trading partner today. Poland joined the European Union in May 2004. Before that, it fostered regional integration and trade through the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which included Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\nPoland is a founding member of the World Trade Organization. As a member of the European Union, it applies the common external tariff to goods from other countries including the United States. Poland's major imports are capital goods needed for industrial retooling and for manufacturing inputs. The country's exports also include machinery but are highly diversified. The most successful exports are furniture, foods, motor boats, light planes, hardwood products, casual clothing, shoes, and cosmetics. Germany is by far the biggest importer of Poland's exports as of 2013. In the agricultural sector, the biggest money-makers abroad include smoked and fresh fish, fine chocolate, dairy products, meats, and specialty breads, with the exchange rate conducive to export growth. Food exports amounted to 62 billion z\u0142oty in 2011, increasing by 17% from 2010. Most Polish exports to the U.S. receive tariff benefits under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) program. Poland ranks in the top 20 in the world both in terms of exports and imports, recording a clear trade surplus.\nPoland is less dependent on external trade than most other Central and Eastern European countries, but its volume of trade with Europe is still substantial. In 2011 the volume of trade (exports plus imports) with the Eurozone as share of GDP was 40%, a doubling from the mid 1990s. 30% of Poland's exports are to Germany and another 30% to the rest of Europe. There has been substantial increase in Poland's exports to Russia. However, in August 2014, exports of fruits and vegetables to Russia fell dramatically following its politically motivated ban by Moscow.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) was at 40% of GDP in 2010, a doubling over the level in 2000. Most FDI into Poland comes from France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Polish firms in turn have foreign investments primarily in Italy and Luxembourg. Most of the internal FDI is in manufacturing, which makes it susceptible to economic fluctuations in the source countries.\nThe UAE is Poland's largest trading partner in the Arab world.\nThe government offers investors various forms of state aid, such as CIT tax at the level of 19% and investment incentives in 14 Special Economic Zones (among others: income tax exemption, real estate tax exemption, competitive land prices), several industrial and technology parks, the possibility to benefit from the EU structural funds, brownfield and greenfield locations. According to the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the level of FDI inflow into Poland in 2006 amounted to \u20ac13.9 billion.\nAccording to an Ernst &amp; Young report, Poland ranks 7th in the world in terms of investment attractiveness. However, Ernst &amp; Young's 2010 European attractiveness survey reported that Poland saw a 52% decrease in FDI job creation and a 42% decrease in number of FDI projects since 2008. According to an OECD report, in 2004 Poland was one of the hardest-working nations in Europe. In 2010, the World Economic Forum ranked Poland near the bottom of OECD countries in terms of the clarity, efficiency, and neutrality of the legal framework used by firms to settle disputes.\nSectors.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], the Polish economy is dominated by the services sector, with 615,647 registered companies, followed by 329,255 companies in finance, insurance, and real estate and 176,149 companies in retail trade.\nProduction industries.\nBefore World War II, Poland's industrial base was concentrated in the coal, textile, chemical, machinery, iron, and steel sectors. Today it extends to fertilizers, petrochemicals, machine tools, electrical machinery, electronics, car manufacturing, and shipbuilding.\nPoland's industrial base suffered greatly during World War II, and many resources were directed toward reconstruction. The socialist economic system imposed in the late 1940s created large and unwieldy economic structures&lt;ref name=\"Poland 11/07\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; operated under a tight central command. In part because of this systemic rigidity, the economy performed poorly even in comparison with other economies in Central Europe.\nIn 1990, the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government began a comprehensive reform programme to replace the centralised command economy with a market-oriented system. While the results overall have been impressive, many large state-owned industrial enterprises, particularly the rail, mining, steel, and defence sectors, have remained resistant to change and the downsizing required to survive in a market-based economy.\nPharmaceuticals.\nThe pharmaceutical market is worth 50 billion PLN as of 2023[ [update]], an increase of 9.5% over the previous year.\nThe non-prescription medicine market, which accounts for about one-third of the total market value, was worth PLN 7.5bn in 2008. This value includes drugs and non-drugs such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, dressings, dental materials, diagnostic tests, and medical devices. The prescription medicines market was worth PLN 15.8bn.\nMining.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of rhenium, 5th largest producer of silver, the 13th largest producer of copper, the 14th largest producer of sulfur,and the 14th largest producer of salt.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture employs 8.2% of the workforce but contributes 3.8% to GDP, reflecting relatively low productivity. Unlike the industrial sector, Poland's agricultural sector remained largely in private hands during the Polish People's Republic. Most of the former state farms are now leased to farmer tenants. Lack of credit is hampering efforts to sell former state farmland. Currently, Poland's 2 million private farms occupy 90% of all farmland and account for roughly the same percentage of total agricultural production. Farms are small\u20148 hectares on average\u2014and often fragmented. Farms with an area exceeding 15 ha accounted for 9% of the total number of farms but cover 45% of total agricultural area. Over half of all farm households in Poland produce only for their own needs with little, if any, commercial sales.\nPoland is a net exporter of processed fruit and vegetables, meat, and dairy products. Processors often rely on imports to supplement domestic supplies of wheat, feed grains, vegetable oil, and protein meals, which are generally insufficient to meet domestic demand. However, Poland is the leading EU producer of potatoes and rye and is one of the world's largest producers of sugar beets and triticale. Poland is also a significant producer of rapeseed, grains, hogs, and cattle. Poland is the sixth-largest producer and exporter of apples in the entire world.\nTourism.\nAfter acceding to the EU in 2004, tourism grew in Poland. Most tourist attractions in Poland are connected with natural environment, historic sites, and cultural events. They draw millions of tourists every year from all around the world. According to Tourist Institute's data, Poland was visited by 15.7 million tourists in 2006, and by 15 million tourists in 2007, out of the total number of 66.2 million foreign visitors. In 2016 the number of arrivals to Poland amounted to 80.5 million. 17.5 million of this number are arrivals considered for tourism purposes (with at least one night's stay), making it the 16th most visited country in the world. The most popular cities are Krak\u00f3w, Warsaw, Gda\u0144sk, Wroc\u0142aw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144, Szczecin, Lublin, Toru\u0144, Sopot, Zakopane, and the Wieliczka Salt Mine. The best recreational destinations include Poland's Masurian Lake District, Baltic Sea coast, Tatra Mountains (the highest mountain range of the Carpathians), Sudetes, and Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest. Poland's main tourist offers consist of sightseeing within cities and out-of-town historical monuments, business trips, qualified tourism, agrotourism, mountain hiking (trekking), and climbing among others.\nFinancial sector.\nThe Polish banking sector is regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA).\nWhile transforming the country to a market-oriented economy during 1992\u201397, the government privatized some banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced legal reforms that made the sector competitive. These reforms, and the health and relative stability of the sector, attracted a number of strategic foreign investors. At the beginning of 2009, Poland's banking sector had 51 domestic banks, a network of 578 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign-owned banks. In addition, foreign investors had controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks, which made up 68% of the banking capital. Banks in Poland reacted to the 2008 financial crisis by restraining lending, raising interest rates, and strengthening balance sheets. Subsequently, the sector started lending again, with an increase of more than 4% expected in 2011.\nVenture capital.\nThe segment of the private equity market that finances early-stage high-risk companies, with the potential for fast growth, had 130 active firms in Poland (as of March 2019). Between 2009 and 2019, these entities have invested locally in over 750 companies, an average of 9 companies per portfolio. Since 2016, new legal institutions have been established for entities investing in enterprises in the seed or startup phase. In 2018, venture capital funds invested \u20ac in Polish startups (0.033% of GDP). As of March 2019, total assets managed by VC companies operating in Poland are estimated at \u20ac. The total value of investments of the Polish VC market is \u20ac.\nTransportation.\nPoland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities, the main railway station is located near a city centre and is well connected to the local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by Polish State Railways, part of state-run PKP Group. The rail network is very dense in western and northern Poland, while the eastern part of the country is less developed. The capital city, Warsaw, has the country's only rapid transit system: the Warsaw Metro.\nPoland's busiest airport is Warsaw Chopin Airport. Warsaw Chopin serves as the main international hub for Poland's flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines. In addition to Warsaw Chopin, Wroc\u0142aw, Gda\u0144sk, Katowice, Krak\u00f3w, and Pozna\u0144 all have international airports. In preparation for the Euro 2012 football championships jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine, a number of airports around the country were renovated and redeveloped. This included the building of new terminals with an increased number of jetways and stands at both Wroc\u0142aw Airport in Wroc\u0142aw and Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa Airport in Gda\u0144sk.\nPoland has 412,264\u00a0km (256,170\u00a0mi) of public roads. Polish public roads are categorised by administrative division, which include national roads, voivodeship roads, Powiat roads, and Gmina roads. Motorways and expressways are part of the national road network. As of May 2025, there are 5,205.5\u00a0km of motorways and expressways in use.\nMajor companies in Poland.\nSelection of major Polish companies including from the list of 500 largest companies in Poland compiled by magazine \"Polityka\":\nBudget and debt.\nThe public and private debt levels of Poland are below the European average (2017).\nGDP growth in Poland.\nRecent GDP growth (comparing to the same quarter of previous year): \nLocation.\nPoland has an excellent location for transporting locally made components or products to the rest of Europe. For example, when moving production from China, the new factory in Poland can move their goods in 24 hours to the most populated parts of Europe, and in 48 hours to all of Europe.\nPotential of the Polish economy in the EU.\nPoland, measured by the purchasing power parity index, is the sixth-largest economy in the European Union and the eighth-largest economy in Europe, slightly ahead of the Netherlands.\nPoland recorded GDP growth even during the 2008 financial crisis. The unemployment rate in the country remains very low and amounted to 5% in September 2023.\nAlthough the Polish economy is catching up with Western European countries, this has been a slow process. So far, taking into account the level of social development, Poland has managed to overtake Portugal. There is a great deal of variation between regions. Masovian Voivodeship is on a similar level to the richest regions of Spain and most regions of France (82% of the EU average). However, it should be remembered that the GDP of this voivodeship is mainly generated by Warsaw. Lower Silesian Voivodeship with a GDP of $16,000 is on par with Portugal and the regions of Spain and Greece. Subsequent voivodeships reached about 50% of the EU average, and the poorest voivodships of the eastern wall have GDP per capita comparable to Romania and Bulgaria.\nPolish capital has several large concerns in this region of Europe, i.e. PKN Orlen, which has its stations in Germany and Lithuania, Polsat, which also invests in Lithuania, the ITI Group. Poland has a highly developed road network, most of the A1, A2, A4 highways and expressways, including S6 and S7, are fully completed. The next ones are to be ready by 2023. Their construction by private companies is financed in part by the EU. In the coming years, Poland is to receive approximately EUR 4.5 billion for the modernisation of railways.\nPoland is one of the key immigration destinations in the EU, having attracted more non-EU immigrants, already in 2021 mostly from Ukraine, than any other EU country for a few consecutive years.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The state monopoly was implemented by the PPTiT which was subordinated to the Ministry of Communications. The telephony segments of that entity were spun-off and incorporated into Telekomunikacja Polska, which was later privatized and sold to Orange Polska. The Telecommunications Act of 1990 allowed the provision of telecommunication infrastructure and services by the former monopoly. After 2000, other operators were allowed to use TP's telecommunications infrastructure under Third-party Access.\nFrom the communist era Poland inherited an underdeveloped and outmoded system of telephones, with some areas (e.g. in the extreme South East) being served by manual exchanges. In December 2005 the last analog exchange was shut down. All telephone lines are now served by modern fully computerized exchanges (Siemens EWSD, Alcatel S12, Lucent 5ESS, Alcatel E10). The former state owned telephone monopoly (TPSA) has been mostly privatized, with France Telecom buying the largest share. Various other companies have entered the fixed phone market, but generally aiming for niches (e.g. Sferia with fixed wireless, Netia covering primarily business). Whilst prices have reduced and availability has increased considerably since the introduction of competition, there is little sign of TPSA's market share being seriously reduced.\nThere are three competing networks with similar market share, T-Mobile (T-Mobile and Heyah brands), Orange Polska (Orange and nju brands) and Plus (Plus and plush brands). The fourth network, Play, started offering UMTS network services in early 2007. \nAs of 2022, all mobile operators run nationwide LTE . Play, Plus, and Orange have nationwide UMTS coverage. Plus also offers full 5G coverage in most cities on 2.6 GHz \nThe auction for the 5G network in the n78 band has been ended and the commercial launch of the network is expected at the end of 2023\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23022", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23022", "title": "Transport in Poland", "text": " \nTransport in Poland involves air, water, road and rail transportation. The country has a large network of municipal public transport, such as buses, trams and the metro. As a country located at the 'cross-roads' of Europe, Poland is a nation with a large and increasingly modern network of transport infrastructure.\nThe country's most important waterway is the Vistula river. The largest seaports are the Port of Gda\u0144sk, the Port of Gdynia and the Port of Szczecin. Air travel is generally used for international travel, with many flights originating at Warsaw Chopin Airport. Railways connect all of Poland's major cities and the state-owned Polish State Railways (PKP) corporation, through its subsidiaries, runs a great number of domestic and international services of varying speed and comfort. In addition to this, five out of sixteen Polish voivodeships have their own regional rail service providers.\nRail transport.\nPoland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities the main railway station is located near a city centre and is well connected to the local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by PKP Group. The rail network is very dense in western and northern Poland, while eastern part of the country is less developed. The capital city, Warsaw, has the country's only rapid transit system: the Warsaw Metro.\nThe only high-speed rail line (though by most definitions, real high-speed rail only includes speeds over 200\u00a0km/h) in central-eastern Europe is the Central Rail Line (Poland), \"Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa\" (CMK). It has a length of , and was built in 1971\u20131977; it links Warsaw with Krak\u00f3w and Katowice. Most trains on the CMK operate at speeds up to , but since December 2014 new Alstom Pendolino ED250 trains operate on a 90\u00a0km section of the CMK at , and improvements under way should raise the authorized speed to on most of the line. In test runs on the CMK in November 2013 a new Pendolino ED250 train set a new Polish speed record of .\nOther high-speed lines:\n\"Projects\"\nThe Warsaw\u2013\u0141\u00f3d\u017a line is being upgraded to allow speed up to 160\u00a0km/h (in order to bind together the Warsaw\u2013\u0141\u00f3d\u017a agglomeration).\nPlans were made to construct a new high-speed line (350\u00a0km/h) from Warsaw to Pozna\u0144 and Wroc\u0142aw with forks in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Kalisz., but the project was cancelled in November 2011 due to its high cost.\nThe PKP Group is the fourth largest railway throughout Europe. Trains are run by its different subsidiaries.\nPassenger transport operators.\nThe following companies operate in Poland:\nNarrow-gauge railways.\nThere are hundreds of kilometres of , , , and narrow-gauge lines in Poland.\nThese railways are mostly in decline, some survive as a museum or tourist railways.\nFreight transport market.\nBroad-gauge railways.\nExcept for Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa, and a few very short stretches near border crossings, Poland uses the standard gauge for its railways. Therefore, Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym \"LHS\", English: \"Broad-gauge steelworks line\") in S\u0142awk\u00f3w is the longest broad-gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubiesz\u00f3w. It is the westernmost broad-gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad-gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.\nRail system.\nTotal: \nAs of December 2002 narrow-gauge railways were no longer owned or operated by PKP. They were transferred to regional authorities or became independent companies.\nRoad transport.\nPolish public roads are grouped into categories related to administrative division. Poland has of public roads, of which are unsurfaced (2021):\nIn recent years, the network has been improving and government spending on road construction recently saw a huge increase, due to rapid development of the country and the inflow of European Union funds for infrastructure projects.\nMotorways and expressways.\nPolish motorways and expressways are part of national roads network. As of December 2021, there are of motorways (\"autostrady\", singular - \"autostrada\") and of expressways (\"drogi ekspresowe\", singular - \"droga ekspresowa\").\n Motorways in Poland, (2021):&lt;br&gt;\nA1 | A2 | A4 | A6 | A8 | A18\n Expressways in Poland, (2021):&lt;br&gt;S1 | S2 | S3 | S5 |\nS6 | S7 | S8 | S10 |\nS11 | S12 | S14 | S16 | \nS17 | S19 | S22 |\nS51 | S52 | S61 | S74 | S79 | S86\nAir transport.\nThe most important airport in Poland is Warsaw 'Frederic Chopin' International Airport. Warsaw's airport is the main international hub for LOT Polish Airlines.\nIn addition to Warsaw Chopin, Wroc\u0142aw, Gda\u0144sk, Katowice, Krak\u00f3w and Pozna\u0144 all have international airports.\nIn preparation for the Euro 2012 football championships jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine, a number of airports around the country were renovated and redeveloped. This included the building of new terminals with an increased number of jetways and stands at both Wroc\u0142aw Airport and Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa Airport in Gda\u0144sk.\nAirlines.\nThere are a total of 8 Polish airline companies currently operating, with the most successful airline being LOT Polish Airlines, the flag carrier of Poland. It is also the only regularly scheduled airline in Poland.\n6 of the airlines are chartered airlines, including Buzz, Enter Air, LOT Charters, Skytaxi, SprintAir, and Smartwings Poland. SprintAir Cargo is also the main cargo airline in Poland.\nAirports.\nThe Polish airline market was until 2004 a closed market, with bilateral agreements between countries served from the national hub \u2013 Warsaw. The regional airports were mostly serving as spokes, and were controlled by PPL, the state-owned airport authority. However, in the 1990s it was decided to deregulate the airport market and abolish the dominant position of PPL. Nearly all local airports (apart from Zielona G\u00f3ra airport) became separate companies, with local governments involved in their management, which led to the partial decentralisation. Soon after opening of Polish sky for competition, flights \"avoiding\" the Warsaw hub became more common.\nThere are twelve passenger airports in operation, and there is also an airport Heringsdorf in German village Garz, 7 kilometers from Polish seaside spa \u015awinouj\u015bcie.\nInternational airports.\nList of airports in Poland\nThe following are the largest airports in Poland (In descending order for 2013):\nDomestic:\nAirports with paved runways:\nTotal: 84 (2005)\nAirports \u2013 with unpaved runways:\nTotal: 39 (2005)\nHeliports: 2 (2005)\nWater transport.\nThe country's most important waterway is the river Vistula. The largest seaports are the Port of Szczecin and Port of Gda\u0144sk.\nMarine transport in Poland has two main sub-groups, riverine and seaborne. On the Baltic Sea coast, a number of large seaports exist to serve the international freight and passenger trade; these are typically deep water ports and are able to serve very large ships, including the ro-ro ferries of Unity Line, Polferries and Stena Line which operate the Poland \u2013 Scandinavia passenger lines.\nRiverine services operate on almost all major Polish rivers and canals (such as the Danube\u2013Oder and Elbl\u0105g canals) as well as on domestic coastal routes.\nWaterways.\nPoland has of navigable rivers and canals (as of 2009).\nMerchant marine.\nTotal: 57 ships (1,000 GT or over) totaling 1,120,165 GT/\u00a0tonnes deadweight (DWT)\nShips by type:\nbulk 50, cargo 2, chemical tanker 2, roll-on/roll-off 1, short-sea passenger 2\nMunicipal transport.\nBus.\nMost Polish towns and cities have well-developed municipal bus services. Typically, a city possesses its own local bus service, however, in some cases they have private competitors operating on certain lines upon the agreement with local authorities.\nUntil the 1990s, interurban connections were operated by a single, state-owned company PKS. Since then, it has been broken into a number of independent national and municipal enterprises. In addition, several private operators emerged. There are two classes of service distinguished by vehicle length:\nWhile they often use the same bus stops, they tend to use different stations.\nTram.\nBigger cities run dense tram networks, which are the primary mean of public transport. Currently, there are 15 systems serving over 30 cities including Bydgoszcz, Gda\u0144sk, Katowice, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144, Szczecin, Warsaw and Wroc\u0142aw, with the total track length varying from (Silesian Interurbans) to less than (Tramways in Grudzi\u0105dz). A new network has been constructed in Olsztyn in 2015. See the list of town tramway systems in Poland\nSince the 1990s, a number of cities attempts to upgrade certain parts of their networks to the light rail standard (called \"szybkie tramwaje\", En. \"fast trams\"). The most notable investments are Pozna\u0144 Fast Tram and Krak\u00f3w Fast Tram with the underground premetro section.\nTrolleybus.\nTrolleybuses can be found in three cities: Gdynia (with some lines reaching Sopot), Lublin and Tychy.\nRapid transit.\nThe first metro line was opened in Warsaw in 1995. Part of the second line was opened in 2015. This is part of the country's rail transport infrastructure. There is an ongoing debate whether a new metro or premetro should be built in Krak\u00f3w. The current President of Krak\u00f3w, Aleksander Miszalski, supports the idea and has declared that first works will commence in 2028.\nCommuter trains.\nIn major Polish cities such as Warsaw and the Tricity area, Commuter (SKM) trains provide efficient connections between the city center and surrounding suburbs or satellite towns. In other cities like \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (served by \u0141KA) and Krak\u00f3w (served by SKA), similar commuter rail services operate under different names but follow the same principles and rules.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The public television broadcaster is \"Telewizja Polska\" (TVP), which runs two main channels, one regional channel and several thematic channels. The TVP is an important source of information for many Poles, in particular in small cities, though its popularity has been declining in recent years. In the private sector there are over 200 commercial TV broadcasters: the two leading one are Polsat and TVN.\nRadio is a popular medium in Poland. In addition to the public radio broadcaster, Polskie Radio (PR), there are over 200 licensed private radio outlets.\nHistory and political landscape.\nThe oldest Polish newspaper was Merkuriusz Polski, first published in 1661. A number of other dailies were established during the First Polish Republic, including the Monitor and Gazeta Warszawska.\nPublic radio service and the first national news agency were both founded at the beginning of the 20th century. The first TV broadcaster, Telewizja Polska, launched in 1952.\nDuring the Soviet-imposed communist regime the Stalinist press doctrine dominated and controlled the media. However the country instituted freedom of press since the fall of communism.\nThe main features of the media system of modern Poland are the product of the country's socio-political and economic post-communist transition. These features include: the privatisation of the press sector; the transformation of the state radio and television into public broadcasting services; influx of foreign capital into the media market and European integration of audiovisual media policies.Since the 1990s, Poland has developed a pluralistic but highly polarized media environment. The media landscape comprises, in addition to the public radio and television broadcasters, a variety of private media outlets, encompassing a broad political spectrum, from socially liberal to ultraconservative.\nIn the sector of print media, the newspaper with the largest circulation is \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", founded in 1989. Its founding father was Adam Michnik- a Communist-era dissident. The daily had a critical stance towards the Law and Justice Party (PiS) government. The second largest paper is \"Rzeczpospolita\", which has conservative traditions.\nThe two main business-oriented dailies are \"Dziennik Gazeta Prawna\" and \"Puls Biznesu\": they both have a narrow, professional readership and are typically not engaged in the country\u2019 political conflict. The two leading tabloids are \"Fakt\", owned by the Swiss-German media conglomerate Axel Springer, and \"Super Express\", owned by ZPR Media. These tabloids have a remarkable impact on public opinion.\nIn addition to national publications, there are several regional dailies: in this sector, the top competitors have sales comprised between 20,000 and 40,000 daily copies sold.\nIn the recent years, sales of both national and regional dailies have been declining.\nPolitical polarization also characterizes the weekly newsmagazine market. On the liberal side there is \"Newsweek Polska\" (the Polish edition of the \"Newsweek\"), followed by \"Polityka\". On the right side, there are newer titles\"Sieci\", \"Do Rzeczy\" and the older \"Gazeta Polska\". The right-wing weeklies do not form a uniform bloc.\nLegal framework.\nThe Polish constitution of 1997 guarantees freedom of the press and prohibits both preventive censorship and licensing requirements for the press. The media sector is regulated by the 1984 Polish Press Law and the 1992 Broadcasting Act, which have both been amended since then. The Broadcasting Act defines the rules for appointing the members of the National Broadcasting Council (\"Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji\", KRRiT) and its powers. According to the Constitution, the KRRiT's role is to \"safeguard the freedom of speech, the right to information, and the public interest in radio and television broadcasting\".\nEven though its members are not allowed to belong to political party or perform public activities, the KRRiT in practice has been politicized, with members somehow affiliated with political parties. Also the governments\u2019 reform attempts of the KRRiT have been largely politically driven. These attempts have been strengthened by the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) government which, after winning the parliamentary elections in October 2015, partly replaced the management at the public television and radio broadcasters.\nMedia polarisation.\nThe Polish media environment is highly polarized. Since 2015 elections, this polarization has become ever stronger. The cleavage concerns both PiS's controversial decisions and policies and diverging attitudes towards issues such as equal rights for LGBT people, refugees, the EU.\nPoland lacks the tradition of an editorially independent public service media: public radio and television broadcasters tend to favor those in power.\nPartisanship in the Polish media system goes hand in hand with bias among the journalists themselves. This bias is mirrored in the two major journalists's organizations that have different orientations: the Association of Polish Journalists (SDP), sympathetic toward the PiS government, and the Association of Journalists (TD), which is against the PiS's government.\nOn 7 December 2020 state-owned petroleum refinery and distributor PKN Orlen acquired media and press company \"Polska Press\" controlling large number of regional media portals and several regional newspapers. Together with previous acquisition of Polish newspaper distributor RUCH it creates a situation where regional media are owned and distributed by state-owned company raising concerns of media neutrality in Poland. On April 8, 2021, a Polish court has suspended the purchase of Polska Press by PKN Orlen.\nMedia ownership.\nForeign companies hold a dominant position in the Polish media market. This fact entered into the political debate, in particular since the PiS government took office. To contrast this, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, founder of the PiS and former Prime Minister, called for the media to be \"repolonized\" PiS politicians argued that foreign-owned media outlets pursue deliberately unfavorable coverage of the PiS's government with the aim of undermining it.\nPolish print media and radio outlets are mainly private and diversified in terms of ownership, however foreign owners control around three-quarters of the Polish media market. The main domestic competitor is Agora, which owns \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" and a number of magazines, radio stations, internet platforms, a publishing house and additional ventures.\nForeign ownership is very strong also in the regional media which are largely owned by the German Polska Press.\nTo counter foreign ownership in Polish media, in 2021, the PiS government submitted a bill that would ban non-European-Union citizens and companies from possessing a controlling stake in Polish media outlets. In August 11, 2021, The bill Lex TVN which forbids companies except those from the European Economic Area from holding more than a 49% stake in Polish radio and television stations passed the Sejm.\nMedia freedom and pluralism.\nIn recent years, according to Reporters Without Borders, in particular since the PiS went to power in 2015 and ended in 2023, media freedom in Poland has been significantly deteriorating.\nSeveral weeks after winning the 2015 parliamentary elections, the PiS passed a media law which gave the government direct control over public broadcasting. It also replaced journalists working in the public radio and TV stations and attempted to throttle several independent print media outlets, such as \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", \"Polityka\" and \"Newsweek Polska\" by restricting public advertising. According to Freedom House, this effort is part of a broader attempt to weaken checks and balances, silence independent voices and control the public sphere. PiS's control on the executive branch and the executive can undermine the independence of the judiciary and its aggressive attitude towards the Constitutional Tribunal has prompted accusations that it is undermining the rule of law in Poland. In January 2016, the European Commission launched a procedure in order to impose the respect of the rule of law in the country.\nReporters Without Borders in its 2019 assessment of Poland stated that the public media \"have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces.\" Poland is rated \"Partly Free\" in Freedom House's 2017 \"Freedom of the Press\" report. It is ranked 62 out of 180 countries in the 2020 World Press Freedom index by Reporters Without Borders, down from 18th in 2015.\nPublic television and radio broadcasters.\nAfter winning parliamentary elections in October 2015, the PiS party replaced the management positions at the public television and radio broadcasters. This effort was not limited to public broadcasters since the party leadership tried to control also private media outlets for instance by advancing a proposal to restrict reporters\u2019 access to the parliament.\nIn December 2015 the so-called \"small media law\" prepared by PiS was sent to the Polish parliament. The proposal, which was conceived as a temporary measure before the adoption of a more comprehensive media law, provided for the termination of the mandates of the current members of the national television and radio broadcasters\u2019 management and supervisory boards and their replacement through the direct appointment by the treasury minister. The law created great turmoil in public media: the directors of several public channels left their position in protest. Public protests occurred across Poland as well as abroad in the environment connected the community of Poles living abroad.\nThe staffing changes were not limited to the managing positions. According to the Association of Journalists, 225 journalists left the public media during 2016, due to either layoffs or resignations. The new law and its effects were widely criticized also abroad: the European Federation of Journalists, the European Broadcasting Union, the Association of European Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Index on Censorship denounced this decision. In January 2016, the European Commission discussed the \"small media law\" in the frame of its assessment of the situation in Poland under the Rule of Law Framework.\nIn December 2016, the Constitutional Tribunal declared parts of the \"small media law\" unconstitutional, calling for the need to constitutional rules on the KRRiT which should have played a decisive role in appointing its management and supervisory boards.\nIn the first months of 2016 the PiS's government worked on a \"big media law\", a more comprehensive reform of the media system. In April 2016, a draft Law on National Media was presented to the Parliament. The draft wanted to transform the public radio and television broadcasters into \"national media\", thus shifting away from the model of editorially independent public service. The bill obliged the public media to disseminate the views of the prime minister, the president, and the speakers of the parliament and stated that the public media should preserve national traditions, patriotic and Christian values and strengthen the national community. The Council of Europe criticized the draft, describing it a move towards a \"State broadcasters\". The law was not adopted: the government decided to pursue a less ambitious approach and proposed the Parliament a \"bridge law\" to go into force at the expiration of the \"small media law\". The \"bridge law\" was approved in June 2016: the law stated that a newly established National Media Council have to be responsible for the appointment of the management and supervisory boards of the public media. The arrangement established by the law effectively guarantees the rule party a key role in appointing the members of the national Media Council. The law also does not forbid the new council's members from belonging to political party.\nTV stations.\nTVP \u2013 public broadcaster\nPolsat \u2013 private\nTVN Discovery Group \u2013 private\n\"*TTV belongs to Stavka (51% - TVN, 49% - Besta Film)\"\nGroupe Canal+ Poland (owned by Canal+ Group (51%), TVN Group (32%), Liberty Global (17%))\nMinor players:\nPolcast Television\n4Fun Media\n4Fun.tv\n4Fun Kids\n4Fun Dance\nLux Veritatis Foundation\nTV Trwam\nTV Puls\nMany major world players are also present on the market, among them:\nHBO, HBO2, MTV Poland, NickMusic.\nRadio stations.\nPrivately owned stations.\nBauer Media Group company:\nEurozet company:\nGrupa ZPR Media company:\nAgora SA company:\nOther radio stations\nIndependent local radio stations, broadcasting on FM\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "23033", "revid": "21609265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23033", "title": "Portugal", "text": "Country in Southwestern Europe\nPortugal, officially the Portuguese Republic, is a country on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe. It is an unitary semi-presidential republic composed by continental Portugal and two autonomous regions, with Lisbon as both its capital and largest city. The continental portion borders Spain to the north and east, with Madeira and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean. It features the westernmost point in continental Europe.\nThe western Iberian Peninsula has been continuously inhabited since prehistoric times, with the earliest signs of settlement dating to 5500 BC. Celtic and Iberian peoples arrived in the first millennium BC. The region came under Roman control in the second century BC. A succession of Germanic peoples and the Alans ruled from the fifth to eighth centuries AD. Muslims invaded mainland Portugal in the eighth century, but were gradually expelled by the Christian \"Reconquista\", culminating with the capture of the Algarve between 1238 and 1249. Modern Portugal began taking shape during this period, initially as a county of the Christian Kingdom of Le\u00f3n in 868, and formally as a sovereign kingdom with the \"Manifestis Probatum\" in 1179.\nAs one of the earliest participants in the Age of Discovery, Portugal made several seminal advancements in nautical science. The Portuguese subsequently were among the first Europeans to explore and discover new territories and sea routes, establishing a maritime empire of settlements, colonies, and trading posts that extended mostly along the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts. A dynastic crisis in the early 1580s resulted in the Iberian Union (1580\u20131640), which unified Portugal under Spanish rule, marking its gradual decline as a global power. Portuguese sovereignty was regained in 1640 and was followed by a costly and protracted war lasting until 1688, while the 1755 Lisbon earthquake destroyed the city and further damaged the empire's economy.\nThe Napoleonic Wars drove the relocation of the court to Brazil in 1807, leading to its elevation from colony to kingdom, which culminated in Brazilian independence in 1822, this resulted in a civil war (1828\u20131834) between absolutist monarchists and supporters of a constitutional monarchy, with the latter prevailing. The monarchy endured until the 5 October 1910 revolution, which replaced it with the First Republic. Wracked by unrest and civil strife, the republic was replaced by the authoritarian and its successor, the . Democracy was restored in 1974 following the Carnation Revolution, which brought an end to the Portuguese Colonial War and allowed the last of Portugal's African territories to achieve independence.\nPortugal's imperial history has left a vast cultural legacy, with around 300 million Portuguese speakers around the world. The country has a developed and advanced economy relying chiefly upon services, industry, and tourism. Portugal is a member of the United Nations, European Union, Schengen Area, and Council of Europe, and one of the founding members of NATO, the eurozone, the OECD, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Portugal\" () derives from the combined Roman-Celtic place name Portus Cale (present-day's conurbation of Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia). Porto stems from the Latin for port, ; \"Cale\"'s meaning and origin is unclear. The mainstream explanation is an ethnonym derived from the Callaeci, also known as the Gallaeci peoples, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. One theory proposes \"Cale\" is a derivation of the Celtic word for 'port'. Another is that \"Cala\" was a Celtic goddess. Some French scholars believe it may have come from , the port of the Gauls.\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took Iberia from the Carthaginians during the Second Punic War. In the process they conquered Cale, renaming it ('Port of Cale') and incorporating it into the province of Gallaecia. During the Middle Ages, the region around Portus Cale became known by the Suebi and Visigoths as \"Portucale\". The name \"Portucale\" changed into \"Portugale\" during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, it was used to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and Minho. By the 11th and 12th centuries, \"Portugale\", \"Portugallia\", \"Portvgallo\" or \"Portvgalliae\" was already referred to as \"Portugal\".\nWith the implementation of the republic in 1910, the word \"Portugal\" lost its prior status as the official name for the country, being replaced with the phrase \"Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa\" (). After the current constitution entered into force, in 1976, the Mirandese language received official recognition as a regional language, with the phrase \"Rep\u00fablica Pertuesa\" being the official name of the country in Mirandese.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe region has been inhabited by humans since circa 400,000 years ago, when Homo heidelbergensis entered the area. The oldest human fossil found in Portugal is the 400,000-year-old \"Aroeira 3\" \"H. Heidelbergensis\" skull discovered in the Cave of Aroeira in 2014. Later Neanderthals roamed the northern Iberian peninsula and a tooth has been found at Nova da Columbeira cave in Estremadura. Homo sapiens sapiens arrived in Portugal around 35,000 years ago and spread rapidly, with the earliest signs of settlement dating to 5500 BC. Pre-Celtic tribes inhabited Portugal. The Cynetes developed a written language, leaving stelae, which are mainly found in the south.\nThe Lusitanians were an Indo-European-speaking people living in the far west of the Iberian Peninsula, in present-day central Portugal and regions of Western Spain. \nIt is uncertain whether the Lusitanians were Celticized Iberians, representatives of the ancient Beaker Culture (with Proto-Lusitanian tribes possibly originating from Gallia Belgica) or Celts, related to the Lusones.\nEarly in the first millennium BC, several waves of Celts arrived in Portugal from Central Europe and intermarried with the local populations to form several different ethnic groups.\nThe Celtic presence and heritage is patent in archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated most of northern and central Portugal, while the south maintained some of its older character (believed non-Indo-European, likely related to Basque) until the Roman conquest. In southern Portugal, some small, semi-permanent commercial outposts were also founded by Mediterranean peoples namely Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians along the coast.\nRoman Portugal.\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's opponent in the Punic Wars, were expelled from their coastal colonies. During Julius Caesar's rule, almost the entire peninsula was annexed to Rome. The conquest took two hundred years and many died, including those sentenced to work in slave mines or sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. The Roman occupation suffered a setback in 155 BC, when a rebellion began in the north. The Lusitanians and other native tribes, under the leadership of Viriathus, wrested control of all of western Iberia. Rome sent legions to quell the rebellion but were unsuccessful. Roman leaders bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him in 139 BC; he was replaced by Tautalus.\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of Roman province. Later, a northern province was separated from the province of Tarraconensis, under Emperor Diocletian's reforms, known as Gallaecia. There are numerous ruins of castros (hill forts) and remains of the Castro culture, like the Mozinho, Zambujal, Cidadelhe, Con\u00edmbriga, Mirobriga, Briteiros archaeological sites.\nGermanic kingdoms.\nIn 409, with the decline of the Roman Empire, the Iberian Peninsula was occupied by Germanic tribes. In 411, with a federation contract with Emperor Honorius, many of these people settled in Hispania. An important group was made up of the Suebi, Buri, Vandals in Gallaecia, who founded a Suebi Kingdom with its capital in Braga. They came to dominate central Portugal, including Aeminium (Coimbra) all the way to the Tagus, while the Visigoths occupied the south.\nThe Suebi and the Visigoths were the Germanic tribes who had the most lasting presence in the territories corresponding to modern Portugal. As elsewhere in Western Europe, there was a sharp decline in urban life during the Dark Ages.\nRoman institutions disappeared in the wake of the Germanic invasions with the exception of ecclesiastical organisations, which were fostered by the Suebi in the fifth century and adopted by the Visigoths afterwards. Although the Suebi and Visigoths were initially followers of Arianism and Priscillianism, they adopted Catholicism from the local inhabitants. St. Martin of Braga was a particularly influential evangelist.\nIn 429, the Visigoths moved south to expel the Alans and Vandals and founded a kingdom with its capital in Toledo. From 470, conflict between the Suebi and Visigoths increased. In 585, the Visigothic King Liuvigild conquered Braga and annexed Gallaecia; the Iberian Peninsula was unified under a Visigothic Kingdom. A new class emerged, unknown in Roman times: a nobility, which played a key social and political role during the Middle Ages. It was under the Visigoths that the Church began to play an important part within the state. As the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws were made by councils of bishops, and the clergy emerged as a high-ranking class.\nIslamic period.\nToday's continental Portugal, along with most of modern Spain, was invaded from the South and became part of al-Andalus between 726 and 1249, following the Umayyad Caliphate conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. This rule lasted decades in the North, up to five centuries in the South.\nAfter defeating the Visigoths in a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of Damascus, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under Abd-ar-Rahman I with the establishment of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. The Emirate became the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in 929, until its dissolution in 1031, into 23 small kingdoms, called Taifa kingdoms.\nThe governors of the taifas proclaimed themselves Emir of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of present-day Portugal fell into the hands of the Taifa of Badajoz of the Aftasid Dynasty, and in 1022 the Taifa of Seville of the Abbadids poets. The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the Almoravids in 1086, then by the Almohads in 1147.\nAl-Andaluz was divided into districts called \"Kura\". Gharb Al-Andalus at its largest consisted of ten kuras, each with a distinct capital and governor. The main cities were in the southern half of the country: Beja, Silves, Alc\u00e1cer do Sal, Santar\u00e9m and Lisbon. The Muslim population consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to Islam and Berbers. The Arabs (mainly noblemen from Syria) although a minority, constituted the elite. The Berbers who joined them, were nomads from the Rif Mountains of North Africa.\nInvasions from the North also occurred in this period, with Viking incursions raiding the coast between the 9th and 11th centuries, including Lisbon. This resulted in the establishment of small Norse settlements in the coastline between Douro and Minho.\nOne likely Viking cultural heritage is found in the ancient \"Marcas Poveiras\" or Siglas Poveiras. It is generally accepted that the \"siglas\", also known as \"marcas\", are of Scandinavian origin. Based on numerous similarities initially found at the Nationalmuseet in Copenhagen, several objects marked with \"home-marks\" were also identified in Funen (also known as Fyn), Denmark. Further studies revealed that the complex hereditary marking system of P\u00f3voa de Varzim was also present in Fyn. Given the geographical distance, historical Viking incursions along the Portuguese coast, and pagan rituals practiced by people from this particular fishing region, it is believed that there is a partial Norse ancestry and cultural legacy.\nReconquista.\nThe Reconquista was a period when Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from Moorish domination. An Asturian Visigothic noble named Pelagius of Asturias was elected leader in 718 by many of the ousted Visigoth nobles. Pelagius called for the remnants of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands, known today as the Cantabrian Mountains, in north-west Spain. After defeating the Moors in the Battle of Covadonga in 722, Pelagius was proclaimed king, thus founding the Christian Kingdom of Asturias and starting the war of Christian reconquest.\nAt the end of the 9th century, the region of Portugal between the rivers Minho and Douro was reconquered from the Moors by nobleman and knight V\u00edmara Peres on the orders of King Alfonso III of Asturias. Finding many towns deserted, he decided to repopulate and rebuild them.\nV\u00edmara Peres elevated the region to the status of County, naming it the County of Portugal after its major port city \u2013 \"Portus Cale\" or modern Porto. One of the first cities he founded is Vimaranes, known today as Guimar\u00e3es \u2013 \"birthplace of the Portuguese nation\" or the \"cradle city\".\nAfter annexing the County of Portugal into one of the counties that made up the Kingdom of Asturias, King Alfonso III of Asturias knighted V\u00edmara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as \"Portucale\", \"Portugale\", and simultaneously \"Portug\u00e1lia\". With the forced abdication of Alfonso III in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms; they were reunited in 924 under the crown of Le\u00f3n.\nIn 1093 Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n bestowed the county to Henry of Burgundy and married him to his daughter, Teresa of Le\u00f3n. Henry thus became Henry, Count of Portugal and based his newly formed county from Bracara Augusta (modern Braga).\nIndependence.\nAt the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede, in the outskirts of Guimar\u00e3es, in 1128, Afonso Henriques, Count of Portugal, defeated his mother Countess Teresa and her lover Fern\u00e3o Peres de Trava, establishing himself as sole leader of the county. Afonso continued his father Henry of Burgundy's Reconquista wars. His campaigns were successful and in 1139, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Ourique, so was proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal became the independent Kingdom of Portugal and, in 1129, the capital city was transferred from Guimar\u00e3es to Coimbra. Afonso was recognised as the first king of Portugal in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n, and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III as Afonso I of Portugal, with the papal bull \"Manifestis Probatum\".\nAfonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military monastic orders, continued pushing southwards against the Moors. In 1217, during the reign of King Afonso II, Portuguese troops, supported by crusaders and others, retook Alc\u00e1cer do Sal, with further land conquests from the Moors during the reign of Sancho II, mainly the start of the conquest of the Algarve in 1238. After internal tensions, Sancho II was deposed from the throne and his brother, Afonso III, became king in 1248. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve, in the aftermath of the Siege of Faro, and the last Moorish settlements were expelled. With minor readjustments, Portugal's territorial borders have remained the same, making it one of the oldest established nations in Europe.\nAfter a conflict with the kingdom of Castile, Denis of Portugal signed the Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices in 1297 with Ferdinand IV of Castile. This treaty established the border between the kingdoms of Portugal and Leon. During the reign of Denis, the first university in Portugal opened in Lisbon, on March 1, 1290, being then transferred to Coimbra in 1308. Denis died in 1325 and was succeeded by his son, Afonso IV, who had a strained relationship with his father that nearly ended in war. In 1355, in the aftermath of the assassination of In\u00eas de Castro, Peter's I lover, a civil war broke between the King, Afonso IV, and his son, and heir, Peter, with peace only being achieved in 1357. The reigns of Denis, Afonso IV, and Peter I mostly saw peace with the other kingdoms of Iberia.\nIn 1348-49 Portugal, as with the rest of Europe, was devastated by the Black Death. In 1373, Portugal, during the reign of Ferdinand I, made an alliance with England, the oldest standing alliance in the world. This alliance was signed during the Fernandine Wars, a series of conflicts between Portugal and Castile over the right to the throne of Castile. This alliance would be reinforced with the signing of the Treaty of Windsor in 1386.\nAge of Discoveries.\nIn 1383 John I of Castile and Beatrice of Portugal, the only surviving legitimate child of Ferdinand I of Portugal, claimed the throne of Portugal. John of Aviz, later John I of Portugal, led a revolt against this claim and defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota, with the House of Aviz becoming the ruling house. The new ruling dynasty led Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture. They created and sponsored literature, such as a history of Portugal, by Fern\u00e3o Lopes.\nPortugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery under the sponsorship of Prince Henry the Navigator, and made several seminal advancements in nautical science. Portugal explored the Atlantic, encountering the Azores, Madeira, and Portuguese Cape Verde, which led to the first colonisation movements. The Portuguese explored the Indian Ocean, established trade routes in most of southern Asia, and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China (Jorge \u00c1lvares) and Japan (Nanban trade). In 1415, Portugal acquired its first colonies by conquering Ceuta, in North Africa. Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for commodities, ranging from gold to slavery. Portugal sailed the Portuguese India Armadas to Goa via the Cape of Good Hope.\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 was intended to resolve a dispute created following the return of Christopher Columbus and divided the newly located lands outside Europe between Portugal and Spain along a line west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. In 1498 Vasco da Gama became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, one of many Portuguese colonies of the Americas.\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral landed on Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia, landing in Taiwan, Japan, Timor, Flores, and the Moluccas. Although it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is evidence the Portuguese may have discovered it in 1521.\nBetween 1519 and 1522 Ferdinand Magellan organised a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. The Treaty of Zaragoza, signed in 1529 between Portugal and Spain, divided the Pacific Ocean between Spain and Portugal.\nIberian Union and Restoration.\nPortugal voluntarily entered a dynastic union (1580\u20131640) because the last two kings of the House of Aviz (Sebastian, King of Portugal, followed by his grand-uncle Henry, King of Portugal) died without heirs, resulting in the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580. Philip II of Spain claimed the throne, under the pretext that his mother was a Portuguese princess, Isabella of Portugal, the second child and first daughter of King Manuel I of Portugal. Philip II of Spain was accepted as Philip I of Portugal. Yet, Portugal did not lose its formal independence. Instead, a union of kingdoms was formed. But the joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of an independent foreign policy, and led to its involvement in the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands.\nWar led to a deterioration of relations with Portugal's oldest ally, England, and the loss of Hormuz, a strategic trading post located between Iran and Oman. From 1595 to 1663 the Dutch Portuguese War primarily involved Dutch companies invading Portuguese colonies and commercial interests in Brazil, Africa, India and the Far East, resulting in the loss of Portugal's Indian sea trade monopoly. \nIn 1640 John IV of Portugal spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The Portuguese Restoration War ended the 60-year period of the Iberian Union under the House of Habsburg. This was the beginning of the House of Braganza, which reigned until 1910. John V saw a reign characterised by the influx of gold into the royal treasury, supplied largely by the royal fifth (tax on precious metals) from the Portuguese colonies of Brazil and Maranh\u00e3o. Most estimates place the number of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000. This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies, during colonial times.\nPombaline era and Enlightenment.\nIn 1738 Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, later ennobled as 1st Marquis of Pombal, began a career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London, later in Vienna. King Joseph I was crowned in 1750 and made him his Minister of Foreign Affairs. As the King's confidence in Carvalho e Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Carvalho e Melo was made prime minister. Impressed by British economic success witnessed as ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal.\nIn 1761, during the reign of King Jos\u00e9 I, he banned the import of black slaves into mainland Portugal and India, not for humanitarian reasons, but because they were a necessary work force in Brazil. At the same time, he encouraged the trade of black slaves (\"the pieces\", in the terms of that time) to that colony, and with the support and direct involvement of the Marquis of Pombal, two companies were founded - the \"Companhia do Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 e Maranh\u00e3o\" and the \"Companhia Geral de Pernambuco e Para\u00edba\" - whose main activity was the trafficking of slaves, mostly Africans, to Brazilian lands.\nHe reorganised the army and navy and ended legal discrimination against different Christian sects. He created companies and guilds to regulate commercial activity and one of the first appellation systems by demarcating the region for production of Port to ensure the wine's quality. This was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He imposed strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society, along with a widespread review of the tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes.\nLisbon was struck by a major earthquake on 1 November 1755, magnitude estimated to have been between 7.7 and 9.0, with casualties ranging from 12,000 to 50,000. Following the earthquake, Joseph I gave his prime minister more power, and Carvalho de Melo became an enlightened despot. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The Marquis of T\u00e1vora, several members of his family and even servants were tortured and executed in public with extreme brutality (even by the standards of the time), as alleged part of the T\u00e1vora affair.\nThe following year, the Jesuits were suppressed and expelled. This crushed opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy was powerless before Pombal. Further titled \"Marqu\u00eas de Pombal\" in 1770, he ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1777. The new ruler, Queen Maria I of Portugal, disliked Pombal because of his excesses, and upon her accession to the throne, withdrew all his political offices. Pombal was banished to his estate at Pombal, where he died in 1782.\nHistorians argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial exploitation and consolidating personal control, and profit.\nCrises of the 19th century.\nIn 1807 Portugal refused Napoleon's demand to accede to the Continental System of embargo against the United Kingdom; a French invasion under General Junot followed, and Lisbon was captured in 1807. British intervention in the Peninsular War helped maintain Portuguese independence; the last French troops were expelled in 1812. During the Napoleonic invasions, the Portuguese royal family transferred the court to Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, making it the capital of the Portuguese empire between 1808 and 1821.\nIn 1820, constitutionalist insurrections took place at Porto and Lisbon, and King John VI and his court were forced to return to mainland Portugal in 1821. Lisbon regained its status as the capital of Portugal when Brazil declared its independence in 1822. The death of King John VI in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession. His eldest son, Pedro I of Brazil, briefly became Pedro IV of Portugal, but neither the Portuguese nor Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy.\nConsequently, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his 7-year-old daughter, Maria da Gl\u00f3ria, on the condition that when she came of age she would marry his brother, Miguel. Dissatisfaction at Pedro's constitutional reforms led the \"absolutist\" faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel king in February 1828. This led to the Liberal Wars, also known as the \"War of the Two Brothers\" or the \"Portuguese Civil War\", in which Pedro forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834 and place his daughter on the throne as Queen Maria II of Portugal.\nAfter 1815 the Portuguese expanded their trading ports along the African coast, moving inland to take control of Angola and Mozambique. The slave trade was abolished in 1836. In Portuguese India, trade flourished in the colony of Goa, with its subsidiary colonies of Macau, near Hong Kong, and Timor, north of Australia. The Portuguese successfully introduced Catholicism and the Portuguese language into their colonies, while most settlers continued to head to Brazil.\nIn January 1890, the British government delivered an ultimatum to Portugal, demanding the withdrawal of Portuguese forces from the area between Portugal's colonies of Mozambique and Angola. The area had been claimed by Portugal as part of its colonialist Pink Map project, but Britain disputed these claims, mostly due to Cecil Rhodes' aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway, which was intended to link all British colonies via a single railway. The government of Portugal quietly accepted the ultimatum and withdrew their forces from the disputed area, leading to a widespread backlash among the Portuguese public, who viewed acceptance of the British demands as a humiliation.\nFirst Republic and.\nOn 1 February 1908, King Carlos I and his son and heir, Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal, were assassinated by Republican and Carbon\u00e1ria members. Two years later, on 5 October 1910, a coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew the near 800-year-old Monarchy and the Republic was proclaimed. During World War I, Portugal helped the Allies fight the Central Powers; however the war hurt its weak economy.\nPolitical instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the First Portuguese Republic. Several coups occurred during the First Republic, like the failed Monarchy of the North coup, but others had success, like the December 1917 coup d'\u00e9tat, which led to the rise of Sid\u00f3nio Pais to power. In 1921, the \"Bloody Night\" revolt ended in the assassination of the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials of the Republic.\nThese conditions led to the 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat and creation of the National Dictatorship (). This in turn led to the right-wing dictatorship of the (New State), under Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar in 1933.\nPortugal remained neutral in World War II. From the 1940s to 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of NATO, OECD, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and joined the United Nations in 1955. New economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with Angola and Mozambique being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a transcontinental nation and not a colonial empire.\nPro-Indian residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, separated those territories from Portuguese rule in 1954. In 1961, Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1's annexation by the Republic of Dahomey was the start of a process that led to the dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire. Another forcible retreat occurred in 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish Goa. The Portuguese were involved in armed conflict in Portuguese India against the Indian Armed Forces. The operations resulted in the defeat and loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese regime refused to recognise Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in the National Assembly until the coup of 1974.\nAlso in the early 1960s the independence movements in the Portuguese provinces of Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea in Africa, resulted in the Portuguese Colonial War (lasting from 1961 till 1974). The war mobilised around 1.4 million men for military or for civilian support service, and led to large casualties. Throughout the colonial war period Portugal dealt with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by the international community. The authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime, tried to preserve the empire.\nSalazar governed until 1968, when he suffered a brain hemorrhage, and was replaced by Marcelo Caetano, which raised hopes of a \"liberalization\" of the Estado Novo regime, called the \"Marcelist Spring\", but those hopes were soon crushed.\nCarnation Revolution and return to democracy.\nThe government and army resisted the decolonization of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a left-wing military coup in Lisbon, the Carnation Revolution, led the way for the independence of territories, as well as the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (\"Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso\"). This period was characterised by power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. By the summer of 1975, the tensions were so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. Forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched another coup on 25 November, but a military faction, the Group of Nine, initiated a counter-coup.\nThe Group of Nine emerged victorious, preventing the establishment of a communist state and ending political instability. The retreat from the overseas territories prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from its African territories. Over one million Portuguese refugees fled the former Portuguese provinces, as white settlers were usually not considered part of the former colonies. By 1975, all Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first democratic elections in 50 years.\nPortugal continued to be governed by a National Salvation Junta until the Portuguese legislative election of 1976. It was won by the Portuguese Socialist Party and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became prime minister. Soares would be prime minister from 1976 to 1978 and 1983 to 1985. Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution. He initiated the process of accession to the European Economic Community (EEC).\nAfter the transition to democracy, Portugal flipped between socialism and adherence to the neoliberal model. Land reform and nationalisations were enforced; the Portuguese Constitution was rewritten to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution had references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a socialist economy. Portugal's economic situation after the revolution obliged the government to pursue International Monetary Fund (IMF)-monitored stabilisation programmes in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385. In 1986 Portugal alongside Spain, joined the European Economic Community which later became the European Union (EU). Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of European Structural and Investment Funds and companies' easier access to foreign markets.\nPortugal's last overseas territory, Macau, was peacefully handed over to China in 1999. In 2002, the independence of East Timor (Asia) was formally recognised by Portugal. In 1995, Portugal started to implement Schengen Area rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members. Expo '98 took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the euro and eurozone. In 2004 Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the then Prime Minister of Portugal, was nominated President of the European Commission.\nOn 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union. Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in government debt during the 2008 financial crisis led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility, a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\nGeography.\nPortugal occupies an area on the Iberian Peninsula (referred to as \"the continent\" by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: Madeira and the Azores. It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 N, and longitudes 32\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 W.\nContinental Portugal is split by its main river, the Tagus, that flows from Spain and disgorges in the Tagus Estuary at Lisbon, before escaping into the Atlantic. The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the south, including the Algarve and the Alentejo regions, is characterised by rolling plains.\nPortugal's highest peak is Mount Pico on Pico Island in the Azores. The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean: the Azores straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on a tectonic triple junction, and Madeira along a range formed by in-plate hotspot geology. Geologically, these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events. The last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 1957\u201358 (Capelinhos) and minor earthquakes occur sporadically.\nThe exclusive economic zone, a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights in exploration and have use of marine resources, covers an area of . This is the 3rd largest exclusive economic zone of the European Union and the 20th largest in the world.\nProvinces of Portugal.\nThe term \"provinces\" () has been used throughout history to identify regions of continental Portugal. Current legal subdivisions of Portugal do not coincide with the provinces, but several provinces, in their 19th- and 20th-century versions, still correspond to culturally relevant, strongly self-identifying categories. They include:\nThe islands of Azores and Madeira were never called \"provinces\".\nClimate.\nPortugal is mainly characterised by a Mediterranean climate, temperate maritime climate in high altitude zones of the Azorean islands; a semi-arid climate in parts of the Beja District far south and in Porto Santo Island, a hot desert climate in the Selvagens Islands and a humid subtropical climate in the western Azores, according to the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification. It is one of the warmest countries in Europe: the average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from in the mountainous interior north to in the south and on the Guadiana river basin. There are variations from the highlands to the lowlands. The Algarve, separated from the Alentejo region by mountains reaching up to in Alto da F\u00f3ia, has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia.\nAnnual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over on the Peneda-Ger\u00eas National Park to less than in southern parts of Alentejo. Mount Pico receives the largest annual rainfall (over per year), according to \"Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera\". In some areas, such as the Guadiana basin, annual diurnal average temperatures can be as high as , and summer's highest temperatures are routinely over . The record high of was recorded in Amareleja.\nSnowfalls occur regularly during winter in the interior North and Centre, particularly in the highlands. In these regions, temperatures can drop below , and snow may fall any time from October to May. In the South, snowfalls are rare but can still occur at the highest elevations. While the official absolute minimum by IPMA is in Penhas da Sa\u00fade and Miranda do Douro, lower temperatures have been recorded. Continental Portugal receives around 2,300-3,200 hours of sunshine annually, an average of 4\u20136\u00a0hours in winter and 10\u201312\u00a0hours in the summer, with higher values in the south-east, south-west, Algarve coast and lower in the north-west.\nPortugal's central west and southwest coasts have an extreme ocean seasonal lag; sea temperatures are warmer in October than in July and are their coldest in March. The average sea surface temperature on the west coast of mainland Portugal varies from in January\u2212March to in August\u2212October while on the south coast it ranges from in January\u2212March and rises in the summer to about , occasionally reaching . In the Azores, around in February\u2212April to in July\u2212September, and in Madeira, around in February\u2212April to in August\u2212October.\nAzores and Madeira have a subtropical climate, although variations between islands exist. The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range, with annual average temperatures exceeding in some parts of the coast. Some islands in Azores have drier months in the summer. Consequently, the islands of the Azores have been identified as having a Mediterranean climate, while some islands (such as Flores or Corvo) are classified as Humid subtropical, transitioning into an Oceanic climate at higher altitudes. Porto Santo Island in Madeira has a warm semi-arid climate. The Savage Islands, which are part of the regional territory of Madeira and a nature reserve are unique in being classified as a desert climate with an annual average rainfall of approximately .\nClimate change in Portugal is causing rising temperatures and longer-lasting heat waves, decreases in average rainfall and increases in the number of extremely rainy days (causing droughts and floods), and rising sea levels which will threaten the country's many coastal populations. Wildfires are quite common and a major issue in Portugal, being the country with the highest percentage of burned area, on average, in the entire European Union.\nBiodiversity.\nPortugal is located on the Mediterranean Basin, the third most diverse hotspot of flora in the world. It is home to six terrestrial ecoregions: Azores temperate mixed forests, Cantabrian mixed forests, Madeira evergreen forests, Iberian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests, Northwest Iberian montane forests, and Southwest Iberian Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests. Over 22% of its land area is included in the Natura 2000 network. Eucalyptus, cork oak and maritime pine together make up 71% of the total forested area of continental Portugal.\nGeographical and climatic conditions facilitate the introduction of exotic species that later turn to be invasive and destructive to the native habitats. Around 20 percent of the total number of extant species in continental Portugal are exotic. Portugal is the second country in Europe with the highest number of threatened animal and plant species. Portugal as a whole is an important stopover for migratory bird species.\nThe large mammalian species of Portugal (deer, Iberian ibex, wild boar, red fox, Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx) were once widespread throughout the country, but intense hunting, habitat degradation and growing pressure from agriculture and livestock reduced population on a large scale in the 19th and early 20th century, others, such as the Portuguese ibex were even led to extinction. Today, these animals are re-expanding their native range.\nThe Portuguese west coast is part of the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems of the ocean. This seasonal upwelling system typically seen during the summer months brings cooler, nutrient rich water up to the sea surface promoting phytoplankton growth, zooplankton development and the subsequent rich diversity in pelagic fish and other marine invertebrates. This makes Portugal one of the largest per capita fish-consumers in the world. 73% of the freshwater fish occurring in the Iberian Peninsula are endemic, the largest out of any region in Europe. Some protected areas of Portugal include: the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros, the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, and the Montesinho Natural Park which hosts some of the only populations of Iberian wolf and Iberian brown bear.\nPolitics.\nPortugal has been a semi-presidential representative democratic republic since the ratification of the Constitution of 1976, with Lisbon, the nation's largest city, as its capital. The Constitution grants the division or separation of powers among four sovereignty bodies: the President of the Republic, the Assembly of the Republic, the Government and the Courts.\nThe Head of State is the President of the Republic, elected to a five-year term by direct, universal suffrage; the current president is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Although largely a ceremonial post, Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and other members of the Government; dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly; vetoing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring war (only on the advice of the Government and with the authorisation of the Assembly). The President has also supervisory and reserve powers and is the \"ex officio\" Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The President is advised on issues of importance by the Council of State.\nAccording to International IDEA\u2019s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Portugal performs in the mid-high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in political representation, including elected government and inclusive suffrage.\nGovernment.\nThe Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of a maximum of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the Prime Minister and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State, that have full executive powers; the current prime minister is Lu\u00eds Montenegro. The Council of Ministers \u2013 under the Prime Minister (or the President at the latter's request) and the Ministers \u2013 acts as the cabinet. The Courts are organised into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The Supreme Courts are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member Constitutional Court oversees the constitutionality of the laws.\nPortugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic is dominated by three political parties, the Social Democratic Party (PSD), Enough (CH) and the Socialist Party (PS), while in Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes the PSD and PS continue to be the dominant parties. Others parties include the Liberal Initiative, the Left Bloc, the Unitary Democratic Coalition (Portuguese Communist Party and Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"), LIVRE, the CDS \u2013 People's Party and the People Animals Nature.\nForeign relations.\nA member state of the United Nations since 1955, Portugal is a founding member of NATO (1949), the OECD (1961) and EFTA (1960); it left the last in 1986 to join the European Economic Community, which became the European Union in 1993. In 1996, Portugal co-founded the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organisation and political association of Lusophone nations where Portuguese is an official language.\nPortugal has hosted several international summits and events like the first EU\u2013Brazil summit in July 2007, the second EU\u2013African Union summit in December 2007, the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon also in December 2007, and the NATO summit in November 2010. Portugal was a full member of the Latin Union (1983) and the Organisation of Ibero-American States (1949). It has a friendship alliance and dual citizenship treaty with its former colony, Brazil. Portugal and the United Kingdom share the world's oldest active military accord through their Anglo-Portuguese Alliance (Treaty of Windsor), signed in 1373.\nTerritorial disputes.\nOlivenza: Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Oliven\u00e7a was ceded to Spain under the Treaty of Badajoz in 1801, after the War of the Oranges. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the Treaty of Vienna. However, since the 19th century, it has been continuously ruled by Spain which considers the territory theirs not only \"de facto\" but also \"de jure\".\nSavage Islands: A small group of mostly uninhabited islets which fall under Portuguese Madeira's regional autonomous jurisdiction. Found in 1364 by Italian mariners under the service of Prince Henry The Navigator, it was first noted by Portuguese navigator Diogo Gomes de Sintra in 1438. Historically, the islands have belonged to private Portuguese owners from the 16th century on, until 1971 when the government purchased them and established a natural reserve area covering the whole archipelago. The islands have been claimed by Spain since 1911, and the dispute has caused some periods of political tension between the two countries. The main problem for Spain's attempts to claim these small islands, has been not so much their intrinsic value, but the fact that they expand Portugal's exclusive economic zone considerably to the south, in detriment of Spain. The Selvagens Islands have been tentatively added to UNESCO's world heritage list in 2017.\nMilitary.\nThe armed forces have three branches: Navy, Army and Air Force, commanded by the Portuguese Armed Forces General Staff. They serve primarily as a self-defence force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country but can also be used in offensive missions in foreign territories. In recent years, the Portuguese Armed Forces have carried out several NATO and European Union military missions in various territories, namely in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Mali, Central African Republic, Somalia, Mozambique and East Timor. As of 2023, the three branches numbered 24.000 military personnel. Portuguese military expenditure in 2023 was more than 4 billion US$, representing 1.48 per cent of GDP.\nThe Army of 11,000 personnel comprises three brigades and other small units. An Infantry Brigade (mainly equipped with Pandur II APC, M114 howitzer and MIM-72 Chaparral air defence systems), a Mechanized Brigade (mainly equipped with Leopard 2 A6 tanks and M113A2 APC) and a Rapid Reaction Brigade (consisting of Paratroopers, Commandos, Rangers and Artillery Regiment). The Navy (7,000 personnel, of which 900 are marines), the world's oldest surviving naval force, has five frigates, two corvettes, two submarines, and 20 oceanic patrol vessels. The Air Force (6,000 personnel) has the Lockheed F-16M Fighting Falcon as the main combat aircraft.\nIn addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the National Republican Guard, a security force subject to military law and organisation (gendarmerie) comprising 25,000 personnel. This force is under the authority of both the Defence and the Interior Ministry. It has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq and East Timor. The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops in the Lajes Air Base at Terceira Island, in the Azores. The Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon (JFC Lisbon) is one of the three main subdivisions of NATO's Allied Command Operations.\nLaw and justice.\nThe Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system. The main laws include the Constitution (1976), the Portuguese Civil Code (1966) and the Penal Code of Portugal (1982), as amended. Other relevant laws are the \"Commercial Code\" (1888) and the \"Civil Procedure Code\" (1961). Portuguese laws were applied in the former colonies and territories and continue to be influences for those countries. The supreme national courts are the Supreme Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court. The Public Ministry, headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\nDrug decriminalisation was declared in 2001, making Portugal the first country to allow usage and personal possession of all common drugs. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with HIV infection cases, which dropped 50 percent by 2009. Overall drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds declined, however use of marijuana rose slightly.\nLGBT rights in Portugal have increased substantially in the 21st century. In 2003, Portugal added an anti-discrimination employment law on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2004, sexual orientation was added to the Constitution as part of the protected from discrimination characteristics. In 2010, Portugal became the sixth country in Europe and eighth in the world to legalise same-sex marriage at the national level.\nLGBT adoption has been allowed since 2016 as has female same-sex couple access to medically assisted reproduction. In 2017 the \"Law of Gender Identity\", simplified the legal process of gender and name change for transgender people, making it easier for minors to change their sex marker in legal documents. In 2018, the right to gender identity and gender expression self-determination became protected, intersex minors became protected by law from unnecessary medical procedures \"until the minor gender identity manifests\" and the right of protection from discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics became protected by the same law.\nOver the past 30 years, Euthanasia legalisation has been proposed and approved in several parliamentary reviews, but has been blocked by the Constitutional Court, with the most recent unfavourable decision dating from 2025. In the most recent proposal, national residents over 18 who were terminally ill and in extreme suffering, but who could still decide to, would have the legal right to request for assisted dying. For non-residents or foreigners euthanasia would not be allowed.\nLaw enforcement.\nPortugal's main police organisations are the \"Guarda Nacional Republicana\u00a0\u2013 GNR\" (National Republican Guard), a gendarmerie; the \"Pol\u00edcia de Seguran\u00e7a P\u00fablica\u00a0\u2013 PSP\" (Public Security Police), a civilian police force who work in urban areas; and the \"Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria\u00a0\u2013 PJ\" (Judicial Police), a highly specialised criminal investigation police that is overseen by the Public Ministry.\nPortugal has 49 correctional facilities in total run by the Ministry of Justice. They include seventeen central prisons, four special prisons, twenty-seven regional prisons, and one 'Cadeia de Apoio' (Support Detention Centre). As of 2025[ [update]], the prison population stood at 12,193 inmates, which comes to about 0.11% of the country's entire population. The incarceration rate had a strong increase after 2010, with the prison population surpassing 14,000 inmates by 2013, but after that same year the incarceration rate began to steadily decline, a trend that has continued in recent years.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAdministratively, Portugal is divided into 308 municipalities (\"munic\u00edpios\" or \"concelhos\"), which after a reform in 2013 are subdivided into 3,092 civil parishes (). Operationally, the municipality and civil parish, along with the national government, are the only legally local administrative units identified by the government of Portugal (for example, cities, towns or villages have no standing in law, although may be used as catchment for the defining services). \"Continental Portugal\" is agglomerated into 18 districts, while the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are governed as autonomous regions; the largest units, established since 1976, are either mainland Portugal and the autonomous regions of Portugal (Azores and Madeira).\nThe 18 districts of mainland Portugal are: Aveiro, Beja, Braga, Bragan\u00e7a, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, \u00c9vora, Faro, Guarda, Leiria, Lisbon, Portalegre, Porto, Santar\u00e9m, Set\u00fabal, Viana do Castelo, Vila Real and Viseu\u00a0\u2013 each district takes the name of the district capital.\nWithin the European Union NUTS system, Portugal is divided into nine regions: the Azores, Alentejo, Algarve, Centro, Lisboa, Madeira, Norte, Oeste e Vale do Tejo and Pen\u00ednsula de Set\u00fabal, and with the exception of the Azores and Madeira, NUTS areas are subdivided into 28 subregions.\nEconomy.\nPortugal is a developed and high-income country with a GDP per capita of 82% of the EU27 average in 2024, and a HDI of 0.874 (the 42nd highest in the world) in 2022. It holds the 14th largest gold reserve in the world at its national central bank, with the highest gold share of forex reserves in the world, has the 8th largest proven reserves of lithium, and total exports representing 46.6% of its GDP in 2024. Portugal has been a net beneficiary of the European Union budget since it joined the union, then known as EEC, in 1986.\nBy the end of 2024, GDP (PPP) was $50,617 per capita, according to the World Bank. By the same year, Portugal had the 6th lowest GDP per capita (PPP), ranking 15th, among the 20 members of the eurozone, and ranked only 18th among the 27 member-states of the European Union. In 2022, labour productivity had fallen to the fourth lowest among the 27 member-states of the European Union (EU) and was 35% lower than the EU average.\nPortugal was an original member of the eurozone. The national currency, the euro (\u20ac) started transitioning from the Portuguese Escudo in 2000 and consolidated in 2002. Portugal's central bank is the \"Banco de Portugal\", an integral part of the European System of Central Banks. Most industries, businesses and financial institutions are concentrated in the Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas \u2013 the Set\u00fabal, Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Leiria and Faro districts are the biggest economic centres outside these two main areas.\nSince the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which culminated in the end of one of Portugal's most notable phases of economic expansion, a significant change has occurred in the nation's annual economic growth. After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution, Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy, a process that continues. Since the 1990s, Portugal's public consumption-based economic development model has changed to a system focused on exports, private investment and the development of the high-tech sector. Consequently, business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear and cork (Portugal is the world's leading cork producer), wood products and beverages.\nIn the 2010s, the Portuguese economy suffered its most severe recession since the 1970s, which resulted in the country receiving a 78-billion-euro bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in May 2011. By end of 2023, the share of debt as percentage of GDP fell below 100 percent, to 96.9%, and fell further to 93.6% by the end of 2024.\nIn 2024, the average gross salary was \u20ac1,602 per month, and the minimum wage, which is regulated by law, is \u20ac870 per month (paid 14 times per annum) as of 2025. The World Competitiveness Ranking 2025, by Swiss institute IMD, ranked Portugal at 37th. The Numbeo quality of life index placed Portugal 20th in the world in 2023.\nCompanies listed on Euronext Lisbon stock exchange like EDP, Galp, Jer\u00f3nimo Martins, Mota-Engil, Novabase, Semapa, Portucel Soporcel, Portugal Telecom and Sonae, are among the largest corporations by number of employees, net income or international market share. The Euronext Lisbon is the major stock exchange and part of the pan-European group of stock exchanges Euronext. The PSI-20 is Portugal's most selective and widely known stock index.\nThe OECD economic reports since 2018 show recovery. Rents and house prices have skyrocketed in Portugal, particularly Lisbon, where rents jumped 37% in 2022. The 8% inflation rate in the same year exacerbated the problem. According to the IMF, Portugal's economic recovery from the COVID pandemic in 2022 was substantially better than the EU average. Although modest, economic growth continued in 2023 while inflation continued decreasing to 5%. In 2024 the annual inflation continued a downward trend ending at 2.3% and accompanied by a small economic growth. In 2025, the economy is expected to continue growing at 1.9 annually, while inflation is forecast at 2.1% for the fiscal year. These moderately optimistic indicators are supported by increased private consumption, investment, employment growth and unemployment easing.\nAgriculture in Portugal is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. However, the sector also includes larger scale intensive farming, export-oriented agrobusinesses. The country produces a variety of crops and livestock products, including: tomatoes, citrus, green vegetables, rice, wheat, barley, maize, olives, oilseeds, nuts, cherries, bilberry, table grapes, edible mushrooms, dairy products, poultry and beef. According to FAO, Portugal is the top producer of cork and carob in the world, accounting for about 50% and 30% of world production, respectively. It is the third largest exporter of chestnuts and third largest European producer of pulp. Portugal is among the world's top ten largest olive oil producers and fourth largest exporter. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of wine, reputed for its fine wines. Forestry has played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry. In 2001, the gross agricultural product accounted for 4% of the economy; in 2022 it was 2%.\nTourism.\nTravel and tourism is an important part of Portugal's economy. As of 2024, the tourism sector contributed 11.9% to GDP, worth \u20ac34 billion, with tourism contributing 0.3% to an annual GDP growth of 1.9%, a decrease compared to 2023, when almost half of the annual GDP growth was due to the tourism sector. It has been necessary for the country to focus upon its niche attractions, such as health, nature and rural tourism, to stay ahead of its competitors.\nPortugal is among the top 20 most-visited countries in the world, receiving nearly 29 million foreign tourists by 2024. In 2014, Portugal was elected \"The Best European Country\" by \"USA Today\". In 2017, Portugal was elected both \"Europe's Leading Destination\" and in 2018 and 2019, \"World's Leading Destination\"\nTourist hotspots in Portugal are: Lisbon, Cascais, Algarve, Madeira, Nazar\u00e9, F\u00e1tima, \u00d3bidos, Porto, Braga, Guimar\u00e3es and Coimbra. Lisbon attracts many tourists, being the 9th most visited city in Europe, and with 6,7 million tourists occupying the city's hotels by 2024, of which 5,5 million were foreign.\nScience and technology.\nScientific and technological research activities are mainly conducted within a network of R&amp;D units belonging to public universities and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the INETI\u00a0\u2013 Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o and the INRB\u00a0\u2013 Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos. Funding and management of this system is conducted under the authority of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education and the (Foundation for Science and Technology). The largest R&amp;D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications, include biosciences research institutions.\nAmong the largest non-state-run research institutions are the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia and the Champalimaud Foundation, a neuroscience and oncology research centre. National and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are responsible for research and development projects. One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, founded in 1779.\nIberian bilateral state-supported research efforts include the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory and the Ibercivis distributed computing platform. Portugal is a member of pan-European scientific organisations. These include the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), ITER, and the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Portugal has the largest aquarium in Europe, the Lisbon Oceanarium, and have other notable organisations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation, like the state agency \"Ci\u00eancia Viva\", the Science Museum of the University of Coimbra, the National Museum of Natural History at the University of Lisbon, and the Visionarium. The European Innovation Scoreboard 2011, placed Portugal-based innovation 15th, with increase in innovation expenditure and output. Portugal was ranked 31st in the Global Innovation Index in 2025.\nTransport.\nPortugal has a road network, of which are part of system of 48 motorways, making it the 8th largest motorway system among 42 European countries. On many highways, a toll needs to be paid (see Via Verde). Vasco da Gama bridge is the longest bridge in the EU (the second longest in Europe) at .\nContinental Portugal's territory is serviced by four international airports located near the principal cities of Lisbon, Porto, Faro and Beja. Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country. The primary flag-carrier is TAP Air Portugal, although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country.\nThe most important airports are in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal (Madeira), and Ponta Delgada (Azores), managed by the national airport authority group ANA\u00a0\u2013 Aeroportos de Portugal. A new airport, to replace the current Lisbon airport, has been planned for more than 50 years, but it has been always postponed by a series of reasons.\nA national railway system that extends throughout the country and into Spain, is supported and administered by Comboios de Portugal (CP). Rail transport of passengers and goods is derived using the of railway lines currently in service, of which are electrified and about allow train speeds greater than . The railway network is managed by Infraestruturas de Portugal while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of CP, both public companies. In 2006, the CP carried 133,000,000 passengers and of goods.\nThe major seaports are located in Sines, Leix\u00f5es, Lisbon, Set\u00fabal, Aveiro, Figueira da Foz, and Faro. The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems: Lisbon Metro and Metro Sul do Tejo light rail system in the Lisbon metropolitan area, and Porto Metro light metro system in the Porto Metropolitan Area, each with more than of lines. Coimbra is currently developing a Bus rapid transit system, Metro Mondego, as is the Algarve, Algarve Metrobus.\nIn Portugal, Lisbon tram services have been supplied by the \"Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa\" (Carris), for over a century. In Porto, a tram network, of which only a tourist line on the shores of the Douro remains, began construction on 12 September 1895 (a first for the Iberian Peninsula). All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network, as well as taxi services.\nEnergy.\nAs of 2023, oil made up 44% of Portugal's total energy supply. However the country phased out coal-fired generation in 2021 and has been developing renewable energies such as hydopower and wind power and investing in public transport and electric vehicles.\nPortugal has considerable wind and hydropower resources. In 2006, the world's then largest solar power plant, the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station, began operating, while the world's first commercial wave power farm, the Agu\u00e7adoura Wave Farm, opened in the Norte region (2008). By 2006, 66% of the country's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants, while 29% were derived from hydroelectric dams, and 6% by wind energy. In 2008, renewable energy resources were producing 43% of the nation's electricity, even as hydroelectric production decreased with severe droughts. As of 2010, electricity exports had outnumbered imports and 70% of energy came from renewable sources.\nPortugal's national energy transmission company, Redes Energ\u00e9ticas Nacionais (REN), uses modelling to predict weather, especially wind patterns. Before the solar/wind revolution, Portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades. New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night; then water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is now two-way. It draws electricity small generators, like rooftop solar panels.\nIn 2023 Portugal emitted around 339 million tonnes of greenhouse gases (about 5 tonnes per person), equivalent to around 1% of global total emissions. As an EU member state, Portugal is part of their joint plan to reduce emissions by a minimum of 55% by 2030, compared to the level of emissions in 1990. Portugal has committed to carbon neutrality and net zero by 2050.\nDemographics.\nAs of 31 December 2024, Portugal had a population 10,749,635, of which 52.2% was female and 47.8% male, according to Statistics Portugal. In 2025, the median life expectancy reached 82.95 years, with United Nations projecting a rise of up to 90 years or more by 2100. The population historically has been relatively homogeneous, with most people adhering to Catholicism and speaking Portuguese.\nPortugal has had a fertility rate well below the replacement rate of 2.1 since the 1980s. The total fertility rate (TFR) as of 2024[ [update]] was estimated at 1.36 children born per woman, one of the lowest in the world, and considerably below the high of 5.0 in 1911. Consequently, Portugal's population has been steadily ageing and was the 11th oldest in the world in 2024, with a median age of 46.4 years and the fourth highest number of citizens over 65 years, at 21.8% of the total population. According to projections by the national statistics office, the population will fall to 7.7 million by 2080 and the population will continue to age. As of 2022, 60.2% of births were to unmarried women, and 24.5% of births were to foreign born women.\nPortuguese society displays relatively high rates of socioeconomic equality, with the country ranking 24th within the 41 countries of the EU and OECD in the 2019 Social Justice Index. In 2018, Portugal's parliament approved a budget plan for 2019 that included tax breaks for returning emigrants in a bid to attract back those who left during the 2008 financial crisis.\nAccording to a Statistics Portugal study conducted between 2022 and 2023, around 6.4 million people aged between 18 and 74 years old identified themselves as White (84%), more than 262,000 as Mixed-race (3%), nearly 170,000 as Black (2%), 57,000 as Asian (&lt;1%), and 47,500 as Romani (&lt;1%)\nUrbanisation.\nBased on commuting patterns, OECD and Eurostat define eight metropolitan areas of Portugal. Only two have populations over 1 million, and since the 2013 local government reform, these are the only two which also have administrative legal status of metropolitan areas: Lisbon and Porto, Several smaller metropolitan areas (Algarve, Aveiro, Coimbra, Minho and Viseu) also held this status from 2003 to 2008, when they were converted into intermunicipal communities, whose territories are roughly based on the NUTS III statistical regions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImmigration.\nHistorically a country of emigration, Portugal has been a net recipient of immigrants since the early 21st century. As of 2024, legal resident foreigners number 1,543,697, or approximately 14% of the population; these figures do not include more than 340,000 resident foreigners who acquired Portuguese citizenship between 2008 and 2022\u2014and thus constitute around 3.27% of the country's population in 2022. That year, almost 21,000 foreign residents acquired Portuguese citizenship, of which 11,170 were female and 9,674 were male.\nUntil the late 20th century, immigrants came primarily from former Portuguese territories in India, Africa, and East Asia. Since the 1990s, economic growth, particularly in the construction industry, brought an influx of Ukrainians, Brazilians, and other Africans. Other sizeable groups include Romanians, Moldovans, Kosovo Albanians, Russians, Bulgarians, Chinese, Venezuelans, Pakistanis, Indians, and Bangladeshis. Net immigration persisted even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the emigration rate increased to 6.9% in 2022 but remained well below the immigration rate of around 11.3%; Among those that had left the country, 56.8% returned within a year.\nIt is estimated that over 30,000 seasonal, often illegal immigrants work in agriculture, mainly southern cities such as Odemira, where they are often exploited by organised seasonal workers' networks. These migrants, who frequently arrive without due documentation or work contracts, make up over 90% of agricultural workers in southern Portugal. Most are Southeast Asians from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Thailand; in the interior of the Alentejo there are many African workers. Significant numbers also come from Eastern Europe, including Moldova, Ukraine, Romania and Brazil.\nA significant number of EU citizens, mostly from Italy, France, Germany, and other northern European countries, have become permanent residents. There is also a large expatriate community made up of Britons, Canadians and Americans. The British community is mostly composed of retired pensioners who live in the Algarve and Madeira.\nA National Statistics Institute (INE) study conducted between 2022 and 2023 found out that 1.4 million people (13% of the population) have immigrant background, in which 947,500 are first generation immigrants, concentrated mainly in the Lisbon metropolitan area and the Algarve. As the survey was limited to people living legally in the country for at least one year at the time of the interview, the statistical office suggests that 16.1% of the country's population, or 1,683,829 people, were first generation immigrants.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPortugal is a secular state with no official religion. The Catholic Church, which has a long history in the country, was formally separated from government during the First Portuguese Republic; this was reiterated in the 1976 Portuguese Constitution. Religious freedom was also reaffirmed by the 1940 Concordata (later amended in 1971) between Portugal and the Holy See and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act.\nAccording to the 2021 Census, 80.2% of the Portuguese population was Catholic. The country has small Protestant, Latter-day Saint, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Eastern Orthodox Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, Buddhist, Jewish and Spiritist communities. Influences from African Traditional Religion and Chinese Traditional Religion are also felt among many people, particularly in fields related with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Traditional African Herbal Medicine. Some 14.1% of the population declared themselves nonreligious.\nMany Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a Christian origin or connotation.\nLanguages.\nPortuguese is the official language of Portugal. Mirandese is also recognised as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern Portugal. It is part of the Astur-Leonese group of languages. An estimate of between 6,000 and 7,000 Mirandese speakers has been documented for Portugal. Furthermore, a particular dialect known as Barranquenho, spoken in Barrancos, is also officially recognised and protected in Portugal since 2021. Minderico, a sociolect of the Portuguese language, is spoken by around 500 people in the town of Minde.\nAccording to the International English Proficiency Index, Portugal has a high proficiency level in English, higher than those of other Romance-speaking European countries like France, Italy or Spain.\nEducation.\nThe educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age six), basic education (nine years, in three stages, compulsory), secondary education (three years, compulsory since 2010), and higher education (subdivided in university and polytechnic education). Universities are usually organised into faculties. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of Portuguese higher education institutions.\nThe total adult literacy rate in Portugal was 99.8% in 2021. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, Portugal scored around the OECD average in reading, mathematics and science. In reading and mathematics, mean performance in 2018 was close to the level observed in 2009 to 2015; in science, mean performance in 2018 was below that of 2015, and returned close to the level observed in 2009 and 2012, near below average.\nAbout 47.6% of college-age citizens (20 years old) attend one of Portugal's higher education institutions (compared with 50% in the United States and 35% in the OECD on average). In addition to being a destination for international students, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totalled 380,937 in 2005.\nPortuguese universities have existed since 1290. The oldest Portuguese university was first established in Lisbon before moving to Coimbra. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the Americas (the \"Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho\" of Rio de Janeiro) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the \"Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica\" of Goa) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the University of Lisbon.\nThe Bologna process has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of \"numerus clausus\" is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), international students, foreign students from the Lusosphere, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\nMost student costs are supported with public money. Portugal has entered into cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\nHealth.\nIn 2025, Portugal ranked as 23rd best healthcare system in the world, which was visibly lower than the previous 12th place in the 2000 World Health Organisation ranking of best public health systems in the world. The health system is characterised by three coexisting systems: the National Health Service (\"Servi\u00e7o Nacional de Sa\u00fade\", SNS), special social health insurance schemes for certain professions (health subsystems) and voluntary private health insurance. The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 55% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 43% by private insurance schemes and another 12% by mutual funds.The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralisation efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care. The SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\nSimilarly to other 'Eur-A countries', (Western Europe), most Portuguese die from noncommunicable diseases. Mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is around 30,000 deaths per year, a third of all annual deaths, but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with cerebrovascular disease being the single biggest killer in Portugal, with more than 11,000 deaths per year. Oncological diseases represent 22% of all deaths in the country, with lung and breast cancer cases being lower, and cervical and prostate cancer being more frequent. Diabetes mortality rates have been decreasing, from 4.5% in 2010 down to 2.8% in 2021.\nPortugal's infant mortality rate (IMR) stood at 2,25 deaths per 1,000 live births as of 2024. A Eurostat opinion-poll in 2023 found that 55.4% of adults rated their health as good or very good, the third lowest rate collected in the European Union. The largest university hospital in the country is Hospital de Santa Maria, Lisbon.\nDespite good economic development, the average Portuguese, along with Italians, have been among the shortest in Europe since around 1890 and still are. A driving factor was modest real wage growth, given late industrialisation and economic growth compared to the European core. Another determinant was delayed human capital formation.\nCulture.\nPortugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilisations that have crossed the European continent and Mediterranean, or were introduced when it played an active role during the Age of Discovery. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), Portugal modernised its public cultural facilities, in addition to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation established in 1956 in Lisbon.\nThese include the Bel\u00e9m Cultural Centre in Lisbon, Serralves Foundation and the Casa da M\u00fasica, both in Porto, as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country. Portugal is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ranking it 9th in Europe and 18th in the world.\nArchitecture.\nTraditional architecture is distinctive and include the Manueline, also known as Portuguese late Gothic a sumptuous, composite Portuguese style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century, followed by Pombaline style of the 18th century.\nA 20th-century interpretation of traditional architecture, Soft Portuguese style, appears extensively in major cities, especially Lisbon. Modern Portugal has given the world renowned architects like Eduardo Souto de Moura, \u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira (both Pritzker Prize winners) and Gon\u00e7alo Byrne. In Portugal Tom\u00e1s Taveira is also noteworthy, particularly for stadium design. The azulejo is a mainstream, typical element among Portugal's traditional building materials and construction techniques.\nCuisine.\n sprinkled with cinnamon.\nPortuguese cuisine is diverse, part of the Atlantic diet. A significant ingredient in the Portuguese diet is dry cod (\"bacalhau\" in Portuguese). They say that the Portuguese have mastered 365 different ways to prepare codfish, meaning a cod dish for each day of the year, to name a few recipes: bacalhau \u00e0 Br\u00e1s, bacalhau \u00e0 Gomes de S\u00e1, bacalhau com natas, bacalhau \u00e0 Minhota, bacalhau espiritual, bacalhau \u00e0 Lagareiro, bacalhau assado, bacalhau \u00e0 Z\u00e9 do Pipo, past\u00e9is de bacalhau. Other fish recipes include grilled sardines, mackerel, sea bream, and caldeirada, a tomato-based stew that can be made from several types of fish or shellfish, with a mix of onion, garlic, bay leaf, potatoes, peppers, parsley.\nTypical Portuguese meat recipes made out of the customary beef, pork, chicken, goat, lamb or duck meat, include \"cozido \u00e0 portuguesa\", \"feijoada\", \"frango de churrasco\", \"leit\u00e3o\" (roast suckling pig), \"chanfana\" and \"carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana\". Typical fast food dishes include the Francesinha (Frenchie) from Porto and \"bifanas\" (grilled pork) or \"prego\" (grilled beef) sandwiches. An egg custard tart pastry, the pastel de nata, typical and popular among the Portuguese, became popular abroad and among foreign tourists visiting the country as well.\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed recognition since the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god Bacchus, due to its climate. Some of the best Portuguese wines are Vinho Verde, Alvarinho, Vinho do Douro, Vinho do Alentejo, Vinho do D\u00e3o, Vinho da Bairrada and the sweet Port Wine, Madeira Wine, and the Moscatel from Set\u00fabal and Favaios.\nVisual art.\nPortugal has a rich history in painting. The first well-known painters dating back to the 15th century\u00a0\u2013 like Nuno Gon\u00e7alves and Vasco Fernandes\u00a0\u2013 were part of the late Gothic painting period. During the Renaissance, Portuguese painting was highly influenced by Northern European painting. In the Baroque period Josefa de \u00d3bidos and Vieira Lusitano were the most prolific painters.\nJos\u00e9 Malhoa, known for his work \"Fado\", and Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (who painted the portraits of Te\u00f3filo Braga and Antero de Quental) were both references in naturalist painting.\nThe 20th century saw the arrival of Modernism, and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly the Delaunays (Robert and Sonia). Among his best-known works is \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o Popular \u2013 a Russa e o F\u00edgaro\". Other great modernist painters/writers include Carlos Botelho and Almada Negreiros, friend to the poet Fernando Pessoa, who painted Pessoa's portrait. He was deeply influenced by both Cubist and Futurist trends.\nProminent international figures in visual arts today include painters Vieira da Silva, J\u00falio Pomar, Joana Vasconcelos, Juli\u00e3o Sarmento and Paula Rego.\nLiterature.\nPortuguese literature, one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text as well as song. Until 1350, the Portuguese-Galician troubadours spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula, like King D. Dinis (1261\u20131325) who became famous for his poetry. Other kings would write and sponsor works of literature across Portuguese history, like D. Fernando (1367\u20131383) who supported P\u00earo Menino in writing o \"Livro da Falcoaria\".\nAdventurer and poet Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es (c. 1524\u20131580) wrote the epic poem \"Os Lus\u00edadas\" (\"The Lusiads\"), with Virgil's \"Aeneid\" as his main influence. Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by Bocage (1765\u20131805), Antero de Quental (1842\u20131891) and Fernando Pessoa (1888\u20131935). Modern Portuguese literature is represented by authors such as Almeida Garrett, Camilo Castelo Branco, E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s, Fernando Pessoa, Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen, Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes, Miguel Torga and Agustina Bessa-Lu\u00eds. Particularly popular and distinguished is Jos\u00e9 Saramago, recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature.\nMusic.\nThe Music of Portugal encompasses a wide variety of genres. The traditional one is the Portuguese folk music which has deep roots in local customs, utilising instruments such as bagpipes (\"gaita\"), drums, flutes, tambourines, accordions and ukuleles (\"cavaquinho\"). Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of Fado, a melancholic urban music that originated in Lisbon in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, and is usually associated with the Portuguese guitar and \"saudade\", or longing. Coimbra fado, a unique type of \"troubadour serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues, Carlos Paredes, Jos\u00e9 Afonso, Mariza, Carlos do Carmo, Ant\u00f3nio Chainho, M\u00edsia, Dulce Pontes and Madredeus.\nIn addition to Folk, Fado and Classical music, other genres are present at Portugal like pop and other types of modern music, particularly from North America and the United Kingdom, as well as a wide range of Portuguese, Caribbean, Lusophone African and Brazilian artists and bands. Artists with international recognition include Dulce Pontes, Moonspell, Buraka Som Sistema, Blasted Mechanism, David Carreira and The Gift, with the three latter being nominees for a MTV Europe Music Award.\nPortugal has several summer music festivals, such as \"Festival Sudoeste\" in Zambujeira do Mar, \"Festival de Paredes de Coura\" in Paredes de Coura, \"Festival Vilar de Mouros\" near Caminha, \"Boom Festival\" in Idanha-a-Nova municipality, \"NOS Alive\", \"Sumol Summer Fest\" in Ericeira, \"Rock in Rio Lisboa\" and \"Super Bock Super Rock\" in Greater Lisbon, plus and in the Greater Porto area.\n Lu\u00edsa and Salvador Sobral won the Eurovision Song Contest 2017.\nThe student festivals of \"Queima das Fitas,\" which are major events in a number of cities across Portugal, show every year a selection of well-established, high-profile musicians and bands to the public as well as newer, on the rise, upcoming success artists seeking definite recognition. In 2005, Portugal held the MTV Europe Music Awards, in Pavilh\u00e3o Atl\u00e2ntico, Lisbon. Furthermore, Portugal won the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 in Kyiv with the song \"Amar pelos dois\" presented by Salvador Sobral, and subsequently hosted the 2018 contest.\nPortuguese classical music constitutes an important chapter of Western music. Over the centuries, names of composers and performers have stood out, such as the troubadours Martim Codax and King Denis I, the polyphonists Duarte Lobo, Filipe de Magalh\u00e3es, Manuel Cardoso and Pedro de Cristo, the organist Manuel Rodrigues Coelho, the composer and harpsichordist Carlos Seixas, the singer Lu\u00edsa Todi, symphonist and pianist Jo\u00e3o Domingos Bomtempo or composer and musicologist Fernando Lopes Gra\u00e7a.\nThe golden period of Portuguese music coincided, arguably, with the heyday of classical polyphony in the 17th century (Escola de \u00c9vora, Santa Cruz de Coimbra). Among the great current references, the names of pianists Artur Pizarro, Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires and Sequeira Costa, violinist Carlos Damas, composer Emmanuel Nunes, composer and conductor \u00c1lvaro Cassuto stand out. The most important symphony orchestras are the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Gulbenkian, the Porto National Orchestra and the Portuguese Symphony Orchestra. When it comes to opera, the Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos in Lisbon is the most representative.\nSport.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Portugal. There are several football competitions ranging from local amateur to world-class professional level. All-time greats Eus\u00e9bio, Lu\u00eds Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo are major symbols of Portuguese football history. Portuguese football managers are also noteworthy, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Abel Ferreira among the most renowned.\nThe Portugal national football team has won one UEFA European Championship title: the UEFA Euro 2016, with a 1\u20130 victory in the final over France, the tournament hosts. In addition, Portugal finished first in the 2018\u201319 and 2024\u201325 UEFA Nations League, second in the Euro 2004, third in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and fourth in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. At youth level, Portugal have won two FIFA World Youth Championships.\nS.L. Benfica, Sporting CP and FC Porto are the largest sports clubs by popularity and number of trophies, often known as \"os tr\u00eas grandes\" (\"the big three\"). They have won eight titles in the European UEFA club competitions and present in 21 finals. The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) \u2013 \"Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Futebol\"\u00a0\u2013 annually hosts the Algarve Cup, a women's football tournament.\nOther than football, many Portuguese sports clubs, including the \"big three\", compete in other sports events with a varying level of success and popularity, these include roller hockey, basketball, futsal, handball, volleyball and athletics. The Portuguese national rugby union team qualified for the 2027 Rugby World Cup and the Portuguese national rugby sevens team has played in the World Rugby Sevens Series.\nRoad cycling, with Volta a Portugal the most important race, is a popular sports event and includes professional cycling teams such as Sporting CP, Boavista, Clube de Ciclismo de Tavira and Uni\u00e3o Ciclista da Maia. In motorsport, Portugal is noted for the Rally of Portugal, and the Estoril and Algarve Circuits as well as the revived Porto Street Circuit which holds a stage of the WTCC every two years, as well as for a number of internationally noted racers such as Miguel Oliveira, Tiago Monteiro, Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa, Filipe Albuquerque, Pedro Lamy, Armindo Ara\u00fajo and others in a range of varied motorsports.\nIn water, Portugal has three major sports: swimming, water polo and surfing. Portugal had success in canoeing with several world and European champions, such as olympic medalist Fernando Pimenta. Annually, the country hosts one of the stages of the World Surf League men's and women's \"Championship Tour\", the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal at the Supertubos in Peniche. Northern Portugal has its own original martial art, \"Jogo do Pau\", in which fighters use staffs to confront one or several opponents. Other popular sport-related recreational outdoor activities include airsoft, fishing, golf, hiking, hunting and orienteering. Portugal is one of the world's leading golf destinations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23034", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23034", "title": "Piano", "text": "Keyboard instrument\nA piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when its keys are depressed, activating an action mechanism where hammers strike strings. Modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, tuned to a chromatic scale in equal temperament. A musician who specializes in piano is called a pianist.\nThere are two main types of piano: the grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano offers better sound and more precise key control, making it the preferred choice when space and budget allow. The grand piano is also considered a necessity in venues hosting skilled pianists. The upright piano is more commonly used because of its smaller size and lower cost.\nWhen a key is depressed, the strings inside are struck by felt-coated wooden hammers. The vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies the sound by coupling the acoustic energy to the air. When the key is released, a damper stops the string's vibration, ending the sound. Most notes have three strings, except for the bass, which graduates from one to two. Notes can be sustained when the keys are released by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument, which lift the dampers off the strings. The sustain pedal allows pianists to connect and overlay sound, and achieve expressive and colorful sonority.\nIn the 19th century, influenced by Romantic music trends, the fortepiano underwent changes such as the use of a cast iron frame, which allowed much greater string tensions. Aliquot stringing gave grand pianos a more powerful sound, a longer sustain, and a richer tone. Later in the century, as the piano became more common it allowed families to listen to a newly published musical piece by having a family member play a simplified version. \nThe piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals. Despite its weight and cost, the piano's versatility, the extensive training of musicians, and its availability in venues, schools, and rehearsal spaces have made it a familiar instrument in the Western world.\nHistory.\nThe piano was based on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments. The earliest known keyboard instrument was the Ancient Greek hydraulis, a type of pipe organ invented in the third century BC. Pipe organs had been used since antiquity, and as such the development of pipe organs enabled instrument builders to learn about creating keyboard mechanisms for sounding pitches. The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers, which were introduced in the Middle Ages in Europe. During the Middle Ages, there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings. By the 17th century, the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed. In a clavichord the strings are struck by tangents, while in a harpsichord they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key. Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown instrument builders the most effective ways to construct the case, soundboard, bridge, and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings.\nThe English word \"piano\" is a shortened form of the Italian ', derived from ' (\"harpsichord with soft and loud\"). Variations in volume (loudness) are produced in response to the pianist's \"touch\" (pressure on the keys): the greater the pressure, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings and the louder the sound produced and the stronger the \"attack\". Invented in 1700, the fortepiano was the second keyboard instrument (in addition to the clavichord which predates it) to allow gradations of volume and tone according to how forcefully or softly the player presses or strikes the keys, unlike the pipe organ and harpsichord.\nInvention.\nThe invention of the piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, as the Keeper of the Instruments. Cristofori was an expert harpsichord maker and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments. This knowledge of keyboard mechanisms and actions helped him to develop the first pianos. It is not known when Cristofori first built a piano. An inventory made by his employers, the Medici family, indicates the existence of a piano by 1700. The three Cristofori pianos that survive today date from the 1720s. Cristofori named the instrument \"un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte\" (\"a keyboard of cypress with soft and loud\"), abbreviated over time as \"pianoforte\", \"fortepiano\", and later reduced to only \"piano\".\nCristofori's great success was designing a stringed keyboard instrument in which the notes are struck by a hammer. The hammer must strike the string but not remain in contact with it, because continued contact would damp the sound and stop the string from vibrating and making sound. This means that after striking the string, the hammer must quickly fall from (or rebound from) the strings. The hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, thus preventing notes from being re-played by accidental rebound. It must return to a position in which it is ready to play again almost immediately after its key is depressed, so the player can repeat the same note rapidly when desired. Cristofori's piano action was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed in the next century.\nCristofori's early instruments were made with thin strings and were much quieter than the modern piano, though they were louder and had more sustain compared to the clavichord\u2014the only previous keyboard instrument capable of dynamic nuance responding to the player's touch, the velocity with which the keys are pressed. While the clavichord allows expressive control of volume and sustain, it is relatively quiet even at its loudest. The harpsichord produces a sufficiently loud sound, especially when a coupler joins each key to both manuals of a two-manual harpsichord, but it offers no dynamic or expressive control over individual notes. The piano in some sense offers the best of both of the older instruments, combining the ability to play at least as loudly as a harpsichord with the ability to continuously vary dynamics by touch.\nEarly fortepiano.\nCristofori's new instrument remained relatively unknown until an Italian writer, Scipione Maffei, wrote an enthusiastic article about it in 1711, including a diagram of the mechanism, that was translated into German and widely distributed. Most of the next generation of piano builders started their work based on reading this article. One of these builders was Gottfried Silbermann, better known as an organ builder. Silbermann's pianos were virtual copies of Cristofori's, with one important addition: Silbermann invented the forerunner of the modern sustain pedal, which lifts all the dampers from the strings simultaneously. This innovation allows the pianist to sustain the notes that they have depressed even after their fingers are no longer pressing down the keys. As such, by holding a chord with the sustain pedal, pianists can relocate their hands to a different register of the keyboard in preparation for a subsequent section.\nSilbermann showed Johann Sebastian Bach one of his early instruments in the 1730s, but Bach did not like the instrument at that time, saying that the higher notes were too soft to allow a full dynamic range. Although this earned him some animosity from Silbermann, the criticism was apparently heeded. Bach did approve of a later instrument he saw in 1747 and even served as an agent in selling Silbermann's pianos. \"Instrument: piano et forte genandt\"\u2014a reference to the instrument's ability to play soft and loud\u2014was an expression that Bach used to help sell the instrument when he was acting as Silbermann's agent in 1749.\nPiano making flourished during the late 18th century in the Viennese school, which included Johann Andreas Stein (who worked in Augsburg, Germany) and the Viennese makers Nannette Streicher (daughter of Stein) and Anton Walter. Viennese-style pianos were built with wood frames, two strings per note, and leather-covered hammers. Some of these Viennese pianos had the opposite coloring of modern-day pianos; the natural keys were black and the accidental keys white. It was for such instruments that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed his concertos and sonatas, and replicas of them are built in the 21st century for use in authentic-instrument performance of his music. The pianos of Mozart's day had a softer tone than 21st century pianos or English pianos, with less sustaining power. The term \"fortepiano\" now distinguishes these early instruments (and modern re-creations) from later pianos.\nFurther developments.\nIn the period from about 1790 to 1860, the Mozart-era piano underwent significant changes that led to the modern structure of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, which was made possible by the ongoing Industrial Revolution with resources such as high-quality piano wire for strings and precision casting for the production of massive iron frames that could withstand the tremendous tension of the strings. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five octaves of Mozart's day to the seven octave (or more) range found on today's pianos.\nEarly technological progress in the late 18th century owed much to the firm of Broadwood. John Broadwood joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, Americus Backers, to design a piano in the harpsichord case\u2014the origin of the \"grand\". This was achieved by about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing pianos that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed. \nThey sent pianos to both Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a fifth during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The Viennese makers similarly followed these trends. The two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods used a more robust action, whereas Viennese instruments were more sensitive.\nBy the 1820s, the center of piano innovation had shifted to Paris, where the Pleyel firm manufactured pianos used by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, and the \u00c9rard firm manufactured those used by Franz Liszt. In 1821, S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard invented the double escapement action, which incorporated a \"repetition lever\" (also called the \"balancier\") that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not return to its resting position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by Henri Herz, the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced in the 2000s.\nOther improvements of the mechanism included the use of firm felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which Jean-Henri Pape was the first to use in pianos in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The sostenuto pedal (see below), invented in 1844 by Jean-Louis Boisselot and copied by the Steinway firm in 1874, allowed for a wider range of effects.\nOne innovation that helped create the powerful sound of the modern piano was the use of a massive, strong, cast iron frame. Also called the \"plate\", the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension that can exceed 20 tons () in total for a modern grand piano. The single piece cast iron frame for square piano was patented in 1825 in Boston by Alpheus Babcock. Combining the metal hitch pin plate was patented in 1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Herv\u00e9. Resisting bars were added by Thom and Allen in 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and \u00c9rard. Babcock later worked for the Chickering &amp; Mackays firm, who patented the first full iron frame for grand pianos in 1843. \nComposite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century. The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings. In 1834, the Webster &amp; Horsfal firm of Birmingham brought out a form of piano wire made from cast steel. It was \"so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly.\" A better steel wire was developed in 1840 by the Viennese firm Martin Miller, and a period of innovation and intense competition ensued, with rival brands of piano wire being tested against one another at international competitions, leading ultimately to the modern form of piano wire.\nSeveral important advances included changes to the way the piano was strung. There is one string for each note in the bass, two for each note in the tenor, and three for each note in the treble. The use of a Capo d\u2019Astro bar instead of agraffes in the uppermost treble allowed the hammers to strike the strings in their optimal position, greatly increasing that area's power. The implementation of over-stringing, also called cross-stringing, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own bridge height, allowed greater length to the bass strings and optimized the transition from unwound tenor strings to the iron or copper-wound bass strings. Over-stringing was invented by Pape during the 1820s and first patented for use in grand pianos in the United States by Henry Steinway Jr. in 1859.\nSome piano makers added variations to enhance the tone of each note, such as Pascal Taskin (1788), Collard &amp; Collard (1821), and Julius Bl\u00fcthner, who developed Aliquot stringing in 1893. These systems were used to strengthen the tone of the highest register of notes on the piano, which up until this time were viewed as being too weak-sounding. Each used more distinctly ringing, undamped vibrations of sympathetically vibrating strings to add to the tone, except the Bl\u00fcthner Aliquot stringing, which uses an additional fourth string in the upper two treble sections. \nWhile the hitchpins of these separately suspended Aliquot strings are raised slightly above the level of the usual tri-choir strings, they are not struck by the hammers but rather are damped by attachments of the usual dampers. Eager to copy these effects, Theodore Steinway invented \"duplex scaling\", which used short lengths of non-speaking wire bridged by the \"aliquot\" throughout much of the upper range of the piano, always in locations that caused them to vibrate sympathetically in conformity with their respective overtones\u2014typically in doubled octaves and twelfths.\nVariations in shape and design.\nSome early pianos had shapes and designs that are no longer in use. The square piano, not truly square, but rectangular, was cross strung at an extremely acute angle above the hammers, with the keyboard set along the long side. This design is attributed to Christian Ernst Friderici, a pupil of Gottfried Silbermann, in Germany and Johannes Zumpe in England, and it was improved by changes first introduced by Guillaume-Lebrecht Petzold in France and Alpheus Babcock in the United States. \nSquare pianos were built in great numbers until the 1840s in Europe and the 1890s in the United States, and saw the most visible change of any type of piano: the iron-framed, over-strung squares manufactured by Steinway &amp; Sons were more than two-and-a-half times the size of Zumpe's wood-framed instruments from a century before. Their overwhelming popularity was the result of inexpensive construction and price, although their tone and performance were limited by narrow soundboards, simple actions and string spacing that made proper hammer alignment difficult.\nThe tall, vertically strung upright grand was arranged like a grand set on end, with the soundboard and bridges above the keys and tuning pins below them. \"Giraffe pianos\", \"pyramid pianos\" and \"lyre pianos\" were arranged in a somewhat similar fashion, using evocatively shaped cases. The very tall cabinet piano was introduced about 1805 and was built until the 1840s. It had strings arranged vertically on a continuous frame with bridges extended nearly to the floor, behind the keyboard and very large \"sticker action\". \nThe short cottage upright or \"pianino\" with vertical stringing\u2014made popular by Robert Wornum around 1815\u2014was built into the 20th century. They are informally called \"birdcage pianos\" because of their prominent damper mechanism. The oblique upright, popularized in France by Roller &amp; Blanchet during the late 1820s, was diagonally strung throughout its compass. The tiny spinet upright was manufactured from the mid-1930s until recent times. The low position of the hammers required the use of a \"drop action\" to preserve a reasonable keyboard height. \nModern upright and grand pianos attained their present, 2000-era forms by the end of the 19th century. While improvements have been made in manufacturing processes, and many individual details of the instrument continue to receive attention, and a small number of acoustic pianos in the 2010s are produced with MIDI recording and digital sound module-triggering capabilities, the 19th century was the era of the most dramatic innovations and modifications of the instrument.\nTypes.\nModern pianos have two basic configurations, the grand piano and the upright piano, with various styles of each. There are also specialized and novelty pianos, electric pianos based on electromechanical designs, electronic pianos that synthesize piano-like tones using oscillators, and digital pianos using digital samples of acoustic piano sounds.\nGrand.\nIn a grand piano, the frame and strings are horizontal, with the strings extending away from the keyboard. The action lies beneath the strings and uses gravity as its means of return to a state of rest. Grand pianos range in length from approximately . Some of the lengths have been given more-or-less customary names, which vary from time to time and place to place, but might include:\nAll else being equal, longer pianos with longer strings have larger, richer sound and lower inharmonicity of the strings. Inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of overtones, known as partials or harmonics, sound sharp relative to whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. This results from the piano's considerable string stiffness. As a struck string decays, its harmonics vibrate from a point very slightly from its termination toward the center, or more flexible part of the string.\nThe inharmonicity may also result from imperfections within the string, such as rust on plain strings and dirt in the windings of bass strings. The higher the partial, the further sharp it runs. Pianos with shorter and thicker string, i.e., small pianos with short string scales, have more inharmonicity. The greater the inharmonicity, the more the ear perceives it as harshness of tone.\nThe inharmonicity of piano strings requires that octaves be \"stretched,\" or tuned to a lower octave's corresponding sharp overtone rather than to a theoretically correct octave. If octaves are not stretched, single octaves sound in tune, but double\u2014and notably triple\u2014octaves are unacceptably narrow. Stretching a small piano's octaves to match its inherent inharmonicity level creates an imbalance among all the instrument's intervallic relationships. \nIn a concert grand, the octave \"stretch\" retains harmonic balance, even when aligning treble notes to a harmonic produced from three octaves below. This lets close and widespread octaves sound pure, and produces virtually beatless perfect fifths. This gives the concert grand a brilliant, singing and sustaining tone quality\u2014one of the principal reasons that full-size grands are used in the concert hall. Smaller grands satisfy the space and cost needs of domestic use. They are used in some small teaching studios and smaller performance venues.\nUpright.\nUpright pianos, also called vertical pianos, are more compact with a vertical structure of the frame and strings. The mechanical action structure of the upright piano was invented in London in 1826 by Robert Wornum, and upright models became the most popular model for domestic use. Upright pianos take up less space than a grand piano and as such are a better size for use in private homes for domestic music-making and practice. The hammers move horizontally and return to their resting position via springs, which are susceptible to degradation.\nUpright pianos with unusually tall frames and long strings were sometimes marketed as \"upright grand\" pianos, but that label is misleading. Some authors classify modern pianos according to their height and to modifications of the action that are necessary to accommodate the height. Upright pianos are generally less expensive than grand pianos. Upright pianos are widely used in churches, community centers, schools, music conservatories and university music programs as rehearsal and practice instruments. They are popular models for in-home purchase.\nSpecialized.\nThe toy piano, introduced in the 19th century, is a small piano-like instrument that generally uses round metal rods to produce sound, rather than strings. The US Library of Congress recognizes the toy piano as a unique instrument with the subject designation, Toy Piano Scores: M175 T69.\nIn 1863, Henri Fourneaux invented the player piano, which plays itself from a piano roll. A machine perforates a performance recording into rolls of paper, and the player piano replays the performance using pneumatic devices. Modern equivalents of the player piano include the B\u00f6sendorfer CEUS, Yamaha Disklavier and QRS Pianomation, using solenoids and MIDI rather than pneumatics and rolls.\nA silent piano is an acoustic piano having an option to silence the strings by means of an interposing hammer bar. They are designed for private silent practice, to avoid disturbing others.\nIn 1801, Edward Ryley invented the transposing piano. This rare instrument has a lever under the keyboard to move the keyboard relative to the strings, so a pianist can play in a familiar key while the music sounds in a different key.\nThe minipiano is an instrument patented by the Brasted brothers of the Eavestaff Ltd. piano company in 1934. This instrument has a braceless back and a soundboard positioned below the keys\u2014long metal rods pull on the levers to make the hammers strike the strings. The first model, known as the \"Pianette\", was unique in that the tuning pins extended through the instrument, so it could be tuned at the front.\nThe prepared piano, present in some contemporary art music from the 20th and 21st century is a piano which has objects placed inside it to alter its sound, or has had its mechanism changed in some other way. The scores for music for prepared piano specify the modifications, for example, instructing the pianist to insert pieces of rubber, paper, metal screws, or washers in between the strings. These objects mute the strings or alter their timbre.\nSome Viennese fortepianos incorporated percussion effects, brought into action by levers. These were used in pieces such as Mozart's \"Rondo alla Turca\". \nThe pedal piano is a rare type of piano that has a pedal keyboard at the base, designed to be played by the feet. The pedals may play the existing bass strings on the piano, or rarely, the pedals may have their own set of bass strings and hammer mechanisms. While the typical intended use for pedal pianos is to enable a keyboardist to practice pipe organ music at home, a few players of pedal piano use it as a performance instrument.\nWadia Sabra had a microtone piano manufactured by Pleyel in 1920. Abdallah Chahine later constructed his quartertone \"Oriental piano\" with the help of Austrian Hofmann.\nElectric, electronic, and digital.\nWith technological advances, amplified electric pianos (1929), electronic pianos (1970s), and digital pianos (1980s) have been developed. The first electric pianos from the late 1920s used metal strings with a magnetic pickup, an amplifier and a loudspeaker. The electric pianos that became most popular in pop and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s, such as the Fender Rhodes use metal tines in place of strings and use electromagnetic pickups similar to those on an electric guitar. The resulting electrical, analogue signal can then be amplified with a keyboard amplifier or electronically manipulated with effects units. In classical music, electric pianos are mainly used as inexpensive rehearsal or practice instruments. Electric pianos, particularly the Fender Rhodes, became important instruments in 1970s funk and jazz fusion and in some rock music genres.\nElectronic pianos are non-acoustic; they do not have strings, tines or hammers, but are a type of analog synthesizer that simulates or imitates piano sounds using oscillators and filters that synthesize the sound of an acoustic piano. They must be connected to a keyboard amplifier and speaker to produce sound (however, some electronic keyboards have a built-in amp and speaker). Alternatively, a person can play an electronic piano with headphones in quieter settings.\nDigital pianos are also non-acoustic and do not have strings or hammers. They use digital audio sampling technology to reproduce the acoustic sound of each piano note accurately. They also must be connected to a power amplifier and speaker to produce sound (however, most digital pianos have a built-in amp and speaker). Alternatively, a person can practise with headphones to avoid disturbing others. Digital pianos can include sustain pedals, weighted or semi-weighted keys, multiple voice options (e.g., sampled or synthesized imitations of electric piano, Hammond organ, violin, etc.), and MIDI interfaces. MIDI inputs and outputs connect a digital piano to other electronic instruments or musical devices. For example, a digital piano's MIDI out signal could be connected by a patch cord to a synth module, which would allow the performer to use the keyboard of the digital piano to play modern synthesizer sounds. Early digital pianos tended to lack a full set of pedals, but the synthesis software of later models such as the Yamaha Clavinova series synthesised the sympathetic vibration of the other strings (such as when the sustain pedal is depressed) and full pedal sets can now be replicated. The processing power of digital pianos has enabled highly realistic pianos using multi-gigabyte piano sample sets with as many as ninety recordings, each lasting many seconds, for each key under different conditions (e.g., there are samples of each note being struck softly, loudly, with a sharp attack, etc.). Additional samples emulate sympathetic resonance of the strings when the sustain pedal is depressed, key release, the drop of the dampers, and simulations of techniques such as re-pedalling.\nDigital, MIDI-equipped pianos can output a stream of MIDI data, or record and play MIDI format files on digital storage media, similar in concept to a pianola. The MIDI file records the physics of a note rather than its resulting sound and recreates the sounds from its physical properties (e.g., which note was struck and with what velocity). Computer based software, such as Modartt's 2006 Pianoteq, can be used to manipulate the MIDI stream in real time or subsequently to edit it. This type of software may use no samples but synthesize a sound based on aspects of the physics that went into the creation of a played note.\nHybrid instruments.\nBy the 2000s, some pianos included an acoustic grand piano or upright piano combined with MIDI electronic features. Such a piano can be played acoustically, or the keyboard can be used as a MIDI controller, which can trigger a synthesizer module or music sampler. Some electronic feature-equipped pianos such as the Yamaha Disklavier electronic player piano, introduced in 1987, are outfitted with electronic sensors for recording and electromechanical solenoids for player piano-style playback. Sensors record the movements of the keys, hammers, and pedals during a performance, and the system saves the performance data as a Standard MIDI File (SMF). On playback, the solenoids move the keys and pedals and thus reproduce the original performance. Modern Disklaviers typically include an array of electronic features, such as a built-in tone generator for playing back MIDI accompaniment tracks, speakers, MIDI connectivity that supports communication with computing devices and external MIDI instruments, additional ports for audio and SMPTE input/output (I/O), and Internet connectivity. Disklaviers have been manufactured in the form of upright, baby grand, and grand piano styles (including a nine-foot concert grand). Reproducing systems have ranged from relatively simple, playback-only models to professional models that can record performance data at resolutions that exceed the limits of normal MIDI data. The unit mounted under the keyboard of the piano can play MIDI or audio software on its CD.\nConstruction and components.\nPianos can have over 12,000 individual parts, supporting six functional features: keyboard, hammers, dampers, bridge, soundboard, and strings. Many parts of a piano are made of materials selected for strength and longevity. This is especially true of the outer rim, which is most commonly made of hardwood, typically hard maple or beech, and its massiveness serves as an essentially immobile object from which the flexible soundboard can best vibrate. According to Harold A. Conklin, the purpose of a sturdy rim is so that, \"...\u00a0the vibrational energy will stay as much as possible in the soundboard instead of dissipating uselessly in the case parts, which are inefficient radiators of sound.\"\nHardwood rims are commonly made by laminating thin, hence flexible, strips of hardwood, bending them to the desired shape immediately after the application of glue. The bent plywood system was developed by C.F. Theodore Steinway in 1880 to reduce manufacturing time and costs. Previously, the rim was constructed from several pieces of solid wood, joined and veneered, and European makers used this method well into the 20th century. A modern exception, B\u00f6sendorfer, an Austrian manufacturer of high-quality pianos, constructs their inner rims from solid spruce, the same wood that the soundboard is made from, which is notched to allow it to bend. Rather than isolating the rim from vibration, their \"resonance case principle\" allows the framework to resonate more freely with the soundboard, creating additional coloration and complexity of the overall sound.\nThe thick wooden posts on the underside (grands) or back (uprights) of the piano stabilize the rim structure and are made of softwood for stability. The requirement of structural strength, fulfilled by stout hardwood and thick metal, makes a piano heavy. Even a small upright can weigh . The Steinway concert grand (Model D) weighs . The largest piano available on the general market, the Fazioli F308, weighs .\nThe pinblock, which holds the tuning pins in place, is another area where toughness is important. It is made of hardwood, typically hard maple or beech, and is laminated for strength, stability and longevity. Piano strings, also called piano wire, which must endure years of extreme tension and hard blows, are made of high carbon steel. They are manufactured to vary as little as possible in diameter, since all deviations from uniformity introduce tonal distortion. The bass strings of a piano are made of a steel core wrapped with one or two layers of copper wire, to increase their mass whilst retaining flexibility. If all strings throughout the piano's compass were individual (monochord), the massive bass strings would overpower the upper ranges. Makers compensate for this with the use of double strings in the tenor and triple strings throughout the treble.\nThe plate (harp), or metal frame, of a piano is usually made of cast iron. A massive plate is advantageous. Since the strings vibrate from the plate at both ends, an insufficiently massive plate would absorb too much of the vibrational energy that should go through the bridge to the soundboard. While some manufacturers use cast steel in their plates, most prefer cast iron. Cast iron is easy to cast and machine, has flexibility sufficient for piano use, is much more resistant to deformation than steel, and is especially tolerant of compression. Plate casting is an art, since dimensions are crucial and the iron shrinks about one percent during cooling. Including an extremely large piece of metal in a piano is potentially an aesthetic handicap. Piano makers overcome this by polishing, painting, and decorating the plate. Plates often include the manufacturer's ornamental medallion. \nIn an effort to make pianos lighter, Alcoa worked with Winter and Company piano manufacturers to make pianos using an aluminum plate during the 1940s. Aluminum piano plates were not widely accepted and were discontinued. Prior to this, a piano made almost entirely of aluminum was placed aboard the airship Hindenburg.\nThe numerous parts of a piano action are generally made from hardwood, such as maple, beech, or hornbeam. Since World War II, makers have also incorporated plastics. Early plastics used in some pianos in the late 1940s and 1950s, proved problematic when they lost strength after a few decades of use. Beginning in 1961, the New York branch of the Steinway firm incorporated Teflon, a synthetic material developed by DuPont, for some parts of its Permafree grand action in place of cloth bushings. \nThey abandoned the experiment in 1982 due to excessive friction and a \"clicking\" that developed over time. Teflon is \"humidity stable\" whereas the wood adjacent to the Teflon swells and shrinks with humidity changes, causing problems. More recently, the Kawai firm built pianos with action parts made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic. The piano parts manufacturer Wessell, Nickel and Gross has launched a new line of carefully engineered composite parts. Thus far these parts have performed reasonably, but it will take decades to know if they equal the longevity of wood.\nIn all but the lowest quality pianos, the soundboard is made of spruce boards glued together along the side grain. Spruce's high ratio of strength to weight minimizes acoustic impedance while offering strength sufficient to withstand the downward force of the strings. The best piano makers use quarter-sawn, defect-free spruce of close annular grain, carefully seasoning it over a long period before fabricating the soundboards. This is the same material that is used in quality acoustic guitar soundboards. Low-cost pianos often have plywood soundboards.\nThe design of the piano hammers requires having the hammer felt be soft enough so that it will not create loud, very high harmonics that a hard hammer will cause. The hammer must be lightweight enough to move swiftly when a key is pressed; yet at the same time, it must be strong enough so that it can hit strings hard when the player strikes the keys forcefully for fortissimo playing or sforzando accents.\nKeyboard.\nIn the early years of piano construction, keys were commonly made from sugar pine. In the 2010s, they are usually made of spruce or basswood. Spruce is typically used in high-quality pianos. Black keys were traditionally made of ebony, and the white keys were covered with strips of ivory. Since ivory-yielding species are now endangered and protected by treaty, or are illegal in some countries, makers use plastics almost exclusively. Also, ivory tends to chip more easily than plastic. Legal ivory can still be obtained in limited quantities. Yamaha developed a plastic called \"Ivorite\" intended to mimic the look and feel of ivory, with manufacturers doing the same.\nMost modern pianos have 52 white keys and 36 black keys, for a total of 88 keys (seven octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8). Some older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to A7). Some piano manufacturers have extended the range further in one or both directions. For example, the Imperial B\u00f6sendorfer has nine extra keys at the bass end, giving a total of 97 keys and an eight octave range. These extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can cover the keys to prevent visual disorientation for pianists unfamiliar with the extra keys, or the colours of the extra white keys are reversed, black instead of white. More recently, Australian manufacturer Stuart &amp; Sons created a piano with 108 keys, going from C0 to B8, covering nine full octaves. \nThe extra keys are the same as the other keys in appearance. The extra keys are added primarily for increased resonance from the associated strings. They vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the damper pedal is depressed and thus give a fuller tone. Only a very small number of works composed for piano actually use these notes. Toy piano company Schoenhut manufactures grands and uprights with only 44 or 49 keys and a shorter distance between the keyboard and the pedals. These are true pianos with working mechanisms and strings.\nA rare variant of the piano called the \"Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r Pianoforte\" has double keyboards, one lying above the other. It was invented by Hungarian composer and pianist Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r. The lower keyboard has the usual 88 keys, whilst the upper keyboard has 76 keys. When the upper keyboard is played, an internal mechanism pulls down the corresponding key on the lower keyboard, but an octave higher. This lets a pianist reach two octaves with one hand, impossible on a conventional piano.\nDue to its double keyboard, musical works that were originally created for double-manual harpsichord, such as the \"Goldberg Variations\" by Bach, become much easier to play, since playing on a conventional single keyboard piano involves complex and hand-tangling cross-hand movements. The design features a special fourth pedal that couples the lower and upper keyboard, so when playing on the lower keyboard the note one octave higher also plays. Only about 60 Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r Pianofortes were made, mostly by B\u00f6sendorfer. Other piano manufacturers, such as Bechstein, Chickering, and Steinway &amp; Sons, also manufactured a few.\nPianos have been built with alternative keyboard systems, e.g., the Jank\u00f3 keyboard.\nPedals.\nPianos have had pedals, or some close equivalent, since the earliest days. In the 18th century, some pianos used levers pressed upward by the player's knee instead of pedals. Most grand pianos in the US have three pedals: the soft pedal (una corda), sostenuto, and sustain pedal, from left to right, respectively. In Europe, the standard is two pedals: the soft pedal and the sustain pedal. \nMost modern upright pianos have three pedals: soft pedal, practice pedal and sustain pedal. Older or cheaper models may lack the practice pedal. In Europe the standard for upright pianos is two pedals: the soft and the sustain pedals.\nThe sustain pedal, or damper pedal, is often simply called \"the pedal\", since it is the most frequently used. It is the rightmost pedal in the group. It lifts the dampers from all strings, sustaining played notes. In addition, it broadens the overall tone by allowing all strings, including those not directly played, to reverberate sympathetically.\nSympathetic vibration of strings is strongest among notes that are harmonically related to the sounded pitches, i.e., a played 440\u00a0Hz \"A\" note would evoke the higher octave \"A\" notes, but since piano strings vibrate with a great complexity of overtones, the harmonic and inharmonic interaction is among all notes is enormous.\nThe soft pedal or \"una corda\" pedal is placed leftmost in the row of pedals. In grand pianos it shifts the entire action/keyboard assembly to the right (a very few instruments have shifted left) so that the hammers hit two of the three strings for each note. In the earliest pianos whose unisons were two strings rather than three, the action shifted so that hammers hit a single string, hence the name \"una corda\", or 'one string'. The effect is to soften the note as well as change the tone. In upright pianos, depressing the pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings, allowing the hammers to strike with less force. This produces a slightly softer sound but no change in timbre.\nOn grand pianos, the middle pedal is a sostenuto pedal. This pedal keeps raised any damper already raised at the moment the pedal is depressed. This makes it possible to sustain selected notes (by depressing the sostenuto pedal before those notes are released) while the player's hands are free to play additional notes (which do not sustain). This can be useful for musical passages with low bass pedal points, in which a bass note is sustained while a series of chords changes over top of it, and other otherwise tricky parts. On many upright pianos, the middle pedal is called the \"practice\" or \"celeste\" pedal. This drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings, greatly muting the sound of the instrument. This pedal can be shifted while depressed, into a \"locking\" position.\nThere are also non-standard variants. On some pianos (grands and verticals), the middle pedal can be a bass sustain pedal: that is, when it is depressed, the dampers lift off the strings only in the bass section. Players use this pedal to sustain a single bass note or chord over many measures, while playing the melody in the treble section.\nThe rare transposing piano (an example of which was owned by Irving Berlin) has a middle pedal that functions as a clutch that disengages the keyboard from the mechanism, so the player can move the keyboard to the left or right with a lever. This shifts the entire piano action so the pianist can play music written in one key so that it sounds in a different key.\nSome piano companies have included extra pedals other than the standard two or three. On the Stuart and Sons pianos as well as the largest Fazioli piano, there is a fourth pedal to the left of the principal three. This fourth pedal works in the same way as the soft pedal of an upright piano, moving the hammers closer to the strings. The Crown and Schubert Piano Company also produced a four-pedal piano.\nWing and Son of New York offered a five-pedal piano from approximately 1893 to the 1920s. There is no mention of the company past the 1930s. Labeled left to right, the pedals are Mandolin, Orchestra, Expression, Soft, and Forte (Sustain). The Orchestral pedal produced a sound similar to a tremolo feel by bouncing a set of small beads dangling against the strings, enabling the piano to mimic a mandolin, guitar, banjo, zither and harp, thus the name Orchestral. The Mandolin pedal used a similar approach, lowering a set of felt strips with metal rings in between the hammers and the strings (aka rinky-tink effect). This extended the life of the hammers when the Orch pedal was used, a good idea for practicing, and created an echo-like sound that mimicked playing in an orchestral hall.\nThe \"pedalier\" piano, or pedal piano, is a rare type of piano that includes a pedalboard so players can use their feet to play bass register notes, as on an organ. There are two types of pedal piano. On one, the pedal board is an integral part of the instrument, using the same strings and mechanism as the manual keyboard. The other, rarer type, consists of two independent pianos (each with separate mechanics and strings) placed one above the other\u2014one for the hands and one for the feet. This was developed primarily as a practice instrument for organists, though there is a small repertoire written specifically for the instrument.\nMechanics.\nWhen the key is struck, a chain reaction occurs to produce the sound. First, the key raises the \"wippen\" mechanism, which forces the jack against the hammer roller (or \"knuckle\"). The hammer roller then lifts the lever carrying the hammer. The key also raises the damper. Immediately after the hammer strikes the wire it falls back, allowing the wire to resonate and thus produce sound. When the key is released, the damper falls back onto the strings, stopping the wire from vibrating, and thus stopping the sound. \nThe vibrating piano strings themselves are not very loud, but their vibrations are transmitted to a large soundboard that moves air and thus converts the energy to sound. The irregular shape and off-center placement of the bridge ensure that the soundboard vibrates strongly at all frequencies. The raised damper allows the note to sound until the key, or sustain pedal, is released.\nThere are three factors that influence the pitch of a vibrating wire.\nA vibrating wire subdivides itself into many parts vibrating at the same time. Each part produces a pitch of its own, called a partial. A vibrating string has one fundamental and a series of partials. The purest combination of two pitches is when one is double the frequency of the other.\nFor a repeating wave, the velocity \"v\" equals the wavelength \"\u03bb\" times the frequency \"f\",\n\"v\" \n \"\u03bbf\"\nOn the piano string, waves reflect from both ends. The superposition of reflecting waves results in a standing wave pattern, but only for wavelengths \"\u03bb\" \n 2\"L\", \"L\", , , ... \n , where \"L\" is the length of the string. Therefore, the only frequencies produced on a single string are \"f\" \n . Timbre is largely determined by the content of these harmonics. Different instruments have different harmonic content for the same pitch. A real string vibrates at harmonics that are not perfect multiples of the fundamental. This results in a little inharmonicity, which gives richness to the tone but causes significant tuning challenges throughout the compass of the instrument.\nStriking the piano key with greater velocity increases the amplitude of the waves and therefore the volume. From \"pianissimo\" (pp) to \"fortissimo\" (ff) the hammer velocity changes by almost a factor of a hundred. The hammer contact time with the string shortens from 4 milliseconds at pp to less than 2\u00a0ms at ff. If two wires adjusted to the same pitch are struck at the same time, the sound produced by one reinforces the other, and a louder combined sound of shorter duration is produced. If one wire vibrates out of synchronization with the other, they subtract from each other and produce a softer tone of longer duration.\nMaintenance.\nTuning.\nPianos are heavy and powerful, yet delicate instruments. Over the years, professional piano movers have developed special techniques for transporting both grands and uprights, which prevent damage to the case and to the piano's mechanical elements. Pianos need regular tuning to keep them on correct pitch. The hammers of pianos are voiced to compensate for gradual hardening of the felt, and other parts also need periodic regulation. Pianos need regular maintenance to ensure the felt hammers and key mechanisms are functioning properly. Aged and worn pianos can be rebuilt or reconditioned by piano rebuilders. Strings eventually must be replaced. Often, by replacing a great number of their parts and adjusting them, old instruments can perform as well as new pianos.\nPiano tuning involves adjusting the tensions of the piano's strings with a specialized wrench, thereby aligning the intervals among their tones so that the instrument is in tune. While guitar and violin players tune their own instruments, pianists usually hire a piano tuner, a specialized technician, to tune their pianos. The piano tuner uses special tools. The meaning of the term \"in tune\" in the context of piano tuning is not simply a particular fixed set of pitches. \nFine piano tuning carefully assesses the interaction among all notes of the chromatic scale, different for every piano, and requires slightly different pitches from any theoretical standard. Pianos are usually tuned to a modified version of the system called equal temperament. In all systems of tuning, each pitch is derived from its relationship to a chosen fixed pitch, usually the internationally recognized standard concert pitch of A4 (the A above middle C). The term A440 refers to a widely accepted frequency of this pitch: 440\u00a0Hz.\nThe relationship between two pitches, called an interval, is the ratio of their absolute frequencies. Two different intervals are perceived as the same when the pairs of pitches involved share the same frequency ratio. The easiest intervals to identify, and the easiest intervals to tune, are those that are just, meaning they have a simple whole-number ratio. The term \"temperament\" refers to a tuning system that tempers the just intervals (usually the perfect fifth, which has the ratio 3:2) to satisfy another mathematical property; in equal temperament, a fifth is tempered by narrowing it slightly, achieved by flattening its upper pitch slightly, or raising its lower pitch slightly. A temperament system is also known as a set of \"bearings\". \nTempering an interval causes it to beat, which is a fluctuation in perceived sound intensity due to interference between close (but unequal) pitches. The rate of beating is equal to the frequency differences of any harmonics that are present for both pitches and that coincide or nearly coincide. Piano tuners have to use their ear to \"stretch\" the tuning of a piano to make it sound in tune. This involves tuning the highest-pitched strings slightly higher and the lowest-pitched strings slightly lower than what a mathematical frequency table (in which octaves are derived by doubling the frequency) would suggest.\nPlaying and technique.\nAs with any other musical instrument, the piano may be played from written music, by ear, or through improvisation. While some folk and blues pianists were self-taught, in classical and jazz, there are well-established piano teaching systems and institutions, including pre-college graded examinations, university, college and music conservatory diplomas and degrees, ranging from the B.Mus. and M.Mus. to the Doctor of Musical Arts in piano. Piano technique evolved during the transition from harpsichord and clavichord to fortepiano playing and continued through the development of the modern piano. Changes in musical styles and audience preferences over the 19th and 20th century, as well as the emergence of virtuoso performers, contributed to this evolution and to the growth of distinct approaches or schools of piano playing. Although technique is often viewed as only the physical execution of a musical idea, many pedagogues and performers stress the interrelatedness of the physical and mental or emotional aspects of piano playing. Well-known approaches to piano technique include those by Dorothy Taubman, Edna Golandsky, Fred Karpoff, Charles-Louis Hanon and Otto Ortmann.\nPerformance styles.\nMany classical music composers, including Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and Beethoven, composed for the fortepiano, a rather different instrument than the modern piano. Even composers of the Romantic movement, like Franz Liszt, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Clara and Robert Schumann, Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn, and Johannes Brahms, wrote for pianos substantially different from 2010-era modern pianos. Contemporary musicians may adjust their interpretation of historical compositions from the 17th century to the 19th century to account for sound quality differences between old and new instruments or to changing performance practice.\nStarting in Beethoven's later career, the fortepiano evolved into an instrument more like the modern piano. Modern pianos were in wide use by the late 19th century. They featured an octave range larger than the earlier fortepiano instrument, adding around 30 more keys to the instrument, which extended the deep bass range and the high treble range. Factory mass production of upright pianos made them more affordable for a larger number of middle-class people. They appeared in music halls and pubs during the 19th century, providing entertainment through a piano soloist, or in combination with a small dance band. Just as harpsichordists had accompanied singers or dancers performing on stage, or playing for dances, pianists took up this role in the late 18th and following centuries.\nDuring the 19th century, American musicians playing for working-class audiences in small pubs and bars, particularly , developed new musical genres based on the modern piano. Ragtime music, popularized by composers such as Scott Joplin, reached a broader audience by 1900. The popularity of ragtime music was quickly succeeded by Jazz piano. New techniques and rhythms were invented for the piano, including ostinato for boogie-woogie, and Shearing voicing. George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\" broke new musical ground by combining American jazz piano with symphonic sounds. \nComping, a technique for accompanying jazz vocalists on piano, was exemplified by Duke Ellington's technique. Honky-tonk music, featuring yet another style of piano rhythm, became popular during the same era. Bebop techniques grew out of jazz, with leading composer-pianists such as Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell. In the late 20th century, Bill Evans composed pieces combining classical techniques with his jazz experimentation. In the 1970s, Herbie Hancock was one of the first jazz composer-pianists to find mainstream popularity working with newer urban music techniques such as jazz-funk and jazz-rock.\nPianos have also been used prominently in rock and roll and rock music by performers such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Keith Emerson (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer), Elton John, Ben Folds, Billy Joel, Nicky Hopkins, Rick Wakeman, Freddie Mercury and Tori Amos, to name a few. At a 2023 auction in Sotheby's in London, Mercury's Yamaha baby grand piano, which he used to compose \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" among other Queen songs, sold for \u00a31.7 million ($2.1 million), which Sotheby's state is a record for a composer's piano. Modernist styles of music have also appealed to composers writing for the modern grand piano, including John Cage and Philip Glass.\nTraditional Burmese style.\nIntroduced to Burma during the mid-19th century, the piano was quickly indigenized by court musicians and uses a novel \"technique of interlocked fingering with both hands extending a single melodic line allowed for agogic embellishment, fleeting grace notes in syncopated spirals around a steady underlying beat found in the bell and clapper time keepers\", adapted to play Mah\u0101g\u012bta compositions. Many Burmese pianists (e.g., Sandayar Hla Htut and Sandayar Chit Swe) adopt a title from the word for piano, \"sandaya\" ().\nRole.\nThe piano is a crucial instrument in many Western musical genres. Pianos are used in soloing or melodic roles and as accompaniment instruments. Pianos can be played alone, with a voice or other instrument, in small groups (bands and chamber music ensembles) and large ensembles (big band or orchestra). A large number of composers and songwriters are proficient pianists because the piano keyboard offers an effective means of experimenting with complex melodic and harmonic interplay of chords and trying out multiple, independent melody lines that are played at the same time. Pianos are used by composers doing film and television scoring, as the large range permits composers to try out melodies and bass lines, even if the music will be orchestrated for other instruments.\nBandleaders and choir conductors often learn the piano, as it is an excellent instrument for learning new pieces and songs to lead in performance. Many conductors are trained in piano, because it allows them to play parts of the symphonies they are conducting (using a piano reduction or doing a reduction from the full score), so that they can develop their interpretation. The piano is an essential tool in music education in elementary and secondary schools, and universities and colleges. Most music classrooms and many practice rooms have a piano. Pianos are used to help teach music theory, music history and music appreciation classes, and even non-pianist music professors or instructors may have a piano in their office.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

She is best known for her modelling work in \"Playboy\" magazine and for her role as \"C.J.\" Parker on the television series \"Baywatch\" (1992\u20131997).\nAnderson came to public prominence after being selected as the February 1990 \"Playboy\" Playmate of the Month following her appearance on the cover of the magazine's October 1989 issue. She went on to make regular appearances on the magazine's cover, holding the record for the most \"Playboy\" covers by any individual. Anderson became known to a wider audience with her role on the ABC sitcom \"Home Improvement\" for its first two seasons. She gained international recognition for her starring role of \"C.J.\" Parker on the action drama series \"Baywatch\", further cementing her status as a sex symbol. In 1995, a sex tape of her with her then-husband Tommy Lee was stolen and leaked, which resulted in a legal fight and made her the subject of controversy.\nAnderson starred as Vallery Irons in the syndicated series \"V.I.P.\" (1998\u20132002) and as Skyler Dayton in the Fox sitcom \"Stacked\" (2005\u20132006). Her film credits include \"Barb Wire\" (1996), \"Scary Movie 3\" (2003), \"Borat\" (2006), \"Baywatch\" (2017), and \"City Hunter\" (2018). She appeared in her own reality series \"\" in 2008 and has partaken in numerous television shows from around the world, including \"Dancing with the Stars\" (2010, 2012), \"Bailando\" (2011), \"VIP Brother\" (2012), \"Dancing on Ice\" (2013), and \"Danse avec les stars\" (2018). In 2022, she made her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in the musical \"Chicago\", and in 2023 collaborated with Netflix on \"Pamela, a Love Story\", a documentary about her life. For starring in the independent drama film \"The Last Showgirl\" (2024), she received nominations for the Golden Globe Award and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. She then starred in the comedy film \"The Naked Gun\" (2025).\nAnderson has publicly supported many charitable matters, particularly animal rights, and has endorsed PETA activities. She has released three autobiographies and four novels and has taken part in activism in regard to various causes.\nEarly life and education.\nAnderson was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of Barry W. Anderson, a furnace repairman, and Carol (n\u00e9e\u00a0Cawthorpe), a waitress. Her great-grandfather, , was a Finnish native of , and left the Grand Duchy of Finland (which was an autonomous state within the Russian Empire at the time) for Canada in 1908. He changed his name to Anderson when he arrived as an immigrant. Anderson also has Volga German ancestry on her mother's side; her grandmother, Rose Friesen, ethnically German, was born in Russia in a Mennonite village and immigrated to Canada in 1901. Anderson received press coverage right after her birth as a \"Centennial Baby\", having been born on July 1, 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canada's official founding via the \"Constitution Act, 1867\". She has a younger brother, Gerry (born 1971), an actor and producer who worked in some of her films and television shows.\nWhen she was in grade 8, Anderson was a \"scat soloist\" for her middle school jazz band, where she played the saxophone. Decades later, she would draw on this talent for a solo in \"The Naked Gun\". Anderson attended Highland Secondary School in Comox, British Columbia. In high school, she played on the volleyball team, and graduated in 1985. \nIn 2014, Anderson discussed suffering sexual abuse as a child. She mentioned being molested by a female babysitter from ages 6 to 10, raped by a 25-year-old man when she was age 12, and gang-raped by her boyfriend and six of his friends when she was 14.\nCareer.\nModelling career.\nIn 1988, Anderson moved to Vancouver and worked as a fitness instructor. The next year, she attended a BC Lions Canadian Football League game at the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, where she was featured on the jumbotron while wearing a Labatt's Beer T-shirt. The brewing company hired Anderson briefly as a spokesmodel. Inspired by the event, her then-boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced a poster of her image, entitled the \"Blue Zone Girl\".\nAnderson was flown to Los Angeles for a photo shoot; she appeared as the cover girl on \"Playboy\" magazine's October 1989 issue. She subsequently moved to the United States, settling in LA to further pursue a modelling career. \"Playboy\" subsequently chose her as Playmate of the Month in their February 1990 issue, in which she appeared in the centrefold portrait. Anderson then elected to have breast implant surgery, increasing her bust size to 34D. She increased her bust size again, to 34DD, several years later. Her \"Playboy\" career spans 22 years, and she has appeared on more \"Playboy\" covers than any other model. She has also made numerous appearances in the publication's newsstand specials. Anderson wrote the foreword to the \"Playboy\" coffee table book \"Playboy's Greatest Covers\".\nEntertainment career.\nAfter Anderson moved to Los Angeles, she won a minor role as Lisa, the original \"Tool Time Girl\", on the ABC comedy series \"Home Improvement\". Her breakthrough role was as C.J. Parker on \"Baywatch\", which she played for five seasons between 1992 and 1997, making her one of the longest-serving cast members. The series has gained her popularity from international viewers and the character of Parker became one of her best-known roles, having been reenacted by multiple high-profile people since. Anderson was paid US$1,500 per episode during the first season. She reprised her role in a reunion movie, \"\" (2003), and also appeared in commercials for DirecTV in 2007. Anderson was still modelling for \"Outdoor Life\" and appearing on the cover of the magazine each year. In 1993, Anderson appeared in a music video \"Can't Have Your Cake\" by Vince Neil to promote his first solo album, \"Exposed\".\nIn 1994, she was cast in her first starring film role, in \"Raw Justice\", also known as \"Good Cop, Bad Cop\", co-starring with Stacy Keach, David Keith, and Robert Hays. Under the alternate title, the film won the Bronze Award at the Worldfest-Charleston in the category for dramatic theatrical films. In 1996, she played Barbara Rose Kopetski in the film \"Barb Wire\". The movie, a thinly veiled futuristic remake of \"Casablanca\", was not a commercial success. During filming, she had barbed wire tattooed on her left upper arm instead of having it painted on by make-up artists every day, but she had it removed in 2016. In April 1997, she guest-hosted \"Saturday Night Live\". She appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of \"Playboy\". In September 1998, Anderson starred as Vallery Irons in the Sony Pictures Television syndicated action/comedy-drama series \"V.I.P.\" created by J. F. Lawton. The series had a successful four-year run. In 1999, she appeared as a man-eating giantess in the music video for \"Miserable\" by California alternative rock band Lit. She appeared on \"The Nanny\" as Fran Fine's rival, Heather Biblow.\nSam Newman House, a pop architecture building constructed in 2001 in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, has a large image of Anderson's face. Sam Newman commissioned local architect Cassandra Fahey to design the building, and used the image with Anderson's permission. Permits were issued retroactively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards. Later that year, Anderson played herself in the Miller Lite TV commercial \"Pillow Fight\", the sequel to the brand's earlier commercial \"Catfight\", with models Tanya Ballinger and Kitana Baker reprising their roles.\nIn May 2004, Anderson appeared nude on the cover of \"Playboy\" magazine. Later, she posed naked for \"Stuff\" and \"GQ\" magazines. Anderson was also featured on the cover of the fashion magazines \"W\", British \"Marie Claire\", \"Flare\", and \"Elle\" Canada and in editorials for Russian \"Elle\" and \"V\".\nIn 2004, she released the book \"Star\", co-written by Eric Shaw Quinn, about a teenager trying to become famous. After this, she began touring the United States, signing autographs for fans nationwide. That year she launched her vegan clothing line The Pamela Anderson Collection. Her second book, \"Star Struck\", released in 2005, is a thinly veiled look at her life with Tommy Lee and the trials of celebrity life. In 2005, Anderson starred in a new Fox comedy series \"Stacked\" as Skyler Dayton, a party girl who works at a book store. It was cancelled on May 18, 2006, after two seasons. On August 14, 2005, Comedy Central aired the \"Roast of Pamela Anderson\". Anderson was named most powerful Canadian in Hollywood in 2005.\nIn December 2005, NBC cut a video of Anderson pole dancing to Elton John's \"The Red Piano\", saying that the footage was inappropriate for prime time. The video was shown on huge screens during the event, while John played \"The Bitch is Back\". In March 2006, it was announced that Anderson would receive a star on Canada's Walk of Fame due to her many years as a model and actress, only the second model to receive a star. In April 2006, Anderson hosted Canada's Juno Awards, becoming the first non-singer and model to do so.\nAnderson appeared in the 2006 mockumentary \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\", in which the title character becomes obsessed with her and plans to abduct and marry her. She appears as herself at a book-signing at the end of the film, confronted by Borat in a staged botched abduction.\nAnderson performed on February 13\u201314, 2008, in a Valentine's Day strip-tease act at the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris. Anderson then starred in the reality series \".\"\nIn December 2009, Anderson guest-starred as \"Genie of the Lamp\" in the pantomime \"Aladdin\" at the New Wimbledon Theatre in Wimbledon, in southwest London. Anderson took over the role from comedian Ruby Wax, with former \"EastEnders\" actress Anita Dobson and comedian Paul O'Grady also booked for the role.\nIn 2010, she appeared in the short film \"The Commuter\" directed by the McHenry Brothers and shot entirely on the Nokia N8 smartphone as promotion for the phone in the UK.

A few months later in 2023, Netflix released a documentary directed by Ryan White on her life from childhood to the 2022 appearance in \"Chicago\", called \"Pamela, a Love Story.\" It was also produced by her son Brandon Thomas Lee, who received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination as a producer in the 2023 Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special category for his work on the film. Its release coincided with Anderson's autobiography, \"Love, Pamela\", which debuted at number two on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list within its first week of release.\nAfter watching \"Pamela, a Love Story\", Gia Coppola wanted to cast Anderson as Shelly in the 2024 drama film \"The Last Showgirl.\" She sent the script to Anderson's then-agent who turned it down within the hour without letting Anderson know about it. Coppola then reached out to Anderson's son Brandon through mutual friends, who passed it along to his mother. While Anderson had given up on acting by this point, she accepted the role. She was officially cast in February 2024, starring alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, Dave Bautista, Brenda Song, Kiernan Shipka and Billie Lourd. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2024, with Anderson calling it \"the role I have been waiting for my entire career\". Caryn James of the BBC called Anderson \"a revelation\" and wrote: \"The low-key devastation Anderson has captured is the real acting triumph.\" David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said Anderson's \"transformative performance is undeniably affecting, offering illuminating insights into both the character and the actress playing her, who has had to struggle to be taken seriously. This role should mark a turning point on that front.\" Anderson received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama for her performance in the film, marking her first Golden Globe Award nomination and the first major industry acting nomination in her career. She was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.\nAnderson appeared in the November 12, 2024 episode of the \"Criterion Closet\", where she discussed her lifelong interest in cinema.

In 2025, Anderson appeared in the Williamstown Theatre Festival's production of \"Camino Real\" (Tennessee Williams), and is slated to appear in Karim A\u00efnouz's \"Rosebush Pruning\".\nIn the early 1990s, Anderson was offered the role of Tanya Peters in the 1994 film, \",\" but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts (the role eventually went to Anna Nicole Smith). Over thirty years later, Anderson co-starred in the 2025 legacy sequel, \"The Naked Gun\" (Beth Davenport) with Liam Neeson (Lt. Frank Drebin Jr.)\n\"Pamela's Cooking with Love\" (Anderson's plant-based cooking show) was greenlit in February 2023, and debuted on Canada's Flavour Network in February 2025. In addition, Anderson's 2024 plant-based cookbook \"I Love You: Recipes From the Heart,\" was nominated for a 2025 . The work of her photographer, Ditte Isager, was recognized in the \"Media: Visuals\" category. Actress and talk show host Drew Barrymore has noted that \"literally as a cookbook collector\" she finds \"I Love You: Recipes From the Heart\" to be \"the most beautiful cookbook I've ever seen - it is stunning.\"\nVegNews describes \"I Love You: Recipes From the Heart\" as one of \"The Best Vegan Cookbooks of 2024,\" Chowhound calls it one of the \"15 Best Vegetarian Cookbooks Of 2024,\" and SHE Media lists Anderson as one of \"22 Celebrity Moms Whose Cookbooks Will Solve Your Dinner\u00a0Problems.\" During her interview with Anderson for Elle, Martha Stewart stated that \"I Love You: Recipes From the Heart\" is \"very nicely done,\" and that Anderson drew from French cuisine \"in the most simple, beautiful way.\" She also told Anderson that her Pierogi recipe \"came out beautifully.\" In addition, after testing a salad recipe in the book, Jessica Wrubel states in \"Parade\" magazine that she is \"completely smitten with \"I Love You\" as a whole. Pamela's journey into this softer, more personal territory\u2014whether through her recipes or her stories\u2014makes the book feel like an extension of her heart. If you've ever doubted the staying power of Pamela Anderson's influence, let this cookbook\u2014and this salad\u2014prove you wrong.\"\nActivism.\nAnimal rights.\nAnderson became a vegetarian in her early teens after her father went hunting and brought home a \"bloodied deer.\" She eventually transitioned to a vegan diet in her twenties, and promotes the benefits of a plant-based diet. She served as an executive producer for the 2018 plant-based documentary, \"The Game Changers\", along with James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jackie Chan. Anderson advocates for animal rights, and is an active member of the animal protection organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).\nShe became the center of controversy when she posed for a PETA ad wearing a bikini with sections drawn on her body dividing it into ribs, rump, shoulder, etc., like a diagram of meat cuts; the ad's tagline was \"All Animals Have the Same Parts\". The ad was banned in Montreal, Quebec on grounds that it was sexist. Anderson retorted, \"In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with burqas \u2013 is that next? I didn't think that Canada would be so puritanical.\"\nShe became a company spokesperson for FrogAds, Inc. in March 2012, a company that used her as part of a media campaign in a pool operation of which she was unaware. In February 2014, she stripped for a Valentine's Day-themed ad for PETA, urging dog lovers to cuddle up with their pets during winter.\nOn July 8, 2015, Anderson wrote to Vladimir Putin to save whales. On December 15, 2015, Anderson, representing the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), met with top Kremlin officials regarding animals rights in Russia. On December 15, 2016, Anderson and IFAW officials met with Kremlin officials to discuss animal welfare and conservation.\nIn December 2015, Anderson, a close friend of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society founder Paul Watson and a long-time supporter and advisory board member, became a full board member in order to further its efforts in opposing the hunting of whales.\nAnti-pornography.\nAnderson has been critical of pornography. In 2016, she co-authored a viral opinion article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" with Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach, in which they called online pornography a \"public hazard of unprecedented seriousness.\" The two called for a \"sensual revolution\" to replace \"pornography with eroticism, the alloying of sex with love, of physicality with personality, of the body's mechanics with imagination, of orgasmic release with binding relationships.\" They later gave a joint lecture at Oxford University to over 1,000 people. Boteach observed: \"It can be intimidating to talk about pornography and eroticism alongside an international sex symbol, but I think Pamela has handled it extremely well.\" The two also wrote a book together, \"Lust for Love\" (2018), about how meaningful, passionate sex has been declining, and called for a new sensual revolution that emphasizes partners connecting in the bedroom. However, in a 2008 interview with \"The Guardian\", Anderson said that because she is aware of her Finnish ancestry, she considered moving to Finland and opening a strip club called \"Lapland\".\nJulian Assange.\nIn December 2016, in a statement to \"People\" magazine, Anderson called WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a \"hero\". She stated that he had done everyone \"a great service\" and that \"[e]veryone in the world has benefited because of WikiLeaks,\" while decrying how \"elaborate plots against him and made up sexual allegations could result in him being extradited to the US \u2013 where he would not be treated fairly \u2013 because of his exposure of truths.\" In April 2019, Anderson expressed anger on Twitter at Assange's expulsion from Ecuador's London embassy. In May 2019, Anderson visited Assange in Belmarsh prison with Kristinn Hrafnsson, and said she believed Assange to be innocent, saying, \"He is a good man, he is an incredible person. I love him, I can't imagine what he has been going through.\"\nIn October 2019, Anderson announced she would be travelling to Australia in November 2019 to challenge Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stand up for Assange. In her announcement, she referenced the 'disparaging remarks' he made about her in 2018 and challenged him to debate the matter \"in front of the Australian people.\" She also wrote another letter to Morrison asking him to use his influence to secure Assange's release. Morrison replied with a letter, saying that his government would respect Britain's judicial process and Assange would not receive any special help. In the text of a speech she had intended to give at Parliament House, Canberra, Anderson said that Assange was suffering \"psychological torture\" in jail and that \"every moment he is in there, he is in danger\".\nOn January 18, 2021, Anderson spoke on the Fox News show \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\", asking President Donald Trump to pardon Assange.\nAdditional activism.\nIn March 2005, Anderson became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics's MAC AIDS Fund, which helped people affected by AIDS and HIV. After becoming the official spokesmodel, Anderson raised money during Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, and Athens events. Anderson became the celebrity spokesperson for the American Liver Foundation and served as the Grand Marshal of the SOS motorcycle ride fundraiser.\nIn 2009, Anderson wrote an open letter to President Barack Obama urging the legalization of cannabis.\nIn November 2016, Anderson starred in a video public service announcement produced by the National Limousine Association and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center as part of the Ride Responsibly initiative, titled The Driving Game, which aimed to shed light on the lack of universal driver regulations in the private ground transportation industry.\nAnderson once again starred in a video public service announcement produced by the National Limousine Association in January 2018, this time in partnership with Promoting Awareness | Victim Empowerment (PAVE), as part of the Ride Responsibly initiative. The video titled \"The Signs\" pushes for passenger safety and universal driver regulations in the private ground transportation industry.\nIn the 2019 Canadian federal election, she endorsed the Green Party of Canada.\nAfter supporting the yellow vests movement, Anderson attended a meeting of the European Spring with Yanis Varoufakis and Beno\u00eet Hamon. She appeared as a supporter on election posters of the German DiEM25 campaign in the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament elections.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nAnderson has been married five times. She married her first husband, Tommy Lee, drummer of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, on February 19, 1995, after knowing him for only four days. They married on a beach, with Anderson in a white bikini and Lee in boardshorts. Anderson's mother did not know, and learned of the marriage from \"People\" magazine. During this time, she was known professionally as Pamela Anderson Lee. They have two sons together: Brandon Thomas (born June 5, 1996) and Dylan Jagger (born December 29, 1997). During their tumultuous marriage, Lee was sentenced to six months in the Los Angeles County Jail for spousal abuse after assaulting Anderson. The couple divorced in 1998. A long custody dispute over their sons followed, and was finalized when they were granted joint custody in October 2002.\nIn March\u00a02002, Anderson publicly stated that she had contracted hepatitis C by sharing tattoo needles with Lee, and began writing a regular column for \"Jane\" magazine. In October\u00a02003, Anderson jokingly said on Howard Stern's radio show that she did not expect to live more than 10 or 15\u00a0years, but this was taken seriously by many websites and tabloids. By 2015 Anderson had been cured of hepatitis\u00a0C.\nAfter the divorce, Anderson became engaged to the model Marcus Schenkenberg; they broke up in 2001. She then became engaged to the singer Kid Rock; she broke up with him in 2003. On July 18, 2006, it was announced that she would marry Kid Rock on July 29, 2006, on a yacht near Saint-Tropez, France.\n \"Feels like I've been stuck in a time warp,\" said Anderson in her blog entry. \"Not able to let go of MY family picture ... it's been sad and lonely and frustrating ... I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle. Well my miracle came and went. And came back and back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing.\" \"I'm moving on,\" she declared. \"I feel like I'm finally free ... I'm in love.\"\nThere was extensive unconfirmed media speculation that the marriage was pregnancy-related, based on Anderson's representative's refusal to comment on the question.\nOn November 10, 2006, it was announced that Anderson had miscarried while in Vancouver shooting a new film, \"Blonde and Blonder\". Seventeen days later, on November 27, 2006, Anderson filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences. Some news reports had suggested that Kid Rock's outrage during a screening of \"Borat\", in which Anderson has a cameo role, led to filing for divorce two weeks later.\nIn February\u00a02007, Anderson said that she often had sex with Lee since their divorce. In June 2008, Lee said that they were trying to reconcile.\nIn September\u00a02007, Anderson stated on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" that she was engaged. On September 29, Anderson and Rick Salomon applied for a marriage license in Las Vegas. On October 6, 2007, Anderson married Salomon in a small wedding ceremony at The Mirage, between her two nightly appearances at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Hans Klok's magic show. The couple separated on December 13, and on February 22, 2008, Anderson requested through the courts that the marriage be annulled, citing fraud.\nIn October\u00a02013, Anderson stated on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" that she and Salomon were \"friends with benefits\". In January\u00a02014, she announced that she had remarried Salomon on an unspecified date. Anderson filed for divorce from Salomon in February\u00a02015. The divorce was finalized on April 29, 2015.\nAnderson began dating French footballer Adil Rami in 2017. In late June\u00a02019, Anderson declared on an Instagram post that the relationship with Rami was over. On January 20, 2020 Anderson married Hollywood producer Jon Peters. On February 1, 2020, Anderson announced she and Peters had separated, and later claimed to have never been legally married to Peters. On December 24, 2020, Anderson married Dan Hayhurst, her bodyguard. On January 21, 2022, Anderson announced that she had filed for divorce and split with Hayhurst.\nLegal issues.\nA sex tape of Anderson and Tommy Lee filmed on a houseboat on Lake Mead was stolen from their home in 1995 and was widely distributed on the internet. Anderson sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group, who posted the video on their website ClubLove in November 1997. Anderson was pregnant during the trial and, fearful of the extreme stress causing harm to her pregnancy, dismissed the case. Thereafter, the company began making the tape available to subscribers to its websites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the sites. It was said the Lees entered a confidential agreement over releasing rights to the video, but Pamela said that was not true on her 2023 Netflix documentary \"Pamela, a Love Story\".\nAnother tape, which was made before the Tommy Lee tape, involving Anderson and musician Bret Michaels from Poison, was later announced. Frames of the video first appeared in \"Penthouse\" magazine in March 1998. After Poison's and Michaels' longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, obtained a federal injunction prohibiting the distribution of the explicit sex tape that the couple made, an abridged version of the tape appeared on the internet in 1998.\nThe story of the sex tape was later portrayed in the 2022 miniseries \"Pam &amp; Tommy\". Anderson was repeatedly contacted by the producers and the actress, Lily James, portraying her, to get input and permission, but never answered their calls.\nAnderson revealed that she was not asked if she approved of the series. She stated \"I've got nothing against Lily James. I think that she's a beautiful girl and she was just doing the job. But the idea of the whole thing happening was just really crushing for me.\"\nHomes and residences.\nAnderson became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2004, while retaining her Canadian citizenship. After moving to California in 1989, Anderson felt that it was important to become an American citizen in order to vote and one day petition to bring her parents to the U.S. and care for them when they were older. Anderson purchased a beach home in Malibu, California, for $1.8 million in 2001, and attempted to sell it in 2013 for $7.75 million, but later took it off the market. Since then, she has been renting out her Malibu home for $50,000 per month and moved to the French Riviera, mainly because of her relationship with football player Adil Rami. Anderson previously lived in a mansion in Cassis, in the commune of Marseille, France. In 2019, Anderson said that she had recently moved to Canada, residing on Vancouver Island. Her move to Canada became permanent in 2021, and she later sold the home facing Malibu Lagoon State Beach the same year.\nContributors: Pamela Anderson, Julian Assange, Renata Avila, Katrin Axelsson, Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi, Sally Burch, Noam Chomsky, Patrick Cockburn, Naomi Colvin, The Courage Foundation, Mark Curtis, Daniel Ellsberg, Teresa Forcades i Vila, Charles Glass, Kevin Gosztola, Serge Halimi, Nozomi Hayase, Chris Hedges, Sre\u0107ko Horvat, Caitlin Johnstone, Margaret Kimberley, Geoffroy de Lagasnerie, Lisa Longstaff, Alan MacLeod, Stefania Maurizi, Craig Murray, Fidel Narv\u00e1ez, John C.

Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, is credited with developing movable type in the 1450s. His printing press incorporated various innovative techniques, such as individual metal letter blocks and an oil-based ink, enabling faster and more efficient book production.\nEvolution of printing presses.\nThe Gutenberg Press.\nGutenberg's press set the foundation for subsequent developments in printing technology. It comprised a heavy wooden frame with a screw mechanism, enabling the even application of pressure to inked type and paper. Gutenberg's printing press accelerated the production of books, leading to the spread of knowledge and the democratization of information.\nMechanical and industrial advances.\nIn the following centuries, printing presses underwent significant advancements. In the 18th century, the steam-powered press was introduced, enabling higher print volumes. Subsequently, the Industrial Revolution brought forth the development of cylinder presses, powered by steam or mechanized systems. These presses could print thousands of pages per hour, marking a substantial leap in production capabilities.\nOffset Lithography.\nIn the late 19th century, the introduction of offset lithography revolutionized the printing industry. This technique used a flat metal plate with an image to transfer ink to a rubber blanket, which, in turn, printed the image onto the paper. Offset lithography offered more efficient and cost-effective printing, enabling high-quality reproductions and color printing on a large scale.\nTypes.\nPrinters can include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23037", "revid": "28979433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23037", "title": "Punk rock", "text": "Genre of rock music\nPunk rock (or simply punk) is a subgenre of rock music that emerged in the mid-1970s. Rooted in 1950s rock and roll and 1960s garage rock, punk bands rejected the overproduction and corporate nature of mainstream rock music. Typically producing short, fast-paced songs with rough stripped-down vocals and instrumentation and an anti-establishment theme, artists embrace a DIY ethic with many bands self-producing and distributing recordings through independent labels.\nDuring the early 1970s, the term \"punk rock\" was originally used by some American rock critics to describe mid-1960s garage bands. Subsequent developments such as glam and pub rock in the UK, alongside the Velvet Underground and the New York Dolls from New York have been cited as key influences. By the mid-1970s, the term \"punk rock\" had become associated with several regional underground music scenes, including the MC5 and the Stooges in Detroit; Television, Patti Smith, Suicide, the Dictators, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Ramones in New York City; Rocket from the Tombs, Electric Eels and Dead Boys in Ohio; the Saints and Radio Birdman in Australia; and the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Damned and the Buzzcocks in England. By late 1976, punk had become a major cultural phenomenon in the UK, giving rise to a punk subculture that expressed youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing, such as T-shirts with deliberately offensive graphics, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands, jewelry, bondage clothing and safety pins. \nBy 1977, the influence of punk music and its associated subculture spread worldwide, taking root in a wide range of local scenes. The movement later proliferated into various subgenres during the late 1970s, giving rise to movements such as post-punk, new wave, and art punk. By the early 1980s, punk experienced further diversification with subgenres such as hardcore punk (e.g. Bad Brains, Minor Threat and Black Flag); Oi!, (e.g. Sham 69 and the Exploited); street punk (e.g. GBH, the Partisans, and Chaos UK); and anarcho-punk (e.g. Crass). The movement expanded through several regional scenes in countries such as Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Estonia, Greece, and Yugoslavia, among others, and inspired the development of pop-punk, grunge, riot grrrl and alternative rock.\nFollowing alternative rock's mainstream breakthrough in the 1990s through the success of bands like Nirvana, punk rock saw renewed major-label interest and mainstream appeal exemplified by the rise of Californian bands Green Day, Social Distortion, Rancid, the Offspring, Bad Religion, Blink-182 and NOFX.\nCharacteristics.\nOutlook.\nThe first wave of punk rock was \"aggressively modern\" and differed from what came before. According to Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone, \"In its initial form, a lot of 1960s stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, what happens is that people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll.\" John Holmstrom, founding editor of \"Punk\" magazine, recalls feeling \"punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [acts] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music.\" According to Robert Christgau, punk \"scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of hippie myth.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHippies were rainbow extremists; punks are romantics of black-and-white. Hippies forced warmth; punks cultivate cool. Hippies kidded themselves about free love; punks pretend that s&amp;m is our condition. As symbols of protest, swastikas are no less fatuous than flowers.\n\u2014Robert Christgau in \"\" (1981)\nTechnical accessibility and a do it yourself (DIY) spirit are prized in punk rock. UK pub rock from 1972 to 1975 contributed to the emergence of punk rock by developing a network of small venues, such as pubs, where non-mainstream bands could play. Pub rock also introduced the idea of independent record labels, such as Stiff Records, which put out basic, low-cost records. Pub rock bands organized their own small venue tours and put out small pressings of their records. In the early days of punk rock, this DIY ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands. Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was \"rock and roll by people who didn't have very many skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music\". In December 1976, the English fanzine \"Sideburns\" published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned \"This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band\".\nBritish punk rejected contemporary mainstream rock, the broader culture it represented, and their musical predecessors: \"No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977\", declared the Clash song \"1977\". 1976, when the punk revolution began in Britain, became a musical and a cultural \"Year Zero\". As nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols' slogan \"No Future\"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, \"punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England.\" While \"self-imposed alienation\" was common among \"drunk punks\" and \"gutter punks\", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the \"radical leftist utopianism\" of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer Joe Strummer's outlook, \"Punk rock is meant to be our freedom. We're meant to be able to do what we want to do.\"\nAuthenticity has always been important in the punk subculture\u2014the pejorative term \"poseur\" is applied to those who adopt its stylistic attributes but do not actually share or understand its underlying values and philosophy. Scholar Daniel S. Traber argues that \"attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult\"; as the punk scene matured, he observes, eventually \"everyone got called a poseur\".\nMusical and lyrical elements.\nThe early punk bands emulated the minimal musical arrangements of 1960s garage rock. Typical punk rock instrumentation is stripped down to one or two guitars, bass, drums and vocals. Songs tend to be shorter than those of other rock genres and played at fast tempos. Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock 'n' roll verse-chorus form and time signature. However, later bands often broke from this format. Punk music was not a standalone movement in the 70s and 80s. Major punk communities gather across the globe as punk perseveres among contemporary musicians and listeners today.\nThe vocals are sometimes nasal, and the lyrics often shouted in an \"arrogant snarl\", rather than conventionally sung. Complicated guitar solos were considered self-indulgent, although basic guitar breaks were common. Guitar parts tend to include highly distorted power chords or barre chords, creating a characteristic sound described by Christgau as a \"buzzsaw drone\". Some punk rock bands take a surf rock approach with a lighter, twangier guitar tone. Others, such as Robert Quine, lead guitarist of the Voidoids, have employed a wild, \"gonzo\" attack, a style that stretches back through the Velvet Underground to the 1950s recordings of Ike Turner. Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated; the quintessential approach is a relentless, repetitive \"forced rhythm\", although some punk rock bass players emphasize more technical bass lines. Bassists often use a pick with fingerpicking being less common. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up. Compared to other forms of rock, syncopation is much less common. Hardcore punk drumming displays a faster tempo. Production tends to be minimalistic, with tracks sometimes laid down on home tape recorders or four-track portastudios.\nPunk rock lyrics are typically blunt and confrontational; compared to the lyrics of other popular music genres, they often focus on social and political issues. Trend-setting songs such as the Clash's \"Career Opportunities\" and Chelsea's \"Right to Work\" deal with unemployment and the grim realities of urban life. Especially in early British punk, a central goal was to outrage and shock the mainstream. The Sex Pistols' \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" and \"God Save the Queen\" openly disparaged the British political system and social mores. Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in \"Love Comes in Spurts\", recorded by the Voidoids. Anomie, variously expressed in the poetic terms of Richard Hell's \"Blank Generation\" and the bluntness of the Ramones' \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", is a common theme. The controversial content of punk lyrics has frequently led to certain punk records being banned by radio stations and refused shelf space in major chain stores. Christgau said that \"Punk is so tied up with the disillusions of growing up that punks do often age poorly.\"\nVisual and other elements.\nThe classic punk rock look among male American musicians harkens back to the T-shirt, motorcycle jacket, and jeans ensemble favored by American greasers of the 1950s associated with the rockabilly scene and by British rockers of the 1960s. In addition to the T-shirt, and leather jackets they wore ripped jeans and boots, typically Doc Martens. The punk look was inspired to shock people. Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look\u2014and reputed invention of the safety-pin aesthetic\u2014was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario Malcolm McLaren and, in turn, British punk style. (John D Morton of Cleveland's Electric Eels may have been the first rock musician to wear a safety-pin-covered jacket). McLaren's partner, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, credits Johnny Rotten as the first British punk musician to rip his shirt, and Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious as the first to use safety pins, although few of those following punk could afford to buy McLaren and Westwood's designs so famously worn by the Pistols, so they made their own, diversifying the 'look' with various different styles based on these designs.\nYoung women in punk demolished the typical female types in rock of either \"coy sex kittens or wronged blues belters\" in their fashion. Early female punk musicians displayed styles ranging from Siouxsie Sioux's bondage gear to Patti Smith's \"straight-from-the-gutter androgyny\". The former proved much more influential on female fan styles. Over time, tattoos, piercings, and metal-studded and -spiked accessories became increasingly common elements of punk fashion among both musicians and fans, a \"style of adornment calculated to disturb and outrage\". Among the other facets of the punk rock scene, a punk's hair is an important way of showing their freedom of expression. The typical male punk haircut was originally short and choppy; the mohawk later emerged as a characteristic style. Along with the mohawk, long spikes have been associated with the punk rock genre.\nEtymology.\nBetween the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute; William Shakespeare used it with that meaning in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" (1602) and \"Measure for Measure\" (1603\u20134). The term eventually came to describe \"a young male hustler, a gangster, a hoodlum, or a ruffian\".\nThe first known use of the phrase \"punk rock\" appeared in the \"Chicago Tribune\" on March 22, 1970, when Ed Sanders, co-founder of New York's anarcho-prankster band the Fugs described his first solo album as \"punk rock \u2013 redneck sentimentality\". In 1969 Sanders recorded a song for an album called \"Street Punk\" but it was only released in 2008. In the December 1970 issue of Creem, Lester Bangs, mocking more mainstream rock musicians, ironically referred to Iggy Pop as \"that Stooge punk\". Suicide's Alan Vega credits this usage with inspiring his duo to bill its gigs as \"punk music\" or a \"punk mass\" for the next couple of years.\nIn the March 1971 issue of Creem, critic Greg Shaw wrote about the Shadows of Knight's \"hard-edge punk sound\". In an April 1971 issue of \"Rolling Stone\", he referred to a track by the Guess Who as \"good, not too imaginative, punk rock and roll\". The same month John Medelsohn described Alice Cooper's album \"Love It to Death\" as \"nicely wrought mainstream punk raunch\". Dave Marsh used the term in the May 1971 issue of \"Creem\", where he described ? and the Mysterians as giving a \"landmark exposition of punk rock\". Later in 1971, in his fanzine \"Who Put the Bomp\", Greg Shaw wrote about \"what I have chosen to call \"punkrock\" bands\u2014white teenage hard rock of '64\u201366 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)\". Lester Bangs used the term \"punk rock\" in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts.\nIn the liner notes of the 1972 anthology LP \"\", musician and rock journalist Lenny Kaye, later a member of the Patti Smith Group, used the term \"punk rock\" to describe the genre of 1960s garage bands, while the earliest known use of the term \"garage punk\" appeared in Kaye's track-by-track liner notes to describe a song by the 1960s garage rock band the Shadows of Knight, which he labelled \"classic garage punk\". Nick Kent referred to Iggy Pop as the \"Punk Messiah of the Teenage Wasteland\" in his review of the Stooges July 1972 performance at King's Cross Cinema in London for a British magazine called \"Cream\" (no relation to the more famous US publication). In the January 1973 \"Rolling Stone\" review of \"Nuggets\", Greg Shaw commented \"Punk rock is a fascinating genre... Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the '60s to the original rockabilly spirit of Rock 'n Roll.\" In February 1973, Terry Atkinson of the \"Los Angeles Times\", reviewing the debut album by a hard rock band, Aerosmith, declared that it \"achieves all that punk-rock bands strive for but most miss.\" A March 1973 review of an Iggy and the Stooges show in the \"Detroit Free Press\" dismissively referred to Pop as \"the apotheosis of Detroit punk music\". In May 1973, Billy Altman launched the short-lived \"punk magazine\" in Buffalo, New York, which was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts.&lt;ref name=\"Laing (punk/Altman)\"&gt; \u2013 Laing mentions original \"punk\" magazine. He indicates that much \"punk\" fanfare in the early 70s was in relation to mid-60s garage rock and artists perceived as following in that tradition.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn May 1974, \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Robert Hilburn reviewed the second New York Dolls album, \"Too Much Too Soon\". \"I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing,\" he wrote, describing the album as \"perhaps the best example of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since the Rolling Stones' \"Exile on Main Street\".\" In a 1974 interview for his fanzine \"Heavy Metal Digest\", Danny Sugerman told Iggy Pop \"You went on record as saying you never were a punk\" and Iggy replied \"...well I ain't. I never was a punk.\"\nBy 1975, \"punk\" was being used to describe acts as diverse as the Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement \"Street rock\"; John Holmstrom credits \"Aquarian\" magazine with using \"punk\" \"to describe what was going on at CBGBs\". Holmstrom, Legs McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine \"Punk\", which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term. \"It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular\", Holmstrom later remarked. \"We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it. We wanted to get rid of the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. We wanted the fun and liveliness back.\"\n1960s\u20131973: Precursors.\nGarage rock and beat.\nThe early to mid-1960s garage rock bands in the United States and elsewhere are often recognized as punk rock's progenitors. The Kingsmen's \"Louie, Louie\" is often cited as punk rock's defining \"ur-text\". After the success of the British Invasion, the garage phenomenon gathered momentum around the US. By 1965, the harder-edged sound of British acts, such as the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, and the Who, became increasingly influential with American garage bands. The raw sound of U.S. groups such as the Sonics and the Seeds predicted the style of later acts. In the early 1970s some rock critics used the term \"punk rock\" to refer to the mid-1960s garage genre, as well as for subsequent acts perceived to be in that stylistic tradition, such as the Stooges. \nIn Britain, largely under the influence of the mod movement and beat groups, the Kinks' 1964 hit singles \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\", were both influenced by \"Louie, Louie\". In 1965, the Who released the mod anthem \"My Generation\", which according to John Reed, anticipated the kind of \"cerebral mix of musical ferocity and rebellious posture\" that would characterize much of the later British punk rock of the 1970s. The garage/beat phenomenon extended beyond North America and Britain. In Peru, founded in 1964, the group Los Saicos, used fast tempos, aggressive riffing, and screamed vocals along with souped-up tracks about prison escapes, funerals and destruction which later led publications to retrospectively credit them with pioneering punk rock. In Germany, the Monks, a band consisting of several stationed American G.I.'s, infused beat music with that of raucous garage rock, releasing their sole album, \"Black Monk Time\", in March 1966, which was later retroactively described as a precursor to punk rock.\nIn America, the psychedelic rock movement birthed an array of garage bands that would later become influences on punk, which included a multitude of influential regional hits, by garage-psych bands like the Seeds, Music Machine, Blues Magoos, Electric Prunes and Count Five, later featured prominently on the 1972 garage rock compilation album, , whose liner notes contained one of the earliest known uses of the term \"punk rock\". Additionally, the Austin Chronicle described the 13th Floor Elevators as a band who can lay claim to influencing the movement, stating \"the seeds of punk remain blatant in the howling ultimatum Erickson transferred from his previous teen combo to the Elevators\".\nProto-punk.\nDetroit.\nThe MC5 (also known as the \"Motor City Five\") formed in Lincoln Park, Michigan in 1963, the group began as an R&amp;B and garage rock band, later releasing the single \"Borderline\" backed with \"Looking at You\" in 1968 on A-Square records, without the knowledge of that label's owner Jeep Holland, the single sold out thousands of copies. Guitarist Wayne Kramer's style was retrospectively described by \"The Guardian\" as showcasing \"an edge of atonality and barely controlled chaos.\" Similarly, the Up, formed in Michigan in 1967 were another Detroit band closely associated with the MC5 and early Detroit punk scene, they've been described as an \"important step in the evolution of punk rock\". In February 1969, the MC5 released their influential debut album, \"Kick Out the Jams\", which was later considered an influential and important forerunner to punk rock music.\nIn August 1969, the Stooges, from Ann Arbor, premiered with a self-titled album, produced by John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground. The album was later followed by the release of further influential records; \"Fun House\" and \"Raw Power\", both of which helped establish a \"blueprint for punk rock\". Stooges' vocalist Iggy Pop would go on to be described as \"the Godfather of Punk\" due to his on-stage antics and confrontational attitude. The influence of the Stooges also inspired other early Michigan punk bands such as the Dogs and the Punks. In 1973, Destroy All Monsters formed, featuring Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton and MC5 bassist Michael Davis. Followed by, early punk supergroup, the Sonic's Rendezvous Band which was formed by guitarist Fred \"Sonic\" Smith, formerly of the MC5, Gary Rasmussen, formerly of the Up on bass and Scott Asheton, formerly of the Stooges on drums. Additionally, Detroit band Death formed in 1974, by three African American brothers, recorded \"scorching blasts of feral ur-punk\". However, due to their name could not secure a record deal, they released the single \"Politicians in My Eyes\" backed with \"Keep On Knockin\" in 1976 and promptly disbanded, only to be rediscovered decades later.\nAround the world.\nBands anticipating the forthcoming punk movement were appearing as far afield as West Germany, where bands like Can, Faust, and Neu! emerged from the burgeoning krautrock scene. The latter's album \"Neu! '75\", which featured songs like \"Hero\" and \"After Eight\", was influential to Johnny Rotten, Iggy Pop, and David Bowie. In Japan, the anti-establishment Zun\u014d Keisatsu (Brain Police) mixed garage-psych and folk. The combo regularly faced censorship challenges, their live act at least once included onstage masturbation. In New York City's Lower East Side, the Fugs formed in 1963 and became an influential early proto-punk band that bridged the beat generation with rock and roll. They were followed by the Velvet Underground and hippie proto-punk David Peel, who was the first person to use the word \"motherfucker\" in a song title, and later influenced the Clash, and became closely aligned with the far-left Yippie movement. In Boston, the Modern Lovers formed in 1970, led by Jonathan Richman, gained attention for their garage rock sound which anticipated punk, with their self-titled album which was produced by John Cale. In Canada, early noise music group Nihilist Spasm Band formed in 1965 in London, Ontario, alongside Simply Saucer, who formed in 1973 in Hamilton, Ontario, the latter of which drew influences from the Stooges and the Velvet Underground, to form an early punk style.\n1974\u20131976: First wave.\nNorth America.\nNew York City.\nThe origins of New York's punk rock scene can be traced back to such sources as the late 1960s trash culture and an early 1970s underground rock movement centered on the Mercer Arts Center in Greenwich Village, where the New York Dolls performed, their updated form of 1950s' rock 'n' roll later became known as glam punk. The influential New York duo Suicide who formed in 1970 are credited with being one of the earliest artists to describe their music as \"punk\". While the Dictators, formed in 1972, became another early key band in the scene. In early 1974, a new scene began to develop around the CBGB club, also in Lower Manhattan. At its core was Television, described by critic John Walker as \"the ultimate garage band with pretensions\". Their influences ranged from The Velvet Underground to the staccato guitar work of Dr. Feelgood's Wilko Johnson. The band's bassist/singer, Richard Hell, created a look with cropped, ragged hair, ripped T-shirts, and black leather jackets credited as the basis for punk rock visual style. In April 1974, Patti Smith came to CBGB for the first time to see the band perform. A veteran of independent theater and performance poetry, Smith was developing an intellectual, feminist take on rock 'n' roll. On June 5, she recorded the single \"Hey Joe\"/\"Piss Factory\", featuring Television guitarist Tom Verlaine; released on her own Mer Records label, it heralded the scene's DIY ethic and has often been cited as the first punk rock record. By August, Smith and Television were gigging together at Max's Kansas City.\nIn Forest Hills, Queens, the Ramones drew on sources ranging from the Stooges to the Beatles and the Beach Boys to Herman's Hermits and 1960s girl groups, and condensed rock 'n' roll to its primal level: \"'1\u20132\u20133\u20134!' bass-player Dee Dee Ramone shouted at the start of every song as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm.\" The band played its first show at CBGB in August 1974. By the end of the year, the Ramones had performed seventy-four shows, each about seventeen minutes long. \"When I first saw the Ramones\", critic Mary Harron later remembered, \"I couldn't believe people were doing this. The dumb brattiness.\"\nThat spring, Smith and Television shared a two-month-long weekend residency at CBGB that significantly raised the club's profile. The Television sets included Richard Hell's \"Blank Generation\", which became the scene's emblematic anthem. Soon after, Hell left Television and founded a band featuring a more stripped-down sound, the Heartbreakers, with former New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan. In August, Television recorded a single, \"Little Johnny Jewel\". In the words of John Walker, the record was \"a turning point for the whole New York scene\" if not quite for the punk rock sound itself \u2013 Hell's departure had left the band \"significantly reduced in fringe aggression\".\nEarly in 1976, Hell left the Heartbreakers to form the Voidoids, described as \"one of the most harshly uncompromising [punk] bands\". That April, the Ramones' debut album was released by Sire Records; the first single was \"Blitzkrieg Bop\", opening with the rallying cry \"Hey! Ho! Let's go!\" According to a later description, \"Like all cultural watersheds, \"Ramones\" was embraced by a discerning few and slagged off as a bad joke by the uncomprehending majority.\" The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California, and Akron, Ohio, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City and CBGB.\nAt this early stage, the term \"punk\" applied to the scene in general, not necessarily a particular stylistic approach as it would later\u2014the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach \u2013 the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other \u2013 there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.\nCleveland.\nDuring the early 1970s, the influential Ohio punk scene emerged alongside the initial New York punk rock scene in Cleveland, Ohio, which included bands like Mirrors, Electric Eels, the Styrenes and Rocket from the Tombs. Bands in the scene drew influences from the Stooges, the Velvet Underground, MC5, Captain Beefheart, and free jazz as much as traditional rock and roll. The scene began in 1974 with the proliferation of live shows which were dubbed \"Extermination Night\". Rocket from the Tombs later disbanded and led to the formation of Pere Ubu, with guitarist Cheetah Chrome later joining Ohio band the Dead Boys, with both bands relocating to New York City. Electric Eels drummer, Nick Knox, went on to join the Cramps, while guitarist, John D Morton allegedly was the first punk rock musician known to wear a jacket held together by safety pins. Cleveland bands like Pere Ubu, positioned themselves in opposition to the early New York punk scene. However, guitarist Peter Laughner admired the early NYC scene, routinely hanging around prominent CBGB figures like Patti Smith, Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine during the early 1970s. Laughner had also reportedly auditioned to replace Richard Hell in Television and was responsible for organizing the band's first gig outside NYC, which was played at Cleveland's Piccadilly Inn on July 24\u201325, 1975 and supported by Laughner's group Rocket from the Tombs.\nAdditionally, early Ohio punk band Devo would form spearheading the Akron Sound movement, with the Cramps briefly relocating to Akron, Ohio before settling in the early New York punk scene.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAfter a brief period unofficially managing the New York Dolls, Briton Malcolm McLaren returned to London in May 1975, inspired by the new scene he had witnessed at CBGB. The King's Road clothing store he co-owned, recently renamed Sex, was building a reputation with its outrageous \"anti-fashion\". Among those who frequented the shop were members of a band called the Strand, which McLaren had also been managing. In August, the group was seeking a new lead singer. Another Sex habitu\u00e9, Johnny Rotten, auditioned for and won the job. Adopting a new name, the group played its first gig as the Sex Pistols on November 6, 1975, at Saint Martin's School of Art, and soon attracted a small but dedicated following. In February 1976, the band received its first significant press coverage; guitarist Steve Jones declared that the Sex Pistols were not so much into music as they were \"chaos\". The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, \"Bet you don't hate us as much as we hate you!\" McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, \"hard and tough\". As described by critic Jon Savage, the band members \"embodied an attitude into which McLaren fed a new set of references: late-sixties radical politics, sexual fetish material, pop history, [...] youth sociology\". \nBernard Rhodes, an associate of McLaren, similarly aimed to make stars of the band London SS, who became the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer. On June 4 and July 20 1976, the Sex Pistols performed at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in what became one of the most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately thirty to forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who had formed the Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and the Smiths, the gig would also inspire the formation of influential independent record labels, Factory and Creation Records. In July, the Ramones played two London shows that helped spark the nascent UK punk scene. Over the next several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often directly inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were near the center of the scene\u2014among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees, X-Ray Spex, and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors, while Sex store frontwoman Jordan not only managed Adam and the Ants but also performed screaming vocals on their song \"Lou\". Other groups included Subway Sect, Alternative TV, Wire, the Stranglers, Eater and Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20\u201321, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the Sex Pistols, Clash, Damned, and Buzzcocks, as well as Paris's female-lead Stinky Toys. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested for having thrown a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident reinforced punk's reputation as a social menace.\nSome new bands, such as London's Ultravox!, Edinburgh's Rezillos, Manchester's the Fall, and Leamington's the Shapes, identified with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock\u2013style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers Eddie and the Hot Rods, the Stranglers, and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related artists and bands such as David Bowie, Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. However, Sex Pistols frontman Johnny Rotten (real name John Lydon) insisted that the influences of the UK punk scene were not from the US and NY. \"I've heard an awful lot of American journalists pretending that the whole punk influence came out of New York.\" He argued: \"T. Rex, David Bowie, Slade, Mott The Hoople, the Alex Harvey Band \u2014 their influence was enormous. And they try to write that all off and wrap it around Patti Smith. It's so wrong!\".\nIn October 1976, the Damned released the first UK punk rock band single, \"New Rose\". The Vibrators followed the next month with \"We Vibrate\". On November 26, 1976, the Sex Pistols' released their debut single \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", which succeeded in its goal of becoming a \"national scandal\". Jamie Reid's \"anarchy flag\" poster and his other design work for the Sex Pistols helped establish a distinctive punk visual aesthetic.\nOn December 1, 1976, an incident took place that sealed punk rock's notorious reputation, when the Sex Pistols and several members of the Bromley Contingent, including Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin, filled a vacancy for Queen on the early evening Thames Television London television show \"Today\" to be interviewed by host Bill Grundy. When Grundy asked Siouxsie how she was doing, she made fun of him saying, \"I've always wanted to meet you, Bill\". Grundy, who was drunk, told her on the air; \"we shall meet afterwards then\". This instantly generated a reaction from Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones who pronounced a series of terms inappropriate for prime-time television. Jones proceeded to call Grundy a \"dirty bastard\", a \"dirty fucker\", and a \"fucking rotter\", triggering a media controversy. The episode had a major impact on the history of the scene and the punk term became a household name in 24 hours thanks to the press coverage, and several front covers of newspapers.\nTwo days later, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Damned, and the Heartbreakers set out on the Anarchy Tour, a series of gigs throughout the UK. Many of the shows were cancelled by venue owners in response to the media outrage following the Grundy interview.\nAustralia.\nA punk subculture began in Australia around the same time, centered around Radio Birdman and the Oxford Tavern in Sydney's Darlinghurst suburb. By 1976, the Saints were hiring Brisbane local halls to use as venues, or playing in \"Club 76\", their shared house in the inner suburb of Petrie Terrace. Inspired mainly by the Stooges and MC5, they drew influences from Australian garage rock band the Missing Links, and evoked the live sound of the British Pretty Things, who had toured Australia and New Zealand in 1975.\nThe Saints soon discovered that musicians were exploring similar paths in other parts of the world. Ed Kuepper, co-founder of the Saints, later recalled:\nOne thing I remember having had a really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it [in 1976], I mean it was a great record [...] but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used [...] and I thought, \"Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones\", when nothing could have been further from the truth.\nIn Perth, the Cheap Nasties formed in August. In September 1976, the Saints became the first punk rock band outside the U.S. to release a recording, the single \"(I'm) Stranded\". The band self-financed, packaged, and distributed the single. \"(I'm) Stranded\" had limited impact at home, but the British music press recognized it as groundbreaking.\n1977\u20131978: Peak of the first wave.\nA second wave of punk rock emerged in 1977. These bands often sounded very different from each other. While punk remained largely an underground phenomenon in the US, in the UK it had become a major sensation. During this period punk music also spread beyond the English speaking world, inspiring local scenes in other countries.\nNorth America.\nBy 1977, downtown New York bands such as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and James Chance and the Contortions led what would later become known as no wave. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movie\u2013inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977. Subsequently, the Californian punk scene would later emerge, primarily centered in Los Angeles with bands such as the Weirdos, The Dils, the Zeros, the Bags, Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the Germs, Fear, The Go-Go's, X, the Dickies, and the relocated Tupperwares, now dubbed the Screamers. San Francisco's punk scene included the Avengers, The Nuns, Negative Trend, the Mutants, and the Sleepers.\nThe Dead Boys' debut LP, \"Young, Loud and Snotty\", was released at the end of August. October saw two more debut albums from the scene: Richard Hell and the Voidoids' first full-length, \"Blank Generation\", and the Heartbreakers' \"L.A.M.F.\" One track on the latter exemplified both the scene's close-knit character and the popularity of heroin within it: \"Chinese Rocks\" \u2014 the title refers to a strong form of the drug \u2013 was written by Dee Dee Ramone and Hell, both users, as were the Heartbreakers' Thunders and Nolan. (During the Heartbreakers' 1976 and 1977 tours of Britain, Thunders played a central role in popularizing heroin among the punk crowd there, as well.) The Ramones' third album, \"Rocket to Russia\", appeared in November 1977.\nIn December 1977, Black Flag performed for the first time in a garage in Redondo Beach, though they initially formed in Hermosa Beach in 1976 under the name Panic. They later became influential in the development of hardcore punk.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Sex Pistols' live TV skirmish with Bill Grundy on December 1, 1976, was the signal moment in British punk's transformation into a major media phenomenon, even as some stores refused to stock the records and radio airplay was hard to come by. Press coverage of punk misbehavior grew intense: On January 4, 1977, \"The Evening News\" of London ran a front-page story on how the Sex Pistols \"vomited and spat their way to an Amsterdam flight\". In February 1977, the first album by a British punk band appeared: \"Damned Damned Damned\" (by the Damned) reached number thirty-six on the UK chart. The EP \"Spiral Scratch\", self-released by Manchester's Buzzcocks, was a benchmark for both the DIY ethic and regionalism in the country's punk movement. The Clash's self-titled debut album came out two months later and rose to number twelve; the single \"White Riot\" entered the top forty. In May, the Sex Pistols achieved new heights of controversy (and number two on the singles chart) with \"God Save the Queen\". The band had recently acquired a new bassist, Sid Vicious, who was seen as exemplifying the punk persona. The swearing during the Grundy interview and the controversy over \"God Save the Queen\" led to a moral panic.\nScores of new punk groups formed around the United Kingdom, as far from London as Belfast's Stiff Little Fingers and Dunfermline, Scotland's the Skids. Though most survived only briefly, perhaps recording a small-label single or two, others set off new trends. Crass, from Essex, merged a vehement, straight-ahead punk rock style with a committed anarchist mission, and played a major role in the emerging anarcho-punk movement. Sham 69, London's Menace, and the Angelic Upstarts from South Shields in the Northeast combined a similarly stripped-down sound with populist lyrics, a style that became known as street punk. These expressly working-class bands contrasted with others in the second wave that presaged the post-punk phenomenon. Liverpool's first punk group, Big in Japan, moved in a glam, theatrical direction. The band did not survive long, but it spun off several well-known post-punk acts. The songs of London's Wire were characterized by sophisticated lyrics, minimalist arrangements, and extreme brevity.\nThe Clash's debut had included a cover of the recent Jamaican reggae hit \"Police and Thieves\". Other first wave bands such as the Slits and new entrants to the scene like the Ruts and the Police interacted with the reggae and ska subcultures, incorporating their rhythms and production styles. The punk rock phenomenon helped spark a full-fledged ska revival movement known as 2 Tone, centered on bands such as the Specials, the Beat, Madness, and the Selecter. In July, the Sex Pistols' third single, \"Pretty Vacant\", reached number six and Australia's the Saints had a top-forty hit with \"This Perfect Day\".\nIn September, Generation X and the Clash reached the top forty with, respectively, \"Your Generation\" and \"Complete Control\". X-Ray Spex's \"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\" did not chart, but it became a requisite item for punk fans. The BBC banned \"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\" due to its controversial lyrics. In October, the Sex Pistols hit number eight with \"Holidays in the Sun\", followed by the release of their first and only \"official\" album, \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\". Inspiring yet another round of controversy, it topped the British charts. In December, one of the first books about punk rock was published: \"The Boy Looked at Johnny\", by Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons.\nAustralia.\nIn February 1977, EMI released the Saints' debut album, \"(I'm) Stranded\", which the band recorded in two days. The Saints had relocated to Sydney; in April, they and Radio Birdman united for a major gig at Paddington Town Hall. Last Words had also formed in the city. The following month, the Saints relocated again, to Great Britain. In June, Radio Birdman released the album \"Radios Appear\" on its own Trafalgar label.\n1979\u20131984: Schism and diversification.\nBy 1979, the hardcore punk movement was emerging in Southern California. A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as \"Hollywood punks\" and \"beach punks\", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of South Bay and Orange County.\nIn contrast to North America, more of the bands from the original British punk movement remained active, sustaining extended careers even as their styles evolved and diverged. Meanwhile, the Oi! and anarcho-punk movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, \"The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash [...] It became essential to sound one particular way to be recognized as a 'punk band' now.\" In February 1979, former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious died of a heroin overdose in New York. If the Sex Pistols' breakup the previous year had marked the end of the original UK punk scene and its promise of cultural transformation, for many the death of Vicious signified that it had been doomed from the start.\nBy the turn of the decade, the punk rock movement had split deeply along cultural and musical lines. The \"Great Schism\" of punk occurred right as the 1980s were approaching, when melodic new wave artists began to separate themselves from hardcore punk. This left a variety of derivative scenes and forms. On one side were new wave and post-punk artists; some adopted more accessible musical styles and gained broad popularity, while some turned in more experimental, less commercial directions. On the other side, hardcore punk, Oi!, and anarcho-punk bands became closely linked with underground cultures and spun off an array of subgenres. Somewhere in between, pop-punk groups created blends like that of the ideal record, as defined by Mekons cofounder Kevin Lycett: \"a cross between ABBA and the Sex Pistols\". A range of other styles emerged, many of them fusions with long-established genres. The Clash album \"London Calling\", released in December 1979, exemplified the breadth of classic punk's legacy. Combining punk rock with reggae, ska, R&amp;B, and rockabilly, it went on to be acclaimed as one of the best rock records ever. At the same time, as observed by Flipper singer Bruce Loose, the relatively restrictive hardcore scenes diminished the variety of music that could once be heard at many punk gigs. If early punk, like most rock scenes, was ultimately male-oriented, the hardcore and Oi! scenes were significantly more so, marked in part by the slam dancing and moshing with which they became identified.\nNew wave.\nIn 1976\u2014first in London, then in the United States\u2014\"New Wave\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \"punk\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. \"NME\" journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \"new wave\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from music venue The Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \"new wave\" and no longer called \"punk\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.\nBringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \"dangerous\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\". New wave crossed into the mainstream with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. According to Stuart Borthwick and Ron Moy, authors of \"Popular Music Genres: an Introduction\", the \"height of popularity for new wave\" coincided with the election of Margaret Thatcher in spring 1979.\nPost-punk.\nDuring the late 1970s, the post-punk scene emerged as a rejection of punk's raw and simplistic conventions, instead incorporating broader and more experimental influences. On 4 June 1976, the Sex Pistols' concert at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall inspired future members of Joy Division, the Fall, Buzzcocks, Magazine and the Smiths to form their own bands, as well as influencing the formation of independent record labels, Factory and Creation Records, both of which contributed to the development of the production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene of the 1980s. The earliest recorded use of the term \"post-punk\" appeared in the 26 November 1977 issue of \"Sounds\" in an article titled \"New Musick: Devo Look Into the Future!\" by writer Jon Savage. In the article, Savage described bands such as Devo, Pere Ubu, Throbbing Gristle, the Feelies, Subway Sect, the Prefects, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the Slits as early examples of post-punk. Post-punk was later further proliferated by other notable bands such as Wire, Public Image Ltd, the Pop Group, the Raincoats, Gang of Four, and the Cure.\nThese bands were often experimental, incorporating an array of influences that ranged from krautrock, funk, electronic music, jazz, dub and disco to Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd as well as the art rock, glam rock and experimental rock music of the Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart, Roxy Music, Brian Eno, as well as Iggy Pop's the Idiot and David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy.\nAlthough, post-punk was largely a British movement, the scene had roots in the United States. Notable American post-punk bands included Pere Ubu, Devo, Television, Mission of Burma, Talking Heads, Suburban Lawns, Chrome and MX-80 Sound. The no wave movement that developed in New York in the late 1970s, with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James Chance, was birthed as an opposition to commercialized new wave music. In 1980, Australian post-punk band, the Birthday Party, relocated to London and later evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Melbourne's Little band scene further proliferated post-punk and gave rise to acts such as Dead Can Dance. The original post-punk movement became highly influential to 1990s and 2000s alternative rock music, inspiring the subsequent post-punk revival scene in New York.\nHardcore.\nA distinctive style of punk, characterized by superfast, aggressive beats, screaming vocals, and often politically aware lyrics, began to emerge in 1978 among bands scattered around the United States and Canada. The first major scene of what came to be known as hardcore punk developed in Southern California in 1978\u201379, initially around such punk bands as the Germs and Fear. The movement soon spread around North America and internationally. According to author Steven Blush, \"Hardcore comes from the bleak suburbs of America. Parents moved their kids out of the cities to these horrible suburbs to save them from the 'reality' of the cities and what they ended up with was this new breed of monster\". In 1981, hardcore punk was exposed to mainstream television audiences following a live performance from Fear on \"Saturday Night Live\", which prompted a live-broadcast riot and mosh pit, which included members of the emerging hardcore scene such as Ian MacKaye, Harley Flanagan, Tesco Vee, and John Brannon.\nAmong the earliest hardcore bands, regarded as having made the first recordings in the style, were Southern California's Middle Class and Black Flag. Bad Brains \u2014 all of whom were black, a rarity in punk of any era \u2013 launched the D.C. scene with their rapid-paced single \"Pay to Cum\" in 1980. Austin, Texas's Big Boys, San Francisco's Dead Kennedys, and Vancouver's D.O.A. were among the other initial hardcore groups. They were soon joined by bands such as the Minutemen, Descendents, and Circle Jerks in Southern California; D.C.'s Minor Threat and State of Alert; and Austin's MDC. By 1981, hardcore was the dominant punk rock style not only in California but much of the rest of North America as well. A New York hardcore scene grew, including the relocated Bad Brains, New Jersey's Misfits and Adrenalin O.D., and local acts such as the Mob, Reagan Youth, and Agnostic Front. Beastie Boys, who would become famous as a hip-hop group, debuted that year as a hardcore band. They were followed by the Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, and Leeway. By 1983, St. Paul's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Willful Neglect, Chicago's Naked Raygun, Indianapolis's Zero Boys, and D.C.'s the Faith were taking the hardcore sound in experimental and ultimately more melodic directions. Hardcore would constitute the American punk rock standard throughout the decade. The lyrical content of hardcore songs is often critical of commercial culture and middle-class values, as in Dead Kennedys' celebrated \"Holiday in Cambodia\" (1980).\nStraight edge bands like Minor Threat, Boston's SS Decontrol, and Reno, Nevada's 7 Seconds rejected the self-destructive lifestyles of their peers, and built a movement based on positivity and abstinence from cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and casual sex.\nSkate punk innovators pointed in other directions: including Venice, California's Suicidal Tendencies who had a formative effect on the heavy metal\u2013influenced crossover thrash style. Toward the middle of the decade, D.R.I spawned the superfast thrashcore genre.\n1985\u2013present: Legacy and revival.\nAlternative rock.\n \nThe underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and their Minneapolis prot\u00e9g\u00e9s the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \"college rock\".\nIn 1985, \"Rolling Stone\" declared that \"Primal punk is pass\u00e9. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles\u2014including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others\u2014unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.\nAs American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the \"no-wave\" scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, \"Bleach\" in 1989 for about $600, the band achieved huge (and unexpected) commercial success with its second album, \"Nevermind\". The band's members cited punk rock as a key influence on their style. \"Punk is musical freedom\", wrote frontman Kurt Cobain. \"It's saying, doing, and playing what you want.\" Nirvana's success opened the door to mainstream popularity for a wide range of other \"left-of-the-dial\" acts, such as Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers, and fueled the alternative rock boom of the early and mid-1990s.\nMetal\u2013rap\u2013punk fusion.\nDuring the early 1990s, new alternative forms of punk rock began to fuse with heavy metal and hip hop music. Rage Against the Machine released their eponymous debut studio album \"Rage Against the Machine\" in November 1992, to commercial and critical acclaim. The band presented itself with politically themed, revolutionary lyrical content, accompanied by the aggressive vocal delivery of lead singer Zack de la Rocha. Rage Against the Machine would go on to achieve back-to-back number 1 debuts on the Billboard 200, with their second studio album, \"Evil Empire\" (1996), and their third studio album, \"The Battle of Los Angeles\" (1999).\nIn a 2016 interview with Audio Ink Radio, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford was asked about the band's status as a punk band:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rage is a punk band. We were a punk band and our ethics were punk. We didn't do anything that anyone wanted us to do. We only did what we wanted to do and that is the essence of punk rock.\u2014\u200a\nQueercore.\nIn the 1990s, the queercore movement developed around a number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, gender identity, and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.\nRiot grrrl.\nThe riot grrrl movement, a significant aspect in the formation of the Third Wave feminist movement, was organized by taking the values and rhetoric of punk and using it to convey feminist messages.\nIn 1991, a concert of female-led bands at the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, Washington, heralded the emerging riot grrrl phenomenon. Billed as \"Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now\", the concert's lineup included Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, L7, and Mecca Normal. The riot grrrl movement foregrounded feminist concerns and progressive politics in general; the DIY ethic and fanzines were also central elements of the scene. This movement relied on media and technology to spread their ideas and messages, creating a cultural-technological space for feminism to voice their concerns. They embodied the punk perspective, taking the anger and emotions and creating a separate culture from it. With riot grrrl, they were grounded in girl punk past but also rooted in modern feminism. Tammy Rae Carbund, from Mr. Lady Records, explains that without riot grrrl bands, \"[women] would have all starved to death culturally.\"\nSinger-guitarists Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17, bands active in both the queercore and riot grrrl scenes, cofounded the indie/punk band Sleater-Kinney in 1994. Bikini Kill's lead singer, Kathleen Hanna, the iconic figure of riot grrrl, moved on to form the art punk group Le Tigre in 1998.\nPunk revival and mainstream success.\nLate 1970s punk music was anti-conformity and anti-mainstream and achieved limited commercial success. By the 1990s, punk rock was sufficiently ingrained in Western culture that punk trappings were often used to market highly commercial bands as \"rebels\". Marketers capitalized on the style and hipness of punk rock to such an extent that a 1993 ad campaign for an automobile, the Subaru Impreza, claimed that the car was \"like punk rock\".\nIn 1993, California's Green Day and Bad Religion were both signed to major labels. The next year, Green Day put out \"Dookie,\" which sold nine million albums in the United States in just over two years. Bad Religion's \"Stranger Than Fiction\" was certified gold. Other California punk bands on the independent label Epitaph, run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz, also began achieving mainstream popularity. In 1994, Epitaph released \"Let's Go\" by Rancid, \"Punk in Drublic\" by NOFX, and \"Smash\" by the Offspring, each eventually certified gold or better. That June, Green Day's \"Longview\" reached number one on \"Billboard\"'s Modern Rock Tracks chart and became a top forty airplay hit, arguably the first ever American punk song to do so; just one month later, the Offspring's \"Come Out and Play\" followed suit. MTV and radio stations such as Los Angeles' KROQ-FM played a major role in these bands' crossover success, though NOFX refused to let MTV air its videos.\nFollowing the lead Boston's Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Anaheim's No Doubt, ska punk and ska-core became widely popular in the mid-1990s. \"...And Out Come the Wolves\", the 1995 album by Rancid became the first record in the ska revival to be certified gold; Sublime's self-titled 1996 album was certified platinum early in 1997. In Australia, two popular groups, skatecore band Frenzal Rhomb and pop-punk act Bodyjar, also established followings in Japan.\nGreen Day and \"Dookie\"'s enormous sales paved the way for a host of bankable North American pop-punk bands in the following decade. With punk rock's renewed visibility came concerns among some in the punk community that the music was being co-opted by the mainstream. They argued that by signing to major labels and appearing on MTV, punk bands like Green Day were buying into a system that punk was created to challenge. Such controversies have been part of the punk culture since 1977 when the Clash were widely accused of \"selling out\" for signing with CBS Records. The Vans Warped Tour and the mall chain store Hot Topic brought punk even further into the U.S. mainstream.\nThe Offspring's 1998 album \"Americana\", released by the major Columbia label, debuted at number two on the album chart. A bootleg MP3 of \"Americana\"'s first single, \"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\", made it onto the Internet and was downloaded a record 22 million times\u2014illegally. The following year, \"Enema of the State\", the first fully major-label release by pop-punk band Blink-182, reached the top ten and sold four million copies in under twelve months. On February 19, 2000, the album's second single, \"All the Small Things\", peaked at number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. While they were viewed as Green Day \"acolytes\", critics also found teen pop acts such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, and 'N Sync suitable points of comparison for Blink-182's sound and market niche. The band's \"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\" (2001) and \"Untitled\" (2003) respectively rose to numbers one and three on the album chart. In November 2003, \"The New Yorker\" described how the \"giddily puerile\" act had \"become massively popular with the mainstream audience, a demographic formerly considered untouchable by punk-rock purists.\"\nOther new North American pop-punk bands, though often critically dismissed, also achieved major sales in the first decade of the 2000s. Ontario's Sum 41 reached the Canadian top ten with its 2001 debut album, \"All Killer No Filler\", which eventually went platinum in the United States. The record included the number one U.S. Alternative hit \"Fat Lip\", which incorporated verses of what one critic called \"brat rap\". Elsewhere around the world, \"punkabilly\" band the Living End became major stars in Australia with their self-titled 1998 debut.\nAdditionally in the early 2000s, attention within punk circles was drawn to the Afro-punk movement and contributions of people of African descent to punk music. Much of this attention was derived from the eponymous documentary released in 2003.\nThe effect of commercialization on the music became an increasingly contentious issue. As observed by scholar Ross Haenfler, many punk fans \"despise corporate punk rock\", typified by bands Sum\u00a041 and Blink-182.\nOther influential subgenres.\nOi!\nFollowing the lead of first-wave British punk bands Cock Sparrer and Sham 69, in the late 1970s second-wave groups like Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts, the Exploited, and the 4-Skins sought to realign punk rock with a working class, street-level following. They believed the music needed to stay \"accessible and unpretentious\", in the words of music historian Simon Reynolds. Their style was originally called \"real punk\" or street punk; \"Sounds\" journalist Garry Bushell is credited with labelling the genre \"Oi!\" in 1980. The name is partly derived from the Cockney Rejects' habit of shouting \"Oi! Oi! Oi!\" before each song, instead of the time-honored \"1, 2, 3, 4!\"\nThe Oi! movement was fueled by a sense that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of the Business guitarist Steve Kent, \"trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic\u00a0... and losing touch\". According to Bushell, \"Punk was meant to be of the voice of the dole queue, and in reality, most of them were not. But Oi was the reality of the punk mythology. In the places where [these bands] came from, it was harder and more aggressive and it produced just as much quality music.\" Lester Bangs described Oi! as \"politicized football chants for unemployed louts\". One song in particular, the Exploited's \"Punks Not Dead\", spoke to an international constituency. It was adopted as an anthem by the groups of disaffected Mexican urban youth known in the 1980s as \"bandas\"; one \"banda\" named itself PND, after the song's initials.\nAlthough most Oi! bands in the initial wave were apolitical or left wing, many of them began to attract a white power skinhead following. Racist skinheads sometimes disrupted Oi! concerts by shouting fascist slogans and starting fights, but some Oi! bands were reluctant to endorse criticism of their fans from what they perceived as the \"middle-class establishment\". In the popular imagination, the movement thus became linked to the far right. \"Strength Thru Oi!\", an album compiled by Bushell and released in May 1981, stirred controversy, especially when it was revealed that the belligerent figure on the cover was a neo-Nazi jailed for racist violence (Bushell claimed ignorance). On July 3, a concert at Hamborough Tavern in Southall featuring the Business, the 4-Skins, and the Last Resort was firebombed by local Asian youths who believed that the event was a neo-Nazi gathering. Following the Southall riot, press coverage increasingly associated Oi! with the extreme right, and the movement soon began to lose momentum.\nAnarcho-punk.\nAnarcho-punk developed alongside the Oi! and American hardcore movements. Inspired by Crass, its Dial House commune, and its independent Crass Records label, a scene developed around British bands such as Subhumans, Flux of Pink Indians, Conflict, Poison Girls, and the Apostles that was as concerned with anarchist and DIY principles as it was with music. Several Crass members were of an older generation of artist and cultural provocateur and thus linked their version of punk directly back to the 1960s counterculture and early 1970s avant-gardism. The acts featured ranting vocals, discordant instrumental sounds, seemingly primitive production values, and lyrics filled with political and social content, often addressing issues such as class inequalities and military violence. Anarcho-punk disdained the older punk scene from which theirs had evolved. In historian Tim Gosling's description, they saw \"safety pins and Mohicans as little more than ineffectual fashion posturing stimulated by the mainstream media and industry. [...] Whereas the Sex Pistols would proudly display bad manners and opportunism in their dealings with 'the establishment,' the anarcho-punks kept clear of 'the establishment' altogether\".\nThe movement spun off several subgenres of a similar political bent. Discharge, founded back in 1977, established D-beat in the early 1980s. Other groups in the movement, led by Amebix and Antisect, developed the extreme style known as crust punk. Several of these bands rooted in anarcho-punk such as the Varukers, Discharge, and Amebix, along with former Oi! groups such as the Exploited and bands from farther afield like Birmingham's Charged GBH, became the leading figures in the UK 82 hardcore movement. The anarcho-punk scene also spawned bands such as Napalm Death, Carcass, and Extreme Noise Terror that in the mid-1980s defined grindcore, incorporating extremely fast tempos and death metal\u2013style guitarwork. Led by Dead Kennedys, a U.S. anarcho-punk scene developed around such bands as Austin's MDC and Southern California's Another Destructive System.\nPop-punk.\nWith their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop-punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\"; Descendents \"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop-punk bands. The mainstream pop-punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 or Green Day are criticized by many punk rock fans; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"\nFusions and directions.\nFrom 1977 on, punk rock crossed lines with many other popular music genres. Los Angeles punk rock bands laid the groundwork for a wide variety of styles: the Flesh Eaters with deathrock; the Plugz with Chicano punk; and Gun Club with punk blues. The Meteors, from South London, and the Cramps were innovators in the psychobilly fusion style. Milwaukee's Violent Femmes jumpstarted the American folk punk scene, while the Pogues did the same on the other side of the Atlantic. Other artists to fuse elements of folk music into punk included R.E.M. and the Proclaimers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "23040", "revid": "49912180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23040", "title": "Political philosophy", "text": "Study of the foundations of politics\nPolitical philosophy studies the theoretical and conceptual foundations of politics. It examines the nature, scope, and legitimacy of political institutions, such as states. The field investigates different forms of government, ranging from democracy to authoritarianism, and the values guiding political action, like justice, equality, and liberty. As a normative field, political philosophy focuses on desirable norms and values, in contrast to political science, which emphasizes empirical description.\nPolitical ideologies are systems of ideas and principles that outline how society should work. Anarchism rejects the coercive power of centralized governments. It proposes a stateless society to promote liberty and equality. Conservatism seeks to preserve traditional institutions and practices. It is skeptical of the human ability to radically reform society, arguing that drastic changes can destroy the wisdom of past generations. Liberals advocate for individual rights and liberties, the rule of law, private property, and tolerance. They believe that governments should protect these values to enable individuals to pursue personal goals without external interference. Socialism emphasizes collective ownership and equal distribution of basic goods. It seeks to overcome sources of inequality, including private ownership of the means of production, class systems, and hereditary privileges. Other strands of political philosophy include environmentalism, realism, idealism, consequentialism, perfectionism, nationalism, individualism, and communitarianism.\nPolitical philosophers rely on various methods to justify and criticize knowledge claims. Particularists use a bottom-up approach and systematize individual judgments, whereas foundationalists employ a top-down approach and construct comprehensive systems from a small number of basic principles. One foundationalist approach uses theories about human nature as the basis for political ideologies. Universalists assert that basic moral and political principles apply equally to every culture, a view rejected by cultural relativists.\nPolitical philosophy has its roots in antiquity, such as the theories of Plato and Aristotle in ancient Greek philosophy, with discussions on the nature of justice and ideal states. Confucianism, Taoism, and legalism emerged in ancient Chinese philosophy, while Hindu and Buddhist political thought developed in ancient India, each offering distinct views on the foundations of the social order and statecraft. Political philosophy in the medieval period was characterized by the interplay between ancient Greek thought and religion in both the Christian and Islamic worlds. The modern period marked a shift towards secularism as diverse schools of thought developed, such as social contract theory, liberalism, conservatism, utilitarianism, Marxism, and anarchism.\nDefinition and related fields.\nPolitical philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the theoretical and conceptual foundations of politics. It considers the relation between individual and society, the best organization of collective human life, the distribution of goods and power, the limits of state authority, and the values that should guide political decisions. The field examines basic concepts such as state, government, power, legitimacy, political obligation, justice, equality, and liberty, analyzing their essential features and how they influence citizens, communities, and policies. Schools of political philosophy, such as liberalism, conservatism, socialism, and anarchism, offer diverse interpretations of these concepts. They are guided by different values and propose distinct frameworks for structuring societies. As a systematic and critical inquiry, political philosophy scrutinizes established beliefs and explores alternative views. A central motivation for this investigation is that forms of government are not predetermined facts of nature but human creations that can be actively shaped to the benefit or detriment of some or all.\nPolitical philosophers address various evaluative or normative issues. They examine ideal forms of government and describe the values and norms that should guide political decisions. They differ in this regard from political scientists, who focus on empirical descriptions of how governments and other political institutions actually work, rather than how they ideally should work. The term \"political theory\" is sometimes used as a synonym of \"political philosophy\", but can also refer to a sister discipline. According to the latter view, political philosophy seeks to answer general and fundamental questions, whereas political theory analyzes and compares more specific aspects of political institutions and clarifies the concepts and methods used by political scientists.\nPolitical philosophy has its roots in ethics\u2014the area of philosophy studying moral phenomena\u2014and is sometimes considered a branch of ethics. While ethics examines right conduct and the good life in the broadest sense, political philosophy has a more narrow scope, focusing on the organization and justification of political institutions rather than private moral obligations not directly related to collective life. Political philosophy is also closely related to social philosophy, and philosophical treatises often discuss the two together without clearly distinguishing between them. Despite their overlap, one difference is that social philosophy examines diverse kinds of social phenomena, while political philosophy has a more specific focus on power and governance. Because of its interest in the role of laws and economic structures, political philosophy is also connected to the philosophy of law and economics.\nThe term \"political philosophy\" originates in the ancient Greek words (, meaning 'belonging or pertaining to the polis') and (, meaning 'love of wisdom'). As one of the oldest branches of philosophy, it has been practiced in many different cultures, often in response to political challenges of their time by trying to understand, justify, or critique social arrangements.\nBasic concepts.\nPolitical philosophers rely on various basic concepts, such as government, power, law, and justice, to formulate theories and conceptualize the field of politics. They understand politics as encompassing diverse activities associated with governance, collective decision-making, reconciliation of conflicting interests, and exercise of power. It is sometimes characterized as the art of skillfully engaging in these activities.\nGovernment, power, and laws.\nThe state, a fundamental concept in political philosophy, is an organized political entity. States are associations of people, called \"citizens\". They typically exercise control over a specific territory, implement the rule of law, and function as juristic persons subject to rights and obligations while engaging with other states. However, the precise definition of statehood is disputed. Some philosophical characterizations emphasize the state's monopoly on violence and the subordination of the will of the many to the will of a dominant few. Another outlook sees the state as a social contract for mutual benefit and security. States are characterized by their level of organization and the power they wield. They contrast with stateless societies, which are more loosely ordered social groups connected through a less centralized web of relationships. Nation, a related concept, refers to a group of people with a common identity such as shared culture, history, or language. Nation-states are states whose citizens share a common national identity that aligns with the state's political boundaries. Historically, the first states in antiquity were city-states.\nA government is an institution that exercises control and governs the people belonging to a political entity, usually a state. Some political philosophers see the government as an end in itself, while others consider it a means to other goods, such as peace and prosperity. Some governments set down fundamental principles, called \"constitution\", that outline the structure, functions, and limitations of governmental authority. By institutionalizing these principles, constitutions can help to constrain and stabilize the exercise of power, prevent abuses and arbitrary rule, legitimize rulebound governance, and saveguard rights. Anarchists reject governments and advocate self-governance without a centralized authority.\nPolitical philosophers distinguish forms of government based on who wields political power and how it is wielded. In democracies, the main power lies with the people. In direct democracies, citizens vote directly on laws and policies, whereas in indirect democracies, they elect leaders who make these decisions. Democracies contrast with authoritarian regimes, which reject political plurality and suppress dissent through centralized, hierarchical power structures. In the case of autocracies, absolute power is vested in a single person, such as a monarch or a dictator. For oligarchies, power is concentrated in the hands of a few, typically the wealthy. An authoritarian regime is totalitarian if it seeks extensive control over public and private life, such as fascism, which combines totalitarianism with nationalist and militarist political ideologies.\nForms of government can also be distinguished based on the type of people making political decisions. Aristocracy implements rule by the elites, such as a privileged ruling class or nobility. In the case of meritocracies, the ruling elites are chosen by skill rather than social background. For technocracies, people with technical skills, such as engineers and scientists, wield political power. Theocracies prioritize religious authority in political decision-making, implement religious laws, and claim legitimacy by following the divine will. Political philosophers further discuss federalism and confederalism, which are systems of governance involving multiple levels: in addition to a central national government, there are several regional governments with distinct responsibilities and powers. These systems contrast with colonialism, where occupied territories are exploited rather than treated as equal partners, and with unitary states, where authority is centralized at the national level.\nA key aspect of governments and other political institutions is the power they wield. Power is the ability to produce intended effects or control what people and institutions do. It can be based on consent, like people following a charismatic leader, but can also take the form of coercion, such as a tyrannical ruler enforcing compliance through fear and repression. The powers of government typically include the legislative power to establish new laws or revoke existing ones, the executive power to enforce laws, and the judicial power to arbitrate legal disputes. Some governments follow the separation of powers and have distinct branches for each function to prevent overconcentration and abuse of power. Others concentrate all power in a single entity. Language is a central aspect of political power, serving as a medium of communication and a force shaping public opinion. This influence is reflected in the control of the means of communication, such as mass media, and in the freedom of speech of each individual. Political power also includes institutional mechanisms that regulate the behavior of individuals, such as educational, disciplinary, and medical institutions.\nLegitimacy, another fundamental concept, is the rightful or justified use of power. Political philosophers examine whether, why, and under what conditions the powers exercised by a government are legitimate. Often-discussed requirements include that power is acquired following established rules and used for rightful ends. For instance, the rules of representative democracies assert that elections determine who acquires power as the legitimate ruler. Authority, a closely related concept, is the right to rule or the common belief that someone is legitimized to exercise power. In some cases, a person may have authority even if they lack the effective power to act. Some theorists also talk of \"illegitimate authority\" in situations where the common belief in the legitimacy of a use of power is mistaken.\nGovernments typically use laws to wield power. Laws are rules of social conduct that describe how people and institutions may or may not act. According to natural law theory, laws are or should be expressions of universal moral principles inherent in human nature. This view contrasts with legal positivism, which sees laws as human conventions. Political obligation is the duty of citizens to follow the laws of their political community. Political philosophers examine in what sense citizens are subject to political obligations even if they did not explicitly consent to them. Political obligation may or may not align with moral obligation\u2014the duty to follow moral principles. For example, if an authoritarian state imposes laws that violate basic human rights, citizens may have a moral obligation to disobey. Laws also regulate the rights of individuals as legal entitlements protecting their interests and freedom.\nLaws governing property are foundational to many legal systems. Property is the right to control a good, such as the rights to use, consume, lend, sell, and destroy it. It covers both material goods, like natural resources, and immaterial goods, such as copyrights associated with intellectual property. Public property pertains to the state or community, whereas private property belongs to other entities, such as individual citizens. Many discussions in political philosophy address the advantages and disadvantages of private property. For example, communism seeks to abolish most forms of private property in favor of collective ownership to promote economic equality.\nJustice, equality, and liberty.\nDiverse concepts in political philosophy act as values or goals of political processes. Justice is a complex concept at the core of many political concerns. It is specifically associated with the idea that people should be treated fairly and receive what they deserve. More broadly, it also refers to appropriate behavior and moral conduct, but its exact meaning varies by context: it can be an aspect of actions, a virtue of actors, or a structural feature of social situations. In the context of social life, social justice encompasses various aspects of fairness and equality in regard to wealth, assets, and other advantages. It includes the idea of distributive justice, which promotes an impartial allocation of resources, goods, and opportunities. In legal contexts, retributive justice deals with punishment, with one principle being that the harm inflicted on an offender should be proportional to their crime.\nJustice is closely related to equality, the ideal that individuals should have the same rights, opportunities, or resources. Equality before the law is the principle that all individuals are subject to the same legal standards, rights, and obligations. Political equality concerns the ability to vote for someone and to become a candidate for a political position. Equal opportunity is the ideal that everyone should have the same chances in life, meaning that success should be based on merit rather than circumstances of birth or social class. This contrasts with equality of outcome, the idea that all people should have similar levels of material wealth and living standards. Philosophers of politics examine and compare different conceptions of equality, discussing which of its aspects should guide political action. They also consider the influence of discrimination, which refers to unfair treatment based on characteristics such as race, gender, sexuality, and class that can undermine equality. The school of political thought known as egalitarianism sees equality as one of the main goals of political action.\nLiberty or freedom is the ideal that people may act according to their will without oppressive restrictions. Political philosophers typically distinguish two complementary aspects of liberty: positive liberty\u2014the power to act in a certain way\u2014and negative liberty\u2014the absence of obstacles or interference from others. Liberty is a key value of liberalism, a school of political philosophy. Competing schools of thought debate whether laws necessarily limit liberty by restricting individual actions to protect the common good or enable it by creating a safe framework in which individuals can exercise their rights freely. Liberty as an ability to do something is sometimes distinguished from license, which involves explicit permission to do something. Autonomy, another closely related concept, is the ability to make informed decisions and govern oneself by being one's own master.\nWelfare, well-being, and happiness express the general quality of life of an individual and are central standards for evaluating policies and political institutions. Subjectivists understand these phenomena as subjective experiences, linked to the presence of pleasant feelings, the absence of unpleasant ones, and a positive self-assessment of one's life. Objectivists, by contrast, argue that the relevant factors can be objectively measured, such as economic prosperity, health, education, and security. Welfarism is the school of political thought that states that well-being is the ultimate goal of political actions. Welfare states are states that prioritize the social and economic well-being of their citizens through measures such as affordable healthcare systems, social security, and free access to education for all.\nMajor schools of thought.\nAnarchism.\nAnarchism is a school of political thought that rejects hierarchical systems, arguing for self-governing social structures and a stateless society, known as \"anarchy\". Anarchists typically see liberty and equality as their guiding values. They understand authority over others as a threat to individual autonomy and criticize hierarchical structures for perpetuating power imbalances and inequalities. As a result, they challenge the legitimacy of centralized governments wielding coercive power over others. Anarchism maintains that freedom from domination is central to human flourishing. It promotes social structures based on voluntary association to advance universal egalitarianism, emphasizing free cooperation and non-coercive consensus-building.\nSeveral schools of anarchism have been proposed. Absolute or \"a priori\" anarchism rejects any form of state, arguing that state power is inherently illegitimate and unjust. Contingent or \"a posteriori\" anarchism presents a less radical view, suggesting that states are not inherently bad but nonetheless usually fail in practice. For example, consequentialist anarchism rejects states based on the claim that they typically have negative consequences, such as inequality, discrimination, and unhappiness. Individualist anarchists emphasize the importance of individual freedom, seeking to defend it against any social structure that restricts personal autonomy, including parental authority and legal institutions. This outlook can take the form of libertarian anarchism or anarcho-capitalism. Collectivist or socialist anarchists, by contrast, stress the importance of community and voluntary cooperation within society, advocating collective ownership of resources and the means of production. For example, anarchist communism argues for decentralized social organization and communal sharing to promote well-being for all.\nDiverse criticisms of anarchism have been articulated. Some see anarchism as a negative attitude that seeks to destroy established institutions without providing viable alternatives, thereby simply replacing order with chaos. Another objection holds that anarchy is inherently unstable since hierarchical structures emerge naturally, meaning that stateless societies will inevitably evolve back into some form of state. Further arguments assert that the guiding anarchist goal is based on an unreachable utopian ideal or that anarchism is incoherent since the attempt to undermine all forms of authority paradoxically is itself a new form of authority.\nConservatism.\nConservatism is a school of political thought that seeks to preserve and promote traditional institutions and practices. It is typically driven by skepticism about the human ability to radically reconceive and reform society, arguing that such attempts, guided by a limited understanding of the consequences, often result in more harm than good. Conservatives give more weight to the wisdom of historical experience than abstract ideals of reason. They assert that since established institutions and practices have passed the test of time, they serve as foundations of stability and continuity. Despite its preference for the \"status quo\", conservatism is not opposed to political and social change in general but advocates for a cautious approach. It maintains that change should happen as a gradual and natural evolution rather than through radical reform to ensure that political arrangements deemed valuable are preserved.\nWhile the exact institutions and practices to be preserved depend on the specific cultural and historical context of a society, conservatives generally emphasize the importance of family, religion, and national identity. They tend to support private property as a safeguard against state power and some forms of social security for the poor to maintain societal stability.\nDistinct strands of conservative thought follow different but overlapping approaches. Authoritarian conservatism prioritizes centralized, established authorities over the judgment of individuals. Traditionalist conservatism sees general customs, conventions, and traditions as the guiding principles that inform both established institutions and individual judgments. Romantic or reactionary conservatism is driven by nostalgia and seeks to restore an earlier state of society deemed superior. Other discussed types include paternalistic conservatism, which argues that those in power should care for the less privileged, and liberal conservatism, which includes the emphasis on individual liberties and economic freedoms in the conservative agenda.\nDifferent criticisms of conservatism have been proposed. Some focus on its resistance to change and lack of innovation, arguing that prioritizing the \"status quo\" perpetuates existing problems and stifles progress. In particular, this concerns situations in which rapidly evolving societal challenges require dynamic, flexible, and creative responses. Another objection targets conservative skepticism about the capacity of reason to effectively address complex social issues, arguing that this skepticism is exaggerated and hinders well-thought-out reforms and meaningful improvements. Some critics state that conservatism reinforces established social hierarchies and inequalities, often benefiting privileged social classes while disadvantaging marginalized groups.\nLiberalism.\nLiberalism is a philosophical tradition emphasizing individual liberties and rights, the rule of law, tolerance, and constitutional democracy. It encompasses a variety of ideas without a precise definition. Some liberals follow John Locke's view that all individuals are born free and equal, highlighting the government's role in protecting this natural state. Others associate liberalism more with the individual's ability to participate in democratic institutions than with equality. Liberals endorse various forms of liberty, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and free choice of profession. Liberalism allows for diverse life choices and advocates tolerance of lifestyles different from one's own. This outlook is grounded in optimism about human nature and trust in the individual's responsibility to make sensible decisions. As a result, liberals assert that the government should remain neutral and uphold the rule of law to allow individuals to pursue their goals without external interference.\nMost forms of liberalism support some form of free-market economy and capitalism. In a free market, the exchange of goods and services occurs with minimal state control and regulation: privately owned businesses compete with each other, and prices are primarily influenced by supply and demand. Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are mainly privately owned. This system is typically characterized by a contrast between capitalist owners, who aim to maximize the profit of their investment, and workers, who sell their labor in exchange for a salary.\nOne broad characterization distinguishes between classical and modern liberalism, also called social democratic liberalism, based on the role of the state. Classical liberalism seeks to protect the liberties and rights of individuals from government interference, arguing for a limited role of the state. It promotes negative liberty and tasks the state with safeguarding individuals from obstacles or interference from others, such as aggression and theft. Modern liberalism emphasizes positive liberty, arguing that the state should foster conditions that enable individuals to achieve their personal goals. This approach advocates for a more active role of the state to promote social justice, equality of opportunity, and the right to a minimal standard of living. This can include state programs to ensure affordable healthcare, education for all, and social security.\nLibertarianism is closely related to classical liberalism. It emphasizes individual liberties and argues that people should be free to do as they want without coercion as long as they do not infringe on the liberty of others. Some libertarians consider the non-aggression principle\u2014the principle forbidding aggression against a person and their property\u2014as the foundational tenet of libertarianism. Libertarians typically support a free-market economy based on private property and voluntary cooperation. They disapprove of governmental attempts to redistribute wealth and other forms of economic regulation. This view seeks to limit the role of government to collective defense, the protection of individual rights, and the enforcement of contracts.\nVarious criticisms of liberalism have been formulated. One objection asserts that its individualistic focus on personal liberties undermines community, arguing that the prioritization of personal freedoms leads to social fragmentation. A different criticism proposes that private property and unregulated markets threaten economic equality and tend to create unjust hierarchies. Further objections argue that liberalism diminishes the common good by reinforcing individualistic social disputes and that its commitments to tolerance and pluralism result in cultural relativism.\nSocialism.\nSocialism is a family of political views emphasizing collective ownership and equality. It argues that the means of production belong to the people in general and the workers in particular and should therefore form part of social ownership rather than private property. This outlook understands the state as a complex administrative device that manages resources and production to ensure social welfare and a fair distribution of goods.\nA key motivation underlying the socialist perspective is the establishment of equality, which is seen as the natural state of humans. Socialists seek to overcome sources of inequality, such as class systems and hereditary privileges. They are critical of capitalism, arguing that private property and free markets reinforce inequalities by leading to large-scale accumulation of private wealth. Some socialists propose systems of regulation and taxation to mitigate the negative effects of free-market economies. Others reject free-market systems in general and promote different mechanisms to manage the production and distribution of goods, ranging from centralized state control and ownership to decentralized systems that plan and direct economic activity.\nMarxism is an influential school of socialism that focuses on the analysis of class relations and social conflicts. It rejects capitalism, arguing that it leads to inequality by dividing society into a capitalist class, which owns the means of production, and a working class, which has to sell its labor and is thereby alienated from the products of its labor. According to this view, economic forces and class struggles are the primary drivers of the historical development of political systems, eventually leading to the downfall of capitalism and the emergence of socialism and communism. Communism is usually understood as a radical form of socialism that aims to replace private property with collective ownership and dissolve all class distinctions. In Marxist theory, socialism and communism are considered distinct types of post-capitalist societies. From this perspective, socialism is an intermediate stage between capitalism and communism that still carries some features of capitalism, such as material scarcity, a ruling government, and division of labor. Marx argued that these features would gradually dissolve, leading to a communist society characterized by material abundance, absence of occupational specialization, and self-organization without a central government.\nSeveral objections to socialism focus on its economic theory. Some argue that central planning and the absence of competition and market-driven price signals result in lower productivity and economic stagnation. Another line of criticism asserts that the different ideals motivating socialism are in conflict with each other. For example, the establishment of a massive state required to manage economic activity and social welfare may create new class distinctions, thereby undermining equality. Liberal critics assert that egalitarian redistribution transgresses individual rights and threatens negative liberty. Feminists argue that socialists focus on class distinctions at the expense of gender inequalities, and environmentalists maintain that socialist planning marginalizes environmental concerns.\nOthers.\nEnvironmentalism is a political ideology concerned with the relationship between humans and nature. It seeks to preserve, restore, and enhance the natural environment, including the protection of landscapes and animals. Anthropocentric environmentalism advocates such policies to improve human life, for example, to mitigate the global consequences of climate change or to promote local environmental justice by protecting marginalized groups from regional environmental degradation. This form of environmentalism can be integrated into many other political ideologies, such as conservatism and socialism. Non-anthropocentric environmentalism, also called ecocentrism and deep ecology, differs by focusing on the intrinsic value of nature itself. This view emphasizes that humans are only a small part of the ecosystem as a whole. It seeks to protect and improve nature for its own sake, not only because it serves human interests. This outlook covers diverse and sometimes contrasting interpretations of the relation between humans and nature, including the belief that humans should act as custodians of nature and the idea that modern human civilizations are the source of the problem and threaten natural balance.\nRealism and idealism are two opposing approaches to explaining and guiding political action. According to realism, political activity is primarily driven by self-interest. It asserts that actors pursue power to expand their sphere of influence. Realists argue that politics should not be limited by moral constraints or shy away from violent conflicts when the power aspirations of different actors collide. They highlight the importance of responding to concrete practical factors, with the primary goal of effectively shaping historical reality rather than pursuing ideals. On the international level, realism holds that the self-interest driving state actors is not constrained by a superior authority enforcing common rules. Idealism, by contrast, asserts that political action should follow moral principles. It seeks to establish a just and fair social order based on universal ethical norms rather than narrow self-interest. Idealists reject established practices and institutions that promote unjust use of power and seek to replace them with fair governance, even if their idealized vision reflects a utopian aspiration distant from current circumstances.\nConsequentialism, perfectionism, and pluralism are distinct but overlapping views about which things are valuable and how values should guide political activity. According to consequentialism, the value of any action depends on its concrete consequences. Classical utilitarianism, an influential form of consequentialism, asserts that only happiness or pleasure is ultimately valuable. This view argues that politics should strive to produce the highest overall happiness for the largest number of people. Welfarism, a closely related view, promotes well-being, which can cover other features in addition to pleasure, such as health, personal growth, meaningful relationships, and a sense of purpose in life. Perfectionism, a different evaluative outlook, asserts that there are certain objective goods, covering fields like morality, art, and culture, that promote the development of human nature. Although perfectionists disagree about what exactly those goods are, they all maintain that states should establish conditions that promote human excellence among their citizens. Value pluralists assert that diverse values influence political action. They often emphasize that different values can be opposed to each other and that value conflicts cannot always be resolved. For example, Isaiah Berlin argued that liberty and equality are conflicting values and that a gain in one value cannot make up for the loss in the other.\nIndividualism prioritizes the importance of individuals over the community, an ideal typically promoted by liberal political systems. It asserts that society is at its core made up of individuals and seeks to defend them from social attempts to interfere with their preferred lifestyles. Individualism contrasts with collectivism, which prioritizes the well-being of groups over individual interests and highlights the importance of group cohesion and unity. Communitarianism is a similar outlook that supports a social structure in which individuals are connected through strong social relationships and shared values. It argues that the personality and social identity of individuals are deeply influenced by community relations and social norms. Nationalism extends the focus on social relations to the state as a whole. It is closely associated with patriotism and promotes social cohesion through national identity based on shared customs, culture, and language.\nRepublicanism is a broad philosophical tradition that emphasizes civic virtue, political participation, and the rule of law. It argues that political action should promote the common good and social equality. This tradition is opposed to oppressive and authoritarian governance. It advocates the separation of powers to prevent overconcentration of authority, encouraging citizens to participate in the political process and seeking to hold the government accountable to the people. Populism, another ideological tendency, encompasses a variety of political outlooks that seek to promote the interests of ordinary people, typically contrasting the will of the people with the agenda of corrupt elites wielding power. The term is often associated with the negative connotation of attempting to gain support from uninformed people by appealing to popular sentiment. Conversely, elitism is the belief that elites, rather than common people, should run the government.\nVarious ideologies integrate religious values and principles into their political outlook. Christian democracy, an influential tradition in Western Europe, blends traditional Catholic social teachings with democratic principles, emphasizing community, family, a harmonious social order, respect for each person, and tradition. It is critical of the modern focus on material wealth and power. Islamism seeks to incorporate Islamic principles into governance, including the implementation of Islamic law while maintaining a critical attitude towards Western influences. Hindu nationalism promotes governance and national identity rooted in Hindu values and traditions. Other religion-inspired political ideologies include Zionism, Buddhist socialism, and Confucianism. Contrasting with these approaches, secularism opposes the integration of religious principles into politics.\nContractarianism and contractualism are views about the sources and legitimacy of power. They argue that political authority should be based on some form of consent among the citizens, for example, as an implicit social contract or as what people would reasonably agree to under ideal circumstances. For contractarianism, everyone's self-interest is the motivational force underlying the agreement, whereas contractualism emphasizes rationality and respect for others as the main factors.\nPostmodernism rejects ideological systems that claim to offer objective, universal truths and adopts a particularly critical attitude towards Enlightenment ideals of reason and progress. It opposes hierarchical power structures that perpetuate and enforce these ideals, calling instead for resistance to this type of centralized power while promoting a pluralism of local practices and ideologies. Feminism, another critical approach, targets injustice based on gender, aiming to empower women and liberate them from unfair patriarchal social structures. Feminists focus on many forms of inequality, including social, economic, political, and legal inequality. African political philosophy, a different tradition, is based on the concept of Ubuntu or humanness, asserting that legitimate power should be guided by the communal good, compassion, and mutual respect.\nMethodology.\nThe methodology of political philosophy examines how to arrive at, justify, and criticize knowledge claims. It helps solve theoretical disagreements, such as disputes about the ideal form of government. Methodological challenges arise from the evaluative or normative nature of political philosophy as a discipline that studies desirable societal arrangements. Disagreements about normative claims often cannot be directly resolved through observation and experimentation, making them less tractable than disagreements about empirical facts. Rational arguments can make a normative theory more plausible or compelling but are frequently not sufficient to lead to definitive or generally accepted solutions. Subjectivists conclude from this difficulty that political philosophy primarily expresses subjective views without a universally accepted rational foundation.\nPolitical philosophers sometimes start from common sense and established beliefs, which they systematically and critically review to assess their validity. This process includes the clarification of basic concepts, which can be used to formalize the underlying beliefs into precise theories while also considering arguments for and against them and exploring alternative views. The methodologies of particularism and foundationalism propose different approaches to this enterprise. Particularists use a bottom-up approach and take individual intuitions or assessments of specific circumstances as their starting point. They seek to systematize these individual judgments into a coherent theoretical framework. Foundationalists, by contrast, employ a top-down approach. They begin their inquiry from wide-reaching principles, such as the maxim of classical utilitarianism, which evaluates actions and policies based on the pain-pleasure balance they produce. Foundationalism aims to construct comprehensive systems of political thought from a small number of basic principles. The method of reflective equilibrium forms a middle ground between particularism and foundationalism. It tries to reconcile general principles with individual intuitions to arrive at a balanced and coherent framework that incorporates the perspectives from both approaches.\nA historically influential form of foundationalism grounds political ideologies in theories about human nature. It can take different forms, like reflections on human needs, abilities, and goals as well as the role of humans in the natural order or in a divine plan. Philosophers use these assumptions about human nature to infer political ideologies about the ideal form of government and other normative theories. For example, Thomas Hobbes believed that the natural state of humans is a perpetual conflict, arguing that a strong state based on a general social contract is necessary to ensure stability and security. An influential criticism of foundationalist approaches centered on human nature argues that one cannot infer normative claims from empirical facts, meaning that empirical facts about human nature do not provide a secure foundation for normative theories about the right form of government.\nFoundationalism is typically combined with universalism, which asserts that basic moral and political principles apply equally to every culture. Universalists suggest that the foundational values and standards of political action are the same for all societies and remain constant across historical periods. Cultural relativism rejects this transcultural perspective, arguing that norms and values are inherently tied to specific cultures. This view asserts that political principles represent assumptions of specific communities and cannot serve as universal standards for evaluating other cultures.\nMethodological individualism and holism are perspectives about the basic units of society. According to methodological individualism, societies are ultimately nothing but the individuals that comprise them. As a result, it analyzes political actions as the actions of the particular people who make decisions and participate within the social structure. This view sees collective entities, like states, nations, and other institutions, as mere byproducts of individual actions. Methodological holists, by contrast, argue for the irreducible existence of collective entities in addition to individuals. They contend that collective entities are more than the sum of their parts and see them as essential elements of political explanations.\nAnother methodological distinction is between rationalism and irrationalism. Rationalists assume that universal reason is or should be the guiding principle underlying political action. They see reason as a common thread that unites diverse societies and can ensure peace between them. Irrationalists reject this assumption and focus on other factors influencing human behavior, including emotions, cultural traditions, and social expectations. Some irrationalists argue for polylogism, the view that the laws of reason or logic are not universal but depend on cultural context, meaning that the same course of action may be rational from the perspective of one culture and irrational from another.\nThought experiments are methodological devices in which political philosophers construct imagined situations to test the validity of political ideologies and explore alternative social arrangements. For example, in his thought experiment \"original position\", John Rawls explores the underlying framework of a just society by imagining a situation in which individuals collectively decide the rules of their society. To ensure impartiality, individuals do not know which position they will occupy in this society, a condition termed \"veil of ignorance\".\nHistory.\nPolitical philosophy has its roots in antiquity, and many foundational concepts of Western political thought emerged in ancient Greek philosophy. Early influential contributions were made by the historian Thucydides (c.\u2009460\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009400 BCE), who inspired the school of realism by analyzing power relations and self-interest as central political factors. Inspired by the ideas of Socrates (470\u2013399 BCE), Plato (428\u2013348 BCE) discussed the role of the state, its relation to the citizens, the nature of justice, and forms of government. He was critical of democracy and favored a utopian monarchy ruled by a wise and benevolent philosopher king to promote the common good. His student Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) objected to Plato's utopianism, preferring a more practical approach to ensure political stability and avoid extremism. He defended perfectionism, asserting that humans have an inborn goal to develop their rational and moral capacities and that the state should foster this tendency. In Roman philosophy, the statesman Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) infused earlier Greek philosophy with Stoicism. He asserted that political action should be guided by reason rather than emotion and supported political participation following the meritocratic ideal of rule by the capable.\nDiverse traditions of political thought also developed in ancient China. Confucianism, initiated by Confucius (c.\u2009551\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009479 BCE), saw the virtue of humaneness or benevolence as the foundation of social order and norms. It sought to balance conflicting interests between private and public spheres, seeing society as an extension of the family. Taoism, another tradition, focused on the relation between humans and nature, arguing that humans should act in harmony with the natural order of the universe while avoiding excessive desires. It is sometimes associated with anarchism because of its emphasis on natural order, spontaneity, and rejection of coercive authority. Legalism, a realist school of thought, proposed that effective governance of large states requires strict laws based on rewards and punishments to control the harmful effects of personal self-interest. In ancient India, various social and political theories emerged in the 2nd millennium BCE, recorded in the \"Rig Veda\", like the idea that the social order is naturally divided into castes, each fulfilling a different role in society. The \"Arthashastra\", traditionally attributed to Kautilya (375\u2013283 BCE), was a political treatise on the essential components of states, such as the king, ministers, territory, and army, describing their nature and interaction. Buddhist political thought, starting in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, rejected the strict caste division of Hindu society, focusing instead on universal equality, brotherhood, and the reduction of everyone's suffering.\nPolitical philosophy in the medieval period was characterized by the interplay between ancient Greek thought and religion. Augustine (354\u2013430 CE) saw states in the human world as fundamentally flawed compared to the divine ideal but also regarded them as vehicles for human improvement and the establishment of peace and order. Influenced by Augustine's philosophy, Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274 CE) developed natural law theory by synthesizing Aristotelian and Christian philosophy. He argued that law serves the common good, positing that God rules the world according to the eternal law while humans participate in this plan by following the natural law, which reflects the moral order and can be known directly.\nIn the Arabic\u2013Persian tradition, philosophers sought to integrate Ancient Greek philosophy with Islamic thought. According to Al-Farabi (872\u2013950), the state is a cooperative entity in which individuals voluntarily work together for common prosperity. Similar to Plato's vision, he imagines a hierarchical structure in which wise philosophers rule. Al-Mawardi (972\u20131058) developed a complex theory of caliphates, examining how this form of government combines religious and political authority in the person of the caliph. Following a descriptive approach, Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406) distinguished between natural states, which serve the worldly interests of the rulers, rational states, which serve the worldly interests of the people, and caliphates, which serve both worldly and otherworldly interests of the people. Other influential contributions were made by Avicenna (980\u20131037), Al-Ghazali (1058\u20131111), and Averroes (1126\u20131198). Meanwhile, in China, starting roughly 960 CE, neo-Confucian thinkers argued for decentralized governance. They identified two main functions of the government: to organize the social order and to morally educate citizens.\nIn early modern philosophy, the medieval focus on religion was replaced by a secular outlook. The statesman Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1469\u20131527), often viewed as the founder of modern political philosophy, defended a radical form of political realism, emphasizing the importance of power and pragmatic governance in which the ends justify the means. Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679) tried to provide a rational foundation for secular states. He argued that humans are naturally driven by egoism, leading to a war of all against all that can only be avoided through a state with absolute centralized authority, justified by a common social contract. As a founder of liberalism, John Locke (1632\u20131704) also based the state on the consent of the governed but prioritized individual freedom over state power. He suggested that humans are born free and equal, and that the primary objective of the state is to protect this natural condition. David Hume (1711\u20131776) rejected social contracts as the foundation of the state, asserting instead that governments typically evolve without a prior plan and are accepted by the people because of their utility. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u20131778) introduced the concept of the general will, which is the will of the people to realize the common good. Influenced by Rousseau, Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) argued that laws should reflect the general will of the people, asserting that every citizen has the fundamental right to freedom and the duty to uphold the social contract. Edmund Burke (1729\u20131797), often considered the father of conservatism, stressed the importance of the accumulated wisdom of past generations while opposing radical change, such as the French Revolution.\nJeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832) developed utilitarianism, promoting the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) adapted this philosophy to support classical liberalism. Following ideas earlier formulated by Montesquieu (1689\u20131755), Alexis de Tocqueville (1805\u20131859) warned of modern despotism in the form of a tyranny of the majority, seeing it as a type of oppression in democracies that threatens the liberal goal of individual freedom. As a forerunner of feminist political philosophy, Mary Wollstonecraft (1759\u20131797) challenged the social subordination of women and argued for equal rights and access to education. According to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831), the role of the state is the embodiment of ethical life and rational freedom, which he saw best realized in conservative, constitutional monarchies. Influenced by Hegel, Karl Marx (1818\u20131883) and Friedrich Engels (1820\u20131895) analyzed the economic forces and class conflicts in capitalist societies, calling for a revolution to replace capitalism with socialism and communism. Another radical reconceptualization of the social order was proposed by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809\u20131865), often regarded as the father of anarchism, who rejected state authority as an obstacle to liberty and equality.\nIn the 20th century, interest in political philosophy declined as a result of criticisms of its normative claims and a shifting interest towards the more descriptive discipline of political science. Max Weber (1864\u20131920) defined states based on the justified use of force and distinguished different types of legitimate authority. A central topic in the philosophy of Hannah Arendt (1906\u20131975) was the nature of totalitarian regimes, exemplified by Nazi Germany and Soviet Stalinism. She highlighted both their ability to mobilize the population through simplistic ideologies and their use of terror as an end in itself. John Rawls (1921\u20132002) explored the nature of justice as fairness and examined the legitimate use of power in liberal democracies. Inspired by Rawls, Robert Nozick (1938\u20132002) defended libertarianism, supporting a minimal state that protects individual rights and liberties. The postmodern thinker Michel Foucault (1926\u20131984) analyzed power dynamics within society, with particular interest in how societal institutions, such as medical and correctional institutions, shape human behavior through the interplay of knowledge and power. In Indian political philosophy, Mahatma Gandhi (1869\u20131948) argued for self-rule and nonviolent resistance to colonialism while seeking to dismantle the caste system to achieve equality. Sri Aurobindo (1872\u20131950) advocated for religious nationalism, which formed part of his broader philosophical worldview describing the spiritual evolution of the world as a whole. In China, Marxism was reinterpreted under Mao Zedong (1893\u20131976) and combined with Confucian thought, considering the peasantry rather than the working class as the main force behind the communist revolution. In the Islamic world, Islamic modernism sought to reconcile traditional Muslim teachings with modernity.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located about southeast of Miami, Florida, between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles, it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. With approximately 3.2\u00a0million residents, it is divided into 78 municipalities, of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan, followed by those within the San Juan metropolitan area. Spanish and English are the official languages of the government, though Spanish predominates.\nPuerto Rico was settled by a succession of Amerindian peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago; these included the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Ta\u00edno. It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and subsequently colonized by Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n in 1508. Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers into the 18th century but remained a Spanish possession for the next 400 years. The decline of the Indigenous population, followed by an influx of Spanish settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, and African slaves vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the archipelago. Within the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategically significant role compared to larger and wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain. By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered on a fusion of European, African, and Indigenous elements. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War, Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.\nPuerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917 and can move freely between the archipelago and the mainland. However, residents of Puerto Rico are disenfranchised from federal elections and generally do not pay federal income tax. In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress, called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in presidential primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which oversees it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Congress approved a territorial constitution in 1952, allowing residents of the archipelago to elect a governor in addition to a senate and house of representatives. The political status of Puerto Rico is an ongoing debate.\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government, together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy; it ranks 47th on the Human Development Index. The major sectors of Puerto Rico's economy are manufacturing, primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and electronics, followed by services, namely tourism and hospitality.\nEtymology.\nPuerto Rico is Spanish for 'rich port'. Puerto Ricans often call the island , a derivation of , its indigenous Ta\u00edno name, which is popularly said to mean 'Land of the Valiant Lord'. The terms , , and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage, and derive from and respectively. The island is also popularly known in Spanish as , meaning \"the island of enchantment\".\nColumbus named the island , in honor of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was named (\"Rich Port City\"). Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city.\nThe island's name was changed to \"Porto Rico\" by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898. The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises. The name was changed back to \"Puerto Rico\" in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by F\u00e9lix C\u00f3rdova D\u00e1vila.\nThe official name of the entity in Spanish is (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Spanish official name was suggested by its architect Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn and adopted by a constitutional assembly on July 25, 1952. Some authorities have called it a euphemism and have charged that the official name in English of \"Commonwealth\" constitutes a fig leaf, i.e., associated with the covering up of an act that is actually embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance. Puerto Rico remains a territory of the United States, exercising substantial internal self-government, but subordinated to the U.S. Constitution in areas such as foreign affairs or defense. For this reason, it is not considered to be a full-fledged associated state under either international or U.S. domestic law.\nHistory.\nIndigenous settlement and European conquest.\nThe history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Ta\u00ednos. The Ta\u00edno people's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.\nLocated in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World. The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\nIn 1593, Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. The smallest of the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish\u2013American War, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain's final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Catholic Church.\nU.S. era.\nIn 1898, during the Spanish\u2013American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S.\nThe Foraker Act of 1900 established a civil government, ending rule by American generals and the Department of War. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling, \"Ortega v. Lara\", 202 U.S. https:// (1906), involving the Foraker Act and referring to the island as \"the acquired country\", soon affirmed that the U.S. Constitution applied within its territory and that any domestic Puerto Rican laws which did not conflict with it remained in force.\nThe Jones Act of 1917 made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens. The Jones Act paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico's Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952 Puerto Rico is one of five territories with less representation in the Federal government, along with the Federal District.\n21st century.\nIn 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S. government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections. The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November. The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association. 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence.\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law \"H.R. 5278: PROMESA\", establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rican government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government's constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico's legislature, governor, and other public authorities. There would be another referendum in 2017 in Puerto Rico, in favor of statehood although it was boycotted by some political opponents of it. (see 2017 Puerto Rican status referendum)\nIn 2017, Puerto Rico suffered back-to-back large hurricanes: the Category 5 Hurricane Irma (September 7, 2017) and the Category 4 Hurricane Maria (September 20, 2017). The storms caused an extreme amount of damage to the island, causing the following effects: all power was knocked out, 95% cell service, 43% of waste water treatment plants, 40 thousand land slides, 97% of roads blocked, 28% of health facilities damaged, leading to over 90% of the population applying for assistance after the storms. See also Effects of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico\nIt is thought that a combination of the debt crisis and two major hurricanes in the late 2010s, caused further departures from the island. Overall the population has decreased by about half a million in the 21st century, with many seeking better opportunities on the mainland.\nPuerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the November 3, 2020, general elections; the ballot asked one question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\" The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico voters answered yes. In the United States in the early 2020s, the Puerto Rico Status Act was being worked on by Congress, and H.R. 8393 passed the House in 2022\u2014though it has not passed the Senate; this bill would support PR making a binding referendum. The bill does not decide PR's fate, it simply prepares the United States to respond to the outcome of the referendum. In the November 5, 2024, elections, there were three choices in a non-binding referendum which included Statehood, Independence, or Independence with Free Association on the ballot; Statehood won with 59%. In addition, on November 5, 2024, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, who is pro-statehood, won the office of Governor of Puerto Rico in the 2024 general election with nearly 40% of the vote.\nGeography.\nPuerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos. Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. There are many other even smaller islets, like Monito, located near Mona, and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan, both located on the San Juan Bay. The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra, which are connected to the main island by bridges.\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of , of which is land and is water. Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island but smaller than Connecticut. The maximum length of the main island from east to west is , and the maximum width from north to south is . Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is 80% of the size of Jamaica, just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.\nThe topography of the island is mostly mountainous with large flat areas in the northern and southern coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the island from east to west is called the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta , is located in this range. Another important peak is El Yunque, one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest, with an elevation of .\nPuerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers, most of which originate in the Cordillera Central. Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions.\nPuerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks. Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm.\nPuerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American Plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The 1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake occurred on October 11, 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale. It originated off the coast of Aguadilla, several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami. It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4\u00a0million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. On January 7, 2020, the country experienced its largest earthquake since 1918, estimated at magnitude 6.4. Economic losses were estimated to be more than $3.1 billion.\nThe Puerto Rico Trench, the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates. It is long. At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep, it is almost deep. The Mona Canyon, located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, is another prominent oceanic landform with steep walls measuring between in height from bottom to top.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Puerto Rico in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest. Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near in lower elevations and in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation. Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas.\nBetween the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature change of around . This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal water temperatures during the year are about in February and in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was at Arecibo, while the lowest temperature ever recorded was in the mountains at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal. The average yearly precipitation is . Climate change in Puerto Rico has had a large impact on the ecosystems and landscapes.\nPuerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season, similar to the rest of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which are more prevalent during periods of La Ni\u00f1a than El Ni\u00f1o. A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane. In 2017, Puerto Rico was affected by Category 5 Hurricane Irma and Category 4 Hurricane Maria, causing widespread and devastating impacts, particularly to the electric grid.\nBiodiversity.\nPuerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests, Puerto Rican dry forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves. Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme: Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Gu\u00e1nica Biosphere Reserve.\nSpecies endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians/reptiles, recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island. The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the \"coqu\u00ed\", a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most \"coqu\u00ed\" species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. Forest Service system, located in the northeast of the island. It was previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon.\nIn addition to El Yunque National Forest, the Puerto Rican moist forest ecoregion is represented by protected areas such as the Maricao and Toro Negro state forests. These areas are home to endangered endemic species such as the Puerto Rican boa (\"Chilabothrus inornatus\"), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (\"Accipiter striatus venator\"), the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (\"Buteo platypterus brunnescens\") and the elfin woods warbler (Setophaga angelae). The Northern Karst country of Puerto Rico is also home to one of the remaining rainforest tracts in the island, with the R\u00edo Abajo State Forest being the first focus for the reintroduction of the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot outside of the Sierra de Luquillo.\nIn the southwest, the Gu\u00e1nica State Forest and Biosphere Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 that are endemic to Puerto Rico, and is considered a prime example of the Puerto Rican dry forest ecoregion and the best-preserved dry forest in the Caribbean. Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico can be formed within the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge complex at the Cabo Rojo, Desecheo, Culebra and Vieques National Wildlife Refuges, and in the Caja de Muertos and Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserves. Examples of endemic species found in this ecoregion are the higo chumbo (\"Harrisia portoricensis\"), the Puerto Rican crested toad (\"Peltophryne lemur\"), and the Mona ground iguana (\"Cyclura stejnegeri\"), the largest land animal native to Puerto Rico.\nPuerto Rico has three of the seven year-long bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean: Laguna Grande in Fajardo, La Parguera in Lajas and Puerto Mosquito in Vieques. These are unique bodies of water surrounded by mangroves that are inhabited by the dinoflagellate \"Pyrodinium bahamense\". However, tourism, pollution, and hurricanes have highly threatened these unique ecosystems.\nGovernment and politics.\nPuerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model, with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States. All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress, with the head of state being the president of the United States. As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S. Constitution.\nThe government of Puerto Rico is composed of three branches. The executive is headed by the governor, currently Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n. The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Legislative Assembly, made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber; the Senate is headed by a president, currently Jos\u00e9 Luis Dalmau, while the House is headed by the speaker of the House, currently Tatito Hern\u00e1ndez. The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years, with the last election held in November 2024. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodr\u00edguez. Members of the judiciary are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.\nPuerto Rico is represented in the U.S. Congress by a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the resident commissioner, currently Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez Rivera. Current congressional rules have removed the commissioner's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole, but the commissioner can vote in committee.\nPuerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico. Residents of Puerto Rico, including other U.S. citizens, cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but can vote in primaries. Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state or Washington, D.C. can vote in presidential elections.\nPuerto Rico has eight senatorial districts, 40 representative districts, and 78 municipalities; there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government. Municipalities are subdivided into barrios. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan is the oldest, founded in 1521; the next earliest settlements are San Germ\u00e1n in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692. Increased settlement in the 18th century saw 30 more communities established, following 34 in the 19th century. Six were founded in the 20th century, the most recent being Florida in 1971.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nSince 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth, while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S. state. Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S. authority. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds about 5%.\nAfter 2007, other parties emerged on the island. The first, the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party was registered that same year. The party claims that it seeks to address the islands' problems from a status-neutral platform. But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four years later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the \"Movimiento Uni\u00f3n Soberanista\" (English: Sovereign Union Movement) and the \"Partido del Pueblo Trabajador\" (English: Working People's Party) but none obtained more than 1% of the vote.\nOther non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, the Socialist Workers Movement, and the Hostosian National Independence Movement.\nPolitical status.\nThe nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress, and the United Nations. Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.\nConstitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution. Laws enacted at the federal level in the U.S. apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".\nPuerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act. U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, hold primary elections in Puerto Rico to choose delegates to vote on the parties' presidential candidates. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and not a U.S. state, the U.S. Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.\nOnly fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft when it has been in effect.\nThough the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, residents of Puerto Rico, contrary to a popular misconception, do pay U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury), import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, etc. Residents pay federal payroll taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes. All federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and some others, such as Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments.\"\nIn 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury. Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income, and the island receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state. Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.\nPuerto Rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, individuals committing a crime can only be tried in federal or territorial court, otherwise it would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.\nIn 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations.\nMany federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, Social Security Administration, and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, serves as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as U.S. ambassadors to other nations.\nAdministrative divisions.\nUnlike the vast majority of U.S. states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, but has 78 municipalities or \"municipios\" as the secondary unit of administration; for U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents. Municipalities are subdivided into \"barrios\". Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991.\nForeign and intergovernmental relations.\nPuerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panam\u00e1.\nIt has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries, all Spanish-speaking, and within the U.S. itself, which now include Spain, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Washington, D.C., New York City and Florida, and has included in the past offices in Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State; most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the U.S. and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states. Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries, mainly from the Americas and Europe, with most located in San Juan.\nAt the local level, Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico, an executive department, headed by the secretary of state of Puerto Rico, who also serves as the unincorporated territory's lieutenant governor. It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner, manages all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the U.S. (including the federal government of the U.S., local and state governments of the U.S., and public or private entities in the U.S.).\nBoth entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington, D.C.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico's foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Department of State, the Agency for International Development, and others. The current secretary of state is Larry Seilhamer Rodr\u00edguez from the New Progressive Party, while the current director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Jennifer M. Stopiran also from the NPP and a member of the Republican Party of the U.S.\nThe resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the U.S. House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The current resident commissioner is Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a member of the New Progressive Party and the Republican Party, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.\nMany Puerto Ricans have served as U.S. ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States, mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.\nMilitary.\nAs it is an unincorporated U.S. territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S. as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S. as its commander-in-chief. Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\nThe commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico adjutant general, currently Major General Jos\u00e9 J. Reyes. The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole.\nU.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM's mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as U.S. Joint Forces Command. Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command.\nBoth the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan, the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300\u00a0million.\nA branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico \u2013 known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard \u2013 which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of different U.S. states, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard \u2013 known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard \u2013 which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states.\nAt different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico. The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques, the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas, Fort Allen in Juana Diaz, the Army's Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force's Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's Mu\u00f1iz Air National Guard Base in San Juan.\nThe former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army's small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Mu\u00f1iz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico \u2013 such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there.\nPuerto Ricans have participated in many U.S. military conflicts, including the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez (1746\u20131786). They continue to be disproportionately represented in present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The most notable example is the 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, nicknamed \"The Borinqueneers,\" from the original Ta\u00edno name of the island (Borinquen). The all-Puerto Rican regiment participated in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the war on terror; in 2014, it was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its heroism during the Korean War.\nA significant number of Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community is estimated to be 100,000, including retired personnel. Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces.\nLaw.\nThe insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems.\nPuerto Rico is the only current U.S. jurisdiction whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish. Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts, and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.\nTitle 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the U.S. Code to U.S. territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California. Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code.\nThe judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico, and someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, and vice versa, since Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does. The U.S. Supreme Court held in 2016 that such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy.\nCrime.\nThe homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014. Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related.\nIn 1992, the FBI made armed carjacking a federal crime and rates decreased per statistics, but as of 2019, the problem continued in municipalities like Guaynabo and others. From January 1, 2019, to March 14, 2019, thirty carjackings had occurred on the island.\nEconomy.\nPuerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index. According to World Bank, gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740. Puerto Rico's economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP. In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan.\nResponsibility for San Juan port inspections lies with PPQ. So high is the volume of cargo traffic that between 1984\u20132000 the San Juan PPQ station recorded 7.74% of all interceptions, #4 in the country, #2 for insects and #3 for pathogens. Most species are originally from South America or elsewhere in the Caribbean due to PR's position as an intermediary on the way to the mainland. This is one of the worst locations for cut flowers and other plant parts \u2013 both in terms of number of problems and diversity of species \u2013 for insects in plant parts in baggage, and for pathogens in plant parts in baggage and cargo. Pathogen interceptions were dramatically (17%) higher 1999\u20132000 than in 1985\u20131986.\nPuerto Rico's geography and political status are both determining factors for its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size; lack of natural resources and subsequent dependence on imports; and vulnerability to U.S. foreign policy and trading restrictions, particularly concerning its shipping industry.\nPuerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by four quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.\nAcademically, most of Puerto Rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history; its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power; as well as its highly inefficient local government which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time. Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204\u00a0billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5\u00a0billion.\nBy American standards, Puerto Rico is underdeveloped: It is poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state of the U.S., with 41% of its population below the poverty line. However, it has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America. Puerto Rico's main trading partners are the United States, Ireland, and Japan, with most products coming from East Asia, mainly China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Puerto Rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate.\nTourism.\nTourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months. The damage was estimated at $100\u00a0billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal. By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.\nA tourism campaign was launched by Discover Puerto Rico in 2018 intended to highlight the island's culture and history, branding it distinct, and different from other Caribbean destinations. In 2019, Discover Puerto Rico planned to continue that campaign.\nFiscal debt.\nIn early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion. The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.\nThe Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system. \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 impoverished U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"\nInitially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31. It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA. An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rossell\u00f3 government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.\nIn early August 2017, the island's financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218\u00a0million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50\u00a0billion in unfunded pension liabilities.\nPublic finances.\nPuerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8\u00a0billion with expenses at about $10.4\u00a0billion, creating a structural deficit of $775\u00a0million (about 7.9% of the budget). The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 25 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973.\nProjected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%\u2014or about $1.5\u00a0billion\u2014of Puerto Rico's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service. Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years.\nFor practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico, and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico's government-owned corporations, by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States, and by other funds.\nBoth budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget.\nThe critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget \u2013 a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.\nLosses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico's entire public debt today. Holistically, from FY2000\u2013FY2010 Puerto Rico's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant. This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9\u00a0billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.\nCost of living.\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade.\nStatistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24\u00a2 to 30\u00a2 range per kilowatt-hour, two to three times the national average, increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the continental United States\". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories.\nThe household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level. In 2011, median home value in Puerto Rico ranged from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value was $119,600.\nOne of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage. Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships. The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success.\nIn 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\". Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the U.S., particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the U.S. A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve &amp; Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the 1920 Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of living on Puerto Rico.\nTransportation.\nCities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways, expressways, and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department. The island's San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called ('Urban Train'). Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico's archipelago as well as (private mini buses).\nPuerto Rico has three international airports, the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport in Carolina, Mercedita International Airport in Ponce, and the Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez International Airport in Aguadilla, and 27 local airports. The Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport is the largest aerial transportation hub in the Caribbean.\nPuerto Rico has nine ports in different cities across the main island. The San Juan Port is the largest in Puerto Rico, and the busiest port in the Caribbean and the 10th busiest in the United States in terms of commercial activity and cargo movement, respectively. The second largest port is the Port of the Americas in Ponce, currently under expansion to increase cargo capacity to 1.5 million twenty-foot containers (TEUs) per year.\nUtilities.\nElectricity.\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, )\u2014is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power transmission, and power distribution in Puerto Rico. PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018. The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is run by an executive director.\nOn July 20, 2018, Puerto Rico Law 120-2018 () was signed. This law authorized PREPA to sell infrastructure and services to other providers. As a result, a contract was signed on June 22, 2020, making LUMA Energy the new operator of the energy distribution and transmission infrastructure, as well as other areas of PREPA's operations, in effect partially privatizing the Puerto Rican power grid. The takeover was set for June 1, 2021, amidst protests and uncertainty from the point of view of the general public and the former-PREPA workers and union members.\nWater and sewage.\nSimilarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, )\u2014is a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality, management, and supply in Puerto Rico. It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly. Its existence is designated by Law No. 40 of May 1, 1945, including the corresponding amendments.\nTelecommunications.\nTelecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As of 2007[ [update]], there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations and roughly 1\u00a0million TV sets on the island. Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island. Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes, which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letter before the number. The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra) and KP5/NP5/WP5 (Desecheo Island). Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them. They have been a key element in disaster relief.\nDemographics.\nThe population of Puerto Rico reflects influences from initial Amerindian settlement, European colonization, slavery, economic migration, and the archipelago's status as unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans are characterized by a high degree of ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as a long history of intermarriage and acculturation among different demographics; racial and ethnic identity is subsequently complex and often nebulous, shaped by the broader attitudes and policies of the Spanish colonial period, 20th century American racial politics, and modern trends in cultural and identity in the 21st century United States.\nAccording to the most recent 2020 United States census, Puerto Rico had 3,285,874 residents, an 11.8% decrease since 2010. The commonwealth's population peaked in 2000, when it was 3,808,610, before declining (for the first time in census history) to 3,725,789 in 2010. Emigration due to economic difficulties and natural disasters, coupled with a low birth rate, have resulted in continued population decline into the 21st century.\nPopulation distribution.\nThe most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan, with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census. Other major cities include Bayam\u00f3n, Carolina, Ponce, and Caguas. Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan's metropolitan area, while the other two are located in the south (Ponce) and west (Mayag\u00fcez) of the island.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPopulation makeup.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2020, Hispanic or Latinos made up 98.9 percent of the population, of which 95.5 percent were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins; only 1.1 percent of the population was non-Hispanic. Fewer than one-fifth of people (17.1 percent) identified as \"White\", a decline of almost 80 percent; by contrast, nearly half of Puerto Ricans (49.8 percent) reported being multiracial\u2014compared to just 3 percent in 2010\u2014while roughly one-quarter chose \"some other race alone\" (25.5 percent).\nCensuses of Puerto Rico were completed by Spain in 1765, 1775, 1800, 1815, 1832, 1846 and 1857, yet some of the data remained untabulated and were considered reliable in a 1943 report by Irene Barnes Taeuber, an American demographer at the Office of Population Research at Princeton University.\nContinuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 to almost a million by the end of the 19th century. A census conducted by royal decree on September 30, 1858, gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were free colored; 300,430 were white; and 41,736 were slaves. A census in 1887 found a population of around 800,000, of which 320,000 were black.\nDuring the 19th century, hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia, Asturias, Galicia and the Balearic Islands; they were later joined by numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America. There were also smaller numbers of settlers from outside Spain, including from Corsica, France, Lebanon, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Italy; this immigration from non-Hispanic countries was largely the result of the \"Real C\u00e9dula de Gracias de 1815\" (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815), which provided European Catholics with land allotments in the sparsely inhabited interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church.\nBetween 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico, according to which most Puerto Ricans identified as white and Latino and few identified as black or some other race.\nAlthough less than one percent of the population identifies as Indigenous, a large proportion of Puerto Ricans have Native ancestry: A 2003 study by the University of Puerto Rico, which took genetic samples from 800 randomly selected subjects throughout the island, found that 61.1 percent of those surveyed had mitochondrial DNA of Indigenous origin; additionally, 26.4 percent had African markers and 12.5 percent showed European descent. The study reportedly resulted in a resurgence of Indigenous and Ta\u00edno identity among Puerto Ricans; in the 2010 census, 19,839 respondents identified as \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\", an increase of almost 49 percent from 2000 count.\nImmigration and emigration.\nThe vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America, over half come from the Dominican Republic. Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico's population. Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Cuba, use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S. mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Spain, and Jamaica. Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans. In fact, non-Hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S. mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S. citizens come from the U.S. Virgin Islands. There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in 'circular migration'. Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S. and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area.\nEmigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War\u00a0II, poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the northeastern states and nearby Florida. This trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \"circular migration\", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration. The impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, combined with the unincorporated territory's worsening economy, led to its greatest population decline since the U.S. acquired the archipelago.\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. census, the number of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico in the U.S. is almost twice as many as those living in Puerto Rico. As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico's economy.\nBased on July 1, 2019, estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 532,095 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.\nLanguages.\nThe official languages of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico are Spanish and English. In 2015, the Puerto Rican legislature declared Spanish to be the first official language and English the second official language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law. However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.\nOut of people aged five and older, 94.3% speak only Spanish at home, 5.5% speak English, and 0.2% speak other languages. A Pew Research survey indicated an adult literacy rate of 90.4% in 2012 based on data from the United Nations.\nIn Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English. English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language.\nThe Spanish language of Puerto Rico has evolved into a variety with\nmany idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from Spanish spoken elsewhere. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Ta\u00edno words as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands. Ta\u00edno loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChristianity is the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. Catholicism was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the prevailing faith. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius\u00a0II in 1511. In 1512, priests were established for the parochial churches. By 1759, there was a priest for each church. One Pope, John Paul\u00a0II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza.\nProtestantism, which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, reemerged under U.S. rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872. It was the first non-Catholic church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.\nSources differ on the denominational breakdown of the population. Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 percent Catholic, 28 percent Pentecostal, and 18 percent independent churches; the total number of Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people, or 46 percent of the population. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants in 1997, finding a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal; however, it estimated that Puerto Rico would become 75 percent evangelical by 2022.\nA 2014 Pew Research report found that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic, while 33% were Protestant and 8% were unaffiliated; these figures are shared by the CIA World Factbook, which further notes that Protestants are \"largely Pentecostal\", while other religions make up 2 percent and atheists only one percent. Pew Research from the year before, which surveyed Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States, found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion. By contrast, an Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent\" of Puerto Ricans identified as Catholic. \nThere is a small Eastern Orthodox community, centered mostly around two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the territory: the Russian Orthodox mission of Saint John Climacus in San German and the Saint George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Carolina; both have services in English and Spanish. There is a small Syriac Orthodox church in Aguada and an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Utuado, Puerto Rico, which represents the only Oriental Orthodox denominations in the Island. The Roman Catholic Church has a Greek Catholic Church in Trujillo Alto as well, Orthodox Christians accounted for one percent of the population in 2010. In 2017, the first Eastern Catholic Church was established in Puerto Rico. In 2023, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a temple in San Juan, and reported having a membership of approximately 23,000 in the commonwealth. In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah's Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.\nPuerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, at roughly 3,000, and is the only Caribbean island where Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements are all represented. The island's first synagogue, \"Sha'are Zedeck,\" was established in 1952 by American Jews.\nIn 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population. Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in R\u00edo Piedras and Caguas; most Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent. There is also a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community.\nBuddhism in Puerto Rico is represented with Nichiren, Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, with the New York Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for example having a branch in San Juan. There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico. An ISKCON temple in Gurabo is devoted to Krishna, with two preaching centers in the San Juan metropolitan area.\nTa\u00edno religious practices have been rediscovered and reinvented to some degree by a handful of advocates. Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have persisted, as African slaves maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santer\u00eda or If\u00e1, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe. Some Indigenous and African practices and beliefs are syncretized with Christianity. In 1940, Juanita Garc\u00eda Peraza founded the Mita Congregation, the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.\nEducation.\nThe first school in Puerto Rico was the (Grammar School). It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.\nEducation in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels\u2014Primary (elementary school grades 1\u20136), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7\u201312), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females. According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher.\nInstruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. As of 2010[ [update]], there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.\nThe largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the which operates the , Metropolitan University and . Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University, the Pontifical Catholic University, , and the . Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA-approved Law Schools.\nHealth.\nIn 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico. As of 2021, average life expectancy is approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010.\n (Puerto Rico Health Reform) \u2013 locally referred to as ('The Reform') \u2013 is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished, by means of contracting private health insurance companies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration.\nCulture.\nModern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German and Irish), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans. Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades.\nFrom the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On March 12, 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years earlier.\nMuch of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.\nPuerto Rico has many symbols, but only the Flor de Maga has been made official by the Government of Puerto Rico. Other popular, traditional, or unofficial symbols of Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican spindalis, the kapok tree, the coqu\u00ed frog, the j\u00edbaro, the Ta\u00edno Indian, and Cerro Las Tetas with its j\u00edbaro culture monument.\nArchitecture.\nThe architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions.\nOld San Juan is one of the two \"barrios\", in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of R\u00edo Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air caf\u00e9s, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San Jos\u00e9 Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de P\u00e1rvulos, built in 1865.\nThe oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro, Fort San Crist\u00f3bal, and El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site.\nDuring the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested in the following decades and into the present. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan\". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the \"Hotel El Convento\" in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias.\nPonce Creole is a unique architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of France, Spain and the Caribbean vernacular to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico's Caribbean Sea coast. It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian.\nArts.\nPuerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art, called \"santos\" evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert Indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity. \"Santos\" depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. \"Santos\" vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.\nAlso popular, \"caretas\" or \"vejigantes\" are masks worn during carnivals. Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican \"caretas\" always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for \"caretas\" but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns.\nLiterature.\nPuerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status. Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write. Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.\nSome of Puerto Rico's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero. Among these was Manuel A. Alonso, the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published , a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos wrote in 1863, which used Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas as a springboard to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change.\nIn the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of \"The Historical Library of Puerto Rico\". Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work \"The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary\" is valuable in understanding the way the Ta\u00ednos lived. Manuel Zeno Gand\u00eda in 1894 wrote and talked about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Antonio S. Pedreira, described in his work the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion.\nWith the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement. Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish, and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, essayists, and screenwriters. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega (Omaha Bigelow), Miguel Pi\u00f1ero (Short Eyes), Piri Thomas (Down These Mean Streets), Giannina Braschi (Yo-Yo Boing!), Rosario Ferrer (Eccentric Neighborhoods). and Esmeralda Santiago (\"When I was Puerto Rican).\"\nMedia.\nThe mass media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations, television stations and newspapers, the majority of which are conducted in Spanish. There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service. Newspapers with daily distribution are , and , , and . is distributed free of charge, as are and .\nNewspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include , , , , and , among others. Several television channels provide local content in the island. These include WIPR-TV, , Univision affiliate WLII-DT (), WAPA-TV, and WKAQ-TV.\nMusic.\nThe music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from Indigenous genres like bomba, plena, aguinaldo, danza and the popular salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton and Latin trap, popular with the new generation of musicians and popularized across the world by Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny.\nPuerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B.\nIn the realm of classical music, the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarm\u00f3nica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world.\nWith respect to opera, the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated, that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. In 1907, Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera \u2013 when he participated in a performance of \"Pagliacci\" by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy.\nMusical artists with great international success include Menudo, Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny and others.\nPhilately.\nPuerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S. postal stamps. Insular Territories were commemorated in 1937, the third stamp honored Puerto Rico featuring 'La Fortaleza', the Spanish Governor's Palace. The first free election for governor of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was honored on April 27, 1949, at San Juan, Puerto Rico. 'Inauguration' on the 3-cent stamp refers to the election of Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico. San Juan, Puerto Rico was commemorated with an 8-cent stamp on its 450th anniversary issued September 12, 1971, featuring a sentry box from Castillo San Felipe del Morro. In the \"Flags of our nation series\" 2008\u20132012, of the fifty-five, five territorial flags were featured. Forever stamps included the Puerto Rico Flag illustrated by a bird issued 2011.\nCuisine.\nPuerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the Native Ta\u00ednos. Basic ingredients include grains and legumes, herbs and spices, starchy tropical tubers, vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits. Main dishes include \"mofongo\", \"arroz con gandules\", \"pasteles\", and pig roast (or lech\u00f3n). Beverages include \"mav\u00ed\" and \"pi\u00f1a colada\". Desserts include flan, \"arroz con dulce\" (sweet rice pudding), \"piraguas\", \"brazo gitanos\", \"tembleque\", \"polvorones\", and \"dulce de leche\".\nSports.\nBaseball was one of the first sports to gain widespread popularity in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Baseball League serves as the only active professional league, operating as a winter league. No Major League Baseball franchise or affiliate plays in Puerto Rico; however, San Juan hosted the Montreal Expos for several series in 2003 and 2004 before they moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals.\nThe Puerto Rico national baseball team has participated in the World Cup of Baseball winning one gold (1951), four silver and four bronze medals, the Caribbean Series (winning fourteen times) and the World Baseball Classic. In March 2006, San Juan's Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted the opening round as well as the second round of the newly formed World Baseball Classic. Puerto Rican baseball players include Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar, enshrined in 1973, 1999, and 2011 respectively.\nBoxing, basketball, and volleyball are considered popular sports as well. Wilfredo G\u00f3mez and McWilliams Arroyo have won their respective divisions at the World Amateur Boxing Championships. Other medalists include Jos\u00e9 Pedraza, who holds a silver medal, and three boxers who finished in third place, Jos\u00e9 Luis Vell\u00f3n, Nelson Dieppa and McJoe Arroyo. In the professional circuit, Puerto Rico has the third-most boxing world champions and it is the global leader in champions per capita. These include Miguel Cotto, F\u00e9lix Trinidad, Wilfred Ben\u00edtez and G\u00f3mez among others.\nThe Puerto Rico national basketball team joined the International Basketball Federation in 1957. Since then, it has won more than 30 medals in international competitions, including gold in three FIBA Americas Championships and the 1994 Goodwill Games August 8, 2004, became a landmark date for the team when it became the first team to defeat the United States in an Olympic tournament since the integration of National Basketball Association players. Winning the inaugural game with scores of 92\u201373 as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics organized in Athens, Greece. Baloncesto Superior Nacional acts as the top-level professional basketball league in Puerto Rico and has experienced success since its beginning in 1930.\nPuerto Rico is also a member of FIFA and CONCACAF. In 2008, the archipelago's first unified league, the Puerto Rico Soccer League, was established.\nOther sports include professional wrestling and road running. The World Wrestling Council and International Wrestling Association are the largest wrestling promotions in the main island. The World's Best 10K, held annually in San Juan, has been ranked among the 20 most competitive races globally. The \"Puerto Rico All Stars\" team, which has won twelve world championships in unicycle basketball.\nOrganized streetball has gathered some exposition, with teams like \"Puerto Rico Street Ball\" competing against established organizations including the Capitanes de Arecibo and AND1's Mixtape Tour Team. Six years after the first visit, AND1 returned as part of their renamed Live Tour, losing to the Puerto Rico Streetballers. Consequently, practitioners of this style have earned participation in international teams, including Orlando \"El Gato\" Mel\u00e9ndez, who became the first Puerto Rican born athlete to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.\nPuerto Rico has representation in all international competitions including the Summer and Winter Olympics, the Pan American Games, the Caribbean World Series, and the Central American and Caribbean Games. Puerto Rico hosted the Pan Am Games in 1979 (officially in San Juan), and The Central American and Caribbean Games were hosted in 1993 in Ponce and in 2010 in Mayag\u00fcez.\nPuerto Rican athletes have won ten medals in Olympic competition (two gold, two silver, six bronze), the first one in 1948 by boxer Juan Evangelista Venegas. Monica Puig won the first gold medal for Puerto Rico in the Olympic Games by winning the Women's Tennis singles title in Rio 2016.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "23047", "revid": "715696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23047", "title": "Pseudoscience", "text": "Unscientific claims presented as scientific\nPseudoscience consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that claim to be scientific or factual but are inherently incompatible with the scientific method. Pseudoscience is often characterized by contradictory, exaggerated or unfalsifiable claims; reliance on confirmation bias rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; absence of systematic practices when developing hypotheses; and continued adherence long after the pseudoscientific hypotheses have been experimentally discredited. It is not the same as junk science.\nThe demarcation between science and pseudoscience has scientific, philosophical, and political implications. Philosophers debate the nature of science and the general criteria for drawing the line between scientific theories and pseudoscientific beliefs, but there is widespread agreement \"that creationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing, ufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian catastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences.\" There are implications for health care, the use of expert testimony, and weighing environmental policies. Recent empirical research has shown that individuals who indulge in pseudoscientific beliefs generally show lower evidential criteria, meaning they often require significantly less evidence before coming to conclusions. This can be coined as a 'jump-to-conclusions' bias that can increase the spread of pseudoscientific beliefs. Addressing pseudoscience is part of science education and developing scientific literacy.\nPseudoscience can have dangerous effects. For example, pseudoscientific anti-vaccine activism and promotion of homeopathic remedies as alternative disease treatments can result in people forgoing important medical treatments with demonstrable health benefits, leading to ill-health and deaths. Furthermore, people who refuse legitimate medical treatments for contagious diseases may put others at risk. Pseudoscientific theories about racial and ethnic classifications have led to racism and genocide.\nThe term \"pseudoscience\" is often considered pejorative, particularly by its purveyors, because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively. Therefore, practitioners and advocates of pseudoscience frequently dispute the characterization.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"pseudoscience\" is derived from the Greek root \"pseudo\" meaning \"false\" and the English word \"science\", from the Latin word \"scientia\", meaning \"knowledge\". Although the term has been in use since at least the late 18th century (e.g., in 1796 by James Pettit Andrews in reference to alchemy), the concept of pseudoscience as distinct from real or proper science seems to have become more widespread during the mid-19th century. Among the earliest uses of \"pseudo-science\" was in an 1844 article in the \"Northern Journal of Medicine\", issue 387:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles.\nAn earlier use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist Fran\u00e7ois Magendie, that refers to phrenology as \"a pseudo-science of the present day\". During the 20th century, the word was used pejoratively to describe explanations of phenomena which were claimed to be scientific, but which were not in fact supported by reliable experimental evidence.\nDismissing the separate issue of intentional fraud\u00a0\u2013 such as the Fox sisters' \"rappings\" in the 1850s\u00a0\u2013 the pejorative label pseudoscience distinguishes the scientific 'us', at one extreme, from the pseudo-scientific 'them', at the other, and asserts that 'our' beliefs, practices, theories, etc., by contrast with that of 'the others', are scientific. There are four criteria:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) the 'pseudoscientific' group asserts that its beliefs, practices, theories, etc., are 'scientific';\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) the 'pseudoscientific' group claims that its allegedly established facts are justified true beliefs;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) the 'pseudoscientific' group asserts that its 'established facts' have been justified by genuine, rigorous, scientific method; and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d) this assertion is false or deceptive: \"it is not simply that subsequent evidence overturns established conclusions, but rather that the conclusions were never warranted in the first place\"\nFrom time to time, however, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner in response to a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and cultural setting.\nRelationship to science.\nPseudoscience is differentiated from science because\u00a0\u2013 although it usually claims to be science\u00a0\u2013 pseudoscience does not adhere to scientific standards, such as the scientific method, falsifiability of claims, and Mertonian norms.\nScientific method.\nA number of basic principles are accepted by scientists as standards for determining whether a body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be reproducible and verified by other researchers. These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a hypothesis or theory related to given phenomena is valid and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and bias to be controlled for or eliminated through randomization, fair sampling procedures, blinding of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for peer review, allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of significance, confidence, and error are also important tools for the scientific method.\nFalsifiability.\nDuring the mid-20th century, the philosopher Karl Popper emphasized the criterion of falsifiability to distinguish science from non-science. Statements, hypotheses, or theories have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility that they can be proven false, that is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument that negates them. Popper used astrology and psychoanalysis as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's theory of relativity as an example of science. He subdivided non-science into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other.\nAnother example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in Carl Sagan's publication \"The Demon-Haunted World\" when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\", once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of scientific inquiry.\nMertonian norms.\nDuring 1942, Robert K. Merton identified a set of five \"norms\" which characterize real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be non-science. His norms were:\nRefusal to acknowledge problems.\nIn 1978, Paul Thagard proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory. In 1983, Mario Bunge suggested the categories of \"belief fields\" and \"research fields\" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method. The 2018 book about scientific skepticism by Steven Novella, et al. \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" lists hostility to criticism as one of the major features of pseudoscience.\nCriticism of the term.\nLarry Laudan has suggested pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly used to describe human emotions: \"If we would stand up and be counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us\". Likewise, Richard McNally states, \"The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites\" and \"When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?\"\nAlternative definition.\nFor philosophers Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome R. Ravetz \"pseudo-science may be defined as one where the uncertainty of its inputs must be suppressed, lest they render its outputs totally indeterminate\". The definition, in the book \"Uncertainty and Quality in Science for Policy\", alludes to the loss of craft skills in handling quantitative information, and to the bad practice of achieving precision in prediction (inference) only at the expenses of ignoring uncertainty in the input which was used to formulate the prediction. This use of the term is common among practitioners of post-normal science. Understood in this way, pseudoscience can be fought using good practices to assess uncertainty in quantitative information, such as NUSAP and\u00a0\u2013 in the case of mathematical modelling\u00a0\u2013 sensitivity auditing.\nHistory.\nThe history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A pseudoscience is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to be properly called such.\nDistinguishing between proper science and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One proposal for demarcation between the two is the falsification criterion, attributed most notably to the philosopher Karl Popper. In the history of science and the history of pseudoscience it can be especially difficult to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this transformation is the science of chemistry, which traces its origins to the pseudoscientific or pre-scientific study of alchemy.\nThe vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of science. Some modern pseudosciences, such as astrology and acupuncture, originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as Lysenkoism, or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. Examples of this ideological process are creation science and intelligent design, which were developed in response to the scientific theory of evolution.\nIndicators of possible pseudoscience.\nA topic, practice, or body of knowledge might reasonably be termed pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms.\nPrevalence of pseudoscientific beliefs.\nCountries.\nThe Ministry of AYUSH in the Government of India is purposed with developing education, research and propagation of indigenous alternative medicine systems in India. The ministry has faced significant criticism for funding systems that lack biological plausibility and are either untested or conclusively proven as ineffective. Quality of research has been poor, and drugs have been launched without any rigorous pharmacological studies and meaningful clinical trials on Ayurveda or other alternative healthcare systems. There is no credible efficacy or scientific basis of any of these forms of treatment.\nIn his book \"The Demon-Haunted World\", Carl Sagan discusses the government of China and the Chinese Communist Party's concern about Western pseudoscience developments and certain ancient Chinese practices in China. He sees pseudoscience occurring in the United States as part of a worldwide trend and suggests its causes, dangers, diagnosis and treatment may be universal.\nA large percentage of the United States population lacks scientific literacy, not adequately understanding scientific principles and method. In the \"Journal of College Science Teaching\", Art Hobson writes, \"Pseudoscientific beliefs are surprisingly widespread in our culture even among public school science teachers and newspaper editors, and are closely related to scientific illiteracy.\" However, a 10,000-student study in the same journal concluded there was no strong correlation between science knowledge and belief in pseudoscience.\nDuring 2006, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) issued an executive summary of a paper on science and engineering which briefly discussed the prevalence of pseudoscience in modern times. It said, \"belief in pseudoscience is widespread\" and, referencing a Gallup Poll, stated that belief in the 10 commonly believed examples of paranormal phenomena listed in the poll were \"pseudoscientific beliefs\". The items were \"extrasensory perception (ESP), that houses can be haunted, ghosts, telepathy, clairvoyance, astrology, that people can mentally communicate with the dead, witches, reincarnation, and channelling\". Such beliefs in pseudoscience represent a lack of knowledge of how science works. The scientific community may attempt to communicate information about science out of concern for the public's susceptibility to unproven claims. The NSF stated that pseudoscientific beliefs in the U.S. became more widespread during the 1990s, peaked about 2001, and then decreased slightly since with pseudoscientific beliefs remaining common. According to the NSF report, there is a lack of knowledge of pseudoscientific issues in society and pseudoscientific practices are commonly followed. Surveys indicate about a third of adult Americans consider astrology to be scientific.\nIn Russia, in the late 20th and early 21st century, significant budgetary funds were spent on programs for the experimental study of \"torsion fields\", the extraction of energy from granite, the study of \"cold nuclear fusion\", and astrological and extrasensory \"research\" by the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the State Duma (see ). In 2006, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation published an article in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, where among the priority areas for the development of the Russian energy sector, the task of extracting energy from a vacuum was in the first place. The project was adopted as a United Russia party project; in the version submitted to the government, the program budget for 2010\u20132017 exceeded $14 billion.\nRacism.\nThere have been many connections between pseudoscientific writers and researchers and their anti-semitic, racist and neo-Nazi backgrounds. They often use pseudoscience to reinforce their beliefs. One of the most predominant pseudoscientific writers is Frank Collin, a self-proclaimed Nazi who goes by Frank Joseph in his writings. The majority of his works include the topics of Atlantis, extraterrestrial encounters, and Lemuria as well as other ancient civilizations, often with white supremacist undertones. For example, he posited that European peoples migrated to North America before Columbus, and that all Native American civilizations were initiated by descendants of white people.\nThe Alt-Right using pseudoscience to base their ideologies on is not a new issue. The entire foundation of anti-semitism is based on pseudoscience, or scientific racism. In an article from \"Newsweek\" by Sander Gilman, Gilman describes the pseudoscience community's anti-semitic views. \"Jews as they appear in this world of pseudoscience are an invented group of ill, stupid or stupidly smart people who use science to their own nefarious ends. Other groups, too, are painted similarly in 'race science', as it used to call itself: African-Americans, the Irish, the Chinese and, well, any and all groups that you want to prove inferior to yourself\". Neo-Nazis and white supremacist often try to support their claims with studies that \"prove\" that their claims are more than just harmful stereotypes. For example Bret Stephens published a column in \"The New York Times\" where he claimed that Ashkenazi Jews had the highest IQ among any ethnic group. However, the scientific methodology and conclusions reached by the article Stephens cited has been called into question repeatedly since its publication. It has been found that at least one of that study's authors has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist.\nThe journal \"Nature\" has published a number of editorials in the last few years warning researchers about extremists looking to abuse their work, particularly population geneticists and those working with ancient DNA. One article in \"Nature\", titled \"Racism in Science: The Taint That Lingers\" notes that early-twentieth-century eugenic pseudoscience has been used to influence public policy, such as the Immigration Act of 1924 in the United States, which sought to prevent immigration from Asia and parts of Europe.\nExplanations.\nIn a 1981 report Singer and Benassi wrote that pseudoscientific beliefs have their origin from at least four sources:\nA 1990 study by Eve and Dunn supported the findings of Singer and Benassi and found pseudoscientific belief being promoted by high school life science and biology teachers.\nPsychology.\nThe psychology of pseudoscience attempts to explore and analyze pseudoscientific thinking by means of thorough clarification on making the distinction of what is considered scientific vs. pseudoscientific. The human proclivity for seeking confirmation rather than refutation (confirmation bias), the tendency to hold comforting beliefs, and the tendency to overgeneralize have been proposed as reasons for pseudoscientific thinking. According to Beyerstein, humans are prone to associations based on resemblances only, and often prone to misattribution in cause-effect thinking.\nMichael Shermer's theory of belief-dependent realism is driven by the idea that the brain is essentially a \"belief engine\" which scans data perceived by the senses and looks for patterns and meaning. There is also the tendency for the brain to create cognitive biases, as a result of inferences and assumptions made without logic and based on instinct \u2013 usually resulting in patterns in cognition. These tendencies of patternicity and agenticity are also driven \"by a meta-bias called the bias blind spot, or the tendency to recognize the power of cognitive biases in other people but to be blind to their influence on our own beliefs\".\nLindeman states that social motives (i.e., \"to comprehend self and the world, to have a sense of control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem\") are often \"more easily\" fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information. Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially. Operating within a different set of rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if the explanation is \"personally functional, satisfying and sufficient\", offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.\nAnyone searching for psychological help that is based in science should seek a licensed therapist whose techniques are not based in pseudoscience. Hupp and Santa Maria provide a complete explanation of what that person should look for.\nEducation and scientific literacy.\nThere is a trend to believe in pseudoscience more than scientific evidence. Some people believe the prevalence of pseudoscientific beliefs is due to widespread scientific illiteracy. Individuals lacking scientific literacy are more susceptible to wishful thinking, since they are likely to turn to immediate gratification powered by System 1, our default operating system which requires little to no effort. This system encourages one to accept the conclusions they believe, and reject the ones they do not. Further analysis of complex pseudoscientific phenomena require System 2, which follows rules, compares objects along multiple dimensions and weighs options. These two systems have several other differences which are further discussed in the dual-process theory. The scientific and secular systems of morality and meaning are generally unsatisfying to most people. Humans are, by nature, a forward-minded species pursuing greater avenues of happiness and satisfaction, but we are all too frequently willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life.\nPsychology has much to discuss about pseudoscience thinking, as it is the illusory perceptions of causality and effectiveness of numerous individuals that needs to be illuminated. Research suggests that illusionary thinking happens in most people when exposed to certain circumstances such as reading a book, an advertisement or the testimony of others are the basis of pseudoscience beliefs. It is assumed that illusions are not unusual, and given the right conditions, illusions are able to occur systematically even in normal emotional situations. One of the things pseudoscience believers quibble most about is that academic science usually treats them as fools. Minimizing these illusions in the real world is not simple. To this aim, designing evidence-based educational programs can be effective to help people identify and reduce their own illusions.\nBoundaries with science.\nClassification.\nPhilosophers classify types of knowledge. In English, the word \"science\" is used to indicate specifically the natural sciences and related fields, which are called the social sciences. Different philosophers of science may disagree on the exact limits \u2013 for example, is mathematics a formal science that is closer to the empirical ones, or is pure mathematics closer to the philosophical study of logic and therefore not a science? \u2013 but all agree that all of the ideas that are not scientific are non-scientific. The large category of non-science includes all matters outside the natural and social sciences, such as the study of history, metaphysics, religion, art, and the humanities. Dividing the category again, unscientific claims are a subset of the large category of non-scientific claims. This category specifically includes all matters that are directly opposed to good science. Un-science includes both \"bad science\" (such as an error made in a good-faith attempt at learning something about the natural world) and pseudoscience. Thus pseudoscience is a subset of un-science, and un-science, in turn, is subset of non-science.\nScience is also distinguishable from revelation, theology, or spirituality in that it offers insight into the physical world obtained by empirical research and testing. The most notable disputes concern the evolution of living organisms, the idea of common descent, the geologic history of the Earth, the formation of the Solar System, and the origin of the universe. Systems of belief that derive from divine or inspired knowledge are not considered pseudoscience if they do not claim either to be scientific or to overturn well-established science. Moreover, some specific religious claims, such as the power of intercessory prayer to heal the sick, although they may be based on untestable beliefs, can be tested by the scientific method.\nSome statements and common beliefs of popular science may not meet the criteria of science. \"Pop\" science may blur the divide between science and pseudoscience among the general public, and may also involve science fiction. Indeed, pop science is disseminated to, and can also easily emanate from, persons not accountable to scientific methodology and expert peer review.\nIf claims of a given field can be tested experimentally and standards are upheld, it is not pseudoscience, regardless of how odd, astonishing, or counterintuitive those claims are. If claims made are inconsistent with existing experimental results or established theory, but the method is sound, caution should be used, since science consists of testing hypotheses which may turn out to be false. In such a case, the work may be better described as ideas that are \"not yet generally accepted\". \"Protoscience\" is a term sometimes used to describe a hypothesis that has not yet been tested adequately by the scientific method, but which is otherwise consistent with existing science or which, where inconsistent, offers reasonable account of the inconsistency. It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.\nPhilosophy.\nKarl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from metaphysics (such as the philosophical question of what existence means), by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the empirical method, which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation. He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had empirical evidence based on observation, on horoscopes and biographies, it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards. Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.\nTo demonstrate this point, Popper gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler's theories: \"that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.\" From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from psychological repression, probably originating from an Oedipus complex, whereas the second man had attained sublimation. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of inferiority and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness. In contrast, Popper gave the example of Einstein's gravitational theory, which predicted \"light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.\" Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, \"If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.\" Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or testability.\nPaul R. Thagard used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them. First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since Ptolemy. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the precession of equinoxes in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of personality and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as witchcraft and pyramidology, while leaving physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, and archaeology in the realm of science.\nIn the philosophy and history of science, Imre Lakatos stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. His distinctive historical analysis of scientific methodology based on research programmes suggests: \"scientists regard the successful theoretical prediction of stunning novel facts\u00a0\u2013 such as the return of Halley's comet or the gravitational bending of light rays\u00a0\u2013 as what demarcates good scientific theories from pseudo-scientific and degenerate theories, and in spite of all scientific theories being forever confronted by 'an ocean of counterexamples'\". Lakatos offers a \"novel fallibilist analysis of the development of Newton's celestial dynamics, [his] favourite historical example of his methodology\" and argues in light of this historical turn, that his account answers for certain inadequacies in those of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. \"Nonetheless, Lakatos did recognize the force of Kuhn's historical criticism of Popper\u00a0\u2013 all important theories have been surrounded by an 'ocean of anomalies', which on a falsificationist view would require the rejection of the theory outright...Lakatos sought to reconcile the rationalism of Popperian falsificationism with what seemed to be its own refutation by history\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many philosophers have tried to solve the problem of demarcation in the following terms: a statement constitutes knowledge if sufficiently many people believe it sufficiently strongly. But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.\u2014\u200a\nThe boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and scientists, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method. The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history. According to Lakatos, the typical descriptive unit of great scientific achievements is not an isolated hypothesis but \"a powerful problem-solving machinery, which, with the help of sophisticated mathematical techniques, digests anomalies and even turns them into positive evidence\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Popper, pseudoscience uses induction to generate theories, and only performs experiments to seek to verify them. To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.\u2014\u200a Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Feyerabend] regards Lakatos's view as being closet anarchism disguised as methodological rationalism. Feyerabend's claim was not that standard methodological rules should never be obeyed, but rather that sometimes progress is made by abandoning them. In the absence of a generally accepted rule, there is a need for alternative methods of persuasion. According to Feyerabend, Galileo employed stylistic and rhetorical techniques to convince his reader, while he also wrote in Italian rather than Latin and directed his arguments to those already temperamentally inclined to accept them.\u2014\u200a\nPolitics, health, and education.\nPolitical implications.\nThe demarcation problem between science and pseudoscience brings up debate in the realms of science, philosophy and politics. Imre Lakatos, for instance, points out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at one point declared that Mendelian genetics was pseudoscientific and had its advocates, including well-established scientists such as Nikolai Vavilov, sent to a Gulag and that the \"liberal Establishment of the West\" denies freedom of speech to topics it regards as pseudoscience, particularly where they run up against social mores.\nSomething becomes pseudoscientific when science cannot be separated from ideology, scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite distort the facts of science for short-term political gain, or when powerful individuals of the public conflate causation and cofactors by clever wordplay. These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of science in society.\nHealth and education implications.\nDistinguishing science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education. Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive and dangerous to patients and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers and the public as to what treatments are appropriate. Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making bad decisions in selecting curricula.\nThe extent to which students acquire a range of social and cognitive thinking skills related to the proper usage of science and technology determines whether they are scientifically literate. Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of science and technology, a fast-changing culture and a knowledge-driven era. A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare. Scientific literacy, which allows a person to distinguish science from pseudosciences such as astrology, is among the attributes that enable students to adapt to the changing world. Its characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conducting investigations, or developing projects.\nAlan J. Friedman mentions why most scientists avoid educating about pseudoscience, including that paying undue attention to pseudoscience could dignify it.\nOn the other hand, Robert L. Park emphasizes how pseudoscience can be a threat to society and considers that scientists have a responsibility to teach how to distinguish science from pseudoscience.\nPseudosciences such as homeopathy, even if generally benign, are used by charlatans. This poses a serious issue because it enables incompetent practitioners to administer health care. True-believing zealots may pose a more serious threat than typical con men because of their delusion to homeopathy's ideology. Irrational health care is not harmless and it is careless to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine.\nOn 8 December 2016, journalist Michael V. LeVine pointed out the dangers posed by the \"Natural News\" website: \"Snake-oil salesmen have pushed false cures since the dawn of medicine, and now websites like \"Natural News\" flood social media with dangerous anti-pharmaceutical, anti-vaccination and anti-GMO pseudoscience that puts millions at risk of contracting preventable illnesses.\"\nThe anti-vaccine movement has persuaded large numbers of parents not to vaccinate their children, citing pseudoscientific research that links childhood vaccines with the onset of autism. These include the study by Andrew Wakefield, which claimed that a combination of gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression, which are often seen in children with ASD, occurred within two weeks of receiving vaccines. The study was eventually retracted by its publisher, and Wakefield was stripped of his license to practice medicine.\nAlkaline water is water that has a pH of higher than 7, purported to host numerous health benefits, with no empirical backing. A practitioner known as Robert O. Young who promoted alkaline water and an \"Alkaline diet\" was sent to jail for 3 years in 2017 for practicing medicine without a license.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
