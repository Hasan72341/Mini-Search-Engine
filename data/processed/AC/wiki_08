{"id": "21069", "revid": "50327534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21069", "title": "Vorkosigan Saga", "text": "Science fiction book series by Lois McMaster Bujold\nThe Vorkosigan Saga is a series of science fiction novels and short stories set in a common fictional universe by American author Lois McMaster Bujold. The first of these was published in 1986 and the most recent in May 2018. Works in the series have received numerous awards and nominations, including five Hugo Award wins including one for Best Series.\nThe point of view characters include women (Cordelia in \"Shards of Honor\", \"Barrayar\", and \"Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen\"; Ekaterin in \"Komarr\", \"A Civil Campaign\", and \"The Flowers of Vashnoi\"), a gay man (\"Ethan of Athos\"), a pair of brothers, one of whom is physically disabled and the other a clone (Miles and Mark Vorkosigan), and their cousin (Ivan Vorpatril), together with some minor characters (e.g., Miles's bodyguard Roic, family friend Kareen Koudelka, and the runaway Jin).\nThe various forms of society and government Bujold presents often reflect contemporary politics. In many novels, there is a contrast between the technology-rich egalitarian Beta Colony (or more generally, galactic society) and the heroic, militaristic, hierarchical society of Barrayar, where personal relationships must ensure societal continuity. Miles Vorkosigan, the protagonist of most of the series, is the son of a Betan former ship captain mother and a Barrayaran aristocrat father.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\n\"Vorkosiverse\".\nHumanity has colonized a galaxy in which there are no competing intelligent species. Since then (at least 400 years before \"Falling Free\" or 600 years before \"Shards of Honor\"), dozens of planets have been colonized and have developed divergent cultures. Barrayar was colonized and then lost contact with the rest of the galaxy, suffering a \"Time of Isolation\", after which it was reconnected. Due to apparent nuclear warfare that has left large areas too radioactive to inhabit, low genetic diversity on Barrayar during the time of isolation, as well as the effects of mutagenic compounds found in native Barrayaran plants, a cultural phobia about mutation developed that leads to a high level of xenophobia. Within the series, exploration and colonization of new planets is still ongoing, most notably on the planet Sergyar.\nInterstellar travel is achieved by \"jumping\" from solar system to solar system via spatial anomalies known as wormholes that create tunnels in a five-dimensional space. Typically wormholes are bracketed by space stations, military or commercial, which provide ports for jump travel. Stations may be owned by planetary governments, or by specific commercial organizations, or they may be completely independent of any planetary organization. Barrayar's original wormhole collapsed, a rare event leading to the Time of Isolation. Barrayar was later re-discovered via a wormhole jump from Komarr. Komarr allows the neighboring Cetagandan empire to use their wormhole to conquer Barrayar, and is later conquered in its turn when Barrayar eventually defeats the Cetagandans.\nThe stories feature several planetary systems, each with its own political organization, including government by corporate democracy, rule by criminal corporations, monarchies, empires and direct democracies. In most cases, there is a single government which dominates the entire planet (exceptions include Jackson's Whole and Earth). Both Cetaganda and Barrayar have empires, acquired by conquering other planets via neighboring wormholes.\nAs a tool to simplify the writing process, Bujold devises a standard system of timekeeping universal to all planets regardless of the length of their day and year. Bujold herself has commented that her posited system is neither technologically nor economically feasible, but is rather a convenience for storytelling.\nTechnology.\nMost of the technology in the series is based on 20th-century engineering situations, projected into null-g or alternative solar system situations. Biomedical advances such as cloning, artificial wombs (named \"uterine replicators\") and cryochambers to preserve and revive recently deceased people are featured heavily in the series.\nBujold presents issues of technological obsolescence and the high rate of failure of R&amp;D projects in personal terms, via bioengineering. Two jump pilots with obsolete navigational brain implants and a number of characters created by genetic manipulation are psychologically stranded by the termination of the programs for which they were designed.\nThe series features gravity manipulation, both artificially generated in spaceships, and artificially suppressed in ground transport and elevators. \"Falling Free\" and \"Diplomatic Immunity\" explore the relationship between a culture adapted to an environment without gravity and one which depends on gravity.\nComputing and communications.\nIn most societies featured in the series, paper has been mostly replaced by either plastic sheets or electronic devices, and two-dimensional video is replaced by three-dimensional holograms. Most characters use portable computers called \"wristconsoles\" and personal computers named \"comconsoles\".\nInterstellar messages, however, have to be recorded on a physical disc which is transported through wormholes at a high cost, and relayed between wormholes by the ships' communication systems, imposing both time and cost constraints on interstellar communications.\nMilitary technology.\nAs the series features a military background in several novels, special attention is paid to military technology. Ship-to-ship combat includes plasma rays and attacks based on gravity manipulation, and defensive countermeasures. Personal combat includes the use of combat suits, plasma rays, needlers, and nerve disruptors, which emit rays that destroy nerve tissue. Biological weapons are also mentioned in the form of wide-spectrum toxin bombs and genetically modified microbes that target specific races, and in some cases, specific people.\nA truth serum, \"fast-penta\", is a widespread tool used in interrogation. Several defenses are devised, such as induced allergies that kill the subject before they can reveal information, genetic engineering to create immunity, or compartmentalization of information on a need-to-know basis. Miles Vorkosigan has an atypical reaction to the drug, which enables him to thwart his enemies on at least one occasion.\nBiospheres.\nIn the Vorkosigan saga, humans live on planets with diverse degrees of habitability, and have developed diverse adaptation strategies to environments that are only approximately fit for human life. For example, Komarr is a cold planet with high CO2 that is going through long-term terraforming to make it habitable, while Beta Colony is a hot, sandy planet where humans must live underground. Barrayar's vegetation is incompatible with Earth's, and often poisonous or allergenic to humans; Barrayarans clear native forest and use compost from Earth-descended plants or horse manure to grow new Earth vegetation. In spaceships and space stations, people live in closed ecologies in which air and waste are continuously reprocessed.\nMedical technology.\nMedical advances are a fundamental part of the saga's worldbuilding. The most ubiquitous are \"uterine replicators\", devices that allow complete in vitro reproduction, with gene therapy (\"gene cleaning\") to correct for congenital defects. In \"Ethan of Athos\", this also makes possible an all-male society in which eggs are produced by ovaries maintained in a lab. The Cetagandan haut go beyond gene cleaning, deliberately engineering the human genome in an attempt to produce a post-human species (\"Cetaganda\", \"Diplomatic Immunity\").\nOther advances include genetic manipulation to produce microbes and animals tailored for specific purposes, including decoration, or humans adapted for combat or to live and work in zero gravity. Fertile hermaphrodites have been created in an attempt to surpass gender roles. Medical prolonging of human life has advanced to achieve natural lifespans of 120 years or more, though Barrayar lags galactic civilization on this. Cloning is featured in the series, prominently in the person of Mark, Miles' clone-brother, and in a morally dubious industry on Jackson's Whole that grows clones of wealthy people to transplant their brains from elderly bodies to youthful, healthy ones.\nBarrayar is an exception to most of these advances due to its long isolation from the rest of humanity. Women carrying their babies to term without uterine replicators are the rule at the beginning of the series, and there is an ingrained fear of mutation in its society. The social challenges posed by medical technology and Miles Vorkosigan's visible deformities are integral to the plot of several of the stories.\nSociety.\nThe time required for wormhole jumps between planetary systems means travel and communication require time and effort which isolate each planet and allow it to develop its own culture, most of them derived to some extent from a culture known historically on Earth.\nFor example, the planet Athos creates a monosexual culture in which men reproduce in vitro without female intervention, Cetaganda is an empire in which hierarchies are based in genetic fitness, Jackson's Whole is a cutthroat criminal planet in which trade and money are law, and Escobar is a moderate planet focused on scientific advancement.\nThe novels do not focus much on several sources of social organization and prejudice on Earth, such as language, skin color, and religion. In general, Nexus inhabitants speak a common language, though they may know other languages or have a planetary accent. A good-looking woman, whether a four-armed quaddie, a Cetagandan haut-lady glimpsed in her floating bubble, or a Barrayaran damsel, has skin comparable to ivory or milk. On the other hand, the most prominent genotype on Barrayar is olive skin (and brown eyes and dark hair). The Arqua family are described as dark-skinned, and the Durona group and Ky Tung are Eurasian. Only isolated Athos has a planetary religion, though Cordelia Naismith and Leo Graf (the hero of \"Falling Free\") believe in a God.\nThe environment and history of the planets dictate their social structures and prejudices. For example, because of the isolation of Barrayar, located with a single wormhole to connect it with the rest of the galaxy, and its people having to defend a broadly habitable planet, Barrayarans both need and can afford a militaristic society. Their genetic isolation has led them to create a patriarchal society to preserve genetic purity. The Betans, on a hostile planet where they must live in domes, rely on industrial export and limit not only childbearing but also every kind of behavior that might be considered \"antisocial\". From their point of view, Barrayaran society is irrational and backward, while the Barrayarans view the Betans as sexually and politically undisciplined, referring to a \"Betan vote\" as an obstacle to decision-making. Planets accessible by many wormholes become centers of trade and finance, whether benign (Komarr, Escobar) or malicious (Jackson's Whole). Finally, some dwellers in space habitats look down on those who call one planet home as \"dirt suckers\".\nThe Vorkosigans and Barrayar.\nIn all the books except \"Ethan of Athos\" and \"Falling Free\", the protagonists are connected to the planet Barrayar, home of the Vorkosigan clan. For this planet Bujold devised a history which allowed for \"swords 'n' spaceships\" due to the transition between the Time of Isolation and galactic culture. In the lifetime of Miles Vorkosigan, Barrayar uses spaceships, computers, and other high technology, but its culture remembers dueling, celebrates the Emperor's birthday by handing him bags of gold, and provides liveried life-sworn servants to carry love letters sealed with the writer's blood. In the conservative backwoods, some still practice infanticide if signs of mutation are detected. Stories of the evils of mutation are pervasive within Barrayaran culture.\nBarrayar is a planet colonized by humans some four hundred years prior to \"Shards of Honor\", the first Vorkosigan novel. Shortly after colonization, the 50,000 settlers are cut off by a failure of the sole wormhole connecting Barrayar to the rest of humanity. During the following centuries, the \"Time of Isolation\", the colony regresses socially and technologically, eventually developing a feudal form of government, in which the Emperor of Barrayar is supported by sixty regional counts and other minor aristocrats, identified by the honorific prefix \"Vor-\" in their names. The Vor caste is a military one, and Barrayaran culture is highly militaristic and hierarchical. The Counts, however, originate as accountants, with the duty of ensuring that the Emperor's taxes are collected. Because of Barrayar's tradition of direct military action, the Counts also become extremely militaristic.\nBarrayar is eventually rediscovered via a different wormhole route controlled by the rich merchant planet Komarr. The Komarrans allow the neighboring expansionist Cetagandan Empire to invade Barrayar in return for commercial rights and concessions. Despite a significant technological advantage, the Cetagandans are finally expelled at great cost after many years of occupation and guerrilla warfare, in large part due to the leadership of General Count Piotr Vorkosigan, Miles' paternal grandfather. The Barrayarans then conquer and annex Komarr under the command of Admiral Aral Vorkosigan, Count Piotr's second son. Due to a massacre initiated by a subordinate, Aral Vorkosigan acquires the sobriquet \"Butcher of Komarr.\"\nAral Vorkosigan later meets Cordelia Naismith, an enemy officer from Beta Colony, at the commencement of another war. Forced to work together to survive on a hostile planet, they fall in love and eventually marry, resulting in the conception of Miles.\nAn attempt to poison Aral during his regency for the child Emperor, Gregor Vorbarra, leads to the exposure of a pregnant Cordelia to a teratogenic compound, the antidote to the poison. Desperate experimental medical procedures are required to save the unborn baby, and the side effects of the antidote threaten to kill Cordelia. Miles is transferred to a uterine replicator to allow medical procedures that would threaten his mother. Miles' physical development is severely affected; in particular, his long bones are short and fragile. As an adult, he is subtly but noticeably misshapen and no taller than a nine-year-old boy. As a result, he has to deal with the deeply ingrained prejudice against mutants on his native world (though he is not technically a mutant since the damage is teratogenic). With nearly pathological determination and high intelligence, aided by his supportive parents and their high social rank, he fashions an extraordinary military and civilian career for himself in the Barrayaran Empire.\nReception.\nSales and international popularity.\nThree of the novels made the New York Times Bestseller List when first released in hardback: \"A Civil Campaign\" at #26, \"Diplomatic Immunity\" at #25, and \"Cryoburn\" at #32.\nThe novels have been translated into a number of languages and the covers of various international editions have been archived.\nA comic book adaptation of \"The Warrior's Apprentice\" was published in France in 2010, which was the first of a projected series called \"La Saga Vorkosigan\".\nWorks.\nThe Saga's internal chronology does not match the order in which the books were written. Bujold has stated that she is generally in favor of reading the books in internal chronological order, with caveats. A more detailed chronology can be found in \"The Vorkosigan Companion\".\nWith the publication of \"Cryoburn\", almost all Vorkosigan tales were available as free e-texts on a CD that accompanied the hardcover release. This CD was initially shared online, but has since been withdrawn by request of the author. Earlier works published up to 2004, including novels (except \"Memory\") and the short stories (except \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\"), have been repackaged in omnibus editions. The first of these was \"Vorkosigan's Game\" (September 1990), an omnibus volume published by a book sales club, collecting \"The Vor Game\" and the three-novella \"Borders of Infinity\" anthology. While all the books and novellas are currently in print as ebooks, in America they are in print as omnibus editions.\nThe roots of the Vorkosigan Saga lie in an early collection by Bujold called \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\". The title story features Beta Colony, and another story contains a character named Cordelia Naismith, perhaps a distant ancestor of the Vorkosigan character. When beginning her first novel, \"Shards of Honor\", Bujold incorporated these elements, but greatly expanded. She followed that up with the second novel with the same setting, \"The Warrior's Apprentice\", then worked on \"Ethan of Athos\". After being rejected by four publishers, \"The Warrior's Apprentice\" was accepted by Baen Books, who agreed to a three-book deal to include the two other novels.\n\"Shards of Honor\" and \"Barrayar\" concern Miles' parents, \"Ethan of Athos\" involves a few minor characters from other Vorkosigan novels, and \"Falling Free\" does not involve Miles or any of his family, though in some later novels Miles encounters the descendants of the characters from \"Falling Free\". \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndividual titles.\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" (short story).\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" is a short story set at the beginning of Earth's age of space colonization and genetic manipulation. It was published in the book of the same name, which is a collection of short stories and essays by Bujold that had been previously unpublished and that she gathered together prior to her appearance at a NESFA convention. \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" contains the first mention of Beta Colony. It is also the only Vorkosigan Saga story not published or republished by Baen Books.\n\"Falling Free\".\n200 years before the birth of Miles Vorkosigan, engineer Leo Graf encounters the Quaddies, who are genetically engineered to have an extra pair of arms in place of legs in order to work better in the free-falling environment of space. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles, Mutants and Microbes\".\n\"Shards of Honor\".\nCaptain Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony meets and eventually falls in love with Captain Lord Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar when they are both stranded on an uninhabited planet. After being captured by the Barrayarans and then escaping twice, she returns home a war hero. However, her own people believe she has been brainwashed and try to \"cure\" her of her love for Aral. She eventually flees to Barrayar to be reunited with him. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Cordelia's Honor\".\n\"Aftermaths\" (short story).\nTwo people retrieve bodies in space near Escobar after the failed Barrayaran invasion. The story was originally a postscript to \"Shards of Honor\" and later included in the omnibus edition \"Cordelia's Honor\".\n\"Barrayar\".\nWhile Cordelia Vorkosigan is pregnant with Miles, an attempted assassination threatens her unborn child's life. Count Vordarian launches a coup. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Cordelia's Honor\".\n\"The Warrior's Apprentice\".\nSeventeen-year-old Miles breaks both legs running an obstacle course, seemingly ruining his chance of a military career. On a visit to Beta Colony, he obtains a ship, a pilot, and a contract to run guns to a blockaded government. He eventually takes over much of the blockading mercenary fleet through brilliant improvisation, sheer audacity and much luck. The unexpected arrival of his cousin Ivan Vorpatril raises Miles' suspicions. He hastens home to foil a plot against his father. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Young Miles\".\n\"The Mountains of Mourning\" (novella).\nMiles has just graduated from the Imperial Academy, and is at home at Vorkosigan Surleau with his parents. A woman from an isolated rural village demands justice for the murder of her baby, who was born with a cleft lip and palate, but was otherwise healthy. Miles' father sends him to investigate as his Voice (representative with full powers) to gain experience. Miles solves the mystery and exercises justice and mercy in appropriate measures. Collected in the omnibus editions \"Vorkosigan's Game\"; \"Young Miles\"; and \"Borders of Infinity\".\n\"The Vor Game\".\nMiles is shipped off-planet to the Hegen Hub after refusing to obey what he considers to be a criminal order at a training camp and being accused of treason (again). He finds himself having to rescue his friend and emperor, Gregor Vorbarra. Collected in the omnibus editions \"Vorkosigan's Game\" and \"Young Miles\".\n\"Cetaganda\".\nMiles and Ivan are sent to the homeworld of the Cetagandan Empire to represent Barrayar at an Imperial funeral, and quickly become entangled in a murderous Cetagandan plot involving power, poisons, and the peculiar application of eugenics in the Cetagandan \"haut\" ruling class. Miles helps defeat the plot, which would have greatly amplified the Cetagandan threat to Barrayar and other systems, and in the process collects a piece of information that causes him to dispatch Elli Quinn on her mission in Ethan of Athos. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles, Mystery, and Mayhem\".\n\"Ethan of Athos\".\nThis novel does not feature Miles except indirectly; his eventual girlfriend, Commander Elli Quinn of the Dendarii Free Mercenary Fleet, plays a leading role. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles, Mystery, and Mayhem\".\n\"Labyrinth\" (novella).\nMiles travels to Jackson's Whole, ostensibly to buy weapons, but in reality to help geneticist Dr. Hugh Canaba leave his current employer to go to work for Barrayar. Canaba throws a wrench into the works when he refuses to leave without certain experimental samples which he has injected into one of his earlier projects, a prototype \"super-soldier\". Even worse, the \"super-soldier\" has been sold to the paranoid and sadistic Baron Ryoval, whom Miles has recently offended.\nMiles breaks into Ryoval's laboratory, but is caught and imprisoned in a utility sublevel where they are also keeping Canaba's dangerous specimen, \"Nine\". This turns out to be an eight-foot-tall warrior, complete with fangs, claws, superhuman strength and speed, and a ravenous appetite. Miles is shocked to find that the creature is female, and, despite her fearsome appearance, intelligent and emotionally vulnerable. She challenges him to prove that he believes she is human by making love to her. Miles gets to indulge his weakness for tall, strong women... He offers her a new life with the Dendarii, and a new name: Taura. They escape, committing one supreme act of sabotage and revenge before Dendarii Captain Bel Thorne manages to negotiate a ransom.\nMiles finds several aspects of the deal unacceptable and the exchange turns into a minor battle with Ryoval's security. In the course of their hasty departure from the Jackson system, Miles sows confusion by telling different lies (and a couple of vital truths) to Ryoval and his rival half-brother, weapons dealer Baron Fell. Collected in the omnibus editions \"Vorkosigan's Game\"; \"Miles, Mystery, and Mayhem\"; \"Miles, Mutants and Microbes\"; and \"Borders of Infinity\".\n\"The Borders of Infinity\" (novella).\nMiles goes undercover and allows himself to be captured by the Cetagandans, who have invaded and occupied the planet Marilac, in order to infiltrate a maximum-security POW camp on Dagoola IV. His mission is to get the Marilacan commander out, but he has to improvise when he finds the man catatonic and on the verge of death.\nWith help from Suegar, an apparent religious fanatic, and Tris, the leader of the female prisoners, he instills order and hope in the apathetic, distrustful inmates and makes them rehearse for quick embarkation (disguised as a food distribution procedure). By quoting Suegar's \"scripture\" (half a page torn from \"The Pilgrim's Progress\"), Miles covertly signals his fleet to attack and rescue them. The Dendarii thereby stage one of the largest mass breakouts in history. As a result, the Cetagandans put a price on Naismith's head. At this point, they (along with nearly everyone else) are unaware that Naismith and Miles Vorkosigan are one and the same. Collected in the omnibus editions \"Vorkosigan's Game\"; \"Miles Errant\"; and \"Borders of Infinity\".\n\"Brothers in Arms\".\nOn the run from Cetagandans furious about his Dagoola IV escapade, Miles and his fleet reach the relative safety of Earth. When he reports to the Barrayaran Embassy there, he is made the Third Military Attach\u00e9. Miles is captured, and his clone, trained as an assassin by Komarrans bent on exacting a measure of revenge for the conquest and annexation of their planet, is successfully substituted for him. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles Errant\".\n\"Borders of Infinity\".\nThe novellas \"The Mountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\" were reprinted with an untitled framing story in which Miles reports to Simon Illyan, head of Barrayaran Imperial Security (\"ImpSec\"). The framing story emphasizes an audit\u2014both financial and political\u2014of ImpSec, questioning Miles' activities and expenditures during the previous adventures. This volume is short-novel length; the three-novella anthology with its framing story was reprinted in the book sales club omnibus \"Vorkosigan's Game\" (1990). The novellas are currently in print as part of other omnibus volumes but without the tie-together framing story.\n\"Mirror Dance\".\nPretending to be Miles, Mark takes part of the Dendarii on a mission to free clones from Jackson's Whole, but is soon surrounded by the enemy. When Miles comes to the rescue, things go very badly wrong. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles Errant\".\n\"Memory\".\nAfter Miles is forced to resign from ImpSec for covering up his new medical disability, he finds himself temporarily appointed an Imperial Auditor, with sweeping powers and answerable only to the Emperor, to investigate the sudden mental impairment of ImpSec chief Simon Illyan.\n\"Komarr\".\nMiles Vorkosigan accompanies fellow Imperial Auditor Professor Vorthys to Komarr to investigate a serious accident in space which may have been sabotage. There, he manages to defeat plotters who seek to seal off the only wormhole to Barrayar, and falls in love with his hostess, Ekaterin Vorsoisson, who is trapped in an unhappy marriage.\nThis novel is notable for the switching of viewpoints between its two protagonists as part of the structure of a given scene. For instance, the scene of Ekaterin's questioning with fast-penta begins from her viewpoint, but as the drug takes hold (and the novel begins a new chapter), it switches to Miles' viewpoint. This technique is expanded in the next novel where multiple viewpoints are used. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles in Love\".\n\"A Civil Campaign\".\nAs Barrayar prepares for Emperor Gregor Vorbarra's wedding to a Komarran heiress, Miles attempts to court Ekaterin Vorsoisson without her knowledge. Part of the omnibus edition \"Miles in Love\".\n\"Winterfair Gifts\" (novella).\nThis novella was published in February 2004 as part of the anthology \"Irresistible Forces\" (Catherine Asaro, editor). Bujold wrote this after completing \"Diplomatic Immunity\".\nThe wedding of Miles and Ekaterin is recounted from the viewpoint of Miles' Armsman Roic. Miles introduces Roic to Taura on her first (and due to her short life expectancy, probably her last) visit to Barrayar. The pair get along well, despite her rather unusual appearance. However, their blossoming romantic relationship is shattered when he makes a careless remark about \"hideous, bioengineered mutants\" \u2014referring to the 'butter bugs' in Mark's latest commercial venture. Taura is hurt and insulted.\nWhen Ekaterin is taken ill, Taura traces the cause to a string of pearls that had apparently been sent by current Dendarii Admiral (and Miles's ex-lover) Elli Quinn, and which do not look right to her augmented vision. With Roic's help, she brings it to the attention of ImpSec. The poisoned pearls are traced to a newly acquired enemy of Miles'. Ekaterin recovers, and the wedding goes smoothly.\nThat night, Roic is on guard when Taura joins him. She tells him that she probably only has a year or two left to live, and therefore takes everything as it comes. Roic replies, \"Can you teach me to do that?\" Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles in Love\".\n\"Diplomatic Immunity\".\nOn the way back from his belated honeymoon, Miles is dispatched to Quaddiespace to untangle a diplomatic incident. Collected in the omnibus edition \"Miles, Mutants and Microbes\".\n\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\".\nOn Komarr, Ivan is asked by an ImpSec friend to protect a pretty young woman targeted by a criminal gang, and stumbles into a conspiracy involving Jackson's Whole politics, hired assassins, criminal syndicates, and an old and potentially dangerous secret on Barrayar. And embarrassing in-laws.\n\"The Flowers of Vashnoi\" (novella).\nStill new to her duties as Lady Vorkosigan, Ekaterin is working together with an expatriate scientist on a radical scheme to recover the lands of the Vashnoi exclusion zone, the lingering radioactive legacy of the Cetagandan invasion of the planet Barrayar. When the scientist's experimental bioengineered creatures go missing, the pair discover that the zone still contains deadly old secrets.\n\"Cryoburn\".\nMiles investigates a cryogenic corporation on the planet Kibou-daini, with the assistance of Jin, a local boy.\n\"Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen\".\nThree years after the death of Aral Vorkosigan, Admiral Jole of the Sergyar Fleet (who once was Aral's subordinate as well as lover) receives a proposal. Aral's widow Cordelia plans to use the genetic material she and Aral had saved and offers him the option of fathering children from his genes and some of Aral's frozen gametes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the main language among Native tribes in this area, mainly Louisiana. There is evidence indicating its existence as early as the late 17th to early 18th century. The Native groups that are said to have used it were the Alabama, Apalachee, Biloxi, Chacato, Pakana, Pascagoula, Taensa, Tunica, Caddo, Chickasaw, Houma, Choctaw, Chitimacha, Natchez, and Ofo. The name is thought to refer to the Mobile Indians of the central Gulf Coast, but did not originate from this group; Mobilian Jargon is linguistically and grammatically different from the language traditionally spoken by the Mobile Indians.\nMobilian Jargon facilitated trade between tribes speaking different languages and European settlers. There is continuing debate as to when Mobilian Jargon first began to be spoken. Some scholars, such as James Crawford, have argued that Mobilian Jargon has its origins in the linguistically diverse environment following the establishment of the French colony of Louisiana. Others, however, suggest that the already linguistically diverse environment of the lower Mississippi basin drove the need for a common method of communication prior to regular contact with Europeans.\nThe Native Americans of the Gulf coast and Mississippi valley have always spoken multiple languages, mainly the languages of the other tribes that inhabited the same area. The Mobilians, like these neighboring tribes, were also multi-lingual. By the early 19th century, Mobilian Jargon evolved from functioning solely as a contact language between people into a means of personal identification. With an increasing presence of outsiders in the Indian Gulf coast community, Mobilian Jargon served as a way of knowing who was truly a native of the area, and allowed Mobilians to be socially isolated from non-Indian population expansion from the north.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe accepted view of the origin is that it developed from contact with the French in the 18th century. But there is obscurity in that. It seems that there was a pre-European origin that is supported through its well-established use in diverse indigenous contexts, geographic overlapping with that of Southeastern Indian groups formerly associated in multilingual paramount chiefdoms of the pre-Columbian Mississippian complex, and its indigenous grammar. Mobilian Jargon has a recorded history of at least 250 years where the first reliable evidence dated 1700. For two centuries it was socially accepted to use as a lingua franca with the outsiders they interacted with, such as traders and settlers. It is presumed that fur traders spread the language to Choctaw and Chickasaw provinces. Though Indians spoke in Mobilian Jargon to outsiders, the outsiders did not have a full understanding of how special the nature and functions of Mobilian Jargon was. Because of this, the Indians created a cultural barrier, preserving their cultural integrity and privacy from non-Indian groups. The pervasiveness of Mobilian Jargon, as a result, created its longtime survival.\nMobilian Jargon is a pidginized or \"corrupted\"/\"complex\" form of Choctaw and Chickasaw (both Western Muskogean) that also contains elements of Eastern Muskogean languages such as Alabama and Koasati, colonial languages including Spanish, French, and English, and perhaps Algonquian and/or other languages. Pamela Munro has argued that Choctaw is the major contributing language (not both Choctaw and Chickasaw) although this has been challenged by Emanuel Drechsel. He has concluded that the presence of certain Algonquian words in Mobilian Jargon are the result of direct contact between the Mobilians of the Mississippi valley and Algonquians moving southward. For the most part, these \"loanwords\" differ by only one or two letters.\nExtinction.\nMobilian has not survived as a functional language. There is documentary evidence of it in numerous historical records such as journals, diaries, reports and scholarly treatments. What was recorded, though, was very little, and it is safe to assume that Europeans did not have a full understanding of Mobilian. They believed that Mobilian was the mother of all other Indian languages, failing to notice that it was actually a hybrid of the Choctaw and Chickasaw languages.\nRevival.\nWhen it was no longer needed as a spoken trade language, Mobilian was lost and eventually became extinct. It was first written about in the 1700s and was spoken until the 1950s. In the 1980s, elders in the Louisiana region could still recall a few words and phrases. In 2012, the Mezcal Jazz Unit of Montpellier, France, collaborated by Internet with Grayhawk Perkins, a historian of the Muskogean nation, to make a recording titled \"Thirteen Moons\", which features \"the soulful chants of ancient folk tales and more modern stories told in Mobilian.\"\nDistribution.\nMobilian was used from the Florida northwest coast and area of the current Alabama-Georgia border westward as far as eastern Texas and in the north from the lower Mississippi Valley (currently south and central Illinois) to the southern Mississippi River Delta region in the south. It is known to have been used by the Alabama, Apalachee, Biloxi, Chacato, Pakana, Pascagoula, Taensa, Tunica, Caddo, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Chitimacha, Natchez, and Ofo. There is some evidence that Mobilian Jargon was used about 500 miles upstream the Missouri River near the Oyo or Osage Indians during the late 18th century. Some scholars also have reason to believe that the language was used or somehow came in contact with groups using the Algonquian languages of the Northeast to Midwest, with which Mobilian Jargon shares a number of words, such as papo(s) or papo\u0161, meaning 'baby, child', which undeniably resembles the Narragansett word with the same meaning, p\u00e1p\u016bs. It is unknown how the crossover between the languages occurred; some possibilities include direct contact with Algonquian-speaking peoples in Virginia and North Carolina, or perhaps contact with French explorers using the Algonquian language at the time. Other Europeans also learned the language, but not in a way where they understood the cultural aspects of it; just enough for them to be able to trade with the Indians. \nGrammar.\nIn its syntax, Mobilian Jargon was fundamentally Muskogean and compared to other southeastern Indian tribes it showed a reduced morphology. Its lexicon shares major similarities to other Muskogean languages, in particular to Chickasaw and to Alabama. Though it evolved from more complex and polysynthetic Native American languages, Mobilian Jargon has a simpler structure where verbs are not required to have subject or object affixes and the subject-object-verb ordering in the sentence is variable. It also requires a separate word after the verb to indicate tense, whereas Muskogean languages use a suffix. It has a simplified syllable and sound structure and a simplified grammar as compared to Choctaw, its primary parent language. Mobilian Jargon was at one point a Muskogean- based pidgin. It was linguistically reduced from analytical grammar. Mobilian Jargon related to Muskogean proper linguistics and historical facts. Mobilians used a lot of Western Muskogean in their spoken language. Compare the personal pronouns among Muskogean languages:\nLexicon.\nMobilian Jargon consists of about 1,250 words of various origins. Of 150 words studied most were from Western Muskogean/Choctaw-Chickisaw, 20 were split between Western Muskogean and Alabama-Koasati, 14 were from Alabama-Koasati, 3 were from English, 2 were from Spanish, 1 was from French, and one from Algonquin.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21073", "revid": "50813202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21073", "title": "Mad (magazine)", "text": "American humor magazine\nMad (stylized in all caps) is an American humor magazine which was launched in 1952 and currently published by DC Comics, a unit of the DC Entertainment subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. \"Mad\" was founded by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines, launched as a comic book series before it became a magazine. It was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media, as well as the cultural landscape of the late 20th century, with editor Al Feldstein increasing readership to more than two million during its 1973\u20131974 circulation peak. It is the last surviving title in the EC Comics line, which sold \"Mad\" to Premier Industries in 1961, but closed in 1956.\n\"Mad\" publishes satire on all aspects of life and popular culture, politics, entertainment, and public figures. Its format includes TV and movie parodies, and satire articles about everyday occurrences that are changed to seem humorous. \"Mad\"'s mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, is usually on the cover, with his face replacing that of a celebrity or character who is being lampooned. From 1952 to 2018, \"Mad\" published 550 regular magazine issues, as well as scores of reprint \"Specials\", original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. After AT&amp;T merged with DC's then-owner Time Warner in June 2018, \"Mad\" ended newsstand distribution, continuing in comic-book stores and via subscription.\nHistory.\n\"Mad\" began as a comic book published by EC, debuting in August 1952 (cover date October\u2013November). The \"Mad\" office was initially located in lower Manhattan at 225 Lafayette Street, while in the early 1960s it moved to 485 Madison Avenue, the location listed in the magazine as \"485 MADison Avenue\".\nThe first issue was written almost entirely by Harvey Kurtzman, and featured illustrations by him, Wally Wood, Will Elder (Also known as Bill Elder), Jack Davis, and John Severin. Wood, Elder, and Davis were to be the three main illustrators throughout the 23-issue run of the comic book.\nTo retain Kurtzman as its editor, the comic book converted to magazine format as of issue No. 24, in 1955. The switchover induced Kurtzman to remain for one more year, but the move had removed \"Mad\" from the strictures of the Comics Code Authority. William Gaines related in 1992 that \"Mad\" \"was not changed [into a magazine] to avoid the Code\" but \"as a result of this [change of format] it \"did\" avoid the Code.\" Gaines claimed that Kurtzman had at the time received \"a very lucrative offer from \"Pageant\" magazine,\" and seeing as he, Kurtzman, \"had, prior to that time, evinced an interest in changing \"Mad\" into a magazine,\" Gaines, \"not know[ing] anything about publishing magazines,\" countered that offer by allowing Kurtzman to make the change. Gaines further stated that \"if Harvey [Kurtzman] had not gotten that offer from \"Pageant\", \"Mad\" probably would not have changed format.\"\nAfter Kurtzman's departure in 1956, new editor Al Feldstein swiftly brought aboard contributors such as Don Martin, Frank Jacobs, and Mort Drucker, and later Antonio Proh\u00edas, Dave Berg, and Sergio Aragon\u00e9s. The magazine's circulation more than quadrupled during Feldstein's tenure, peaking at 2,132,655 in 1974; it later declined to a third of this figure by the end of his time as editor.\nIn its earliest incarnation, new issues of the magazine appeared erratically, between four and nine times a year. By the end of 1958, \"Mad\" had settled on an unusual eight-times-a-year schedule, which lasted almost four decades. Issues would go on sale 7 to 9 weeks before the start of the month listed on the cover. Gaines felt the atypical timing was necessary to maintain the magazine's level of quality. Beginning in 1994, \"Mad\" then began incrementally producing additional issues per year, until it reached a monthly schedule with issue No. 353 (Jan. 1997). With its 500th issue (June 2009), amid company-wide cutbacks at Time Warner, the magazine temporarily regressed to a quarterly publication before settling to six issues per year in 2010.\nGaines sold his company in 1961 to Premier Industries, a maker of venetian blinds. Around 1964, Premier sold \"Mad\" to Independent News, a division of National Periodical Publications, the publisher of DC Comics. In the summer of 1967, Kinney National Company purchased National Periodical Publications. Kinney bought Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in early 1969. As a result of the car parking scandal, Kinney Services spun off of its non-entertainment assets to form National Kinney Corporation in August 1971, and it reincorporated as Warner Communications, Inc. on February 10, 1972. In 1977, National Periodical Publications was renamed DC Comics.\nFeldstein retired in 1985, and was replaced by the senior team of Nick Meglin and John Ficarra, who co-edited \"Mad\" for the next two decades. Long-time production artist Lenny \"The Beard\" Brenner was promoted to art director and Joe Raiola and Charlie Kadau joined the staff as junior editors. Following Gaines's death in 1992, \"Mad\" became more ingrained within the Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) corporate structure. Eventually, the magazine was obliged to abandon its long-time home at 485 Madison Avenue and in the mid-1990s it moved into DC Comics's offices at the same time that DC relocated to 1700 Broadway. In issue No. 404 of April 2001, the magazine broke its long-standing taboo and began running paid advertising. The outside revenue allowed the introduction of color printing and improved paper stock. After Meglin retired in 2004, the team of Ficarra (as executive editor) Raiola and Kadau (as senior editors), and Sam Viviano, who had taken over as art director in 1999, would helm \"Mad\" for the next 14 years.\nThroughout the years, \"Mad\" has remained a unique mix of adolescent silliness and political humor. In November 2017, \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"operating under the cover of barf jokes, \"Mad\" has become America's best political satire magazine.\" Nevertheless, \"Mad\" ended its 65-year run in New York City at the end of 2017 with issue No. 550 (cover-dated April 2018), in preparation for the relocation of its offices to DC Entertainment's headquarters in Burbank, California. Bill Morrison was named in June 2017 to succeed Ficarra in January 2018. None of \"Mad\"'s New York staff made the move, resulting in a change in editorial leadership, tone, and art direction. More than a hundred new names made their \"Mad\" debuts including Brian Posehn, Maria Bamford, Ian Boothby, Luke McGarry, Akilah Hughes, and future Pulitzer Prize finalist Pia Guerra. Scores of artists and writers from the New York run also returned to the pages of the California-based issues including contributors Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Al Jaffee, Desmond Devlin, Tom Richmond, Peter Kuper, Teresa Burns Parkhurst, Rick Tulka, Tom Bunk, Jeff Kruse, Ed Steckley, Arie Kaplan, writer and former Senior Editor Charlie Kadau, and artist and former Art Director Sam Viviano. The first California issue of \"Mad\" was renumbered as \"#1.\" In 2019, the rebooted magazine earned two Eisner Award nominations\u2014the first such nominations in \"Mad's\" history\u2014for the Best Short Story and Best Humor Publication categories.\nAT&amp;T acquired Time Warner in June 2018. Morrison exited \"Mad\" by March 2019, during a time of layoffs and restructuring at DC Entertainment. After issue No. 11 (Feb. 2020) of the new Burbank edition, \"Mad\" began to consist mostly of curated reprints with new covers and fold-ins, although some new articles have been periodically featured, including parodies of \"The Batman\" (\"The Bathroom\") and Elon Musk's tenure at Twitter (in a Dr. Seuss parody called \"Free Speeches on the Beaches\"). Distribution to newsstands stopped, with the magazine initially becoming available only through comic-book shops and by subscription, although in 2022 distribution expanded to Barnes &amp; Noble via a series of compilation issues dubbed \"The Treasure Trove of Trash\".\nInfluence.\nThough there are antecedents to \"Mad\"'s style of humor in print, radio and film, \"Mad\" itself became a signature example. Throughout the 1950s, \"Mad\" featured groundbreaking parodies combining a sentimental fondness for the familiar staples of American culture\u2014such as Archie and Superman\u2014with a keen joy in exposing the fakery behind the image. Its approach was described by Dave Kehr in \"The New York Times\": \"Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding on the radio, Ernie Kovacs on television, Stan Freberg on records, Harvey Kurtzman in the early issues of \"Mad\": all of those pioneering humorists and many others realized that the real world mattered less to people than the sea of sounds and images that the ever more powerful mass media were pumping into American lives.\" Bob and Ray, Kovacs and Freberg all became contributors to \"Mad\".\nIn 1977, Tony Hiss and Jeff Lewis wrote in \"The New York Times\" about the then-25-year-old publication's initial effect:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The skeptical generation of kids it shaped in the 1950s is the same generation that, in the 1960s, opposed a war and didn't feel bad when the United States lost for the first time and in the 1970s helped turn out an Administration and didn't feel bad about that either ... It was magical, objective proof to kids that they weren't alone, that in New York City on Lafayette Street, if nowhere else, there were people who knew that there was something wrong, phony and funny about a world of bomb shelters, brinkmanship and toothpaste smiles. \"Mad\"'s consciousness of itself, as trash, as comic book, as enemy of parents and teachers, even as money-making enterprise, thrilled kids. In 1955, such consciousness was possibly nowhere else to be found. In a \"Mad\" parody, comic-strip characters knew they were stuck in a strip. \"Darnold Duck,\" for example, begins wondering why he has only three fingers and has to wear white gloves all the time. He ends up wanting to murder every other Disney character. G.I. Schmoe tries to win the sexy Asiatic Red Army broad by telling her, \"O.K., baby! You're all mine! I gave you a chance to hit me witta gun butt ... But naturally, you have immediately fallen in love with me, since I am a big hero of this story.\"\n\"Mad\" is often credited with filling a vital gap in political satire from the 1950s to 1970s, when Cold War paranoia and a general culture of censorship prevailed in the United States, especially in literature for teens. Activist Tom Hayden said, \"My own radical journey began with \"Mad Magazine\".\" The rise of such factors as cable television and the Internet has diminished the influence and impact of \"Mad\", although it remains a widely distributed magazine. In a way, \"Mad\"'s power has been undone by its own success: what was subversive in the 1950s and 1960s is now commonplace. However, its impact on three generations of humorists is incalculable, as can be seen in the frequent references to \"Mad\" on the animated series \"The Simpsons\". \"The Simpsons\" producer Bill Oakley said, \"\"The Simpsons\" has transplanted \"Mad\" magazine. Basically everyone who was young between 1955 and 1975 read \"Mad\", and that's where your sense of humor came from. And we knew all these people, you know, Dave Berg and Don Martin\u2014all heroes, and unfortunately, now all dead.\" In 2009, \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"\"Mad\" once defined American satire; now it heckles from the margins as all of culture competes for trickster status.\" Longtime contributor Al Jaffee described the dilemma to an interviewer in 2010: \"When \"Mad\" first came out, in 1952, it was the only game in town. Now, you've got graduates from \"Mad\" who are doing \"The Today Show\" or \"Stephen Colbert\" or \"Saturday Night Live\". All of these people grew up on \"Mad\". Now \"Mad\" has to top them. So \"Mad\" is almost in a competition with itself.\"\n\"Mad\"'s satiric net was cast wide. The magazine often featured parodies of ongoing American culture, including advertising campaigns, the nuclear family, the media, big business, education and publishing. In the 1960s and beyond, it satirized such burgeoning topics as the sexual revolution, hippies, the generation gap, psychoanalysis, gun politics, pollution, the Vietnam War and recreational drug use. The magazine took a generally negative tone towards counterculture drugs such as cannabis and LSD, but it also savaged mainstream drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. \"Mad\" always satirized Democrats as mercilessly as it did Republicans. In 2007, Al Feldstein recalled, \"We even used to rake the hippies over the coals. They were protesting the Vietnam War, but we took aspects of their culture and had fun with it. \"Mad\" was wide open. Bill loved it, and he was a capitalist Republican. I loved it, and I was a liberal Democrat. That went for the writers, too; they all had their own political leanings, and everybody had a voice. But the voices were mostly critical. It was social commentary, after all.\" \"Mad\" also ran a good deal of less topical or contentious material on such varied subjects as fairy tales, nursery rhymes, greeting cards, sports, small talk, poetry, marriage, comic strips, awards shows, cars and many other areas of general interest.\nIn 2007, the \"Los Angeles Times\"' Robert Lloyd wrote, \"All I really need to know I learned from \"Mad\" magazine\", going on to assert:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Plenty of it went right over my head, of course, but that's part of what made it attractive and valuable. Things that go over your head can make you raise your head a little higher.\nThe magazine instilled in me a habit of mind, a way of thinking about a world rife with false fronts, small print, deceptive ads, booby traps, treacherous language, double standards, half truths, subliminal pitches and product placements; it warned me that I was often merely the target of people who claimed to be my friend; it prompted me to mistrust authority, to read between the lines, to take nothing at face value, to see patterns in the often shoddy construction of movies and TV shows; and it got me to think critically in a way that few actual humans charged with my care ever bothered to.\nIn 1988, Geoffrey O'Brien wrote about the impact \"Mad\" had upon the younger generation of the 1950s:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By now they knew the [nuclear survival] pamphlets lied ... Rod Serling knew a lot more than President Eisenhower. There were even jokes about the atom bomb in \"Mad\", a gallows humor commenting on its own ghastliness: \"The last example of this nauseating, busted-crutch type humor is to show an atom-bomb explosion! However, this routine, we feel, is giving way to the even more hilarious picture of the hydrogen bomb!\" The jittery aftertaste of that joke clarified. It was a splinter driven through the carefully measured prose on the back of some Mentor book about Man and His Destiny ... By not fitting in, a joke momentarily interrupted the world. But after the joke you recognized it was a joke and went back to the integral world that the joke broke. But what if it never came back again, and the little gap stayed there and became everything?\nIn 1994, Brian Siano in \"The Humanist\" discussed the effect of \"Mad\" on that segment of people already disaffected from society:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the smarter kids of two generations, \"Mad\" was a revelation: it was the first to tell us that the toys we were being sold were garbage, our teachers were phonies, our leaders were fools, our religious counselors were hypocrites, and even our parents were lying to us about damn near everything. An entire generation had William Gaines for a godfather: this same generation later went on to give us the sexual revolution, the environmental movement, the peace movement, greater freedom in artistic expression, and a host of other goodies. Coincidence? You be the judge.\nPulitzer Prize-winning art comics maven Art Spiegelman said, \"The message \"Mad\" had in general is, 'The media is lying to you, and we are part of the media.' It was basically ... 'Think for yourselves, kids.'\" William Gaines offered his own view: when asked to cite \"Mad\"'s philosophy, his boisterous answer was, \"We must never stop reminding the reader what little value they get for their money!\"\nComics historian Tom Spurgeon picked \"Mad\" as the medium's top series of all time, writing, \"At the height of its influence, \"Mad\" was \"The Simpsons\", \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Onion\" combined.\" Graydon Carter chose it as the sixth-best magazine of any sort ever, describing \"Mad\"'s mission as being \"ever ready to pounce on the illogical, hypocritical, self-serious and ludicrous\" before concluding, \"Nowadays, it's part of the oxygen we breathe.\" Joyce Carol Oates called it \"wonderfully inventive, irresistibly irreverent and intermittently ingenious\".\nArtist Dave Gibbons said, \"When you think of the people who grew up in the '50s and '60s, the letters M-A-D were probably as influential as L-S-D, in that it kind of expanded people's consciousness and showed them an alternative view of society and consumer culture\u2014mocked it, satirized it.\" Gibbons also noted that \"Mad\" was an overt influence on \"Watchmen\", the acclaimed 12-issue comic book series created by writer Alan Moore and himself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When it comes to the kind of storytelling we did in \"Watchmen\", we used many of the tricks Harvey Kurtzman perfected in \"Mad\". The thing for instance where you have a background that remains constant, and have characters walk around in front of it. Or the inverse of that, where you have characters in the same place and move the background around. We quite mercilessly stole the wonderful techniques Harvey Kurtzman had invented in \"Mad\".\nIn a 1985 \"Tonight Show\" appearance, when Johnny Carson asked Michael J. Fox, \"When did you really know you'd made it in show business?\", Fox replied, \"When Mort Drucker drew my head.\" In 2019, Terence Winter, writer and producer of \"The Sopranos\", told \"Variety\" \"When we got into \"Mad\" Magazine, that was the highlight for me. That said everything.\"\nMonty Python's Terry Gilliam wrote, \"\"Mad\" became the Bible for me and my whole generation.\" Underground cartoonist Bill Griffith said of his youth, \"\"Mad\" was a life raft in a place like Levittown, where all around you were the things that \"Mad\" was skewering and making fun of.\"\nRobert Crumb remarked, \"Artists are always trying to equal the work that impressed them in their childhood and youth. I still feel extremely inadequate when I look at the old \"Mad\" comics.\"\nWhen Weird Al Yankovic was asked whether \"Mad\" had had any influence in putting him on a road to a career in parody, the musician replied, \"[It was] more like going off a cliff.\" \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" writer-actor Frank Conniff wrote, \"Without \"Mad\" Magazine, \"MST3K\" would have been slightly different, like for instance, it wouldn't have existed.\" Comedian Jerry Seinfeld talked about the magazine's impact on him, saying, \"You start reading it, and you're going, 'These people don't respect \"anything\".' And that just exploded my head. It was like, you don't have to buy it. You can say 'This is stupid. This is stupid.'\"\nCritic Roger Ebert wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I learned to be a movie critic by reading \"Mad\" magazine ... \"Mad\"'s parodies made me aware of the machine inside the skin\u2014of the way a movie might look original on the outside, while inside it was just recycling the same old dumb formulas. I did not read the magazine, I plundered it for clues to the universe. Pauline Kael lost it at the movies; I lost it at \"Mad\" magazine.\nRock singer Patti Smith said more succinctly, \"After \"Mad\", drugs were nothing.\"\nRecurring features.\n\"Mad\" is known for many regular and semi-regular recurring features in its pages, including \"Spy vs. Spy\", the \"Mad Fold-in\", \"The Lighter Side of ...\" and its television and movie parodies. The magazine has also included recurring gags and references, both visual (e.g. the \"Mad\" Zeppelin, or Arthur the potted plant) and linguistic (unusual words such as axolotl, furshlugginer, potrzebie and veeblefetzer).\nAlfred E. Neuman.\nThe image most closely associated with the magazine is that of Alfred E. Neuman, the boy with misaligned eyes, a gap-toothed smile, and the perennial motto \"What, me worry?\" The original image was a popular humorous graphic for many decades before \"Mad\" adopted it, but the face is now primarily associated with \"Mad\".\n\"Mad\" initially used the boy's face in November 1954. His first iconic full-cover appearance was as a write-in candidate for president on issue No. 30 (December 1956), in which he was identified by name and sported his \"What, me worry?\" motto. He has since appeared in a slew of guises and comic situations. According to \"Mad\" writer Frank Jacobs, a letter was once successfully delivered to the magazine through the U.S. mail bearing only Neuman's face, without any address or other identifying information.\nLegal disputes.\nThe magazine has been involved in various legal actions over the decades, some of which have reached the United States Supreme Court. The most far-reaching was \"Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.\" In 1961, a group of music publishers representing songwriters such as Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers, and Cole Porter filed a $25\u00a0million lawsuit against \"Mad\" for copyright infringement following \"Sing Along With \"Mad\"\", a collection of parody lyrics which the magazine said could be \"sung to the tune of\" many popular songs. The publishing group hoped to establish a legal precedent that only a song's composers retained the right to parody that song. Judge Charles Metzner of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled largely in favor of \"Mad\" in 1963, affirming its right to print 23 of the 25 song parodies under dispute. However, in the case of two parodies, \"Always\" (sung to the tune of \"Always\") and \"There's No Business Like No Business\" (sung to the tune of \"There's No Business Like Show Business\"), Judge Metzner decided that the issue of copyright infringement was closer, requiring a trial because in each case the parodies relied on the same verbal hooks (\"always\" and \"business\") as the originals. The music publishers appealed the ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals not only upheld the pro-\"Mad\" decision in regard to the 23 songs, it adopted an approach that was broad enough to strip the publishers of their limited victory regarding the remaining two songs. Writing a unanimous opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Circuit Judge Irving Kaufman observed, \"We doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in iambic pentameter.\" The publishers again appealed, but the Supreme Court refused to hear it, allowing the decision to stand.\nThis precedent-setting 1964 ruling established the rights of parodists and satirists to mimic the meter of popular songs. However, the \"Sing Along With \"Mad\"\" songbook was not the magazine's first venture into musical parody. In 1960, \"Mad\" had published \"My Fair Ad-Man\", a full advertising-based spoof of the hit Broadway musical \"My Fair Lady\". In 1959, \"If Gilbert &amp; Sullivan wrote \"Dick Tracy\"\" was one of the speculative pairings in \"If Famous Authors Wrote the Comics\".\nIn 1966, a series of copyright infringement lawsuits against the magazine regarding ownership of the Alfred E. Neuman image eventually reached the appellate level. Although Harry Stuff had copyrighted the image in 1914, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that, by allowing many copies of the image to circulate without any copyright notice, the owner of the copyright had allowed the image to pass into the public domain, thus establishing the right of \"Mad\"\u2014or anyone else\u2014to use the image. In addition, \"Mad\" established that Stuff was not himself the creator of the image, by producing numerous other examples dating back to the late 19th century. This decision was also allowed to stand.\nOther legal disputes were settled more easily. Following the magazine's parody of the film \"The Empire Strikes Back\", a letter from George Lucas's lawyers arrived in \"Mad\"'s offices demanding that the issue be recalled for infringement on copyrighted figures. The letter further demanded that the printing plates be destroyed, and that Lucasfilm must receive all revenue from the issue plus additional punitive damages. Unbeknownst to Lucas' lawyers, \"Mad\" had received a letter weeks earlier from Lucas himself, expressing delight over the parody and calling artist Mort Drucker and writer Dick DeBartolo \"the Leonardo da Vinci and George Bernard Shaw of comic satire.\" Publisher Bill Gaines made a copy of Lucas' letter, added the handwritten notation \"Gee, your boss George liked it!\" across the top, and mailed it to the lawyers. Said DeBartolo, \"We never heard from them again.\"\n\"Mad\" was one of several parties that filed \"amicus curiae\" briefs with the Supreme Court in support of 2 Live Crew and its disputed song parody, during the 1993 \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\" case.\nAdvertising.\n\"Mad\" was long noted for its absence of advertising, enabling it to satirize materialist culture without fear of reprisal. For decades, it was the most successful American magazine to publish ad-free, beginning with issue No. 33 (June 1957) and continuing through issue No. 404 (April 2001).\nAs a comic book, \"Mad\" had run the same advertisements as the rest of EC's line. The magazine later made a deal with Moxie soda that involved inserting the Moxie logo into various articles. \"Mad\" ran a limited number of ads in its first two years as a magazine, helpfully labeled \"real advertisement\" to differentiate the real from the parodies. The last authentic ad published under the original \"Mad\" regime was for Famous Artists School; two issues later, the inside front cover of issue No. 34 had a parody of the same ad. After this transitional period, the only promotions to appear in \"Mad\" for decades were house ads for \"Mad\"'s own books and specials, subscriptions, and promotional items such as ceramic busts, T-shirts, or a line of \"Mad\" jewelry. This rule was bent only a few times to promote outside products directly related to the magazine, such as \"The Mad Magazine Game\", a series of video games based on \"Spy vs. Spy\", and the notorious \"Up the Academy\" movie (which the magazine later disowned). \"Mad\" explicitly promised that it would never make its mailing list available.\nBoth Kurtzman and Feldstein wanted the magazine to solicit advertising, feeling this could be accomplished without compromising \"Mad\"'s content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered \"Ballyhoo\", a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein went so far as to propose an in-house \"Mad\" ad agency, and produced a \"dummy\" copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine \"60 Minutes\", \"We long ago decided we couldn't take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola.\" Gaines' motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We'd have to improve our package. Most advertisers want to appear in a magazine that's loaded with color and has super-slick paper. So you find yourself being pushed into producing a more expensive package. You get bigger and fancier and attract more advertisers. Then you find you're losing some of your advertisers. Your readers still expect the fancy package, so you keep putting it out, but now you don't have your advertising income, which is why you got fancier in the first place\u2014and now you're sunk.\nContributors and criticism.\n\"Mad\" has provided a continuing showcase for many long-running satirical writers and artists and has fostered an unusual group loyalty. Although several of the contributors earn far more than their \"Mad\" pay in fields such as television and advertising, they have steadily continued to provide material for the publication. Among the notable artists were the aforementioned Davis, Elder and Wood, as well as Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Mort Drucker, Don Martin, Dave Berg, George Woodbridge, Harry North and Paul Coker. Writers such as Dick DeBartolo, Stan Hart, Frank Jacobs, Tom Koch, and Arnie Kogen appeared regularly in the magazine's pages. In several cases, only infirmity or death has ended a contributor's run at \"Mad.\"\nWithin the industry, \"Mad\" was known for the uncommonly prompt manner in which its contributors were paid. Publisher Gaines would typically write a personal check and give it to the artist upon receipt of the finished product. Wally Wood said, \"I got spoiled ... Other publishers don't do that. I started to get upset if I had to wait a whole week for my check.\" Another lure for contributors was the annual \"Mad Trip\", an all-expenses-paid tradition that began in 1960. The editorial staff was automatically invited, along with freelancers who had qualified for an invitation by selling a set number of articles or pages during the previous year. Gaines was strict about enforcing this quota, and one year, longtime writer and frequent traveller Arnie Kogen was bumped off the list. Later that year, Gaines' mother died, and Kogen was asked if he would be attending the funeral. \"I can't,\" said Kogen, \"I don't have enough pages.\" Over the years, the \"Mad\" crew traveled to such locales as France, Kenya, Russia, Hong Kong, England, Amsterdam, Tahiti, Morocco, Italy, Greece, and Germany. The tradition ended with Gaines' death, and a 1993 trip to Monte Carlo.\nAlthough \"Mad\" was an exclusively freelance publication, it achieved remarkable stability, with numerous contributors remaining prominent for decades. Critics of the magazine felt that this lack of turnover eventually led to a formulaic sameness, although there is little agreement on when the magazine peaked or plunged.\nMany people have proclaimed moments that they say triggered the magazine's irreversible decline. Among the most frequently cited \"downward turning points\" are: creator-editor Harvey Kurtzman's departure in 1957; the magazine's mainstream success; adoption of recurring features starting in the early 1960s; the magazine's absorption into a more corporate structure in 1968 (or later, the mid-1990s); founder Gaines' death in 1992; the magazine's publicized \"edgy revamp\" in 1997; the arrival of paid advertising in 2001; or the magazine's 2018 move to California. \"Mad\" has been criticized for its over-reliance on a core group of aging regulars throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and then criticized again for an alleged downturn as those same creators began to leave, die, retire, or contribute less frequently.\nIt has been proposed that \"Mad\" is more susceptible to this criticism than many media because a sizable percentage of its readership turns over regularly as it ages, as \"Mad\" focuses greatly on current events and a changing popular culture. In 2010, Sergio Aragon\u00e9s said, \"\"Mad\" is written by people who never thought 'Okay, I'm going to write for kids,' or 'I'm going to write for adults.' ... And many people say 'I used to read \"Mad\", but \"Mad\" has changed a lot.' Excuse me\u2014 you grew up! You have new interests. ... The change doesn't come from the magazine, it comes from the people who grow or don't grow.\" \"Mad\" poked fun at the tendency of readers to accuse the magazine of declining in quality at various points in its history in its \"Untold History of \"Mad\" Magazine\", a self-referential faux history in the 400th issue which joked: \"The second issue of \"Mad\" goes on sale on December 9, 1952. On December 11, the first-ever letter complaining that \"Mad\" 'just isn't as funny and original like it used to be' arrives.\" The magazine's art director, Sam Viviano, suggested in 2002 that historically, \"Mad\" was at its best \"whenever you first started reading it.\" According to former \"Mad\" Senior Editor Joe Raiola, \"\"Mad\" is the only place in America where if you mature, you get fired.\"\nAmong the loudest of those who insist the magazine is no longer funny are supporters of Harvey Kurtzman, who left \"Mad\" after just 28 issues.\nHowever, just how much of that success was due to the original Kurtzman template that he left for his successor, and how much should be credited to the Al Feldstein system and the depth of the post-Kurtzman talent pool, can be argued without resolution. In 2009, an interviewer proposed to Al Jaffee, \"There's a group of \"Mad\" aficionados who feel that if Harvey Kurtzman had stayed at \"Mad\", the magazine would not only have been different, but better.\" Jaffee, a Kurtzman enthusiast, replied, \"And then there's a large group who feel that if Harvey had stayed with \"Mad\", he would have upgraded it to the point that only fifteen people would buy it.\" During Kurtzman's final two-plus years at EC, \"Mad\" appeared erratically (ten issues appeared in 1954, followed by eight issues in 1955 and four issues in 1956). Feldstein was less well regarded creatively, but kept the magazine on a regular schedule, leading to decades of success. (Kurtzman and Will Elder returned to \"Mad\" for a short time in the mid-1980s as an illustrating team.)\nThe magazine's sales peak came with issue No. 161 (September 1973), which sold 2.4\u00a0million copies in 1973. That period coincided with several other magazines' sales peaks, including \"TV Guide\" and \"Playboy\". \"Mad\"'s circulation dropped below one million for the first time in 1983.\nMany of the magazine's mainstays began retiring or dying by the 1980s. Newer contributors who appeared in the years that followed include Joe Raiola, Charlie Kadau, Tony Barbieri, Scott Bricher, Tom Bunk, John Caldwell, Desmond Devlin, Drew Friedman, Barry Liebmann, Kevin Pope, Scott Maiko, Hermann Mejia, Tom Richmond, Andrew J. Schwartzberg, Mike Snider, Greg Theakston, Nadina Simon, Rick Tulka, and Bill Wray.\nOn April 1, 1997, the magazine publicized an alleged \"revamp\", ostensibly designed to reach an older, more sophisticated readership. However, \"Salon\"'s David Futrelle opined that such content was very much a part of \"Mad\"'s past:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The October 1971 issue, for example, with its war crimes fold-in and back cover \"mini-poster\" of \"The Four Horsemen of the Metropolis\" (Drugs, Graft, Pollution and Slums). With its Mad Pollution Primer. With its \"Reality Street\" TV satire, taking a poke at the idealized images of interracial harmony on \"Sesame Street\". (\"It's a street of depression,/ Corruption, oppression!/ It's a sadist's dream come true!/ And masochists, too!\") With its \"This is America\" photo feature, contrasting images of heroic astronauts with graphic photos of dead soldiers and junkies shooting up. I remember this issue pretty well; it was one of the ones I picked up at a garage sale and read to death. I seem to remember asking my parents what \"graft\" was. One of the joys of \"Mad\" for me at the time was that it was always slightly over my head. From \"Mad's Up-Dated Modern Day Mother Goose\" I learned about Andy Warhol, Spiro Agnew and Timothy Leary (\"Wee Timmy Leary/ Soars through the sky/ Upward and Upward/ Till he's, oh, so, high/ Since this rhyme's for kiddies/ How do we explain/ That Wee Timmy Leary/ Isn't in a plane?\"). From \"Greeting Cards for the Sexual Revolution\" I learned about \"Gay Liberationists\" and leather-clad \"Sex Fetishists.\" I read the \"Mad\" versions of a whole host of films I never in a million years would have been allowed to see: \"Easy Rider\" (\"Sleazy Riders\"), \"Midnight Cowboy\" (\"Midnight Wowboy\"), \"Five Easy Pieces\" (\"Five Easy Pages [and two hard ones].\") I learned about the John Birch Society and Madison Avenue.\n\"Mad\" editor John Ficarra acknowledged that changes in culture made the task of creating fresh satire more difficult, telling an interviewer, \"The editorial mission statement has always been the same: 'Everyone is lying to you, including magazines. Think for yourself. Question authority.' But it's gotten harder, as they've gotten better at lying and getting in on the joke.\"\n\"Mad\" contributor Tom Richmond has responded to critics who say the magazine's decision to accept advertising would make late publisher William Gaines \"turn over in his grave\", pointing out this is impossible because Gaines was cremated.\nContributors.\n\"Mad\" is known for the stability and longevity of its talent roster, billed as \"The Usual Gang of Idiots\", with several creators enjoying 30-, 40- and even 50-year careers in the magazine's pages.\nAccording to the \"Mad Magazine Contributor Appearances\" website, more than 960 contributors have received bylines in at least one issue of \"Mad\", but only 41 of those have contributed to 100 issues or more. Writer-artist Al Jaffee has appeared in the most issues; No. 550 (April 2018) was the 500th issue with new work by Jaffee. The other three contributors to have appeared in more than 400 issues of \"Mad\" are Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Dick DeBartolo, and Mort Drucker; Dave Berg, Paul Coker, and Frank Jacobs have each topped the 300 mark.\nJaffee, Aragon\u00e9s, Berg, Don Edwing and Don Martin are the five writer-artists to have appeared in the largest total of issues; DeBartolo, Jacobs, Desmond Devlin, Stan Hart, and Tom Koch are the five most frequent writers, and Drucker, Coker, Bob Clarke, Angelo Torres and George Woodbridge are the five top illustrators on the list. (The list calculates appearances by issue only, not by individual articles or overall page count; e.g. although Jacobs wrote three separate articles that appeared in issue No. 172, his total is reckoned to have increased by one.)\nEach of the following contributors has created over 100 articles for the magazine:\nWriters:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWriter-Artists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nArtists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPhotographer:\nOver the years, the editorial staff, most notably Al Feldstein, Nick Meglin, John Ficarra, Joe Raiola, and Charlie Kadau have had creative input on countless articles and shaped \"Mad\"'s distinctive satiric voice.\nOther notable contributors.\nAmong the irregular contributors with just a single \"Mad\" byline to their credit are Charles M. Schulz, Chevy Chase, Andy Griffith, Will Eisner, Kevin Smith, J. Fred Muggs, Boris Vallejo, Sir John Tenniel, Jean Shepherd, Winona Ryder, Jimmy Kimmel, Jason Alexander, Walt Kelly, Rep. Barney Frank, Tom Wolfe, Steve Allen, Jim Lee, Jules Feiffer, Donald Knuth, and Richard Nixon, who remains the only President credited with \"writing\" a \"Mad\" article. (The entire text was taken from Nixon's speeches.)\nThose who have contributed twice apiece include Tom Lehrer, Wally Cox, Gustave Dor\u00e9, Danny Kaye, Stan Freberg and Mort Walker. Appearing slightly more frequently were Frank Frazetta (3 bylines), Ernie Kovacs (11), Bob and Ray (12), Henry Morgan (3), and Sid Caesar (4). In its earliest years, before amassing its own staff of regulars, the magazine frequently used outside \"name\" talent. Often, \"Mad\" would simply illustrate the celebrities' preexisting material while promoting their names on the cover. The Bob and Ray association was particularly fruitful. When the magazine learned that Tom Koch was the writer behind the Bob and Ray radio sketches adapted by \"Mad\", Koch was sought out by the editors and ultimately wrote more than 300 \"Mad\" articles over the next 37 years.\nThe magazine has occasionally run guest articles in which notables from show business or comic books have participated. In 1964, an article called \"Comic Strips They'd Really Like To Do\" featured one-shot proposals by cartoonists including Mell Lazarus and Charles M. Schulz. More than once, the magazine has enlisted popular comic book artists such as Frank Miller or Jim Lee to design and illustrate a series of \"Rejected Superheroes.\" In 2008, the magazine got national coverage for its article \"Why George W. Bush is in Favor of Global warming\". Each of the piece's 10 punchlines was illustrated by a different Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist. In 2015, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic served as the magazine's first and only guest editor, writing some material and guiding the content in issue No. 533, while upping his own career \"Mad\" byline total from two to five.\nReprints.\nIn 1955, Gaines began presenting reprints of material for \"Mad\" in black-and-white paperbacks, the first being \"The Mad Reader\". Many of these featured new covers by \"Mad\" cover artist Norman Mingo. This practice continued into the 2000s, with more than 100 \"Mad\" paperbacks published. Gaines made a special effort to keep the entire line of paperbacks in print at all times, and the books were frequently reprinted in new editions with different covers. There were also dozens of \"Mad\" paperbacks featuring entirely new material by the magazine's contributors.\n\"Mad\" also frequently repackaged its material in a long series of \"Special\" format magazines, beginning in 1958 with two concurrent annual series entitled \"The Worst from Mad\" and \"More Trash from Mad\". Later, the \"Special\" issue series expanded to \"Super Special\" editions. Various other titles have been used through the years. These reprint issues were sometimes augmented by exclusive features such as posters, stickers and, on a few occasions, recordings on flexi-disc. A 1972 \"Special\" edition began Mad's including a comic book replica insert, consisting of reprinted material from the magazine's 1952\u20131955 era.\nFacsimile Edition.\nA Facsimile Edition of \"Mad\" #1, reprinting the entire issue (including the original advertisements), was published by DC Comics on June 4, 2024. The official title of the Facsimile Edition, as per the indicia, is \"Mad Magazine 1 (Facsimile Edition),\" whereas the official indicia title of the original publication, in both comic book and magazine format, has always been just \"Mad\" (not \"Mad Magazine\"), and the original \"Mad\" #1 it reprints was not a magazine but a comic book. (The only \"Mad\" #1 that was originally published as a physical magazine was the first issue of the 2018 reboot.)\nSpin-offs.\n\"Mad Kids\".\nBetween 2005 and February 17, 2009, the magazine published 14 issues of \"Mad Kids,\" a spinoff publication aimed at a younger demographic. Reminiscent of Nickelodeon's newsstand titles, it emphasized current kids' entertainment (e.g. \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\", \"Naruto\", \"High School Musical\"), albeit with an impudent voice. Much of the content of \"Mad Kids\" had originally appeared in the parent publication; reprinted material was chosen and edited to reflect grade schoolers' interests. But the quarterly magazine also included newly commissioned articles and cartoons, as well as puzzles, bonus inserts, a calendar, and the other activity-related content that is common to kids' magazines.\nForeign editions.\n\"Mad\" has been published in local versions in many countries, beginning with the United Kingdom in 1959, and Sweden in 1960. Each new market receives access to the publication's back catalog of articles and is also encouraged to produce its own localized material in the \"Mad\" vein. However, the sensibility of the American \"Mad\" has not always translated to other cultures, and many of the foreign editions have had short lives or interrupted publications. The Swedish, Danish, Italian and Mexican \"Mad\"s were each published on three separate occasions; Norway has had four runs canceled. Brazil also had four runs, but without significant interruptions, spanning five decades. Australia (42 years), United Kingdom (35 years), and Sweden (34 years) have produced the longest uninterrupted \"Mad\" variants.\nDefunct foreign editions\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nConflicts over content have occasionally arisen between the parent magazine and its international franchisees. When a comic strip satirizing the British royal family was reprinted in a \"Mad\" paperback, it was deemed necessary to rip out the page from 25,000 copies by hand before the book could be distributed in Great Britain. But \"Mad\" was also protective of its own editorial standards. Bill Gaines sent \"one of his typically dreadful, blistering letters\" to his Dutch editors after they published a bawdy gag about a men's room urinal. \"Mad\" has since relaxed its requirements, and while the U.S. version still eschews overt profanity, the magazine generally poses no objections to more provocative content.\nOther satiric-comics magazines.\nFollowing the success of \"Mad\", other black-and-white magazines of topical, satiric comics began to be published. Most were short-lived. The three longest-lasting were \"Cracked\", \"Sick\", and \"Crazy Magazine\". These three and many others featured a cover mascot along the lines of Alfred E. Neuman.\nColor comic-book competitors, primarily in the mid-to-late 1950s, were \"Nuts!\", \"Get Lost\", \"Whack\", \"Riot\", \"Flip\", \"Eh!\", \"From Here to Insanity\", and \"Madhouse\"; only the last of these lasted as many as eight issues, and some were canceled after an issue or two. Later color satiric comic books included \"Wild\", \"Blast\", \"Parody\", \"Grin\" and \"Gag!\". EC Comics itself offered the color comic \"Panic\", produced by future \"Mad\" editor Al Feldstein. Two years after EC's \"Panic\" had ceased publication in 1956, the title was used by another publisher for a similar comic.\nIn 1967, Marvel Comics produced the first of 13 issues of the comic book \"Not Brand Echh\", which parodied the company's own superhero titles as well as other publishers. From 1973 to 1976, DC Comics published the comic \"Plop!\", which featured \"Mad\" stalwart Sergio Aragon\u00e9s and frequent cover art by Basil Wolverton. Another publisher's comic was \"Trash\" (1978) featured a blurb on the debut cover reading, \"We mess with \"Mad\" (p. 21)\" and depicted Alfred E. Neuman with a stubbly beard; the fourth and last issue showed two bodybuilders holding up copies of \"Mud\" and \"Crocked\" with the frowning faces of Neuman and \"Cracked\" cover mascot Sylvester P. Smythe.\nAmong other U.S. humor magazines that included some degree of comics art as well as text articles were former \"Mad\" editor Harvey Kurtzman's \"Trump\", \"Humbug\" and \"Help!\", as well as \"National Lampoon\".\nIn 2019 \"Mad\" contributor Andrew Goldfarb started \"Freaky,\" a humor magazine in tribute to \"Mad\", featuring several other artists who had worked on \"Mad\" and \"Cracked\".\nVirginia Commonwealth University's Cabell Library has an extensive collection of \"Mad\" along with other comic books and graphic novels.\n\"Claptrap\".\nWith \"Mad\" ceasing the regular publication of new material after 2019, including film parodies, in future issues, the magazine's veteran writer Desmond Devlin and caricaturist Tom Richmond announced that they would be teaming up to create \"Claptrap\", a book full of twelve brand new movie parodies done in the classic \"Mad\" style. The movies are classics that \"Mad\" did not parody when they were first released. First scheduled to be released in November 2021, it was delayed four times, first to March, then August, then December 2022, and finally to June 2023.\nIn other media.\nOver the years, \"Mad\" has branched out from print into other media. During the Gaines years, the publisher had an aversion to exploiting his fan base and expressed the fear that substandard \"Mad\" products would offend them. He was known to personally issue refunds to anyone who wrote to the magazine with a complaint. Among the few outside \"Mad\" items available in its first 40 years were cufflinks, a T-shirt designed like a straitjacket (complete with lock), and a small ceramic Alfred E. Neuman bust. For decades, the letters page advertised an inexpensive portrait of Neuman (\"suitable for framing or for wrapping fish\") with misleading slogans such as \"Only 1 Left!\" (The joke being that the picture was so undesirable that only one had left their office since the last ad.) After Gaines' death came an overt absorption into the Time-Warner publishing umbrella, with the result that \"Mad\" merchandise began to appear more frequently. Items were displayed in the Warner Bros. Studio Stores, and in 1994 \"The Mad Style Guide\" was created for licensing use.\nRecordings.\n\"Mad\" has sponsored or inspired a number of recordings.\n1950s.\nIn 1959, Bernie Green \"with the Stereo Mad-Men\" recorded the album \"Musically Mad\" for RCA Victor, featuring humorous music, mostly instrumental, with an image of Alfred E. Neuman on the cover; it was nominated for the Grammy for Best Comedy Recording - Musical and has been reissued on CD. That same year, \"The Worst from Mad\" No. 2 included an original recording, \"Meet the staff of Mad\", on a cardboard 33 rpm record, while a single credited to Alfred E. Neuman &amp; The Furshlugginger Five: \"What \u2013 Me Worry?\" (b/w \"Potrzebie\"), was issued in late 1959 on the ABC Paramount label.\n1960s.\nTwo full vinyl LP records were released under the aegis of \"Mad\" in the early 1960s: \"Mad \"Twists\" Rock 'N' Roll\" (1962) and \"Fink Along With Mad\" (1963; the title being a takeoff on the then-popular TV show \"Sing Along With Mitch\", with \"\" being a general insult then current in American slang).\nIn 1961, New York City doo-wop group The Dellwoods (recording then as the \"Sweet Sickteens\") had released a novelty single on RCA Victor, written by Norman Blagman and Sam Bobrick, \"The Pretzel\" (a satiric take on then-current dance songs such as \"The Twist\"), b/w \"Agnes (The Teenage Russian Spy)\". Both songs were later included on \"Mad \"Twists\" Rock 'N' Roll\". (The Sweet Sickteens were Victor Buccellato (lead singer), Mike Ellis (tenor), Andy Ventura (tenor), Amadeo Tese (baritone), and Saul Zeskand (bass),\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nIn 1962, the Dellwoods (as they were now named), along with vocalists Mike Russo and Jeanne Hayes, recorded an entire album of novelty songs by Bobrick and Blagman. The album had originally been written and produced as a Dellwoods album for RCA, but was instead sold to \"Mad\" and released on Bigtop Records as \"Mad \"Twists\" Rock 'N' Roll\". There was a strong \"Mad\" tie in \u2013 besides the title, a portrait of Alfred E. Neuman was featured prominently on the cover, and \"(She Got A) Nose Job\" from the album was bound as a flexi disc into an issue of \"Mad\". None of the material, however, referenced \"Mad\" magazine, Alfred E. Neuman, or any other \"Mad\" tropes or features, having been recorded before the sale by RCA. Other songs on the album included \"(Throwing The) High School Basketball Game\", \"Please Betty Jean (Shave Your Legs)\", \"Somebody Else's Dandruff (On My Lover-Baby's Shirt)\". \"Agnes (The Teenage Russian Spy)\" and \"The Pretzel\" (now titled as \"Let's Do The Pretzel (And End Up Like One!))\".\nThis was followed by another Dellwoods Bigtop release, \"Fink Along With Mad\", again with Russo and Hayes, written by Bobrick and Blagman, and tied in with \"Mad\", in 1963. Album tracks included \"She Lets Me Watch Her Mom And Pop Fight\" which was bound as a flexi-disc into an issue of \"Mad\" (the performance credited to Mike Russo, and described by Josiah Hughes as \"one dark pop song\" since it makes light of domestic assault, with lyrics such as \"To see a lamp go through the window / And watch them kick and scratch and bite / I love her, I love her, oh boy how I love her / 'Cause she lets me watch her mom and pop fight.\")\nOther songs on \"Fink Along With Mad\" included \"I'll Never Make Fun of Her Moustache Again\", \"When the Braces on our Teeth Lock\", and \"Loving A Siamese Twin\". This album also featured a song titled \"It's a Gas\", which punctuated an instrumental track with belches (these \"vocals\" being credited to Alfred E. Neuman), along with a saxophone break by an uncredited King Curtis). Dr. Demento featured this gaseous performance on his radio show in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. \"Mad\" included some of these tracks as plastic-laminated cardboard inserts and (later) flexi discs with their reprint \"Mad Specials\".\n\"Don't Put Onions On Your Hamburger\" from the album was released as a single, credited to just the Dellwoods, and in 1963 the Dellwoods renamed themselves to the Dynamics and released a serious non-novelty single for Liberty Records, \"Chapel On A Hill\" backed with \"Conquistador\".\n1970s and later.\nA number of original recordings also were released in this way in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as \"Gall in the Family Fare\" (a radio play adaptation of their previously illustrated \"All in the Family\" parody), a single entitled \"Makin' Out\", the octuple-grooved track \"It's a Super Spectacular Day\", which had eight possible endings, the spoken word \"Meet the staff\" insert, and a six-track, 30-minute \"Mad Disco\" EP (from the 1980 special of the same title) that included a disco version of \"It's a Gas\". The last turntable-playable recording \"Mad\" packaged with its magazines was \"A Mad Look at Graduation\", in a 1982 special. A CD-ROM containing several audio tracks was included with issue No. 350 (October 1996). Rhino Records compiled a number of \"Mad\"-recorded tracks as \"Mad Grooves\" (1996).\nStage show.\nAn Off-Broadway production, \"The Mad Show\", was first staged in 1966. The show, which lasted for 871 performances during its initial run, featured sketches written by \"Mad\" regulars Stan Hart and Larry Siegel interspersed with comedic songs (one of which was written by an uncredited Stephen Sondheim). The cast album is available on CD.\nGaming.\nIn 1979, \"Mad\" released a board game. \"The Mad Magazine Game\" was an absurdist version of \"Monopoly\" in which the first player to lose all his money and go bankrupt was the winner. Profusely illustrated with artwork by the magazine's contributors, the game included a $1,329,063 bill that could not be won unless one's name was \"Alfred E. Neuman\". It also featured a deck of cards (called \"Card cards\") with bizarre instructions, such as \"If you can jump up and stay airborne for 37 seconds, you can lose $5,000. If not, jump up and lose $500.\" In 1980 a second game was released: \"The Mad Magazine Card Game\" by Parker Brothers. In it, the player who first loses all their cards is declared the winner. The game is fairly similar to \"Uno\" by Mattel. Questions based on the magazine also appeared in the 1999 \"Trivial Pursuit: Warner Bros. Edition\" (which featured questions based around Time-Warner properties, including WB films and TV shows, the \"Looney Tunes\"/\"Merrie Melodies\" cartoons (and follow-up projects from Warner Bros. Animation)), as well as DC Comics, Hanna-Barbera, Cartoon Network and assorted MGM properties owned by Turner Entertainment Co. that WB had come into possession of following the 1996 Turner/Time-Warner merger.\nFilm and television.\n\"Mad\" lent its name in 1980 to the risque comedy \"Up the Academy\". \"Up the Academy\" was such a commercial debacle and critical failure that \"Mad\" successfully arranged for all references to the magazine (including a cameo by Alfred E. Neuman) to be removed from future TV and video releases of the film, although these references were eventually restored on the DVD version, which was titled \"Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy\".\nIn 1974, a \"Mad\" animated television pilot using selected material from the magazine was commissioned by ABC, but the network decided not to broadcast it. Dick DeBartolo noted, \"Nobody wanted to sponsor a show that made fun of products that were advertised on TV, like car manufacturers.\" The program was instead reworked into \"The Mad Magazine TV Special\", which also went unbroadcast for the same reasons. The special was made by Focus Entertainment Inc., and was available for online viewing in SD quality \nuntil 2022, when a 2K resolution scan of a 16mm film print was released online; The print was provided by one of the special's animators.\nIn the mid-1980s, Hanna-Barbera developed another potential \"Mad\" animated television series that was never broadcast.\nIn 1995, Fox Broadcasting Company's \"Mad TV\" licensed the use of the magazine's logo and characters. However, aside from short bumpers which animated existing \"Spy vs. Spy\" (1994\u20131998) and Don Martin (1995\u20132000) cartoons during the show's first three seasons, there was no editorial or stylistic connection between the TV show and the magazine. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sketch comedy series was in the vein of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" and Global/CBC's \"SCTV\", and ran for 14 seasons and 321 episodes. On January 12, 2016, The CW aired an hour-long special celebrating the series' 20th anniversary. A large portion of the original cast returned. An eight-episode revival featuring a brand new cast premiered on July 26, 2016.\nAnimated \"Spy vs. Spy\" sequences were also seen in TV ads for Mountain Dew soda in 2004.\nIn September 2010, Cartoon Network began airing the animated series \"Mad\", from Warner Bros. Animation and executive producer Sam Register. Produced by Kevin Shinick and Mark Marek, the series was composed of animated shorts and sketches lampooning current television shows, films, games and other aspects of popular culture, in a similar manner to the adult stop-motion animated sketch comedy \"Robot Chicken\" (of which Shinick was formerly a writer and is currently a recurring voice actor); in fact, \"Robot Chicken\" co-creator Seth Green occasionally provided voices on \"Mad\" as well. Critics and viewers have often cited the series as a kid-friendly version of \"Robot Chicken\". Much like \"Mad TV\"'s, this series also features appearances by \"Spy vs. Spy\" and Don Martin cartoons. The series ran from September 6, 2010, to December 2, 2013, lasting for four seasons and 103 episodes.\nVideo games.\nIn 1984, the \"Spy vs. Spy\" characters were given their own video game series in which players can set traps for each other. The games were made for various computer systems such as the Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System. Whereas the original game took place in a nondescript building, the sequels transposed the action to a desert island for \"Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper\" and a polar setting for \"Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics\".\nNot to be confused with the later television show, \"Mad TV\" is a television station management simulation computer game produced in 1991 by Rainbow Arts for the Mad franchise. It was released on the PC and the Amiga. It is faithful to the magazine's general style of cartoon humor but does not include any of the original characters except for a brief closeup of Alfred E. Neuman's eyes during the opening screens.\nAnother \"Spy vs. Spy\" video game was made in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. A \"Mad\" app was released for iPad on April 1, 2012. It displayed the contents of each new issue beginning with \"Mad\" No. 507, as well as video clips from Cartoon Network's \"Mad\", and material from the magazine's website, \"The Idiotical\".\nComputer software.\nIn 1996, \"Mad\" No. 350 included a CD-ROM featuring \"Mad\"-related software as well as three audio files. In 1999, Broderbund/The Learning Company released \"Totally Mad,\" a Microsoft Windows 95/98-compatible CD-ROM set collecting the magazine's content from No. 1 through No. 376 (December 1998), plus over 100 \"Mad Specials\" including most of the recorded audio inserts. Despite the title, it omitted a handful of articles due to problems clearing the rights on some book excerpts and text taken from recordings, such as Andy Griffith's \"What It Was, Was Football\". In 2006, Graphic Imaging Technology's DVD-ROM \"Absolutely Mad\" updated the original \"Totally Mad\" content through 2005.

He is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two BAFTA Awards. Known for his versatility as an actor, Cage's work across diverse film genres has gained him a significant cult following. Films in which he has appeared have grossed over $6.4 billion worldwide.\nBorn into the Coppola family, Cage began his career in films such as \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" (1982) and \"Valley Girl\" (1983), as well as various films by his uncle Francis Ford Coppola such as \"Rumble Fish\" (1983), \"The Cotton Club\" (1984), and \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" (1986). He received critical success for his roles in \"Moonstruck\" and \"Raising Arizona\" (both 1987), before earning an Academy Award for Best Actor for the dramatic film \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995). He was Oscar-nominated for playing twins Charlie and Donald Kaufman in the comedy-drama film \"Adaptation\" (2002).\nCage established himself in mainstream action films, such as \"The Rock\" (1996), \"Con Air\" (1997), \"Face/Off\" (1997), \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" (2000), the \"National Treasure\" film series (2004\u20132007), the \"Ghost Rider\" film series (2007\u20132011), and \"Kick-Ass\" (2010). He also took on dramatic roles in \"City of Angels\" (1998), \"Bringing Out the Dead\" (1999), \"The Family Man\" (2000), \"Matchstick Men\" (2003), and \"The Wicker Man\" (2006). He has voiced characters in \"The Ant Bully\" (2006), \"Astro Boy\" (2009), \"The Croods\" film series (2013\u20132020), \"Teen Titans Go! To the Movies\" and \"\" (both 2018). He earned renewed critical recognition for his starring roles in \"Mandy\" (2018), \"Pig\" (2021), \"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\" (2022), \"Dream Scenario\" (2023) and \"Longlegs\" (2024).\nCage owns the production company Saturn Films and has produced films such as \"Shadow of the Vampire\" (2000) and \"The Life of David Gale\" (2003), and has directed \"Sonny\" (2002). For his contributions to the film industry, he was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998. He was ranked No. 40 in \"Empire\" magazine's The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time list in 2007 and was placed No. 37 in \"Premiere\"'s 100 Most Powerful People in Hollywood in 2008. Nicolas Cage was also voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a 2022 readers' poll by \"Empire\" magazine.\nEarly life and family.\nCage was born in Long Beach, California, to August Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy Vogelsang, a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of mainly German and Polish descent with some English and Scottish ancestry on her father's side. His paternal grandparents were composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino, and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda, Basilicata. Through his father, he is a nephew of both director Francis Ford Coppola and actress Talia Shire, and a cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola, and actors Robert and Jason Schwartzman.\nCage is the youngest of three sons. His two brothers are New York radio personality Marc \"The Cope\" Coppola and director Christopher Coppola. He attended Beverly Hills High School, which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of \"Golden Boy\". He said he started acting because he \"wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in \"Rebel Without a Cause\", \"East of Eden\". Nothing affected me\u2014no rock song, no classical music\u2014the way Dean affected me in \"Eden\". It blew my mind. I was like, 'That's what I want to do'.\"\nAt age 15, he tried to convince his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, to give him a screen test, telling him \"I'll show you acting.\" His outburst was met with \"silence in the car.\" By this stage of his career, Coppola had already directed Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Gene Hackman and Robert De Niro. Although early in his career Cage appeared in some of his uncle's films, he changed his name to Nicolas Cage to avoid the appearance of nepotism as Coppola's nephew. His choice of name was inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage and composer John Cage.\nCareer.\n1981\u20131988: Early work and breakthrough.\nCage made his acting debut in the 1981 television pilot \"The Best of Times\", which was never picked up by ABC. His film debut followed in 1982, with a minor role as an unnamed co-worker of Judge Reinhold's character in the coming-of-age film \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\", having originally auditioned for Reinhold's part. His experience on the film was marred by cast members endlessly quoting his uncle's films, which inspired him to change his name. Cage's first starring role came opposite Deborah Foreman in the romantic comedy \"Valley Girl\" (1983), in which he played a punk who falls in love with the titular valley girl, a plot loosely inspired by \"Romeo and Juliet\". The film was a modest box office success and has been branded a cult classic. He auditioned for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle's film \"The Outsiders\", based on S.E. Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon. Cage, however, would co-star in Coppola's adaptation of another Hinton novel, \"Rumble Fish\", in that year.\nIn 1984, Cage appeared in three period films, none of which fared well at the box office. In the drama, \"Racing with the Moon\" (1984), Cage featured opposite Sean Penn as friends who are awaiting deployment to the United States Marine Corps. In Coppola's crime drama \"The Cotton Club\" he portrayed a fictionalized version of mob hitman Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll, earning praise from critic Paul Attanasio for \"artfully [using] his few moments to sketch a brawny, violent thug.\" His final release of the year was Alan Parker's drama \"Birdy\", in which he starred with Matthew Modine. Cage lost weight for the role and had two of his front teeth pulled out to appear disfigured. Despite massively underperforming at the box office, the film, and Cage and Modine's performances, received positive reviews, with \"The New York Times\" critic Janet Maslin writing, \"Mr. Cage very sympathetically captures Al's urgency and frustration. Together, these actors work miracles with what might have been unplayable.\"\nIn 1986, Cage starred in the little-seen Canadian sports drama \"The Boy in Blue\" and his uncle's fantasy comedy \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" (1986) as the husband to Kathleen Turner's character. He then starred in the Coen brothers' crime comedy \"Raising Arizona\" (1987) as a dim-witted ex-con. Cage's biggest breakthrough came in 1987 with the romantic comedy \"Moonstruck\", in which he starred alongside Cher as a hot-tempered baker. The film was a hit with critics and audiences alike, earning Cage a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy In his retrospective review, Roger Ebert wrote that he felt Cage's performance was worthy of an Oscar.\n1989\u20131994: Career slump.\nIn 1989, Cage starred in the black comedy \"Vampire's Kiss\" as a man who falls in love with a vampire and soon begins to believe himself as a vampire. The film was a major box office flop but has developed a cult following largely due to Cage's surrealistic and over-the-top performance appearing in internet memes. Critic Vincent Canby felt the film was \"dominated and destroyed by Mr. Cage's chaotic, self-indulgent performance.\" After filming the Italian drama \"Time to Kill\" (1989) in Zimbabwe, he starred in David Lynch's romantic crime film \"Wild at Heart\" (1990) with Laura Dern. Cage was drawn to the project because he was \"always attracted to those passionate, almost unbridled romantic characters\" and it allowed him to impersonate one of his heroes, Elvis Presley, in scenes in which he sang. \"Wild at Heart\" received mixed reviews upon release, despite controversially winning the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. Cage would reunite with Lynch and Dern for the avant-garde concert performance \"Industrial Symphony No. 1\".\nAlso in 1990, he starred as a helicopter pilot in the action film \"Fire Birds\", which was panned by critics and negatively compared to \"Top Gun\" (1986). Cage's next film, the erotic thriller \"Zandalee\" (1991), was released direct-to-video in the United States, where it did not receive a theatrical release. His \"goofy 'everyman'\" performance in the romantic comedy \"Honeymoon in Vegas\" (1992) garnered some positive critical notices, including from Roger Ebert, who defended Cage amidst some critics finding his acting \"excessive\" and earned Cage his second Golden Globe nomination. He hosted an episode of the variety show \"Saturday Night Live\" to promote the film, his only time hosting the show.\nNone of Cage's three films in 1993\u2014\"Deadfall\" (directed by his brother Christopher), \"Amos &amp; Andrew\" and \"Red Rock West\"\u2014performed well at the box office. The comedy \"Guarding Tess\" (1994) paired Cage with Shirley MacLaine as a Secret Service agent protecting a former First Lady; however, it was dismissed as being derivative by some critics. He next starred alongside Bridget Fonda in the romantic comedy \"It Could Happen to You\" as a cash-strapped police officer who offers to share his lottery winnings with a waitress and then the much-criticized box office flop Christmas comedy \"Trapped in Paradise\" with the \"Saturday Night Live\" actors Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey. According to Lovitz, Cage directed portions of the film because its director, George Gallo, offered little direction.\n1995\u20132003: Critical success and action star.\nCage's performance as a psychopathic criminal kingpin in the crime film \"Kiss of Death\" (1995) was seen by many critics as the film's strong point, but his most acclaimed performance yet came in the drama \"Leaving Las Vegas\" as an alcoholic screenwriter who falls in love with a prostitute in Las Vegas. The role won Cage the Academy Award for Best Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama. To prepare for the part, Cage binge drank for two weeks and studied footage of himself.\nIn 1996, he starred alongside Sean Connery and Ed Harris in Michael Bay's \"The Rock\", the first of a string of action films for Cage. In the film, he played an FBI chemical weapons specialist breaking into Alcatraz federal prison. \"The Rock\" was a box office and critical success, with journalist Alexander Larman stating the film \"launched Cage into an unexpected vocation as an offbeat action star.\" Next, he starred in \"Con Air\" and \"Face/Off\", two commercially successful action thrillers that were both released in June 1997. In \"Con Air\", Cage led an ensemble cast along with John Cusack and John Malkovich. Jerry Bruckheimer, \"Con Air\"'s producer, offered the role to Cage after being impressed with his performances in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" and \"The Rock\". Cage accepted despite disappointment at not being offered the villain role. Ebert felt Cage \"[made] the wrong choice... by playing Cameron Poe as a slow-witted Elvis type who is very, very earnest and approaches every task with tunnel vision; it would have been more fun if he'd been less of a hayseed.\" John Woo's \"Face/Off\" saw Cage and John Travolta star in dual roles as sworn enemies\u2014a terrorist and an FBI agent\u2014who both undergo face transplants to impersonate each other, requiring Cage and Travolta to switch characters. Both performances were praised by critics, with the BBC writing in their review \"Travolta and Cage invest their dual roles with physical subtleties that reflect the other actor's character.\"&lt;ref name=\"Face/OffBBC\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter starring in these action films back-to-back, Cage decided to \"return to more serious fare\" in the romantic fantasy film \"City of Angels\" (1998), a loose remake of the German film \"Wings of Desire\" (1987). Critics were split on the film and Cage's performance, with reviews ranging from describing him as \"endlessly resourceful\" to \"[resembling] a serial killer more than an angel.\" Brian De Palma's thriller \"Snake Eyes\", his second film of 1998, starred Cage as a corrupt detective. The film was met with mixed reviews, which were largely critical of its screenplay. Cage starred in Martin Scorsese's 1999 New York City paramedic drama \"Bringing Out the Dead\". \nMost of Cage's movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre. These include \"The Rock\", \"Con Air\", \"Face/Off\", and \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" (2000), with Cage as a retired car thief. He took the lead role in the 2000 romantic comedy film \"The Family Man\", in which he played a man forced to deal with an alternate life that had a plot similar to the Christmas movie \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), and the 2001 war film \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\" where he learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part. In 2002, he was again nominated for Oscar and Golden Globe best actor awards for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman's fictional twin Donald in \"Adaptation.\" \nCage made his directorial debut in 2002 with \"Sonny\", a low-budget drama starring James Franco as a male prostitute whose mother (Brenda Blethyn) serves as his pimp. Cage had a small role in the film, which received poor reviews and a short run in a limited number of theaters. Cage's producing career includes \"Shadow of the Vampire\" (2000), the first effort from Saturn Films. He starred in Ridley Scott's 2003 black comedy crime film \"Matchstick Men\", in which he played a con artist with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder.\n2004\u20132011: Franchise films.\nIn his second-highest-grossing film to date, \"National Treasure\" (2004), Cage played an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States. In 2005, two films he headlined, \"Lord of War\" and \"The Weather Man\", failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his performances. The 2006 remake of \"The Wicker Man\" was very poorly reviewed, and failed to make back its $40-million budget. In early December 2006, Cage announced at the Bahamas International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors to pursue other interests. On \"The Dresden Files\" for the Sci-Fi Channel, Cage is listed as the executive producer. The much-criticized \"Ghost Rider\" (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, fared better, earning more than $45\u00a0million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208\u00a0million worldwide through the weekend ending on March 25, 2007. Also in 2007, he had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu in Rob Zombie's fake trailer \"Werewolf Women of the S.S.\" from the B-movie double feature \"Grindhouse\", starred in \"Next\", which shared the concept of a glimpse into an alternate timeline with Cage's previous film, \"The Family Man\", and reprised his role as a treasure hunter in \"\".\nIn November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a \"Ring of Honor\" wrestling show in New York City researching for the lead role for \"The Wrestler\". However, Cage dropped out of production shortly afterward because he felt that he did not have enough time to prepare for the role and director Darren Aronofsky preferred Mickey Rourke for the lead role. Rourke would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance. In an interview with /Film, Aronofsky said of Cage's decision to leave the film that \"Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.\"\nIn 2008, Cage appeared as Joe, a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok, in the film \"Bangkok Dangerous\". The film is shot by the Pang Brothers and has a distinctly South-East Asian flavor. In 2009, Cage starred in the science fiction thriller \"Knowing\", directed by Alex Proyas. In the film, he plays an MIT professor who examines the contents of a time capsule unearthed at his son's elementary school. Startling predictions found inside the capsule that have already come true lead him to believe that the world is going to end at the close of the week and that he and his son are somehow involved in the destruction. The film received mixed reviews but was the box office winner on its opening weekend.\nAlso in 2009, Cage starred in the film \"\", directed by acclaimed German director Werner Herzog. He portrayed a corrupt police officer with gambling, drug and alcohol addictions. The film was very well received by critics, holding a rating of 87% positive reviews on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Cage was lauded for his performance, with Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" writing \"Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest.\" This film reunited Cage with Eva Mendes, who played his love interest in \"Ghost Rider\". In 2010, Cage starred in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", in which he played the sorcerer, and the next year, headlined the period piece \"Season of the Witch\", as a 14th-century knight transporting a woman accused of causing the Black Plague to a monastery. In 2011, Cage reprised his role in \"Ghost Rider's\" sequel \".\"\n2012\u20132017: Career setbacks.\nIn 2013, Cage was involved in many projects. Notable films including animated film \"The Croods\", in which he voiced a character named Grug Crood. \"The Croods\" received positive reviews from critics and was a box-office success grossing $585\u00a0million against a budget of $135\u00a0million. He starred as main character in \"The Frozen Ground\", a thriller crime drama film directed and written by Scott Walker in his directorial debut, based on the crimes of real-life Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen. The film, reunited him with Cusack, depicts an Alaskan State Trooper, played by Cage, seeking to apprehend Hansen, played by Cusack, by partnering with a young woman who escaped from Hansen's clutches. The film has received mixed reviews though Cage's performance was cited as a highlight and solid. He also starred in \"Joe\", an independent crime drama film directed and co-produced by David Gordon Green, adaptation from Larry Brown's 1991 novel of the same name. In this film Nicolas Cage is a tormented man who hires a 15-year-old boy (played by Tye Sheridan) and protects him from his abusive father. The film premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 30, 2013, with a subsequent screening at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. It was a box office flop, grossing only $2.36\u00a0million from a $4\u00a0million budget, but received critical acclaim from critics, who praised Cage's performance and Green's direction.\nThe 2016 black comedy \"Dog Eat Dog\", Cage's second film with Paul Schrader, reunited him with Willem Dafoe (after \"Wild at Heart\") as a pair of ex-convicts hired to kidnap a baby. The film had its premiere as the closing entry for the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2016. It was released on November 4, 2016, in the United States. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" gave the film four out of five stars, writing, \"It's the right director for the right project and the result is Schrader's best for years: a lairy, nasty, tasty crime thriller built on black-comic chaos.\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"A rare film to have been shot in Cleveland, \"Dog Eat Dog\" definitely looks like it was shot on the cheap but puts what it needs to up on the screen with vigor and wit.\"\nCage starred alongside Selma Blair and Anne Winters in Brian Taylor's horror comedy film, \"Mom and Dad\", which premiered in the Midnight Madness section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in theaters on January 19, 2018, and received positive reviews from critics, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes defining his performance as \"over-the-top.\" Director John Waters appreciated the film, naming \"Mom and Dad\" as one of the best movies of 2018, placing it fourth on his personal top list.\n2018\u2013present: Critical resurgence.\nIn 2018, Cage starred in the action thriller film \"Mandy\", which premiered on January 19 at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. Nick Allen of \"RogerEbert.com\" praised the movie, writing that \"for all of the endless feral performances that Cage has given, in movies good, bad and forgettable, Cosmatos' style-driven, '80s-tastic passion for weird worlds and characters takes full advantage of Cage's greatness, and then some.\" In October, \"Mandy\"'s producer Elijah Wood announced his intention to size up an Oscar campaign for Nicolas Cage and for composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson (who died in February of that year) but the film was disqualified because it was also released on Video On Demand on September 14.\nLater that year, Cage voiced Clark Kent / Superman in the animated film \"Teen Titans Go! To the Movies\". He had originally been slated to portray Superman in Tim Burton's canceled Superman film, \"Superman Lives\", in the 1990s. He voiced an alternate monochromatic 1930s universe version of Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir in \"\" (2018). Cage based his vocal performance on films of Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson. On January 28, 2019, Viktor and Irina Yelchin premiered a documentary about their son Anton Yelchin, \"Love, Antosha\", at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The documentary was directed by Garret Price and contains various interviews with some of Anton's friends and collaborators such as Kristen Stewart, J. J. Abrams, Chris Pine, Jennifer Lawrence, Jodie Foster, John Cho and Martin Landau. Cage starred as the Narrator of the film, reading various writings by Yelchin.\nIn December 2018, it was announced that Cage had signed to play the lead role for Richard Stanley's \"Color Out of Space\", based on the short story \"The Colour Out of Space\" by H. P. Lovecraft. This was Stanley's first feature film directed since his firing from \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" (1996). \"Color Out of Space\" premiered on September 7, 2019, in the Midnight Madness portion of the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, where Cage was awarded for his role with the Creative Coalition's Spotlight Initiative Award. Following select preview screenings on January 22, the film was released in 81 theaters in the United States on January 24, 2020.\nIn December 2018, it was announced that Sion Sono was working on his first overseas production and English-language debut, \"Prisoners of the Ghostland\", starring Nicolas Cage. Cage said the film \"might be the wildest movie I've ever made.\" Its plot revolves around a notorious criminal, Hero (played by Cage), who is sent to rescue the governor's adopted granddaughter, who has disappeared into a dark region called Ghostland. The film had its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on January 31, 2021.\nIn May 2020, it was announced that Cage would be playing the role of Joe Exotic in a scripted eight-episode \"Tiger King\" series, written and executive produced by Dan Lagana.

He has said it is to increase one's imagination without restraint, in avoidance of experiencing the sense of being ingenuous.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The process itself is about: How do you augment your imagination in a healthy way? So that you can believe you're these characters\u2026 You don't feel like you're acting, you feel like you're being.\u2014\u200a\nIn the film \"Vampire's Kiss\" Cage moved from method acting to \"Nouveau Shamanic.\" The scene where Cage recites the alphabet to his psychiatrist was a result of acting out of impulse. \"Raising Arizona\" showcased the physicality of Nouveau Shamanic. \"\" is a display of how the method leads to impulse decisions fueled by an energy one could only garner naturally. Cage was asked if any of his numerous pets influence his acting, to which he replied \"The cobras, definitely. They would try to hypnotize you by going side to side, and when I did \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\", that's something my character does before he attacks. Animals are fun places to get inspiration.\"\nReception.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"In Cage's hands, cartoonish moments are imbued with real emotion and real emotions become cartoons. Everything \u2013 from individual scenes down to single lines of dialogue \u2013 feel like they have been embraced as opportunities for creation. Cage is usually interesting even when his films are not. He is erratic and unpredictable; he is captivating and he is capricious. He is a performer. He is a troubadour. He is a jazz musician.\"\n \u2014Luke Buckmaster, \"The Guardian\"\nAccording to \"The Guardian\" film critic Luke Buckmaster, \"any casual observer can see that Cage is entertaining, charismatic and wildly flamboyant.\" Attributing it partly to the \"well-cultured\" background of Cage's family, Buckmaster said the actor \"is clearly attracted to grotesque characters and is celebrated for his wild and unhinged approach to them. He has the presence of a leading man, and the eccentricities of a character actor.\" Actor Ethan Hawke stated in 2013 that Cage is \"the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art\", crediting him for taking film audiences \"away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours.\"\nFilm director David Lynch described him as \"the jazz musician of American acting.\" Many critics have accused Cage of overacting. Others, including Cage himself, have described his intentionally extreme performances as \"mega-acting.\" After the actor's series of mainstream-marketed thriller films during the late 1990s, Sean Penn told \"The New York Times\" in 1999 that Cage was \"no longer an actor\" but \"more like a performer.\" Despite this, in his speech after winning the Oscar for his performance in \"Mystic River\", Penn described Cage's performance in \"Matchstick Men\" as one of the best of 2003.\nDuring the 2010s, a growing number of critics described Cage as one of the most underrated actors of his generation.\nActing credits and accolades.\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Cage was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998 with a motion pictures star located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. In May 2001, Cage was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts by California State University, Fullerton. He spoke at the commencement ceremony. Cage has also been nominated for an Academy Award twice. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the film \"Leaving Las Vegas\" in 1995. He was nominated for a second one for his role in the film \"Adaptation\" in 2002.\nHe also won a Golden Globe award, Screen Actors Guild award, and many more awards for \"Leaving Las Vegas\". He has received nominations by the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA for his films \"Adaptation\", \"Honeymoon in Vegas\", and \"Moonstruck.\" He has also won and been nominated for many other awards.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and family.\nIn 1988, Cage began dating actress Christina Fulton, with whom he has a son, Weston Coppola Cage (born in December 26, 1990). Weston has been the vocalist of two symphonic black metal bands, Eyes of Noctrum and Arsh Anubis. Weston also appeared in his father's film \"Lord of War\" as a helicopter mechanic, and in the 2014 film \"Rage\" as Nicolas' character's younger self. Through Weston, Cage has two grandsons born in 2014 and 2016. In July 2024, Weston was arrested for assaulting numerous people with a deadly weapon, including his mother; he was released on a $150,000 bond.\nCage's first wife was actress Patricia Arquette, whom he married in April 1995 and divorced in 2001.\nHis second marriage was to singer-songwriter Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. (Cage, an Elvis fan, used Elvis as the inspiration for his performance in \"Wild at Heart\".) They married in Kamuela, Hawaii, on August 10, 2002, and filed for divorce 107 days later on November 25, 2002. The divorce was finalized on May 24, 2004.\nCage's third wife was Alice Kim. They were married at a private ranch in northern California on July 30, 2004. She gave birth to their son Kal-El in October 3, 2005. They divorced in January 2016.\nIn March 2019, Cage married Erika Koike in Las Vegas, only to file for annulment four days later, stating he was too intoxicated to understand his own actions and that Koike failed to disclose \"the full nature and extent of her relationship with another person.\" He was granted a divorce from Koike three months later.\nOn February 16, 2021, Cage married Riko Shibata. Their daughter August was born in September 7, 2022.\nPolitical views and religious beliefs.\nCage grew up in a family of Catholic background, but does not talk about religion publicly and refuses to answer religion-connected questions in his interviews. When asked about whether he could relate to his character's lack of religious belief in \"Knowing\", Cage replied, \"You know, any of my personal beliefs or opinions run the risk of impinging on your own relationship with the movie. I think movies are best left enigmatic. Left raising more questions than answers. I don't want to ever preach, so that's what you get from a movie; that's far more interesting than anything I could offer.\"\nDuring his visit to University of California, Santa Cruz, he stated that he is not a politically active actor and that he can do it in his work as he learned \"more about nuclear power from the movie \"The China Syndrome\".\" Cage endorsed Andrew Yang for president during the 2020 election.\nAt one point in his life, Cage had decided that he wanted to develop the philosophical aspect of his nature, and he went on a quest to find the Holy Grail. Cage traveled to England to look for it, but also looked at some areas of the United States.\nCharitable activities.\nCage has been called one of the most generous stars in Hollywood. He donated $2\u00a0million to Amnesty International for them to use to offer rehabilitation shelters, medical services and psychological and reintegration services to some of the 300,000 children forced to fight in conflicts across the world. He has also donated $1\u00a0million to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. He became the first artist to support ArtWorks, an artist engagement program to raise awareness of fundamental rights at work, including freedom from slavery and from child labor. During 2023, while filming \"The Surfer\" in Western Australia, Cage personally phoned in an AU$5,000 donation to the Channel Seven Perth Telethon.\nCage has also been honored with a Humanitarian award from the United Nations for his works and appointed as a UN ambassador for Global Justice in 2009 and again in 2013. He led a campaign around the film \"Lord of War\" to raise awareness about international arms control, supported \"Heal the Bay\", the United Negro College Fund efforts, and the Royal United Hospital's Forever Friends Appeal to build intensive care units for babies.\nInterests.\nCage, an avid comic book fan, auctioned a collection of 400 vintage comics through Heritage Auctions for over $1.6\u00a0million in 2002. In 2007, he created a comic book with his son Weston, called \"Voodoo Child\", which was published by Virgin Comics. Cage is a fan and collector of painter and underground comic artist Robert Williams. He has written introductions for \"Juxtapoz\" magazine and purchased the painting \"Death on the Boards\".\nSaturn Films.\nSaturn Films is a production company referred to by one source as \"the production shingle of Nicolas Cage\" and often referred to as \"Cage's Saturn Films\". Michael Nilon has been referred to as Cage's \"producing partner through\" Saturn Films. Norm Golightly was president of the firm for twelve years, ending in 2009. In 2001, Saturn was referred to as \"Intermedia-based\", suggesting it was part of Intermedia, which was defunct as of 2006.\nReal estate and tax problems.\nCage was once considered one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, earning $40\u00a0million in 2009 according to \"Forbes\", although he failed to make \"Forbes\"' Top 10 List in 2014. In 2004 he bought a property on Paradise Island, Bahamas. In May 2006, he bought a island in the Exuma archipelago, some southeast of Nassau and close to a similar island owned by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. He bought the medieval castle Schloss Neidstein in the Oberpfalz region in Germany in 2006 and sold it in 2009 for $2.5\u00a0million. His grandmother was German, living in Cochem an der Mosel.\nIn August 2007, Cage purchased \"Grey Craig\", a brick-and-stone country manor in Middletown, Rhode Island. With an estate occupying , the home has 12 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. It borders the Norman Bird Sanctuary to the west. The sale ranked among the state of Rhode Island's most expensive residential purchases. Also in 2007, Cage purchased Midford Castle in Somerset, England. Shortly after selling his German castle, Cage also put his homes in Rhode Island, Louisiana, Nevada, and California, as well as a $7-million island in the Bahamas, on the market.\nOn July 14, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service filed documents in New Orleans in connection with a federal tax lien against property owned by Cage in Louisiana, concerning unpaid federal taxes. The IRS alleged that Cage failed to pay over $6.2\u00a0million in federal income tax for the year 2007. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service had another lien for more than $350,000 in unpaid taxes dating from 2002 to 2004. Cage filed a $20-million lawsuit on October 16, 2009, against his business manager, Samuel J. Levin, alleging negligence and fraud. The lawsuit stated that Levin \"had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed [Cage] in speculative and risky real estate investments 'resulting in (the actor) suffering catastrophic losses.'\" Cage also faced separate lawsuits from East West Bank and Red Curb Investments for unpaid, multi-million dollar loans.\nSamuel Levin filed a counter-complaint and responded to the lawsuit in a filing stating that he warned Cage that he was living beyond his means and urged him to spend less. Levin's filing states that \"instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Cage (Coppola) spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences.\" Levin's complaint continued: \"Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art.\"\nIn his filing, Levin said that in 2007, Cage's \"shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces), 12 purchases of expensive jewelry, and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items.\" One of those items was a dinosaur skull of a \"Tarbosaurus\". After discovering that it was stolen, he returned it to the Mongolian authorities.\nAccording to Cage, he owned the \"Most Haunted House in America\", a home located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Known as \"The LaLaurie House\" after its former owner Delphine LaLaurie, the house was foreclosed and sold at auction on November 12, 2009, along with another New Orleans property for a total of $5.5\u00a0million, in the wake of Cage's financial problems. His Bel Air home, which had six loans totaling $18\u00a0million on it, failed to sell at an April 2010 foreclosure auction despite an opening offer of $10.4\u00a0million, substantially less than the $35\u00a0million that Cage had originally tried to sell it for. The home, built in 1940 for $110,000 (equivalent to about $\u00a0million in 2024), had been owned at different times by Dean Martin and singer Tom Jones.\nThe home eventually sold in November 2010 for $10.5\u00a0million. Another home in Nevada also faced foreclosure auction. In November 2011, Cage sold his \"Action Comics\" #1 in an online auction managed by Heritage Auctions for a record-breaking $2.16\u00a0million (the previous record being $1.5\u00a0million), to assist paying his tax liens and other debts. Cage purchased the comic in 1997 for $110,000. The comic had been stolen from him in 2000, and Cage had received an insurance payment on the item. In March 2011, it was found in a storage locker in the San Fernando Valley and was verified by ComicConnect.com to be the copy sold to Cage previously. Worth around $25\u00a0million by May 2017, Cage was reportedly \"taking [film] roles left and right\" in order to pay off his remaining debts. By 2022, Cage confirmed that he had finally paid off his debts and intended to be more selective with his film roles.\nLegal issues.\nKathleen Turner wrote in her 2008 memoir, \"Send Your Roses\", that Cage had stolen a chihuahua and was arrested twice for driving drunk while they filmed \"Peggy Sue Got Married\". Later she admitted Cage did not steal a chihuahua and she was sorry. Cage won a libel action against Turner, her publisher Headline Publishing Group, and Associated Newspapers (whose publication the \"Daily Mail\" had repeated the allegations when they published an excerpt from the book).\nChristina Fulton sued Cage in December 2009 for $13\u00a0million and for the house in which she was living. The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling; the order resulted from Cage's financial difficulties. The case was settled in June 2011.\nCage was arrested in New Orleans' French Quarter district on April 15, 2011, for suspicion of domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public intoxication. A police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol. Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by Duane \"Dog\" Chapman. He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011. The New Orleans District Attorney announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped on May 5, 2011."}
{"id": "21113", "revid": "31831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21113", "title": "Napster", "text": "Online peer-to-peer file sharing software\nNapster was an American proprietary peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application primarily associated with digital audio file distribution. Founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, the platform launched on June 1, 1999. Audio shared on the service was typically encoded in the MP3 format. As the software became popular, the company encountered legal difficulties over copyright infringement. Napster shut down in 2001 following a series of lawsuits and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in June 2002.\nThe P2P model employed by Napster involved a centralized database that indexed a complete list of all songs being shared from connected clients. While effective, the service could not function without the central database, which was hosted by Napster and eventually forced to shut down. Following Napster's demise, alternative decentralized methods of P2P file-sharing emerged, including Gnutella, Freenet, FastTrack, I2P, and BitTorrent.\nNapster's assets were eventually acquired by Roxio, and it re-emerged as an online music store commonly known as Napster 2.0. Best Buy later purchased the service, and then went on to sell it to Rhapsody on December 1, 2011. In 2016, the original branding was restored when Rhapsody was renamed Napster. In 2022, the Napster streaming service was acquired by two Web3 companies, Hivemind and Algorand. In March 2025, Napster was sold to Infinite Reality.\nOrigin.\nNapster was founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker. Initially, Napster was envisioned by Fanning as an independent peer-to-peer file sharing service. The service operated between June 1999 and July 2001. Its technology enabled people to easily share their MP3 files with other participants. Although the original service was shut down by court order, the Napster brand survived after the company's assets were liquidated and purchased by other companies through bankruptcy proceedings.\nHistory.\nAlthough there were already networks that facilitated the distribution of files across the Internet, such as IRC, Hotline, and Usenet, Napster specialized in MP3 files of music and had a user-friendly interface. At its peak, the Napster service had about 80 million registered users. Napster made it relatively easy for music enthusiasts to download copies of songs that were otherwise difficult to obtain, such as older songs, unreleased recordings, studio recordings, and songs from concert bootleg recordings. Napster paved the way for streaming media services and transformed music into a public good for a brief time.\nHigh-speed networks in college dormitories became overloaded, with as much as 61% of external network traffic consisting of MP3 file transfers. Many colleges blocked its use for this reason, even before concerns about liability for facilitating copyright violations on campus.\nMacintosh version.\nThe service and software program began as Windows-only. However, in 2000, Black Hole Media wrote a Macintosh client called Macster. Macster was later bought by Napster and designated the official Mac Napster client (\"Napster for the Mac\"), at which point the Macster name was discontinued. Even before the acquisition of Macster, the Macintosh community had a variety of independently developed Napster clients. The most notable was the open source client called MacStar, released by Squirrel Software in early 2000, and Rapster, released by Overcaster Family in Brazil. The release of MacStar's source code paved the way for third-party Napster clients across all computing platforms, giving users advertisement-free music distribution options.\nLegal challenges.\nA demo of the heavy metal band Metallica's song \"I Disappear\" had been circulating across the network before the song's official release. This led to it being played on several radio stations across the United States, which alerted Metallica to the presence of the leaked song, along with the fact that their entire back catalogue of studio material was also available on Napster. On April 13, 2000, they filed a lawsuit against Napster. A month later, rapper and producer Dr. Dre, who shared a litigator and legal firm with Metallica, filed a similar lawsuit after Napster refused his written request to remove his works from its service. Separately, Metallica and Dr. Dre later delivered to Napster thousands of usernames of people who they believed were pirating their songs. In March 2001, Napster settled both suits, after being shut down by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a separate lawsuit from several major record labels (see below). In 2000, Madonna's single \"Music\" was leaked out onto the web and Napster prior to its commercial release, causing widespread media coverage. Verified Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide in February 2001. In that same month, with a court-ordered interim shut-down imminent, Napster went public with a settlement proposal which would have paid the record labels $1 billion over the next five years, with the money coming through a subscription service.\nIn 2000, the American musical recording company A&amp;M Records along with several other recording companies, through the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), sued Napster (\"A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.\") on grounds of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Napster was faced with the following allegations from the music industry:\nNapster lost the case in the District Court but then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Although it was clear that Napster could have commercially significant non-infringing uses, the Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court's decision. Immediately after, the District Court commanded Napster to keep track of the activities of its network and to restrict access to infringing material when informed of that material's location. Napster wasn't able to comply and thus had to close down its service in July 2001. In 2002, Napster announced that it had filed for bankruptcy and sold its assets to a third party. In a 2018 \"Rolling Stone\" article, Kirk Hammett of Metallica upheld the band's opinion that suing Napster was the \"right\" thing to do.\nPromotional power.\nAlong with the accusations that Napster was hurting the sales of the record industry, some felt just the opposite, that file trading on Napster stimulated, rather than hurt, sales. Some evidence may have come in July 2000 when tracks from English rock band Radiohead's album \"Kid A\" found their way to Napster three weeks before the album's release. Unlike Madonna, Dr. Dre, or Metallica, Radiohead had never hit the top 20 in the US. Furthermore, \"Kid A\" was an album without any singles released, and received relatively little radio airplay. By the time of the album's release, the album was estimated to have been downloaded for free by millions of people worldwide, and in October 2000 \"Kid A\" captured the number one spot on the \"Billboard\" 200 sales chart in its debut week. According to Richard Menta of \"MP3 Newswire\", the effect of Napster in this instance was isolated from other elements that could be credited for driving sales, and the album's unexpected success suggested that Napster was a good promotional tool for music.\nSince 2000, some musical artists, particularly those not signed to major labels and without access to traditional mass media outlets such as radio and television, said that Napster and successive Internet file-sharing networks helped get their music heard, spread word of mouth, and may have improved their sales in the long term. One such musician to publicly defend Napster as a promotional tool for independent artists was DJ Xealot, who became directly involved in the 2000 A&amp;M Records Lawsuit. Chuck D from Public Enemy also came out and publicly supported Napster.\nLawsuit.\nNapster's facilitation of the transfer of copyrighted material was objected to by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which filed a lawsuit against the service on December 6, 1999. The legal action, while intended to shut down the service, brought it a great deal of publicity and an influx of millions of new users, many of whom were college students. After a failed appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court, an injunction was issued on March 5, 2001, ordering Napster to prevent the trading of copyrighted music on its network.\nLawrence Lessig claimed, however, that this decision made little sense from the perspective of copyright protection: \"When Napster told the district court that it had developed a technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of identified infringing material, the district court told counsel for Napster 99.4 percent was not good enough. Napster had to push the infringements 'down to zero.' If 99.4 percent is not good enough,\" Lessig concluded, \"then this is a war on file-sharing technologies, not a war on copyright infringement.\"\nShutdown.\nOn July 11, 2001, Napster shut down its entire network to comply with the injunction. One week later, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily overturned the order from the week before and allowed Napster to resume operations, due to Napster saying it could block all but a tiny fraction of unauthorized song-swapping. On September 24, 2001, the case was partially settled. Napster agreed to pay music creators and copyright owners a $26 million settlement for past, unauthorized uses of music, and as an advance against future licensing royalties of $10 million. To pay those fees, Napster attempted to convert its free service into a subscription system, and thus traffic to Napster was reduced. A prototype solution was tested in 2002: the Napster 3.0 Alpha, using the \".nap\" secure file format from PlayMedia Systems and audio fingerprinting technology licensed from Relatable. Napster 3.0 was, according to many former Napster employees, ready to deploy, but it had significant trouble obtaining licenses to distribute major-label music. On May 17, 2002, Napster announced that its assets would be acquired by German media firm Bertelsmann for $85 million to transform Napster into an online music subscription service. The two companies had been collaborating since the middle of 2000 when Bertelsmann became the first major label to drop its copyright lawsuit against Napster. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, on June 3 Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under United States bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets.\nReuse of name.\nNapster's brand and logos were acquired at a bankruptcy auction by Roxio which used them to re-brand the Pressplay music service as Napster 2.0. In September 2008, Napster was purchased by US electronics retailer Best Buy for US$121 million. On December 1, 2011, pursuant to a deal with Best Buy, Napster merged with Rhapsody, with Best Buy receiving a minority stake in Rhapsody. On July 14, 2016, Rhapsody phased out the Rhapsody brand in favor of Napster and has since branded its service internationally as Napster and expanded toward other markets by providing music on-demand as a service to other brands like the iHeartRadio app and their All Access music subscription service that provides subscribers with an on-demand music experience as well as premium radio.\nOn August 25, 2020, Napster was sold to virtual reality concerts company MelodyVR.\nOn May 10, 2022, Napster was sold to Hivemind and Algorand. The investor consortium also includes ATC Management, BH Digital, G20 Ventures, SkyBridge, RSE Ventures, Arrington Capital, Borderless Capital, and others.\nOn March 25, 2025, Napster was sold for $207 million to Infinite Reality, a technology and entertainment company specializing on digital media and artificial intelligence.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21114", "revid": "43682176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21114", "title": "NASCAR", "text": "American automobile racing company\nThe National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, LLC (NASCAR) is an American auto racing sanctioning and operating company that is best known for stock car racing. It is considered to be one of the top-ranked motorsports organizations in the world and is one of the largest spectator sports leagues in America. The privately owned company was founded by Bill France Sr. in 1948, and his son, Jim France, has been the CEO since August 2018. The company is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. Each year, NASCAR sanctions over 1,500 races at over 100 tracks in 48 US states, as well as in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Europe.\nNASCAR, and stock car racing as a whole, traces its roots back to moonshine runners during Prohibition, who grew to compete against each other in a show of pride. In 1935, Bill France Sr. established races in Daytona Beach, with the hope that people would come to watch races and that racers would race for him, as other organizers tended to fleece the winners of their payouts. This was a success, and the series was founded in 1948. Races were held in several divisions, which eventually morphed into what is the \"ladder\": the Cup Series at the top, the Xfinity Series second, and the Truck Series third, with smaller series spread out below. Chevrolet, Ford, and Toyota compete in each series.\nThe vast majority of NASCAR drivers are American, but drivers from Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australasia, and other places have competed. All Cup Series races are held in the United States and Mexico. There are 36 points-paying races in a season, along with the pre-season Clash and mid-season All-Star race. NASCAR runs races primarily on ovals, including superspeedways, short tracks, and previously dirt tracks, but also road courses and street circuits.\nRichard Petty holds the Cup Series wins record with 200. He is tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the championship record, with seven each. Entering the 2026 season, Kyle Larson is the defending Cup Series champion.\nHistory.\nEarly stock car racing.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Daytona Beach supplanted France and Belgium as the preferred location for world land speed records. After a historic race between Ransom Olds and Alexander Winton in 1903, 15 records were set on what became the Daytona Beach Road Course between 1905 and 1935. Daytona Beach had become synonymous with fast cars in 1936. Drivers raced on a course, consisting of a stretch of beach as one straightaway, and a narrow blacktop beachfront highway, State Road\u00a0A1A, as the other. The two straights were connected by two tight, deeply rutted and sand covered turns at each end.\nStock car racing in the United States has its origins in bootlegging during Prohibition, when drivers ran bootleg whiskey made primarily in the Appalachian region of the United States. Bootleggers needed to distribute their illicit products, and they typically used small, fast vehicles to better evade the police. Many of the drivers would modify their cars for speed and handling, as well as increased cargo capacity.\nThe repeal of Prohibition in 1933 dried up some of their business, but by then the people of the American South had developed a taste for moonshine, and a number of the drivers continued \"runnin' shine\", this time evading the \"revenuers\" who were attempting to tax their operations. The cars continued to improve, and by the late 1940s, races featuring these cars were being run for pride and profit. These races were popular entertainment in the rural Southern United States, and they are most closely associated with the Wilkes County region of North Carolina. Most races in those days were of modified cars. Street vehicles were lightened and reinforced.\nSignificant people.\nWilliam France Sr..\nMechanic William France Sr., moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, from Washington, D.C., in 1935 to escape the Great Depression. He was familiar with the history of the area from the land speed record attempts. France entered the 1936 Daytona event, finishing fifth. He took over running the course in 1938. He promoted a few races before World War II.\nFrance had the notion that people would enjoy watching stock cars race. Drivers were frequently victimized by unscrupulous promoters who would leave events with all the money before drivers were paid. On December 14, 1947, France began talks with other influential racers and promoters at the Ebony Bar at the Streamline Hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida, that ended with the formation of NASCAR on February 21, 1948.\nErwin \"Cannonball\" Baker.\nThe first Commissioner of NASCAR was Erwin \"Cannonball\" Baker, a former stock car, motorcycle, and open-wheel racer who competed in the Indianapolis 500 and set over one hundred land speed records. Baker earned most of his fame for his transcontinental speed runs and would prove a car's worth by driving it from New York to Los Angeles. After his death, the famous transcontinental race the 'Cannonball Run' and the film that was inspired by it were both named in his honor.\nBaker is enshrined in the Automotive Hall of Fame, the Motorcycle Hall of Fame, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame. This level of honor and success in each diverse racing association earned Baker the title of \"King of the Road\".\nBob \"Barky\" Barkhimer.\nIn the early 1950s, the United States Navy stationed Bill France Jr., at the Moffett Federal Airfield in northern California. His father asked him to look up Bob Barkhimer in San Jose, California. Barkhimer was a star of midget car racing from the World War II era, and later ran about 22 different speedways as the head of the California Stock Car Racing Association. Young Bill developed a relationship with Bob Barkhimer and his partner, Margo Burke. He went to events with them, stayed weekends with them and generally became very familiar with racing on the west coast. \"Barky\", as he was called by his friends, journeyed to Daytona Beach and met with Bill France Sr. In the spring of 1954, NASCAR became a stock car sanctioning body on the Pacific Coast under Barky.\nWendell Scott.\nWendell Scott was the first African-American to win a race in the Grand National Series, NASCAR's highest level. He was posthumously inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, North Carolina, January 30, 2015.\nFounding.\nOn March 8, 1936, a collection of drivers gathered at Daytona Beach, Florida. The drivers brought coupes, hardtops, convertibles, and sports cars to compete in an event to determine the fastest cars, and best drivers. Throughout the race, the heavier cars got bogged down in the sand, while the lightweight Fords navigated the ruts of the course, eventually claiming the top 6 finishes for the race. Of the 27 cars that started the event, only 10 managed to survive the ordeal, as officials halted the event short of the scheduled distance. Driver Milt Marion was declared the winner, and a young Bill France placed 5th at the end of the day.\nBy early 1947, Bill France saw the potential for a unified series of racing competitors. France announced the foundation of the \"National Championship Stock Car Circuit\", otherwise known as NCSCC. France approached the American Automobile Association, or AAA, in hopes of obtaining financial backing for the venture. When the AAA declined support of the venture, France proceeded to announce a set of rules and awards for the NCSCC. France declared that the winner of the 1947 NCSCC season would receive $1,000 (equivalent to $ in 2024) and a trophy. The season would begin in January 1947 at the Daytona Beach track, and conclude in Jacksonville the following December. Nearly 40 events were logged during the season, and attendance often exceeded the venue's capacity. The competitors were paid as promised, and by the end of the season, driver Fonty Flock was declared the season champion after winning 7 events of the 24 that he entered. Bill France delivered the $1,000 and 4-foot high trophy to Flock at the end of the season, along with $3,000 in prize money to other drivers who competed throughout the season.\nAt the end of the 1947 season, Bill France announced that there would be a series of meetings held at the Streamline Hotel in Florida, beginning on December 14, 1947. At 1:00\u00a0pm, France called to order the 35 men who represented the NCSCC on the top floor of the hotel. The meeting was the first of four seminars in which France would outline his vision of an organized group of race car drivers. The name originally chosen for the series was National Stock Car Racing Association; when it was pointed out that that name was already in use by a rival sanctioning body, \"National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing\", proposed by mechanic Red Vogt, was selected as the organization's name.\nNASCAR was founded by William France, Sr. on February 21, 1948 with the help of several other drivers of the time. The original plans for NASCAR included three distinct divisions: Modified, Roadster, and Strictly Stock. The roadster division was quickly abandoned, while the modified division now operates as the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour. The Strictly Stock division was put on hold as American automobile manufacturers were unable to produce family sedans quickly enough to keep up with post-World War II demand. The 1948 schedule featured 52 Modified dirt track races. The sanctioning body hosted its first event at Daytona Beach on February 15, 1948. Red Byron beat Marshall Teague in the Modified division race. Byron won the 1948 national championship. Things had changed dramatically by 1949, and the Strictly Stock division was able to debut with a exhibition in February near Miami.\nThe first NASCAR \"Strictly Stock\" race ever was held at Charlotte Speedway, although this is not the same track as the Charlotte Motor Speedway that is a fixture on current NASCAR schedule. The race was held on June 19, 1949 and won by driver Jim Roper when Glenn Dunaway was disqualified after the discovery of his altered rear springs. Initially, the cars were known as the \"Strictly Stock Division\" and raced with virtually no modifications on the factory models. This division was renamed the \"Grand National\" division beginning in the 1950 season. Over a period of more than a decade, modifications for both safety and performance were allowed, and by the mid-1960s, the vehicles were purpose-built race cars with a stock-appearing body.\nEarly in NASCAR's history, foreign manufacturers had shown interest in entering the series; the British car manufacturer, MG, found a few of its vehicles entered, with some placing. For example, on August 16, 1963 in the International 200, Smokey Cook drove an MG to a 17th-place finish.\nThe first NASCAR competition held outside the US was in Canada, where on July 1, 1952, Buddy Shuman won a 200-lap race on a half-mile (800 m) dirt track in Stamford Park, Ontario, near Niagara Falls.\nSanctioned series.\nNational series.\nCup Series.\nThe NASCAR Cup Series (NCS) is the sport's highest level of professional competition. It is consequently the most popular and most profitable NASCAR series. Since 2001, the Cup Series season has consisted of 36 races over 10 months. Writers and fans often use \"Cup\" to refer to the NCS and the ambiguous use of \"NASCAR\" as a synonym for the series is common. The record for most championships is 7, held by three drivers: Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, and Jimmie Johnson. Johnson has the record for most consecutive with five consecutive Cup Series drivers' championships from 2006 to 2010. Previously, the most consecutive championships had been three in a row by Cale Yarborough in the late 1970s, the only other time when a driver has won three or more NASCAR Cup Series championships in a row.\nThe Cup Series had its first title sponsor in 1972. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which had been banned from television advertising, found a popular and demographically suitable consumer base in NASCAR fans and engaged NASCAR as a promotional outlet. As a result of that sponsorship, the Grand National Series became known as the Winston Cup Series starting in 1971, with a new points system and some significant cash benefits to compete for championship points. In 1972, the season was shortened from 48 races (including two on dirt tracks) to 31. 1972 is often acknowledged as the beginning of NASCAR's \"modern era\". The next competitive level, called Late Model Sportsman, gained the \"Grand National\" title passed down from the top division and soon found a sponsor in Busch Beer.\nIn 2004, Nextel Communications took over sponsorship of the premier series, and formally renamed it the Nextel Cup Series. A new championship points system, the \"Chase for the Nextel Cup\", (renamed \"Chase for the Sprint Cup\" in 2008) was also developed, which reset the point standings with ten races to go, making only drivers in the top ten or within 400 points of the leader eligible to win the championship. In 2007, NASCAR announced it was expanding \"The Chase\" from ten to twelve drivers, eliminating the 400-point cutoff, and giving a ten-point bonus to the top twelve drivers for each of the races they have won out of the first 26. Wins throughout the season would also be awarded five more points than in previous seasons. In 2008, the premier series title name became the Sprint Cup Series, as part of the merger between Nextel and Sprint.\nIn 2011, NASCAR announced a number of major rules changes, the most significant being abandoning the previous points system. The winner of a race would receive 43 points, with one-point decrements for each subsequent position (42 for second, 41 for third, and so on). The winner also would receive 3 bonus points, and single bonus points were awarded to all drivers who lead a lap, plus the driver who led the most laps. Another significant change involved the qualifying process for the Chase. The number of qualifying drivers remained at 12, but only the top 10 qualified solely on regular-season points. The remaining two Chase drivers were the two drivers in the next 10 of the point standings (11th through 20th) with the most race wins in the regular season.\nIn 2014, NASCAR announced another revamp to the Chase format, expanding the Chase pool to 16 drivers, and eliminating four drivers after every three races, leaving four drivers to compete for the championship at the season finale at Homestead. In addition, wins were given an increased emphasis, with the 16 drivers with the most wins (15 if the points leader is winless; points leader will receive an automatic berth) gaining a spot in the chase. If there are fewer than 16 winners, the remaining spots will be filled based on the conventional points system.\nMonster Energy became the title sponsor in 2017, which changed the series' name to Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. With Monster Energy's title sponsorship, NASCAR also abandoned \"The Chase\" name and now refers to the last 10 races simply as \"the playoffs\" similar to most other sports.\nAfter the 2019 season, NASCAR declined an offer from Monster Energy to remain the title sponsor of the top series. On December 5, NASCAR revealed their new sponsorship model. Instead of a singular title sponsor, four \"premier partners\" (Coca-Cola, Xfinity, Busch Beer and GEICO) would be closely affiliated with the top series, which was simply renamed the NASCAR Cup Series.\nO'Reilly Auto Parts Series.\nThe NASCAR O'Reilly Auto Parts Series is the second-highest level of professional competition in NASCAR. The most recent series champion is Jesse Love in 2025. The modern incarnation of this series began in 1982, with sponsorship by Anheuser-Busch Brewing's Budweiser brand. In 1984, it was renamed to the Busch Grand National Series, then later just the Busch Series. The Anheuser-Busch sponsorship expired at the end of 2007, being replaced by Nationwide Insurance from 2008 to 2014, and then sponsored by Comcast through its Xfinity brand from 2015 to 2025. Beginning in 2026, the series will be sponsored by O'Reilly Auto Parts and named the NASCAR O'Reilly Auto Parts Series.\nThe season usually has fewer races than the Cup Series, and the prize money is significantly lower. However, over the last several years, a number of Cup Series drivers have run both the O'Reilly and Cup Series events each weekend, using the Xfinity race as a warm-up to the Cup event at the same facility. Furthermore, several drivers not only participated in both Cup and Busch/Nationwide/Xfinity/O'Reilly events on the same weekend but also began to compete in both series on a full-time basis. Kevin Harvick was the first Cup series driver to compete full-time in the Busch Series and win a title, actually doing so twice; in 2001, he did this for Richard Childress Racing but only did so out of necessity as Dale Earnhardt's death forced him into the Cup series ahead of RCR's intended schedule for him. His win in 2006, where he raced three cars for RCR and his race team, was the first of five consecutive titles in NBS/NNS that were won by Cup series regulars.\nThe practice received criticism because it was thought to give the Cup Series teams an unfair advantage, and that the presence of the Cup Series drivers squeezes out Nationwide Series competitors who would otherwise be able to qualify. These dual-series drivers have been labeled \"Buschwhackers\", a play on words which combines the original series sponsor's name with the notion of being bushwhacked. In May 2007, NNS director Joe Balash confirmed that NASCAR was exploring options to deal with the Buschwhacker controversy. One of the most often-cited proposals was for Cup Series drivers participating in the Nationwide Series to receive no points for their participation in a Nationwide race. In 2007, NASCAR chairman Brian France indicated that all options, except an outright ban of Cup competitors, were still being considered. On January 11, 2011, \"NASCAR.com\" reported that beginning with the 2011 season, drivers would be allowed to compete for the championship in only one of NASCAR's three national series in a given season, although they could continue to run in multiple series. This change was officially confirmed by France in a press conference less than two weeks later, and has remained in the NASCAR rules ever since.\nBeginning in 2010, the Nationwide cars adapted somewhat to the current \"Car of Tomorrow\" (or COT) design used by Cup cars, with different bodies from the Cup Series.\nIn 2016, the Chase format was extended to both the Xfinity and Truck Series. Instead of the four-round, 10-race format used in the Cup Series, the Chase in each of the two supporting series consists of three rounds and seven races in all, with each preliminary round consisting of three races. The O'Reilly Auto Parts Series Chase involves 12 drivers instead of the 16 participating in the Cup Series Chase. Four drivers are eliminated at the end of each preliminary round of the Chase in the O'Reilly Auto Parts Series, which also mirrors the Cup Series Chase. This means that four drivers are eligible for the series title entering the final race, as in the Cup Series. Similar to Cup, starting in 2017 \"The Chase\" moniker was dropped and the final seven races are now referred to as the O'Reilly Auto Parts Playoffs.\nEven with restrictions limiting points earnings to one national series, Cup drivers were still running and winning a vast majority of O'Reilly Auto Parts series races through 2015. Starting with the 2015 season finale, NASCAR began to add additional restrictions in regards to Cup drivers running O'Reilly races. Beginning in the 2020 season, Cup drivers with more than three years of experience in the top series were limited to five races per season. Furthermore, those same drivers are ineligible to run the regular season finale, NAOPS playoff races, or Dash 4 Cash races.\nCraftsman Truck Series.\nThe NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series features modified pickup trucks. It is one of the three national divisions of NASCAR, together with the Xfinity and Cup Series. The most recent series champion is Ty Majeski in 2024.\nIn 1994, NASCAR announced the formation of the NASCAR SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman. The first series race followed in 1995. In 1996, the series was renamed the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series to emphasize Craftsman's involvement. The series was first considered something of an oddity or a \"senior tour\" for NASCAR drivers, but eventually grew in popularity and has seen drivers move straight to the Cup Series without running a full season in NASCAR Xfinity Series competition. These include Kurt Busch and Carl Edwards (who both ran for Roush Racing). In addition, veteran drivers who have had only moderate success at the other two levels of the sport have revitalized their careers in the truck series, including Ron Hornaday Jr., Todd Bodine, Mike Skinner, and Johnny Benson.\nBeginning in 2009, the series became the Camping World Truck Series. In 2019, per a branding request made by Camping World, the series was rebranded as the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series.\nAs noted previously, the Chase format was extended to the Truck Series in 2016. The format is identical to that used in the Xfinity Series, except that only eight drivers qualify for the Chase (instead of 12 in the Xfinity Series) and only two drivers are eliminated at the end of each preliminary round (instead of four in the Xfinity Series). As in both the Cup Series and Xfinity Series, four drivers are eligible for the series title entering the final race. Similar to Cup, starting in 2017 \"The Chase\" moniker was dropped and is now simply referred to as the Truck Series Playoffs.\nOn May 8, 2018, NASCAR and Camping World announced the Truck Series title sponsor would be moved to Camping World subsidiary Gander Outdoors starting in 2019. The series was renamed again in 2020 to the NASCAR Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series before returning to the Camping World Truck Series name in 2021.\nOn August 26, 2022 it was announced that the original series' sponsor, Craftsman, would return as the title sponsor starting in the 2023 season.\nARCA Menards Series.\nThe ARCA Menards Series is a racing series that races at big touring series tracks and local racing series tracks. It is primarily a Midwestern United States series. NASCAR acquired the series on April 27, 2018 after being privately owned for 60 years.\nInternational series.\nCanada Series.\nThe NASCAR Canada Series is a NASCAR racing series in Canada that derives from the old CASCAR Super Series (founded in 1981 and bought out by NASCAR in 2006). The new series has races through six of Canada's provinces for a total of 13 events with TV coverage on TSN. Many drivers are content running in Canada while others move up to bigger NASCAR series including J. R. Fitzpatrick and D. J. Kennington. The cars are a bit different from the cars seen in America, being more akin to a late model, though steel tube-framed silhouette bodies powered by V8 engines is still the norm.\nMexico Series.\nIn December 2006, NASCAR also announced the creation of a new series in Mexico, the NASCAR Corona Series (now Mexico Series), replacing the existing Desaf\u00edo Corona Series, to begin in 2007.\nIn 2004, NASCAR also began to sanction a mini stock racing series in Mexico, known as the Mexico T4 Series.\nEuro Series.\nIn early 2012, NASCAR announced that it would sanction the existing European-based Racecar Euro Series as a \"NASCAR Touring Series\". On July 1, 2013, with partnership from NASCAR Whelen Engineering, the series was renamed the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series.\nBrasil Series.\nLaunched in 2012 as the Sprint Race series, in 2023 the series received NASCAR sanctioning and technical assistance, becoming the newest of the NASCAR international series.\nRegional racing series.\nIn addition to the six main national series, NASCAR operates several other racing divisions under the NASCAR Regional banner.\nWeekly Series.\nMany local race tracks across the United States and Canada run under the NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series banner, where local drivers are compared against each other in a formula where the best local track champion of the nation wins the Whelen All-American Weekly Series National Championship. The Whelen All-American series is split into four car divisions as well as state and track championships separately. Each division champion receives a point-fund money payout and even more goes to the National champion (driver with most points out of the four division winners). The Whelen All-American Series is the base for stock car racing, developing NASCAR names such as Clint Bowyer, Jimmy Spencer, Tony Stewart, the Bodine brothers, and many others along the way.\nWhelen Modified Tour.\nThe Whelen Modified Tour races open-wheel \"modified\" cars in Northern and Southern divisions. This is NASCAR's oldest division, and the modern division has been operating since 1985 as the Winston Modified Series and later in 1994 as the Featherlite Trailers Modified Series.\nARCA Menards Series East and West.\nThe ARCA Menards Series' feeder divisions, which consists of East and West divisions, race pro-stock cars that are similar to older Xfinity Series cars, although they are less powerful. The east division was originally divided into the Busch North series, which raced in Northeastern states, and the Busch East Series, which raced throughout Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. The west division was originally known as the Winston West Series and raced throughout Southwestern and Coastal Pacific states. In 2008, the series came together in east and west divisions under sponsorship from Camping World as the Camping World Series. K&amp;N Filters took over the sponsorship in 2010. 2019 was the last season for both of the series before they are to go under the ARCA banner in 2020 as part of the unification of the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East and West and the ARCA Menards Series. The series became known as the ARCA Menards Series East and ARCA Menards Series West starting in 2020, meaning 2019 was also K&amp;N's last year as the series title sponsor.\nAutoZone Elite and other divisions.\nIn the past, NASCAR also sanctioned the AutoZone Elite Division, which raced late-model cars that were lighter and less powerful than Cup Series cars, and was originally split into four divisions: Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Midwest. At the end of 2005, NASCAR announced that the AutoZone Elite Division would be discontinued after the 2006 season due to having trouble securing NASCAR-sanctioned tracks to successfully host AutoZone Elite Division events, plus escalating costs of competing and downsizing of the Division in recent years. In 2003, NASCAR standardized rules for its AutoZone Elite and Grand National divisions regional touring series as to permit cars in one series to race against cars in another series in the same division. The top 15 (Grand National) or 10 (AutoZone Elite) in each series will race in a one-race playoff, called the NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown, to determine the annual AutoZone Elite and Grand National champions. This event has been hosted at Irwindale Speedway in California since its inception.\nMany drivers move up through the series before reaching the Cup Series. In 2002, over 9,000 drivers had licenses from NASCAR to race at all levels.\nThe winners of the All-American Series National Championship, the ARCA Menards Series, ARCA East and ARCA West championships, the Whelen Modified and Grand National Divisions, and the three national series are invited to Las Vegas in December to participate in Champions Week ceremonies.\nOnline racing series.\neNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series.\nIn 2010, NASCAR officially sanctioned its first sim racing esports series, partnering with \"iRacing\" to form the NASCAR iRacing.com Series. This sim racing series is made of up of five \"Amateur Series\" divisions, the NASCAR iRacing.com Pro Series, and the PEAK Antifreeze NASCAR iRacing Series (NPAiS), one of iRacing's World Championship Series. Each year, the champion of the NASCAR iRacing.com World Championship Series is invited to NASCAR's Championship Weekend at Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway to receive $10,500 prize money and NASCAR championship trophy at the track.\nIn 2018, \"iRacing\" announced a new, sanctioned qualifying ladder system for the NPAiS, the Road to Pro Series, using virtual Chevrolet and Toyota Camping World Trucks. At the same time, the NASCAR iRacing Pro Series would switch to using the Xfinity Series Camaro, Mustang and Camry models, to replicate the progression to the real life Cup series cars used in the NPAiS.\nIn 2020, Coca-Cola became the entitlement sponsor of the series and it was renamed the eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series. With the sponsorship, the prize pool increased to $300,000. Additionally, six races will be televised on NBCSN.\neNASCAR Ignite Series.\nThe series was created as a developmental league by NASCAR and \"iRacing\" for aspiring gamers ages 13\u201316. The simulator begins with US Legends cars before moving to Modified Tour cars.\nDriver safety.\nNASCAR has often implemented safety measures reactively in response to injuries or fatalities. Fire-retardant driver suits were required after the death of Fireball Roberts, who died from complications of burns suffered in a crash when flames engulfed his car during a Charlotte race. After the deaths of Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin and Tony Roper in 2000 and Dale Earnhardt in 2001, NASCAR revisited the idea of decreasing the G-forces a driver sustained during a crash. The \"kill switch\" throttle, was mandated after the death of Adam Petty, along with the requirements of an anti-spill bladder in fuel cells. The impact-absorbing \"SAFER Barrier\" had been in use as early as 1998, but NASCAR hesitated to install those walls out of concerns that they may bring about unintended consequences of aggravating the crashes, and possibly because of the effort needed to clean up the debris from the damaged walls. Dale Earnhardt fatally suffered a fracture to the base of his skull after his car slammed into the concrete wall in the 2001 Daytona 500. Earnhardt's death prompted NASCAR to implement the SAFER barrier and consider drastic improvements to the safety of the drivers. One of these would require all drivers to use the \"HANS device\" (Head And Neck Support Device), a device that keeps the driver's neck from going forward in a wreck. The mandate came about in October after Blaise Alexander, racing for the ARCA series, died in a crash that resulted in the same injuries sustained as Earnhardt. NASCAR redesigned the racing vehicle with safety improvements, calling it the Car of Tomorrow, which debuted in 2007. The car had a higher roof, wider cockpit, and the driver seat was located more toward the center of the vehicle.\nThe death of Dale Earnhardt has been seen as a \"wake-up\" call for NASCAR. NASCAR has been far more aggressive with safety changes since Earnhardt's death, and as of 2024[ [update]], no NASCAR driver has been involved in a fatal accident since.\nCriticism.\nNASCAR has been the target of criticism on various topics from various sources. Some critics note the significant differences between today's NASCAR vehicles and true \"stock\" cars. Others frequently cite the dominance of the France family in NASCAR's business structure, policies, and decision making. Recently, the increased number of Cup drivers competing consistently in the Xfinity Series races has been hotly debated. Another general area of criticism, not only of NASCAR but other motorsports as well, includes questions about fuel consumption, emissions and pollution, and the use of lead additives in the gasoline. Originally scheduled for 2008, NASCAR adopted the use of unleaded fuel in all three of its top series in 2007. In 2011, NASCAR switched to E15 \"green\" fuel (15% ethanol and 85% gasoline) for all three touring series.\nAs NASCAR has made moves to improve its national appeal, it has begun racing at new tracks, and ceased racing at some traditional ones\u00a0\u2013 a sore spot for the traditional fan base. Most recently, NASCAR has been challenged on the types and frequency of caution flags, with some critics suggesting the outcome of races is being manipulated, and that the intention is not safety, as NASCAR claims, but closer racing.\nThere have been a few accidents involving fans during races and even some off the tracks, but no spectator has ever been killed during a race in an accident relating to the race, although a fan was killed by a lightning strike in 2012 after the 2012 Pennsylvania 400 at Pocono was called short due to the storm. It was revealed in 2008 that a wrongful death lawsuit against NASCAR stemming from the crash of a company plane was settled for $2.4\u00a0million.\nFor years, NASCAR had been under criticism for allowing the Confederate flag to be flown during races. Former chairman Brian France tried to ban the flying of Confederate flags at race tracks in 2015, which caused anger among fans. It had previously asked fans to voluntarily stop flying the flag after the 2015 Charleston church shooting, but this did not end the practice. Bubba Wallace, the only African-American NASCAR top-circuit driver, drove the 2020 spring Martinsville race in a car with Black Lives Matter livery, and appeared in an anti-racism video with a number of white drivers. On June 10, 2020, in the wake of protests related to the murder of George Floyd, NASCAR announced that the display of the Confederate flag will be prohibited from all of its events and properties.\nIn February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media. In April 2022, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Florida against the LGBcoin cryptocurrency company, NASCAR, stock car racing driver Brandon Brown, and political commentator Candace Owens alleging that the defendants made false or misleading statements about the LGBcoin and that the founders of the company had engaged in a pump and dump scheme.\nGlobal expansion.\nIn 2006, Toyota announced they would be joining NASCAR's ranks. Toyota generated early success winning several races off performances from Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch. Any increase in foreign competition is expected to raise the price of putting a car on the track.\nAnother topic on the NASCAR circuit is the increase in foreign born drivers and the effects they may have on the future of NASCAR. Juan Pablo Montoya, Patrick Carpentier, Dario Franchitti, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, and Jenson Button are among the foreign-born big names who have crossed over from Formula One and the Indy car circuit. These drivers have made an impact on NASCAR not only by winning races and dominating road courses, but by expanding NASCAR's point of view.\nNASCAR included a race at the Mexican road course Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez in the Nationwide Series schedule from 2005 through 2008, as well as a race in Montreal, Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve from 2007 through 2012, with the Camping World Truck Series adding a date at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park in 2013. There has been talk of possible expansion with exhibition races in Japan and a return to Canada.\nExpanding into international markets could increase NASCAR's popularity and allow foreign sponsors and manufacturers to get involved in the sport. Some think this could be a very positive move for NASCAR, which has seen its television ratings drop 21 percent between 2005 and 2007. During the same 2-year period, NASCAR also saw the greatest drop in tickets prices observed in over a decade. In 2010, NASCAR saw television ratings drop 10% from the year before, which was down 33% off its peak in 2005. Some think that an increase in international diversity would translate into growth and generate greater opportunities for NASCAR fans.\nIn 2023, to celebrate their 75th anniversary, NASCAR partnered with Chevrolet and Hendrick Motorsports to enter a Next Gen Camaro ZL1 in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It coincided with the 100th anniversary of the prestigious endurance race at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans, Sarthe, France, and the Camaro entered as a Garage 56 (Innovative) entry. Jimmie Johnson and Button were joined by German WEC veteran and Mike Rockenfeller \u2013 a 2010 LMP1 category and overall winner at Le Mans \u2013 as the drivers. Chad Knaus, Johnson's crew chief during each of his Cup Series championships, was project manager, while the car bore #24 in honor of Jeff Gordon.\nNASCAR.com.\nIn October 2000, Turner Sports acquired the digital rights to NASCAR, and subsequently took over its website, which features news, information, and interactive features (such as \"RaceView\" and \"RaceBuddy\") surrounding its series. While NASCAR had extended Turner's contract to operate the site through 2016, the association announced in January 2012 that it would take operation of the site back in-house in 2013. As a result, a new NASCAR.com was launched on January 3, 2013, which features a multimedia-oriented design enhanced to provide a higher level of fan interaction, and provide an improved second screen experience for viewers on mobile devices.\nOn May 7, 2019, NASCAR announced a sports betting content partnership with The Action Network to provide editorial content and analysis to NASCAR.com, including recommended picks and value bets. NASCAR said the partnership was intended to prepare for the spread of legal sports betting in the U.S. following the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal PASPA sports betting prohibition. NASCAR previously struck an exclusive deal with sports data solutions provider Genius Sports to develop an official NASCAR gaming offering for legal sportsbooks.\nSubsidiaries and sister organizations.\nNASCAR Productions.\nNASCAR Digital Media.\nNASCAR Digital Media is a television production company located in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. The company is a subsidiary of NASCAR and produces programs designed to promote the sport of professional stock car racing. It also manages the NASCAR website, as well as some websites related to the sport such as Racing-Reference and Jayski's Silly Season Site (as of 2019, after ESPN.com stopped hosting the website). They also own \"NASCAR Classics\", a free online base of classic NASCAR races.\nNASCAR Studios.\nNASCAR Studios is a production company that produces content including drivers, teams, partners, sponsors, and tracks. Current content includes podcast, documentaries, television shows, and films. The studio also produces content for the NASCAR Channel on Tubi.\nARCA.\nThe Automobile Racing Club of America was purchased by NASCAR in 2018.\nGrand-Am.\nThe Grand American Road Racing Association (Grand-Am) was a sanctioning body of sports car racing. While it was founded independently of NASCAR by several members of the France family, NASCAR took over Grand-Am, but allowed it to operate autonomously.

They are located in the nervous system and help to receive and conduct impulses. Neurons communicate with other cells via synapses, which are specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap.\nNeurons are the main components of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoans. Plants and fungi do not have nerve cells. Molecular evidence suggests that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in evolution some 700 to 800 million years ago, during the Tonian period. Predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic secretory cells. They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled cells to create post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that generate fast electrical signals. The ability to generate electric signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous system.\nNeurons are typically classified into three types based on their function. Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs, and they send signals to the spinal cord and then to the sensorial area in the brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. When multiple neurons are functionally connected together, they form what is called a neural circuit.\nA neuron contains all the structures of other cells such as a nucleus, mitochondria, and Golgi bodies but has additional unique structures such as an axon, and dendrites. The soma or cell body, is a compact structure, and the axon and dendrites are filaments extruding from the soma. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are axon terminals, where the neuron can transmit a signal across the synapse to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axons. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly when the cell is undifferentiated.\nMost neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another. However, synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite. The signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to the maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron generates an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential. This potential travels rapidly along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory, increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma.\nIn most cases, neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood. Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNervous system.\nNeurons are the primary components of the nervous system, along with the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support. The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes the autonomic, enteric and somatic nervous systems. In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea.\nAxons may bundle into nerve fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire that make up a cable). In the central nervous system bundles of axons are called nerve tracts.\nAnatomy and histology.\nNeurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. Given the diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.\nThe accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.\nAxons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10\u201325 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.\nSensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5\u20131 millimeter thick, several centimeters long).\nFully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see neurogenesis). Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells that have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like characteristic of pluripotency.\nMembrane.\nLike all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of embedded protein structures. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are gated, permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The ions include sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a little less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machineries that are embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.\nHistology and internal structure.\nNumerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies (or Nissl substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic (\"base-loving\") dye. These structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA. Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl (1860\u20131919), they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) hematoxylin highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA.\nThe cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which together with neurotubules (neuronal microtubules) are assembled into larger neurofibrils. Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age. Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Class III \u03b2-tubulin is found almost exclusively in neurons. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development. There the actin dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule.\nThere are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons seldom contain ribosomes, except some in the initial segment. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases.\nClassification.\nNeurons vary in shape and size and can be classified by their morphology and function. The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can be further classified by the location of the soma. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by a myelin sheath. The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching axon terminals that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.\nStructural classification.\nPolarity.\nMost neurons can be anatomically characterized as:\nOther.\nSome unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples are:\nFunctional classification.\nDirection.\nAfferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send information from the brain.\nAction on other neurons.\nA neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors. The effect on the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter. Receptors are classified broadly as \"excitatory\" (causing an increase in firing rate), \"inhibitory\" (causing a decrease in firing rate), or \"modulatory\" (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).\nThe two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, glutamate and GABA, have largely consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors and has effects that are excitatory at ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors. Similarly, GABA acts on several types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as \"excitatory neurons\", and cells that release GABA as \"inhibitory neurons\". Some other types of neurons have consistent effects, for example, \"excitatory\" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine, and \"inhibitory\" spinal neurons that release glycine.\nThe distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors. When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.\nIt is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.\nDischarge patterns.\nNeurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory patterns. So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics:\nNeurotransmitter.\nNeurotransmitters are chemical messengers passed from one neuron to another neuron or to a muscle cell or gland cell.\n#AMPA and Kainate receptors function as cation channels permeable to Na+ cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission.\n#NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca2+. The function of NMDA receptors depends on glycine receptor binding as a co-agonist within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.\n#Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability.\n Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, resulting in brain damage. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase.\nMultimodel classification.\nSince 2012 there has been a push from the cellular and computational neuroscience community to come up with a universal classification of neurons that will apply to all neurons in the brain as well as across species. This is done by considering the three essential qualities of all neurons: electrophysiology, morphology, and the individual transcriptome of the cells. Besides being universal this classification has the advantage of being able to classify astrocytes as well. A method called patch-sequencing in which all three qualities can be measured at once is used extensively by the Allen Institute for Brain Science. In 2023, a comprehensive cell atlas of the adult, and developing human brain at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional levels was created through an international collaboration of researchers using the most cutting-edge molecular biology approaches.\nConnectivity.\nNeurons communicate with each other via synapses, where either the axon terminal of one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite, soma, or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus, have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses.\nSynapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, either increasing or decreasing activity in the target neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically conductive junctions between cells.\nWhen an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.\nAn autapse is a synapse in which a neuron's axon connects to its dendrites.\nThe human brain has some 8.6 x 1010 (eighty six billion) neurons. Each neuron has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 1015 synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 1014 to 5 x 1014 synapses (100 to 500 trillion).\nNonelectrochemical signaling.\nBeyond electrical and chemical signaling, studies suggest neurons in healthy human brains can also communicate through:\nThey can also get modulated by input from the environment and hormones released from other parts of the organism, which could be influenced more or less directly by neurons. This also applies to neurotrophins such as BDNF. The gut microbiome is also connected with the brain.\nNeurons also communicate with microglia, the brain's main immune cells via specialized contact sites, called \"somatic junctions\". These connections enable microglia to constantly monitor and regulate neuronal functions, and exert neuroprotection when needed.\nMechanisms for propagating action potentials.\nIn 1937 John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties. It is larger than but similar to human neurons, making it easier to study. By inserting electrodes into the squid giant axons, accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential.\nThe cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential). Some neurons also generate subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl\u2212), and calcium (Ca2+).\nSeveral stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including pressure, stretch, chemical transmitters, and changes in the electric potential across the cell membrane. Stimuli cause specific ion-channels within the cell membrane to open, leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane, changing the membrane potential. Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron type.\nThin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1\u00a0mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from the demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.\nSome neurons do not generate action potentials but instead generate a graded electrical signal, which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release. Such non-spiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances.\nNeural coding.\nNeural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationships among the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble. It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information.\nAll-or-none principle.\nThe conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder sound, does not produce a stronger signal but can increase firing frequency. Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to a steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased stimulus intensity by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more photons, as the photons cannot become \"stronger\" for a specific frequency.\nOther receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with a steady stimulus; examples include skin which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.\nThe pacinian corpuscle is one such structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, the stimulus ends; thus, these neurons typically respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of several other neurons.\nAlthough neurons have long been assumed to always give a stereotyped maximal response or none at all, there is a body of research that argues that this is only partially correct, and that while it is true that Neurons either fire an Action Potential or do not, the amplitude and duration of the Action Potentials that a Neuron fires can vary greatly, allowing the Neuron to encode information in at least the strength of the Action Potential. Additionally, the analog information carried in the Action Potential has been shown to be able to survive and travel distances originally not thought to be possible. This has been proposed to be a highly effective way to encode information compared to the usual rate and temporal coding theories commonly seen in the literature, with the ability to transfer around 4 times more information than current wisdom would suggest.\nEtymology and spelling.\nThe German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer introduced the term \"neuron\" in 1891, based on the ancient Greek \u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"neuron\" 'sinew, cord, nerve'. \nThe word was adopted in French with the spelling \"neurone\". That spelling was also used by many writers in English, but has now become rare in American usage and uncommon in British usage.\nSome previous works used \"nerve cell\" (\"cellule nervose\"), as adopted in Camillo Golgi's 1873 paper on the discovery of the silver staining technique used to visualize nervous tissue under light microscopy.\nHistory.\nThe neuron's place as the primary functional unit of the nervous system was first recognized in the late 19th century through the work of the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal.\nTo make the structure of individual neurons visible, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal improved a silver staining process that had been developed by Camillo Golgi. The improved process involves a technique called \"double impregnation\" and is still in use.\nIn 1888 Ram\u00f3n y Cajal published a paper about the bird cerebellum. In this paper, he stated that he could not find evidence for anastomosis between axons and dendrites and called each nervous element \"an autonomous canton.\" This became known as the neuron doctrine, one of the central tenets of modern neuroscience.\nIn 1891, the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review of the neuron doctrine in which he introduced the term \"neuron\" to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the nervous system.\nThe silver impregnation stains are a useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because, for reasons unknown, it stains only a small percentage of cells in a tissue, exposing the complete micro structure of individual neurons without much overlap from other cells.\nNeuron doctrine.\nThe neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal in the late 19th century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.\nLater discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine. For example, glial cells, which are non-neuronal, play an essential role in information processing. Also, electrical synapses are more common than previously thought, comprising direct, cytoplasmic connections between neurons; In fact, neurons can form even tighter couplings: the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons.\nRam\u00f3n y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization, which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one direction: away from the cell body. The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons and axons can receive synaptic inputs.\nCompartmental modelling of neurons.\nAlthough neurons are often described as \"fundamental units\" of the brain, they perform internal computations. Neurons integrate input within dendrites, and this complexity is lost in models that assume neurons to be a fundamental unit. Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments, whose activity is related to passive membrane properties, but may also be different depending on input from synapses. Compartmental modelling of dendrites is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of neurons that are too small to record with electrodes, as is the case for \"Drosophila melanogaster\".\nNeurons in the brain.\nThe number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species. In a human, there are an estimated 10\u201320 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 55\u201370 billion neurons in the cerebellum. By contrast, the nematode worm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" has just 302 neurons, making it an ideal model organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons. The fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\", a common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems.\nNeurological disorders.\nCharcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease (CMT) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs extending to the hands and arms in advanced stages. Presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, affecting 36 in 100,000 people.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD), also known simply as \"Alzheimer's\", is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.\nParkinson's disease (PD), also known as \"Parkinson's\", is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs motor skills and speech. Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high-level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.\nMyasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.\nDemyelination.\nDemyelination is a process characterized by the gradual loss of the myelin sheath enveloping nerve fibers. When myelin deteriorates, signal conduction along nerves can be significantly impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. Demyelination may affect both central and peripheral nervous systems, contributing to various neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Although demyelination is often caused by an autoimmune reaction, it may also be caused by viral infections, metabolic disorders, trauma, and some medications.\nAxonal degeneration.\nAlthough most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is the rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends, occurring within 30 minutes of injury. Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma, and eventually leads to bead-like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. The endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by the influx of calcium ions), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hours in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown.\nDevelopment.\nNeurons develop through the process of neurogenesis, in which neural stem cells divide to produce differentiated neurons. Once fully differentiated they are no longer capable of undergoing mitosis. Neurogenesis primarily occurs during embryonic development.\nNeurons initially develop from the neural tube in the embryo. The neural tube has three layers \u2013 a ventricular zone, an intermediate zone, and a marginal zone. The ventricular zone surrounds the tube's central canal and becomes the ependyma. Dividing cells of the ventricular zone form the intermediate zone which stretches to the outermost layer of the neural tube called the pial layer. The gray matter of the brain is derived from the intermediate zone. The extensions of the neurons in the intermediate zone make up the marginal zone when myelinated becomes the brain's white matter.\nDifferentiation of the neurons is ordered by their size. Large motor neurons are first. Smaller sensory neurons together with glial cell differentiate at birth.\nAdult neurogenesis can occur and studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells and that the vast majority of neurons in the neocortex form before birth and persist without replacement. The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans, and its contribution to cognition are controversial, with conflicting reports published in 2018.\nThe body contains a variety of stem cell types that can differentiate into neurons. Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using transdifferentiation, in which \"cells are forced to adopt new identities\".\nDuring neurogenesis in the mammalian brain, progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers. Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells, and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine demethylation. DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions (e.g. 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway.\nAt different stages of mammalian nervous system development, two DNA repair processes are employed in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. These pathways are homologous recombinational repair used in proliferating neural precursor cells, and non-homologous end joining used mainly at later developmental stages\nIntercellular communication between developing neurons and microglia is also indispensable for proper neurogenesis and brain development.\nNerve regeneration.\nPeripheral axons can regrow if they are severed, but one neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llin\u00e1s' law).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web. Newsreader software is used to read the content of newsgroups. Before the adoption of the World Wide Web, Usenet newsgroups were among the most popular Internet services.\nCommunication is facilitated by the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) which allows connection to Usenet servers and data transfer over the internet. Similar to another early (yet still used) protocol SMTP which is used for email messages, NNTP allows both server-server and client-server communication. This means that newsgroups can be replicated from server to server which gives the Usenet network the ability to maintain a level of robust data persistence as a result of built-in data redundancy. However, most users will access using only the client-server commands of NNTP and in almost all cases will use a GUI for browsing as opposed to command line based client-server communication specified in the NNTP protocol.\nTypes.\nNewsgroups generally come in either of two types, binary, with single messages limited to some MB's, or text, where text groups are limited to some tens of kilobytes. There is no technical difference between the two, but the naming differentiation allows users and servers with limited facilities to minimize network bandwidth usage, by dropping the large size binary groups. Historically, with telephone modems at only kilobytes transfer rates, Usenet conventions and rules were enacted to minimize the overall amount of network traffic and resource usage, but today, only the above message size hard limits imposed by the providers are respected.\nTypically, the newsgroup is focused on a particular topic of interest. A message sent for publication on a newsgroup is called a \"post\". Some newsgroups allow posts on a wide variety of themes, regarding anything a member chooses to discuss as on-topic, while others keep more strictly to their particular subject, frowning on off-topic posts. The news admin (the administrator of a news server) decides how long posts are kept on their server before being expired (deleted), which is called retention. Different servers will have different retention times for the same newsgroup; some may keep posts for as little as one or two weeks, others may hold them for many years.\nBack when the early community was the pioneering computer society, the common habit seen with many posts was a notice at the end that disclosed whether the author had (or was free of) a personal interest (financial, political or otherwise) in making the post. This is rarer now, and the posts must be read more skeptically, as with other media. Privacy and phishing issues have also risen in importance.\nUsenet newsgroups posters and operators usually do not make money from their occupations on the platform.\nThe number of newsgroups grew from more than 100 as of 1983 to more than 110,000, but only 20,000 or so of those are active. Newsgroups vary in popularity; some newsgroups receive fewer than a dozen posts per year while the most popular can get several thousand in under an hour.\nBinary.\nWhile newsgroups were not created with the intention of distributing files such as pictures, sound and video, they have proven to be quite effective for this. As of 2022, some remain popular as an alternative to BitTorrent to share and download files.\nBecause newsgroups are widely distributed, a file uploaded once will be spread to many other servers and can then be downloaded by an unlimited number of users. More useful is that users download from a local news server, rather than from a more distant machine with perhaps limited connectivity, as may be the case with peer-to-peer technology. In fact, this is another benefit of newsgroups: it is usually not expected that users share. If every user makes uploads then the servers would be flooded; thus it is acceptable and often encouraged for users to just leech.\nThere were originally a number of obstacles to the transfer of binary files over Usenet. Usenet was originally designed with the transmission of text in mind, and so the encoding of posts caused losses in binary data where the data was not part of the protocol's character set. Consequently, for a long while, it was impossible to send binary data as such. As workarounds, codecs such as Uuencode and later Base64 and yEnc were developed which encoded the binary data from the files to be transmitted (e.g. sound or video files) to text characters which would survive transmission over Usenet. At the receiver's end, the data needed to be decoded by the user's news client.\nAdditionally, there was a limit on the size of individual posts so that large files could not be sent as single posts. To get around this, Newsreaders were developed which were able to split long files into several posts. Intelligent newsreaders at the other end could then automatically group such split files into single files, allowing the user to easily retrieve the file. These advances have meant that Usenet is used to send and receive many terabytes of files per day.\nThere are two main issues that pose problems for transmitting large files over newsgroups. The first is completion rates and the other is retention rates. The business of premium news servers is generated primarily on their ability to offer superior completion and retention rates, as well as their ability to offer very fast connections to users. Completion rates are significant when users wish to download large files that are split into pieces; if any one piece is missing, it is impossible to successfully download and reassemble the desired file. To work around the problem, a redundancy scheme known as Parchive (PAR) is commonly used.\nMany major news servers have a retention time of more than seven years. A number of websites exist to keep an index of files posted to binary newsgroups.\nPartly because of such long retention times, as well as growing uploading and downloading speeds, Usenet is also used by individuals to store backup data in a practice called \"Usenet backup\", or uBackup. While commercial providers offer easier-to-use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). A user must manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader has no control over them; they are automatically distributed to all Usenet providers that subscribe to the newsgroup they are uploaded to, so there will be copies of them spread all around the world.\nModerated newsgroups.\nMost Newsgroups are not moderated. A moderated newsgroup has one or more individuals who must approve posts before they are published. A separate address is used to submit posts and the moderators then propagate those they approve of. The first moderated newsgroups appeared in 1984 under mod.* according to RFC 2235, \"Hobbes' Internet Timeline\".\nDistribution.\nTransmission within and at the bounds of the network uses the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) (Internet standard RFC 3977 of 2006, updating RFC 977 of 1986).\nNewsgroup servers are hosted by various organizations and institutions. Most Internet service providers host their own news servers, or rent access to one, for their subscribers. There are also a number of companies who sell access to premium news servers.\nEvery host of a news server maintains agreements with other nearby news servers to synchronize regularly. In this way news servers form a redundant network. When a user posts to one news server, the post is stored locally. That server then shares posts with the servers that are connected to it for those newsgroups they both carry. Those servers do likewise, propagating the posts through the network. For newsgroups that are not widely carried, sometimes a carrier group is used for crossposting to aid distribution. This is typically only useful for groups that have been removed or newer \"alt.*\" groups. Crossposts between hierarchies, outside of the Big 8 and \"alt.*\" hierarchies, are prone to failure.\nHierarchies.\nNewsgroups are often arranged into \"hierarchies\", theoretically making it simpler to find related groups. The term \"top-level hierarchy\" refers to the hierarchy defined by the prefix before the first dot.\nThe most commonly known hierarchies are the \"Usenet hierarchies\". So for instance newsgroup \"rec.arts.sf.starwars.games\" would be in the \"rec.*\" top-level Usenet hierarchy, where the asterisk (*) is defined as a wildcard character. There were seven original major hierarchies of Usenet newsgroups, known as the \"Big 7\":\nThese were all created in the Great Renaming of 1986\u20131987, before which all of these newsgroups were in the net.* hierarchy. At that time there was a great controversy over what newsgroups should be allowed. Among those that the Usenet cabal (who effectively ran the Big 7 at the time) did not allow were those concerning recipes, recreational drug use, and sex.\nThis situation resulted in the creation of an \"alt.*\" (short for \"alternative\") Usenet hierarchy, under which these groups would be allowed. Over time, the laxness of rules on newsgroup creation in alt.* compared to the Big 7 meant that many new topics could, given time, gain enough popularity to get a Big 7 newsgroup. There was a rapid growth of alt.* as a result, and the trend continues to this day. Because of the anarchistic nature with which the groups sprang up, some jokingly referred to ALT standing for \"Anarchists, Lunatics and Terrorists\" (a backronym).\nIn 1995, \"humanities.*\" was created for the discussion of the humanities (e.g. literature, philosophy), and the Big 7 became the Big 8.\nThe \"alt.*\" hierarchy has discussion of all kinds of topics, and many hierarchies for discussion specific to a particular geographical area or in a language other than English.\nBefore a new Big 8 newsgroup can be created, an RFD (Request For Discussion) must be posted into the newsgroup news:, which is then discussed in news:. Once the proposal has been formalized with a name, description, charter, the Big-8 Management Board will vote on whether to create the group. If the proposal is approved by the Big-8 Management Board, the group is created. Groups are removed in a similar manner.\nCreating a new group in the alt.* hierarchy is not subject to the same rules; anybody can create a newsgroup, and anybody can remove it, but most news administrators will ignore these requests unless a local user requests the group by name.\nFurther hierarchies.\nThere are a number of newsgroup hierarchies outside of the Big 8 (and alt.*) that can be found on many news servers. These include non-English language groups, groups managed by companies or organizations about their products, geographic/local hierarchies, and even non-internet network boards routed into NNTP. Examples include (alphabetically):\nAdditionally, there is the \"free.*\" hierarchy, which can be considered \"more alt than alt.*\". There are many local sub-hierarchies within this hierarchy, usually for specific countries or cultures (such as \"free.it.*\" for Italy).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in the aftermath of World War II, NATO was established with the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. The organization serves as a system of collective security, whereby its independent member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any outside party. This is enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty, which states that an armed attack against one member shall be considered an attack against them all.\nThroughout the Cold War, NATO's primary purpose was to deter and counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union and its satellite states, which formed the rival Warsaw Pact in 1955. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the alliance adapted, conducting its first major military interventions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992\u20131995) and Yugoslavia (1999). Article 5 was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks, leading to the deployment of NATO troops to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The alliance has since been involved in a range of roles, including training in Iraq, intervention in Libya in 2011, and countering piracy.\nSince the end of the Cold War, the alliance has accepted sixteen new members, incorporating former Warsaw Pact countries and post-Soviet states. NATO and Russia have co-operated, but Russian leaders have called this eastward enlargement a threat to its security interests, and oppose Ukraine joining NATO. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 prompted strong condemnation from NATO and a renewed focus on collective defence. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to a major reinforcement of NATO's eastern flank and caused Finland and Sweden to abandon their neutral status and join the alliance. NATO recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine and Georgia as aspiring members.\nNATO's main headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium, while its military headquarters are near Mons, Belgium. The combined militaries of all NATO members include approximately 3.5 million soldiers and personnel. Their combined military spending constitutes over half of the global total. Members have committed to a target of spending at least 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defence to ensure the alliance's continued military readiness.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nNATO has its roots in the Atlantic Charter, a 1941 agreement between the United States and United Kingdom. The Charter laid out a framework for international cooperation without territorial expansion after World War II. On 4 March 1947, the Treaty of Dunkirk was signed by France and the United Kingdom during the aftermath of World War II and the start of the Cold War as a \"Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance\" in the event of possible attacks by Germany. In March 1948, this alliance was expanded in the Treaty of Brussels to include the Benelux countries, forming the Brussels Treaty Organization, commonly known as the Western Union. Talks for a wider military alliance, which could include North America, also began that month in the United States, where their foreign policy under the Truman Doctrine set out in 1947 promoted international solidarity against actions they saw as communist aggression, such as the February 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat in Czechoslovakia. These talks resulted in the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 by the member states of the Western Union plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson was a key author and drafter of the treaty.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty was largely dormant until the Korean War initiated the establishment of NATO to implement it with an integrated military structure. This included the formation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in 1951, which adopted many of the Western Union's military structures and plans, including their agreements on standardizing equipment and agreements on stationing foreign military forces in European countries. In 1952, the post of Secretary General of NATO was established as the organization's chief civilian. That year also saw the first major NATO maritime exercises, Exercise Mainbrace and the accession of Greece and Turkey to the organization. Following the London and Paris Conferences, West Germany was permitted to rearm militarily, as they joined NATO in May 1955, which was, in turn, a major factor in the creation of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War.\nThe building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 marked a height in Cold War tensions, when 400,000\u00a0US troops were stationed in Europe. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion \u2013 doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966. In 1982, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance.\nThe Revolutions of 1989 in Europe led to a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and focus on the continent. In October 1990, East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance, and in November 1990, the alliance signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) in Paris with the Soviet Union. It mandated specific military reductions across the continent, which continued after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in February 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that December, which removed the \"de facto\" main adversaries of NATO. This began a drawdown of military spending and equipment in Europe. The CFE treaty allowed signatories to remove 52,000\u00a0pieces of conventional armaments in the following sixteen years, and allowed military spending by NATO's European members to decline by 28 percent from 1990 to 2015. In 1990, several Western leaders gave assurances to Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand further east, as revealed by memoranda of private conversations.\nIn the 1990s, the organization extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the organization conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999.\nPolitically, the organization sought better relations with the newly autonomous Central and Eastern European states, and diplomatic forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbours were set up during this post-Cold War period, including the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative in 1994, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997, and the NATO\u2013Russia Permanent Joint Council in 1998. At the 1999 Washington summit, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic officially joined NATO, and the organization also issued new guidelines for membership with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\". These plans governed the subsequent addition of new alliance members.\n21st century.\n, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks, after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations.\nThe election of French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 led to a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.\nThe 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea led to strong condemnation by all NATO members, and was one of the seven times that Article 4, which calls for consultation among NATO members, has been invoked. Prior times included during the Iraq War and Syrian civil war. At the 2014 Wales summit, the leaders of NATO's member states formally committed for the first time to spend the equivalent of at least two percent of their gross domestic products on defence by 2024, which had previously been only an informal guideline.\nAt the 2016 Warsaw summit, NATO countries agreed on the creation of NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, which deployed four multinational battalion-sized battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Before and during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, several NATO countries sent ground troops, warships and fighter aircraft to reinforce the alliance's eastern flank, and multiple countries again invoked Article 4. In March 2022, NATO leaders met at Brussels for an extraordinary summit which also involved Group of Seven and European Union leaders. NATO member states agreed to establish four additional battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, and elements of the NATO Response Force were activated for the first time in NATO's history.\nAs of June 2022, NATO had deployed 40,000 troops along its Eastern flank to deter Russian aggression. More than half of this number have been deployed in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, which five countries muster a considerable combined ex-NATO force of 259,000 troops. To supplement Bulgaria's Air Force, Spain sent Eurofighter Typhoons, the Netherlands sent eight F-35 attack aircraft, and additional French and US attack aircraft would arrive soon as well. In 2025, Germany stationed a full armoured brigade in Lithuania.\nMilitary operations.\nEarly operations.\nNo military operations were conducted by NATO during the Cold War. Following the end of the Cold War, the first operations, \"Anchor Guard\" in 1990 and \"Ace Guard\" in 1991, were prompted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.\nBosnia and Herzegovina intervention.\nThe Bosnian War began in 1992, as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating situation led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9 October 1992, authorizing its member-states to enforce a previously declared no-fly zone under the United Nations Protection Force over central Bosnia and Herzegovina. NATO complied and started enforcing the ban on 12 April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28 February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.\nOn 10 and 11 April 1994, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes to protect the Gora\u017ede safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Gora\u017ede by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. In retaliation, Serbs took 150\u00a0U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April. On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Gora\u017ede by Serb forces.\nIn August 1995, a two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica genocide. Further NATO air strikes helped bring the Yugoslav Wars to an end, resulting in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO countries in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR, which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations were then passed onto the European Union Force Althea. Following the lead of its member states, NATO began to award a service medal, the NATO Medal, for these operations.\nKosovo intervention.\nIn an effort to stop Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's Serbian-led crackdown on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September 1998 to demand a ceasefire.\nNegotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23 March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which acted on protecting regional security and started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24 March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.\nThe campaign was and has been criticized over its civilian casualties, including the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and over whether it had legitimacy. The US, the UK, and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the UN Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3 June 1999, ending the Kosovo War. On 11 June, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 further accepted UN resolution 1244, under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence. In August\u2013September 2001, the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest, a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia. As of 2023[ [update]], around 4,500\u00a0KFOR soldiers, representing 27\u00a0countries, continue to operate in the area.\nWar in Afghanistan.\nThe September 11 attacks in the United States caused NATO to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Charter for the first time in the organization's history. The Article states that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4 October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, and to enhance the security of shipping in general, which began on 4 October 2001.\nThe alliance showed unity: on 16 April 2003, NATO agreed to take command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which included troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two countries leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11 August, and marked the first time in NATO's history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area.\nISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban, al-Qaeda and factional warlords, so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.\nOn 31 July 2006, the ISAF additionally took over military operations in the south of Afghanistan from a US-led anti-terrorism coalition. Due to the intensity of the fighting in the south, in 2011 France allowed a squadron of Mirage 2000 fighter/attack aircraft to be moved into the area, to Kandahar, in order to reinforce the alliance's efforts. During its 2012 Chicago Summit, NATO endorsed a plan to end the Afghanistan war and to remove the NATO-led ISAF Forces by the end of December 2014. ISAF was disestablished in December 2014 and replaced by the follow-on training Resolute Support Mission.\nOn 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May. Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan Armed Forces. By 15 August 2021, Taliban militants controlled the vast majority of Afghanistan and had encircled the capital city of Kabul. Some politicians in NATO member states have described the chaotic withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan and the collapse of the Afghan government as the greatest debacle that NATO has suffered since its founding.\nIraq training mission.\nIn August 2004, during the Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission \u2013 Iraq, a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the US-led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established at the request of the Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the country. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of the North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17 December 2011.\nTurkey invoked the first Article 4 meetings in 2003 at the start of the Iraq War. Turkey also invoked this article twice in 2012 during the Syrian civil war, after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F-4 reconnaissance jet, and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria, and again in 2015 after threats by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to its territorial integrity.\nGulf of Aden anti-piracy.\nIn 2008 the United Nations Secretary-General called on member-states to protect the ships of Operation Allied Provider, which was distributing aid as part of the World Food Programme mission in Somalia.\nThe North Atlantic Council and other countries, including Russia, China and South Korea, formed Operation Ocean Shield. The operation sought to dissuade and interrupt pirate attacks, protect vessels, and to increase the general level of security in the region.\nBeginning on 17 August 2009, NATO deployed warships in an operation to protect maritime traffic in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean from Somali pirates, and help strengthen the navies and coast guards of regional states.\nLibya intervention.\nDuring the Libyan Civil War, violence between protesters and the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi escalated, and on 17 March 2011 led to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which called for a ceasefire, and authorized military action to protect civilians. A coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya shortly afterwards, beginning with Op\u00e9ration Harmattan by the French Air Force on 19 March.\nOn 20 March 2011, NATO states agreed on enforcing an arms embargo against Libya with Operation Unified Protector using ships from NATO Standing Maritime Group\u00a01 and Standing Mine Countermeasures Group\u00a01, and additional ships and submarines from NATO members. They would \"monitor, report and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries\".\nOn 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone from the initial coalition, while command of targeting ground units remained with the coalition's forces. NATO began officially enforcing the UN resolution on 27 March 2011 with assistance from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. By June, reports of divisions within the alliance surfaced as only eight of the 28 member states were participating in combat operations, resulting in a confrontation between US Defense Secretary Robert Gates and countries such as Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Germany with Gates calling on the latter to contribute more and the latter believing the organization has overstepped its mandate in the conflict. In his final policy speech in Brussels on 10 June, Gates further criticized allied countries in suggesting their actions could cause the demise of NATO. The German foreign ministry pointed to \"a\u00a0considerable [German] contribution to NATO and NATO-led operations\" and to the fact that this engagement was highly valued by President Obama.\nWhile the mission was extended into September, Norway that day (10 June) announced it would begin scaling down contributions and complete withdrawal by 1 August. Earlier that week it was reported Danish air fighters were running out of bombs. The following week, the head of the Royal Navy said the country's operations in the conflict were not sustainable. By the end of the mission in October 2011, after the death of Colonel Gaddafi, NATO planes had flown about 9,500 strike sorties against pro-Gaddafi targets. A report from the organization Human Rights Watch in May 2012 identified at least 72 civilians killed in the campaign.\nFollowing a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt in October 2013, Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan requested technical advice and trainers from NATO to assist with ongoing security issues.\nTurkish border.\nUse of Article 5 has been threatened multiple times and four out of seven official Article 4 consultations have been called due to spillover in Turkey from the Syrian civil war. In April 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan considered invoking Article 5 of the NATO treaty to protect Turkish national security in a dispute over the Syrian civil war. The alliance responded quickly, and a spokesperson said the alliance was \"monitoring the situation very closely and will continue to do so\" and \"takes it very seriously protecting its members.\"\nAfter the shooting down of a Turkish military jet by Syria in June 2012 and Syrian forces shelling Turkish cities in October 2012 resulting in two Article 4 consultations, NATO approved Operation Active Fence. In the past decade the conflict has only escalated. In response to the 2015 Suru\u00e7 bombing, which Turkey attributed to ISIS, and other security issues along its southern border, Turkey called for an emergency meeting. The latest consultation happened in February 2020, as part of increasing tensions due to the Northwestern Syria offensive, which involved Syrian and suspected Russian airstrikes on Turkish troops, and risked direct confrontation between Russia and a NATO member.\nEastern flank.\nOperation Eastern Sentry is a NATO military initiative launched in response to Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace in September 2025. The operation aims to strengthen the alliance's eastern flank and deter further aggression. Multiple member states are contributing military assets, including fighter jets and naval units, to enhance air and ground defense capabilities. Eastern Sentry is designed to provide a flexible and agile response to threats, with a focus on countering drone technology.\nMembership.\nThe 32 NATO members are: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNATO has thirty-two members, mostly in Europe with two in North America. NATO's \"area of responsibility\", within which attacks on member states are eligible for an Article 5 response, is defined under Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty to include member territory in Europe, North America, Turkey, and islands in the North Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer. Attacks on vessels, aircraft and other forces in the North Atlantic (again, north of the Tropic of Cancer) and the Mediterranean Sea may also provoke an Article 5 response. During the original treaty negotiations, the United States insisted that colonies such as the Belgian Congo be excluded from the treaty. French Algeria was, however, covered until its independence on 3 July 1962. Twelve of these thirty-two are original members who joined in 1949, while the other twenty joined in one of ten enlargement rounds.\nSpecial arrangements.\nThe three Nordic countries which joined NATO as founding members, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway, chose to limit their participation in three areas: there would be no permanent peacetime bases, no nuclear warheads and no Allied military activity (unless invited) permitted on their territory. However, Denmark allows the U.S. Space Force to maintain Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland.\nFrom the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed \"Gaullo-Mitterrandism\". Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009, the latter being disbanded the following year. France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and, unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance.\nEnlargement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNATO was established on 4 April 1949 by the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty). The 12 founding members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nFour new members joined during the Cold War: Greece (1952), Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955) and Spain (1982). Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many former Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet states sought membership. In 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. At the 1999 Washington summit, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic officially joined, and NATO issued new guidelines for membership, with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\". These plans governed the addition of new members: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004, Albania and Croatia in 2009, Montenegro in 2017, and North Macedonia in 2020. Finland and Sweden are the newest members, joining in 2023 and 2024 respectively, spurred on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nUkraine's relationship with NATO began with the NATO\u2013Ukraine Action Plan in 2002. In 2005, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that if Ukraine joined NATO, \"we will respect their choice, because it is their sovereign right to decide their own defence policy, and this will not worsen relations between our countries\". However, since his 2007 Munich speech, Putin has strongly opposed further enlargement. In 2010, under President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine re-affirmed its non-aligned status and renounced aspirations of joining NATO. During the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Russia occupied Crimea and supported armed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Because of this, in December 2014 Ukraine's parliament voted to end its non-aligned status, and in 2019 it enshrined the goal of NATO membership in the Constitution. At the June 2021 Brussels Summit, NATO leaders affirmed that Ukraine would eventually join, and supported Ukraine's right to self-determination without interference. In late 2021, there was another massive Russian military buildup on Ukraine's borders. Russian president Putin warned that Ukraine joining NATO, and the deployment of missile defense systems or long-range missiles in Ukraine, would cross a red line. However, Ukraine was a long way from potential membership, and there were no such plans to deploy missiles. The Russian Foreign Ministry drafted a treaty that would forbid Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO. Secretary-General Stoltenberg replied that the decision is up to Ukraine and NATO members, adding \"Russia has no veto...and Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors\". NATO offered to improve communications with Russia and discuss missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's borders. Instead, Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed the country's southeast.\nGeorgia was promised \"future membership\" during the 2008 summit in Bucharest, but US president Barack Obama said in 2014 that the country was not \"currently on a path\" to membership.\nRussian leaders have said that NATO enlargement went against informal understandings between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and European and US negotiators that allowed for peaceful German reunification. A June 2016 Levada Center poll found that 68 percent of Russians think that deploying NATO troops in the Baltic states and Poland \u2013 former Eastern bloc countries bordering Russia \u2013 is a threat to Russia. In contrast, 65 percent of Poles surveyed in a 2017 Pew Research Center report identified Russia as a \"major threat\", with an average of 31 percent saying so across all NATO countries, and 67 percent of Poles surveyed in 2018 favour US forces being based in Poland. Of non-CIS Eastern European countries surveyed by Gallup in 2016, all but Serbia and Montenegro were more likely than not to view NATO as a protective alliance rather than a threat. A 2006 study in the journal \"Security Studies\" argued that NATO enlargement contributed to democratic consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe. China also opposes further expansion.\nNATO defence expenditure.\nDirect contributions.\nMember states pay for NATO's three common funds (the civil and military budgets and the security investment programme) based on a cost-sharing formula that includes per capita gross national income and other factors. In 2023\u20132024, the United States and Germany were the biggest contributors to the NATO budget at 16.2% each.\nIndirect contributions.\nMember states pay for and maintain their own troops and equipment. They contribute to NATO operations and missions by committing troops and equipment on a voluntary basis. Since 2006, the goal has been for each country to spend at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its own defence; in 2014, a NATO declaration said that countries not meeting the goal would \"aim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade\". In July 2022, NATO estimated that 11 members would meet the target in 2023. On 14 February 2024, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that 18 member states would meet the 2% target in 2024. On 17 June 2024, prior to the 2024 Washington summit, Stoltenberg updated that figure and announced that a record 23 of 32 NATO member states were meeting their defense spending targets of 2% of their country's GDP. NATO added that defense spending for European member states and Canada was up 18% in the past year alone. As of 2024, the following countries were not meeting the 2% contribution goal: Spain (1.28%), Luxembourg (1.29%), Slovenia (1.29%), Belgium (1.3%), Canada (1.37%), Italy (1.49%), Portugal (1.55%), and Croatia (1.81%). \nPartnerships with third countries.\nThe Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO: each country may choose the extent of its participation. Members include all current and former members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) was first established on 29 May 1997, and is a forum for regular coordination, consultation and dialogue between all fifty participants. The PfP programme is considered the operational wing of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership. Other third countries have also been contacted for participation in some activities of the PfP framework, such as Afghanistan.\nThe European Union (EU) signed a comprehensive package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16 December 2002. With this agreement, the EU was given the possibility of using NATO assets if it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, on the condition that NATO itself did not want to act \u2013 the so-called \"right of first refusal\". For example, Article 42(7) of the 1982 Treaty of Lisbon specifies that \"If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power\". The treaty applies globally to specified territories, whereas NATO is restricted under its Article 6 to operations north of the Tropic of Cancer. It provides a \"double framework\" for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme.\nAdditionally, NATO cooperates and discusses its activities with numerous other non-NATO members. The Mediterranean Dialogue was established in 1994 to coordinate in a similar way with Israel and countries in North Africa. The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was announced in 2004 as a dialogue forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue. The four participants are also linked through the Gulf Cooperation Council. In June 2018, Qatar expressed a wish to join NATO, who ruled it out, saying that only additional European countries could join according to Article 10 of NATO's founding treaty. Qatar and NATO had earlier signed a joint security agreement, in January 2018.\nPolitical dialogue with Japan began in 1990, and since then, the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries that do not form part of any of these cooperation initiatives. In 1998, NATO established a set of general guidelines that do not allow for a formal institutionalization of relations, but reflect the Allies' desire to increase cooperation. Following extensive debate, the term \"Contact Countries\" was agreed by the Allies in 2000. By 2012, the Alliance had broadened this group, which meets to discuss issues such as counter-piracy and technology exchange, under the names \"global partners\" or \"partners across the globe\". Australia and New Zealand, both global partners, are also members of the AUSCANNZUKUS strategic alliance, and similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members also aid cooperation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that NATO needs to \"address the rise of China\", by closely cooperating with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. Colombia is NATO's latest partner and has access to the full range of cooperative activities offered; it is the first and only Latin American country to cooperate with NATO.\nStructure.\nAll agencies and organizations of NATO are integrated into either the civilian administrative or military executive roles. For the most part, they perform roles and functions that directly or indirectly support the security role of the alliance as a whole.\nThe civilian structure includes:\nThe military structure includes:\nLegal authority of NATO commanders.\nNATO is an alliance of 32 sovereign states and their individual sovereignty is unaffected by participation in the alliance. NATO has no parliaments, no laws, no enforcement, and no power to punish individual citizens. As a consequence of this lack of sovereignty the power and authority of a NATO commander are limited. NATO commanders cannot punish offences such as failure to obey a lawful order; dereliction of duty; or disrespect to a senior officer. NATO commanders expect obedience but sometimes need to subordinate their desires or plans to the operators who are themselves subject to sovereign codes of conduct like the UCMJ. A case in point was the clash between General Sir Mike Jackson and General Wesley Clark over KFOR actions at Pristina Airport.\nNATO commanders can issue orders to their subordinate commanders in the form of operational plans (OPLANs), operational orders (OPORDERs), tactical direction, or fragmental orders (FRAGOs) and others. The joint rules of engagement must be followed, and the Law of Armed Conflict must be obeyed at all times. Operational resources \"remain under national command but have been transferred temporarily to NATO. Although these national units, through the formal process of transfer of authority, have been placed under the operational command and control of a NATO commander, they never lose their national character.\" Senior national representatives, like CDS, \"are designated as so-called red-cardholders\". Caveats are restrictions listed \"nation by nation... that NATO Commanders... must take into account\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt; \nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

It borders Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Gulf of Maine to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Of the 50 U.S. states, New Hampshire is the seventh-smallest by land area and the tenth-least populous, with a population of 1,377,529 residents as of the 2020 census. Concord is the state capital and Manchester is the most populous city. New Hampshire's motto, \"Live Free or Die\", reflects its role in the American Revolutionary War; its nickname, \"The Granite State\", refers to its extensive granite formations and quarries. It is well known for holding the first primary in the U.S. presidential election cycle, and its resulting influence on American electoral politics.\nNew Hampshire was inhabited for thousands of years by Algonquian-speaking peoples such as the Abenaki. Europeans arrived in the 17th century, with the English establishing some of the earliest non-indigenous settlements. The Province of New Hampshire was established in 1629, named after the English county of Hampshire. Following tensions between the British colonies and the crown in the 1760s, New Hampshire saw one of the earliest acts of rebellion, with the seizing of Fort William and Mary from the British in 1774. In 1776, it became the first of the British North American colonies to establish an independent government and state constitution. It signed the United States Declaration of Independence and in the war against Britain. In 1788, it was the 9th state to ratify the U.S. Constitution, bringing it into effect. Through the mid-19th century, New Hampshire was an active center of abolitionism, and fielded close to 32,000 Union soldiers during the U.S. Civil War. Afterwards the state saw rapid industrialization and population growth, becoming a center of textile manufacturing, shoemaking, and papermaking; the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in Manchester was the largest cotton textile plant in the world. French Canadians formed the most significant influx of immigrants, and a quarter of New Hampshire residents have French American ancestry.\nReflecting a nationwide trend, New Hampshire's industrial sector declined after World War II. Since 1950, its economy has diversified to include financial services, real estate, education, transportation and high-tech, with manufacturing still higher than the US average. Its population surged as highways connected it to Greater Boston and led to more commuter towns. New Hampshire is among the wealthiest and most-educated states, tying Massachusetts for the highest Human Development in the nation. It is one of nine states without an income tax and has no taxes on sales, capital gains, or inheritance while relying heavily on local property taxes to fund education; consequently, its state tax burden is among the lowest in the country. New Hampshire is one of the least religious states and known for its libertarian-leaning political culture; it is one of the least liberal states in New England. The New Hampshire Republican Party has held a trifecta majority in state level government since 2017, with the exception of 2019 and 2020, while the Democratic Party has held a majority on federal level representation in Congress. New Hampshire is the only state to have a woman as governor and women as both U.S. senators.\nWith its mountainous and heavily forested terrain, New Hampshire has a growing tourism sector centered on recreation. It has some of the highest ski mountains on the East Coast and is a major destination for winter sports; Mount Monadnock is among the most climbed mountains in the world. Other activities include observing the fall foliage, summer cottages along lakes and the seacoast, motorsports at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, and Motorcycle Week, a motorcycle rally held in Weirs Beach in Laconia. The White Mountain National Forest includes most of the Appalachian Trail between Vermont and Maine, and has the Mount Washington Auto Road, where visitors may drive to the top of Mount Washington.\nHistory.\nVarious Algonquian-speaking Abenaki tribes, largely divided between the Androscoggin, Cowasuck and Pennacook nations, inhabited the area before European colonization. Despite the similar language, they had a very different culture and religion from other Algonquian peoples.\nIndigenous people lived near Keene, New Hampshire 12,000 years ago, according to 2009 archaeological digs, and the Abenaki were present in New Hampshire in pre-colonial times.\nEnglish and French explorers visited New Hampshire in 1600\u20131605, and David Thompson settled at Odiorne's Point in present-day Rye in 1623. The first permanent European settlement was at Hilton's Point (present-day Dover). By 1631, the Upper Plantation comprised modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham; in 1679, it became the \"Royal Province\". Father Rale's War was fought between the colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy throughout New Hampshire.\nNew Hampshire was one of the Thirteen Colonies that rebelled against British rule during the American Revolution. During the American Revolution, New Hampshire was economically divided. The Seacoast region revolved around sawmills, shipyards, merchants' warehouses, and established village and town centers, where wealthy merchants built substantial homes, furnished them with luxuries, and invested their capital in trade and land speculation. At the other end of the social scale, there developed a permanent class of day laborers, mariners, indentured servants and slaves.\nIn December 1774, Paul Revere warned Patriots that Fort William and Mary would be reinforced with British troops. The following day, John Sullivan raided the fort for weapons. During the raid, the British soldiers fired at rebels with cannon and muskets, but there were apparently no casualties. These were among the first shots in the American Revolutionary period, occurring approximately five months before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. On January 5, 1776, New Hampshire became the first colony to declare independence from Great Britain, almost six months before the Declaration of Independence was signed by the Continental Congress.\nThe United States Constitution was ratified by New Hampshire on June 21, 1788, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to do so.\nNew Hampshire was a Jacksonian stronghold; the state sent Franklin Pierce to the White House in the election of 1852. Industrialization took the form of numerous textile mills, which in turn attracted large flows of immigrants from Quebec (the \"French Canadians\") and Ireland. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. After 1960, the textile industry collapsed, but the economy rebounded as a center of high technology and as a service provider.\nStarting in 1952, New Hampshire gained national and international attention for its presidential primary held early in every presidential election year. It immediately became an important testing ground for candidates for the Republican and Democratic nominations but did not necessarily guarantee victory. The media gave New Hampshire and Iowa significant attention compared to other states in the primary process, magnifying the state's decision powers and spurring repeated efforts by out-of-state politicians to change the rules.\nGeography.\nNew Hampshire is part of the six-state New England region of the Northeastern United States. It is bounded by Quebec, Canada, to the north and northwest; Maine and the Gulf of Maine to the east; Massachusetts to the south; and Vermont to the west. New Hampshire's major regions are the Great North Woods, the White Mountains, the Lakes Region, the Seacoast, the Merrimack Valley, the Monadnock Region, and the Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee area. New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any U.S. coastal state, with a length of , sometimes measured as only .\nThe White Mountains range in New Hampshire spans the north-central portion of the state. The range includes Mount Washington, the tallest in the northeastern U.S.\u2014site of the second-highest wind speed ever recorded\u2014 as well as Mount Adams and Mount Jefferson. With hurricane-force winds every third day on average, more than a hundred recorded deaths among visitors, and conspicuous krumholtz (dwarf, matted trees much like a carpet of bonsai trees), the climate on the upper reaches of Mount Washington has inspired the weather observatory on the peak to claim that the area has the \"World's Worst Weather\". The White Mountains were home to the rock formation called the Old Man of the Mountain, a face-like profile in Franconia Notch, until the formation disintegrated in May 2003. Even after its loss, the Old Man remains an enduring symbol for the state, seen on state highway signs, automobile license plates, and many government and private entities around New Hampshire.\nIn southwestern New Hampshire, the landmark Mount Monadnock has given its name to a class of earth-forms\u2014a \"monadnock\"\u2014signifying, in geomorphology, any isolated resistant peak rising from a less resistant eroded plain.\nNew Hampshire\u202fhas more than 800 lakes and ponds, and approximately of rivers and streams. Major rivers include the Merrimack River, which bisects the lower half of the state north\u2013south before passing into Massachusetts and reaching the sea in Newburyport. Its tributaries include the Contoocook River, Pemigewasset River, and Winnipesaukee River. The Connecticut River, which starts at New Hampshire's Connecticut Lakes and flows south to Connecticut, defines the western border with Vermont. The state border is not in the center of that river, as is usually the case, but at the low-water mark on the Vermont side; meaning the entire river along the Vermont border (save for areas where the water level has been raised by a dam) lies within New Hampshire. Only one town\u2014Pittsburg\u2014shares a land border with the state of Vermont. The \"northwesternmost headwaters\" of the Connecticut also define part of the Canada\u2013U.S. border.\nThe Piscataqua River and its several tributaries form the state's only significant ocean port where they flow into the Atlantic at Portsmouth. The Salmon Falls River and the Piscataqua define the southern portion of the border with Maine. The Piscataqua River boundary was the subject of a border dispute between New Hampshire and Maine in 2001, with New Hampshire claiming dominion over several islands (primarily Seavey's Island) that include the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case in 2002, leaving ownership of the island with Maine. New Hampshire still claims sovereignty of the base, however.\nThe largest of New Hampshire's lakes is Lake Winnipesaukee, which covers in the east-central part of New Hampshire. Umbagog Lake along the Maine border, approximately , is a distant second. Squam Lake is the second largest lake entirely in New Hampshire.\nNew Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any state in the United States, approximately long. Hampton Beach is a popular local summer destination. About offshore are the Isles of Shoals, nine small islands (four of which are in New Hampshire) known as the site of a 19th-century art colony founded by poet Celia Thaxter, and the alleged location of one of the buried treasures of the pirate Blackbeard.\nIt is the state with the highest percentage of timberland area in the country. New Hampshire is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. Much of the state, in particular the White Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The southeast corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River along the Vermont border are covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests. The state's numerous forests are popular among autumnal leaf peepers seeking the brilliant foliage of the numerous deciduous trees.\nThe northern third of the state is locally referred to as the \"north country\" or \"north of the notches\", in reference to the White Mountain passes that channel traffic. It contains less than 5% of the state's population, suffers relatively high poverty, and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline. However, the tourist industry, in particular visitors who go to northern New Hampshire to ski, snowboard, hike and mountain bike, has helped offset economic losses from mill closures.\nEnvironmental protection emerged as a key state issue in the early 1900s in response to poor logging practices. In the 1970s, activists defeated a proposal to build an oil refinery along the coast and limited plans for a full-width interstate highway through Franconia Notch to a parkway.\nWinter season lengths are projected to decline at ski areas across New Hampshire due to the effects of climate change, which is likely to continue the historic contraction and consolidation of the ski industry and threaten individual ski businesses and communities that rely on ski tourism.\nFlora and fauna.\nBlack bears, white-tailed deer, and moose can be found all over New Hampshire. There are also less-common animals such as the marten and the Canadian lynx.\nClimate.\nNew Hampshire experiences a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfa\" in some southern areas, \"Dfb\" in most of the state, and \"Dfc\" subarctic in some northern highland areas), with warm, humid summers, and long, cold, and snowy winters. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed all year. The climate of the southeastern portion is moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and averages relatively milder winters (for New Hampshire), while the northern and interior portions experience colder temperatures and lower humidity. Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state, and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas. Average annual snowfall ranges from to over across the state.\nAverage daytime highs are in the mid 70s\u00b0F to low 80s\u00b0F (24\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C) throughout the state in July, with overnight lows in the mid 50s\u00b0F to low 60s\u00b0F (13\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C). January temperatures range from an average high of on the coast to overnight lows below in the far north and at high elevations. Average annual precipitation statewide is roughly with some variation occurring in the White Mountains due to differences in elevation and annual snowfall. New Hampshire's highest recorded temperature was in Nashua on July 4, 1911, while the lowest recorded temperature was atop Mount Washington on January 29, 1934. Mount Washington also saw an unofficial reading on January 22, 1885, which, if made official, would tie the record low for New England (also at Big Black River, Maine, on January 16, 2009, and Bloomfield, Vermont on December 30, 1933).\nExtreme snow is often associated with a nor'easter, such as the Blizzard of '78 and the Blizzard of 1993, when several feet accumulated across portions of the state over 24 to 48 hours. Lighter snowfalls of several inches occur frequently throughout winter, often associated with an Alberta Clipper.\nNew Hampshire, on occasion, is affected by hurricanes and tropical storms\u2014although, by the time they reach the state, they are often extratropical\u2014with most storms striking the southern New England coastline and moving inland or passing by offshore in the Gulf of Maine. Most of New Hampshire averages fewer than 20 days of thunderstorms per year and an average of two tornadoes occur annually statewide.\nThe National Arbor Day Foundation plant hardiness zone map depicts zones 3, 4, 5, and6 occurring throughout the state and indicates the transition from a relatively cooler to warmer climate as one travels southward across New Hampshire. The 1990 USDA plant hardiness zones for New Hampshire range from zone 3b in the north to zone 5b in the south.\nMetropolitan areas.\nMetropolitan areas in the New England region are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs). The following is a list of NECTAs fully or partially in New Hampshire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPopulation.\nAs of the 2020 census, the resident population of New Hampshire was 1,377,529, a 4.6% increase since the 2010 United States census. The center of population of New Hampshire is in Merrimack County, in the town of Pembroke. The center of population has moved south since 1950, a reflection of the fact that the state's fastest growth has been along its southern border, which is within commuting range of Boston and other Massachusetts cities.\nAs indicated in the census, in 2020 88.3% of the population were White; 1.5% were Black or African American; 0.2% were Native American or Alaskan Native; 2.6% were Asian; 0.0% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; 1.7% were some other race; and 5.6% were two or more races. 4.3% of the total population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 18.6% of the population were under 18 years of age; 19.3% were 65 years and over. The female population was 50.5%.\nThe most densely populated areas generally lie within of the Massachusetts border, and are concentrated in two areas: along the Merrimack River Valley running from Concord to Nashua, and in the Seacoast Region along an axis stretching from Rochester to Portsmouth. Outside of those two regions, only one community, the city of Keene, has a population of over 20,000. The four counties covering these two areas account for 72% of the state population, and one (Hillsborough) has nearly 30% of the state population, as well as the two most populous communities, Manchester and Nashua. The northern portion of the state is very sparsely populated: the largest county by area, Coos, covers the northern one-fourth of the state and has only around 31,000 people, about a third of whom live in a single community (Berlin). The trends over the past several decades have been for the population to shift southward, as many northern communities lack the economic base to maintain their populations, while southern communities have been absorbed by the Greater Boston metropolis. \nAs of the 2010 census, the population of New Hampshire was 1,316,470. The gender makeup of the state at that time was 49.3% male and 50.7% female. 21.8% of the population were under the age of 18; 64.6% were between the ages of 18 and 64; and 13.5% were 65 years of age or older. Additionally, about 57.3% of the population was born out of state.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 1,605 homeless people in New Hampshire.\nHispanic or Latino of any race were 2.8% of the population in 2010: 0.6% were of Mexican, 0.9% Puerto Rican, 0.1% Cuban, and 1.2% other Hispanic or Latino origin. As of 2020, the Hispanic or Latino population was counted as 4.3%. The Native American/Alaska native population is listed as 0.3% in the 2020 census, but may be higher.\nAccording to the 2012\u20132017 American Community Survey, the largest ancestry groups in the state were Irish (20.6%), English (16.5%), French (14.0%), Italian (10.4%), German (9.1%), French Canadian (8.9%), and American (4.8%).\nNew Hampshire has the highest percentage (22.9%) of residents with French/French Canadian/Acadian ancestry of any U.S. state.\nIn 2018, the top countries of origin for New Hampshire's immigrants were India, Canada, China, Nepal and the Dominican Republic.\nAccording to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey estimates from 2017, 2.1% of the population aged5 and older speak Spanish at home, while 1.8% speak French. In Co\u00f6s County, 9.6% of the population speaks French at home, down from 16% in 2000. In the city of Nashua, Hillsborough County, 8.02% of the population speaks Spanish at home.\nBirth data.\n\"Note: Percentages in the table do not add up to 100, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\"\nIn 2022, New Hampshire had the lowest teen birth rate of any state, at 4.6 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 years of age.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA Pew survey in 2014 showed that the religious affiliations of the people of New Hampshire was as follows: nonreligious 36%, Protestant 30%, Catholic 26%, Jehovah's Witness 2%, LDS (Mormon) 1%, and Jewish 1%.\nA survey suggests people in New Hampshire and Vermont are less likely than other Americans to attend weekly services and only 54% say they are \"absolutely certain there is a God\" compared to 71% in the rest of the nation. New Hampshire and Vermont are also at the lowest levels among states in religious commitment. In 2012, 23% of New Hampshire residents in a Gallup poll considered themselves \"very religious\", while 52% considered themselves \"non-religious\". According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) in 2010, the largest denominations were the Catholic Church with 311,028 members; the United Church of Christ with 26,321 members; and the United Methodist Church with 18,029 members.\nIn 2016, a Gallup Poll found that New Hampshire was the least religious state in the United States. Only 20% of respondents in New Hampshire categorized themselves as \"very religious\", while the nationwide average was 40%.\nAccording to the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute study, 64% of the population was Christian, dominated by Roman Catholicism and evangelical Protestantism. In contrast with varying studies of estimated irreligiosity, the Public Religion Research Institute reported that irreligion declined from 36% at the separate 2014 Pew survey to 25% of the population in 2020. In 2021, the unaffiliated increased to 40% of the population, although Christianity altogether made up 54% of the total population (Catholics, Protestants, and Jehovah's Witnesses).\nEconomy.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that New Hampshire's total state product in 2018 was $86billion, ranking 40th in the United States. Median household income in 2017 was $74,801, the fourth highest in the country (including Washington, DC). Its agricultural outputs are dairy products, nursery stock, cattle, apples and eggs. Its industrial outputs are machinery, electric equipment, rubber and plastic products, and tourism is a major component of the economy.\nNew Hampshire experienced a major shift in its economic base during the 20th century. Historically, the base was composed of traditional New England textiles, shoemaking, and small machine shops, drawing upon low-wage labor from nearby small farms and parts of Quebec. Today, of the state's total manufacturing dollar value, these sectors contribute only two percent for textiles, two percent for leather goods, and nine percent for machining. They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the Southern United States.\nNew Hampshire today has a broad-based and growing economy, with a state GDP growth rate of 2.2% in 2018. The state's largest economic sectors in 2018, based on contribution to GDP, are: 15% real estate and rental and leasing; 13% professional business services; 12% manufacturing; 10% government and government services; and 9% health care and social services.\nThe state's budget in FY2018 was $5.97billion, including $1.79billion in federal funds. The state has a property tax (subject to municipal control) but no broad sales tax or income tax. The state does have narrower taxes on meals, lodging, vehicles, and business income; and has tolls on some expressways. Though there is no broad-based state tax, local jurisdictions have the U.S.'s 8th-highest property taxes as of a 2019 ranking by the Tax Foundation. However, the state's overall tax burden is relatively low; in 2010 New Hampshire ranked 8th-lowest among states in combined average state and local tax burden.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, New Hampshire's energy consumption and per capita energy consumption are among the lowest in the country. The Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, near Portsmouth, is the largest individual electrical generating unit on the New England power grid and provided 57% of New Hampshire's electricity generation in 2017. Power generation from wind power increased strongly in 2012 and 2013, but remained rather flat for the next ten years at around 4% of consumption. In 2016, 2017 and at least 2019\u20132022, New Hampshire obtained more of its electricity generation from wind power than from coal-fired power plants. Hydroelectric power and biomass are other important renewable resources in the state. New Hampshire was a net exporter of electricity, exporting .\nNew Hampshire's residential electricity use is low compared with the national average, in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their primary energy source for home heating. Nearly half of New Hampshire households use fuel oil for winter heating, which is one of the largest shares in the United States. New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power, hydroelectricity, and wood fuel.\nThe (preliminary) seasonally unemployment rate in April 2019 was 2.4% based on a 767,500 person civilian workforce with 749,000 people in employment. New Hampshire's workforce is 90% in nonfarm employment, with 18% employed in trade, transportation, and utilities; 17% in education and health care; 12% in government; 11% in professional and business services; and 10% in leisure and hospitality.\nLargest employers.\nIn March 2018, 86% of New Hampshire's workforce were employed by the private sector, with 53% of those workers being employed by firms with fewer than 100 employees. About 14% of private-sector employees are employed by firms with more than 1,000 employees.\nAccording to community surveys by the Economic &amp; Labor Market Information Bureau of NH Employment Security, the following are the largest private employers in the state as of 2018:\nNew Hampshire's state government employs approximately 6,100 people. Additionally, the U.S. Department of State employs approximately 1,600 people at the National Visa Center and National Passport Center in Portsmouth, which process United States immigrant visa petitions and United States passport applications.\nLaw and government.\nThe governor of New Hampshire, since January 9, 2025, is Republican Kelly Ayotte. New Hampshire's two U.S. senators are Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both of whom are Democrats and former governors. New Hampshire's two U.S. representatives as of January 2025 are Chris Pappas and Maggie Goodlander, both Democrats.\nNew Hampshire is an alcoholic beverage control state, and through the State Liquor Commission takes in $100million from the sale and distribution of liquor.\nNew Hampshire is the only state in the U.S. that does not require adults to wear seat belts in their vehicles. It is one of three states that have no mandatory helmet law.\nGoverning documents.\nThe New Hampshire State Constitution of 1783 is the supreme law of the state, followed by the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules. These are roughly analogous to the federal United States Constitution, United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations respectively.\nBranches of government.\nNew Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $10,000 and \"advises and consents\" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senate president serves as \"acting governor\" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties.\nThe legislature is called the General Court. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world, and 24 senators. Legislators are paid a nominal salary of $200 per two-year term plus travel costs, the lowest in the U.S. by far. Thus most are effectively volunteers, nearly half of whom are retirees. (For details, see the article on Government of New Hampshire.)\nThe state's sole appellate court is the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in civil or criminal cases. The other state courts are the Probate Court, District Court, and the Family Division.\nLocal government.\nNew Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns.\nNew Hampshire is a \"Dillon Rule\" state, meaning the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities. Even so, the legislature strongly favors local control, particularly concerning land use regulations. New Hampshire municipalities are classified as towns or cities, which differ primarily by the form of government. Most towns generally operate on the town meeting form of government, where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature, and a board of selectmen acts as the executive of the town. Larger towns and the state's thirteen cities operate either on a council\u2013manager or council\u2013mayor form of government. There is no difference, from the state government's point of view, between towns and cities besides the form of government. All state-level statutes treat all municipalities identically.\nNew Hampshire has a small number of unincorporated areas that are titled as grants, locations, purchases, or townships. These locations have limited to no self-government, and services are generally provided for them by neighboring towns or the county or state where needed. As of the 2000 census, there were 25 of these left in New Hampshire, accounting for a total population of 173 people (as of 2000[ [update]]); several were entirely depopulated. All but two of these unincorporated areas are in Co\u00f6s County.\nPolitics.\nNew Hampshire is known for its fiscal conservatism and cultural liberalism. The state's politics are cited as libertarian leaning. It is the least religious state in the Union as of a 2016 Gallup poll. The state has long had a great disdain for state taxation and state bureaucracy.\nThe Democratic Party and the Republican Party, in that order, are the two largest parties in the state. A plurality of voters are registered as undeclared, and can choose either ballot in the primary and then regain their undeclared status after voting. The Libertarian Party had official party status from 1990 to 1996 and from 2016 to 2018. A movement known as the Free State Project suggests libertarians move to the state to concentrate their power. As of August 30, 2022, there were 869,863 registered voters, of whom 332,008 (38.17%) did not declare a political party affiliation, 273,921 (31.49%) were Democratic, and 263,934 (30.34%) were Republican.\nAs of 2025, the Republican Party controls the governorship, the Executive Council, and both houses of the legislature. However, the Democratic Party controls all four seats in the state's delegation to Congress.\nNew Hampshire primary.\nThe New Hampshire primary is the first primary election in the quadrennial American presidential election cycle. State law requires that the Secretary of State schedule this election at least one week before any \"similar event\". While the Iowa caucus precedes the New Hampshire primary, the New Hampshire election is the nation's first contest that uses the same procedure as the general election. It draws more attention than those in other states and shapes the national contest.\nIn February 2023, the Democratic National Committee awarded that party's first primary to South Carolina, to be held on February 3, 2024, directing New Hampshire and Nevada to vote three days later. New Hampshire officials from both parties stood by the state's \"first in the nation\" law and ignored the DNC.\nState law permits a town with fewer than 100 residents to open its polls at midnight and close when all registered citizens have cast their ballots. Dixville Notch in Coos County and Hart's Location in Carroll County, among others, have implemented these provisions. Dixville Notch and Hart's Location are thus the first precincts in both New Hampshire and the U.S. to report results in presidential primaries and elections.\nNominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate primary election. In Presidential election cycles, this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire.\nSaint Anselm College in Goffstown has become a popular campaign spot for politicians as well as several national presidential debates.\nElections.\nIn the past, New Hampshire has often voted Republican. Between 1856 and 1988, New Hampshire cast its electoral votes for the Democratic presidential ticket six times: Woodrow Wilson (twice), Franklin D. Roosevelt (three times), and Lyndon B. Johnson (once).\nBeginning in 1992, New Hampshire became a swing state in national and local elections, and in that time has supported Democrats in all presidential elections except 2000. It was the only state in the country to switch from supporting Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 election to supporting his Democratic challenger in the 2004 election, when John Kerry, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, won the state.\nThe Democrats dominated elections in New Hampshire in 2006 and 2008. In 2006, Democrats won both congressional seats (electing Carol Shea-Porter in the first district and Paul Hodes in the second), re-elected Governor John Lynch, and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses for the first time since 1911. Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874. Neither U.S. Senate seat was up for a vote in 2006. In 2008, Democrats retained their majorities, governorship, and Congressional seats; and former governor Jeanne Shaheen defeated incumbent Republican John E. Sununu for the U.S. Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest.\nThe 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senate, a first for any legislative body in the United States.\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made historic gains in New Hampshire, capturing veto-proof majorities in the state legislature, taking all five seats in the Executive Council, electing a new U.S. senator, Kelly Ayotte, winning both U.S. House seats, and reducing the margin of victory of incumbent Governor John Lynch compared to his 2006 and 2008 landslide wins.\nIn the 2012 state legislative elections, Democrats took back the New Hampshire House of Representatives and narrowed the Republican majority in the New Hampshire Senate to 13\u201311. In 2012, New Hampshire became the first state in U.S. history to elect an all-female federal delegation: Democratic Congresswomen Carol Shea-Porter of Congressional District 1 and Ann McLane Kuster of Congressional District 2 accompanied U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte in 2013. Further, the state elected its second female governor: Democrat Maggie Hassan.\nIn the 2014 elections, Republicans retook the New Hampshire House of Representatives with a 239\u2013160 majority and expanded their majority in the New Hampshire Senate to 14 of the Senate's 24 seats. On the national level, incumbent Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. New Hampshire also elected Frank Guinta (R) for its First Congressional District representative and Ann Kuster (D) for its Second Congressional District representative.\nIn the 2016 elections, Republicans held the New Hampshire House of Representatives with a majority of 220\u2013175 and held onto their 14 seats in the New Hampshire Senate. In the gubernatorial race, retiring Governor Maggie Hassan was succeeded by Republican Chris Sununu, who defeated Democratic nominee Colin Van Ostern. Sununu became the state's first Republican governor since Craig Benson, who left office in 2005 following defeat by John Lynch. In the presidential race, the state voted for the Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, by a margin of 2,736 votes, or 0.3%, one of the closest results the state has ever seen in a presidential race, while Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received 4.12% of the vote. The Democrats also won a competitive race in the Second Congressional District, as well as a competitive senate race.\nSince 2017, Democrats have controlled New Hampshire's entire congressional delegation, while Republicans have controlled the governorship and (except in 2019\u20132020) both houses of the legislature.\nFree State Project.\nThe Free State Project (FSP) is a movement founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire, was selected in 2003), to concentrate libertarian activism around a single region. The Free State Project emphasizes decentralized decision-making, encouraging new movers and prior residents of New Hampshire to participate in a way the individual mover deems most appropriate. For example, as of 2017, there were 17 so-called Free Staters elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and in 2021, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, which ranks bills and elected representatives based on their adherence to what they see as libertarian principles, scored 150 representatives as \"A\u2212\" or above rated representatives. Participants also engage with other like-minded activist groups such as Rebuild New Hampshire, Young Americans for Liberty, and Americans for Prosperity. As of April 2022, approximately 6,232 participants have moved to New Hampshire for the Free State Project.\nTransportation.\nHighways.\nNew Hampshire has a well-maintained, well-signed network of Interstate highways, U.S. highways, and state highways. State highway markers still depict the Old Man of the Mountain despite that rock formation's demise in 2003. Several route numbers align with the same route numbers in neighboring states. State highway numbering is arbitrary, with no overall system, while the U.S. highway and Interstate systems follow national numbering conventions. Major routes include:\nAir.\nNew Hampshire has 25 public-use airports, three with some scheduled commercial passenger service. The busiest airport by number of passengers handled is Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester and Londonderry, which serves the Greater Boston metropolitan area. The closest airport with international service is Logan International Airport in Boston.\nPublic transportation.\nLong-distance intercity passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak's \"Vermonter\" and \"Downeaster\" lines.\nGreyhound, Concord Coach, Vermont Translines, and Dartmouth Coach all provide intercity bus connections to and from points in New Hampshire and to long-distance points beyond and in between.\nAs of 2013[ [update]], Boston-centered MBTA Commuter Rail services reach only as far as northern Massachusetts. The New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority is working to extend \"Capital Corridor\" service from Lowell, Massachusetts, to Nashua, Concord, and Manchester, including Manchester-Boston Regional Airport; and \"Coastal Corridor\" service from Haverhill, Massachusetts, to Plaistow, New Hampshire. Legislation in 2007 created the New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority (NHRTA) with the goal of overseeing the development of commuter rail in the state of New Hampshire. In 2011, Governor John Lynch vetoed HB 218, a bill passed by Republican lawmakers, which would have drastically curtailed the powers and responsibilities of NHRTA. The I-93 Corridor transit study suggested a rail alternative along the Manchester and Lawrence branch line which could provide freight and passenger service. This rail corridor would also have access to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.\nEleven public transit authorities operate local and regional bus services around the state, and eight private carriers operate express bus services which link with the national intercity bus network. The New Hampshire Department of Transportation operates a statewide ride-sharing match service, in addition to independent ride matching and guaranteed ride home programs.\nTourist railroads include the Conway Scenic Railroad, Hobo-Winnipesaukee Railroad, and the Mount Washington Cog Railway.\nFreight railways.\nFreight railways in New Hampshire include Claremont &amp; Concord Railroad (CCRR), Pan Am Railways via subsidiary Springfield Terminal Railway (ST), the New England Central Railroad (NHCR), the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad (SLR), and New Hampshire Northcoast Corporation (NHN).\nEducation.\nHigh schools.\nThe first public high schools in the state were the Boys' High School and the Girls' High School of Portsmouth, established either in 1827 or 1830, depending on the source.\nNew Hampshire has more than 80 public high schools, many of which serve more than one town. The largest is Pinkerton Academy in Derry, which is owned by a private non-profit organization and serves as the public high school of several neighboring towns. There are at least 30 private high schools in the state.\nNew Hampshire is also the home of several prestigious university-preparatory schools, such as Phillips Exeter Academy, St. Paul's School, Proctor Academy, Brewster Academy, and Kimball Union Academy.\nTraditionally, school funding has been decided by municipalities, often at town meeting. In 1993, the \"Claremont\" litigation began when that town's school district secured a verdict that Part 2, Article 83 of the state constitution required the state to fund education adequately and uniformly. This was never achieved despite additional rounds of litigation. In 2002, New Hampshire enacted a statewide property tax to be forwarded to school districts to address the problem. In 2008, the Court ended its supervisory role because the original laws had been replaced, but it did not reverse its earlier finding. In 2023, a district judge set a new, higher amount for educational \"adequacy\". In June 2025, the legislature enacted language asserting its right to determine funding. The New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the 2023 verdict but declined to force the legislature to comply.\nMedia.\nDaily newspapers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther publications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports.\nThe following sports teams are based in New Hampshire:\nThe sport of paintball was invented in Henniker in 1981. Sutton was the home of the world's first commercial paintball facility.\nThe New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon is an oval track and road course that has been visited by national motorsport championship series such as the NASCAR Cup Series, the NASCAR Xfinity Series, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour, American Canadian Tour (ACT), the Champ Car and the IndyCar Series. Other motor racing venues include Star Speedway and New England Dragway in Epping, Lee USA Speedway in Lee, Twin State Speedway in Claremont, Monadnock Speedway in Winchester and Canaan Fair Speedway in Canaan.\nNew Hampshire has two universities competing at the NCAA Division I in all collegiate sports: the Dartmouth Big Green (Ivy League) and the New Hampshire Wildcats (America East Conference), as well as three NCAA Division II teams: Franklin Pierce Ravens, Saint Anselm Hawks, and Southern New Hampshire Penmen (Northeast-10 Conference). Most other schools compete in NCAA Division III or the NAIA.\nAnnually since 2002, high-school statewide all-stars compete against Vermont in 10 sports during \"Twin State\" playoffs.\nCulture.\nIn the spring, New Hampshire's many sap houses hold sugaring-off open houses. In summer and early autumn, New Hampshire is home to many county fairs, the largest being the Hopkinton State Fair, in Contoocook. New Hampshire's Lakes Region is home to many summer camps, especially around Lake Winnipesaukee, and is a popular tourist destination. The Peterborough Players have performed every summer in Peterborough since 1933. The Barnstormers Theatre in Tamworth, founded in 1931, is one of the longest-running professional summer theaters in the United States.\nIn September, New Hampshire is host to the \"New Hampshire Highland Games\". New Hampshire has also registered an official tartan with the proper authorities in Scotland, used to make kilts worn by the Lincoln Police Department while its officers serve during the games. The fall foliage peaks in mid-October. In the winter, New Hampshire's ski areas and snowmobile trails attract visitors from a wide area. After the lakes freeze over they become dotted with ice fishing ice houses, known locally as bobhouses.\nFunspot, the world's largest video arcade (now termed a museum), is in Laconia.\nIn fiction.\nMany , and have been set in New Hampshire.\nTelevision.\nMany have been set in New Hampshire. Notable recent examples include:\nNotable people.\nProminent individuals from New Hampshire include 14th President of the United States Franklin Pierce, founding father Nicholas Gilman, Senator Daniel Webster, Revolutionary War hero John Stark, editor Horace Greeley, founder of the Christian Science religion Mary Baker Eddy, poet Robert Frost, sculptor Daniel Chester French, astronaut Alan Shepard, rock musician Ronnie James Dio, author Dan Brown, actor-comedian Adam Sandler, inventor Dean Kamen, comedians Sarah Silverman and Seth Meyers, restaurateurs Richard and Maurice McDonald, WWE wrestler Triple H, and streamer Ludwig Ahgren.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21137", "revid": "51021181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21137", "title": "Numerology", "text": "Mystical properties of numbers\nNumerology (known before the 20th century as arithmancy) is the belief in an occult, divine or mystical relationship between a number and one or more coinciding events. It is also the study of the numerical value, via an alphanumeric system, of the letters in words and names. When numerology is applied to a person's name, it is a form of onomancy. It is often associated with astrology and other divinatory arts.\nNumber symbolism is an ancient and pervasive aspect of human thought, deeply intertwined with religion, philosophy, mysticism, and mathematics. Different cultures and traditions have assigned specific meanings to numbers, often linking them to divine principles, cosmic forces, or natural patterns.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"arithmancy\" is derived from two Greek words \u2013 \"arithmos\" (meaning number) and \"manteia\" (meaning divination). \"\u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\" Arithmancy is thus the study of divination through numbers. Although the word \"arithmancy\" dates back to the 1570s, the word \"numerology\" was not recorded in English before c. 1907.\nHistory.\nThe practice of gematria, assigning numerical values to words and names and imputing those values with religious meaning, dates back to antiquity. An Assyrian inscription from the 8th century BC, commissioned by Sargon\u00a0II declares \"the king built the wall of Khorsabad 16,283 cubits long to correspond with the numerical value of his name\". Rabbinic literature used gematria to interpret passages in the Hebrew Bible.\nThe practice of using alphabetic letters to represent numbers developed in the Greek city of Miletus, and is thus known as the Milesian system. Early examples include vase graffiti dating back to the 6th century BCE. Aristotle wrote that the Pythagorean tradition, founded in the 6th century by Pythagoras of Samos, practiced isopsephy, the Greek predecessor of Hebrew gematria. Pythagoras was a contemporary of the philosophers Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the historian Hecataeus, all of whom lived in Miletus, across the sea from Samos. The Milesian system was in common use by the reign of Alexander the Great (336\u2013323\u00a0BCE) and was adopted by other cultures during the subsequent Hellenistic period. It was officially adopted in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy\u00a0II Philadelphus (284\u2013246\u00a0BCE).\nBy the late 4th century AD, following the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD and the subsequent enforcement of Nicene Christianity under Theodosius I, departures from the beliefs of the state church were classified as civil violations within the Roman Empire. Numerology, referred to as isopsephy, remained in use in conservative Greek Orthodox circles, particularly in mystical and theological contexts.\nSome alchemical theories were closely related to numerology. For example, Arab alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (died c.\u00a0806\u2212816) framed his experiments in an elaborate numerology based on the names of substances in the Arabic language.\nNumerology is prominent in Sir Thomas Browne's 1658 literary discourse \"The Garden of Cyrus\". Throughout its pages, the author attempts to demonstrate that the number five and the related quincunx pattern can be found throughout the arts, in design, and in nature, particularly botany.\nSome approaches to understanding the meanings of the Qur'an (the book of Muslims) include the understanding of numerical meanings, numerical symbols and their combination with purely textual approaches.\nMethods.\nAlphanumeric systems.\nThere are various numerology systems which assign numerical value to the letters of an alphabet. Examples include the Abjad numerals in Arabic, Hebrew numerals, Armenian numerals, and Greek numerals. The practice within Jewish tradition of assigning mystical meaning to words based on their numerical values, and on connections between words of equal value, is known as \"gematria\".\nThe Mandaean number alphasyllabary is also used for numerology (Mandaic: \"gma\u1e6d aria\"). The \"Book of the Zodiac\" is an important Mandaean text on numerology.\nPythagorean method.\nIn the Pythagorean method (which uses a kind of place-value for number-letter attributions, as does the ancient Hebrew and Greek systems), the letters of the modern Latin alphabet are assigned numerical values 1 through 9.\nAgrippan method.\nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa applied the concept of arithmancy to the classical Latin alphabet in the 16th century in \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\". He mapped the letters as follows (in accordance with the Latin alphabet's place-value at that time):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNote that the letters U, J, and W were not commonly considered part of the Latin alphabet at the time.\nAngel numbers.\nSo-called Angel numbers, as defined by Doreen Virtue and Lynnette Brown in 2004, are numbers consisting of repeating digits, such as 111 or 444. As of 2023[ [update]], a number of popular media publications have published articles suggesting that these numbers have numerological significance. Doreen Virtue has since renounced the concept of angel numbers in a 2024 interview with \"The Cut\" declaring that, \"It\u2019s garbage. I regret it, and I\u2019m sorry that I made them.\"\nHowever, so-called \"Angel numbers\" have a traditional place within arithmancy, although they are not known by that name.\nEnglish systems.\nThere are various systems of English Qabalah or numerology. These systems interpret the letters of the Roman script or English alphabet via an assigned set of numerological significances. English Qaballa, on the other hand, refers specifically to a Qabalah supported by a system discovered by James Lees in 1976.\nThe first system of English gematria was used by the poet John Skelton in 1523 in his poem \"The Garland of Laurel\". The next reference to an English gematria found in the literature was made by Willis F. Whitehead in 1899 in his book \"The Mystic Thesaurus\", in which he describes a system he called \"English Cabala\".\nIn 1952, John P. L. Hughes published \"The Hidden Numerical Significance of the English Language, or, Suggestive Gematria\", based on his lecture delivered at Holden Research Circle on July 4, 1952. A system related to the Spiritualist Agasha Temple of Wisdom was described by William Eisen in his two volume \"The English Cabalah\" (1980\u201382).\nWilliam G. Gray proposes another system in his 1984 book \"Concepts of Qabalah\", more recently republished as \"Qabalistic Concepts\". This system includes correspondence attributions of the English letters to the positions on the Tree of Life. Michael Bertiaux described a system called \"Angelic Gematria\" in his \"The Voudon Gnostic Workbook\" (1989). David Rankine described a system of English gematria using prime numbers which he calls \"Prime Qabalah\" in his book \"Becoming Magick\" (2004).\nIn popular culture.\nIn modern culture, numerology continues to influence personal and public life. For example, Australian MP Sussan Ley credibly altered the spelling of her own name according to numerological advice, believing it would bring excitement to her life, a story widely reported in 2025.\nSimilarly, celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow have marked entry into a \u201c9-year\u201d numerological cycle signifying transformation and closure, with symbolic gestures such as posting rain imagery associated with personal renewal.\nRelated uses.\nScientific theories are sometimes labeled \"numerology\" if their primary inspiration appears to be a set of patterns rather than scientific observations. This colloquial use of the term is quite common within the scientific community and it is mostly used to dismiss a theory as questionable science.\nThe best known example of \"numerology\" in science involves the coincidental resemblance of certain large numbers that intrigued mathematical physicist Paul Dirac, mathematician Hermann Weyl and astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington. These numerical coincidences refer to such quantities as the ratio of the age of the universe to the atomic unit of time, the number of electrons in the universe, and the difference in strengths between gravity and the electric force for the electron and proton. (See also Fine-tuned universe).\nWolfgang Pauli was also fascinated by the appearance of certain numbers, including 137 (a prime number), in physics.\nBritish mathematician I. J. Good wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There have been a few examples of numerology that have led to theories that transformed society: see the mention of Kirchhoff and Balmer in [...] and one can well include Kepler on account of his third law. It would be fair enough to say that numerology was the origin of the theories of electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, gravitation. [...] So I intend no disparagement when I describe a formula as numerological.\nWhen a numerological formula is proposed, then we may ask whether it is correct. [...] I think an appropriate definition of correctness is that the formula has a good explanation, in a Platonic sense, that is, the explanation could be based on a good theory that is not yet known but 'exists' in the universe of possible reasonable ideas.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21139", "revid": "19042704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21139", "title": "North America", "text": "Continent\nNorth America is a continent in the Northern and Western hemispheres. North America is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean. The region includes Middle America comprising the Caribbean, Central America, and Northern America.\nNorth America covers an area of around , representing approximately 16.5% of Earth's land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after Asia and Africa, and the fourth-largest continent by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. As of 2021[ [update]], North America's population was estimated as over 592 million people in 23 independent states and territories, or about 7.5% of the world's population. In human geography, the terms \"North America\" and \"North American\" refers to Canada, Greenland, Mexico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the United States.\nIt is unknown with certainty how and when first human populations first reached North America. People were known to live in the Americas at least 20,000 years ago, but various evidence points to possibly earlier dates. The Paleo-Indian period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago when the Archaic period began. The classic stage followed the Archaic period, and lasted from approximately the 6th to 13th centuries. Beginning in 1000 AD, the Norse were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America.\nIn 1492, the exploratory voyages of Christopher Columbus led to a transatlantic exchange, including migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, immigrants from Europe, Asia, and descendants of these respective groups.\nEurope's colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, and the cultures of the region commonly reflect Western traditions. However, relatively small parts of North America in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre-European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions.\nName.\nThe Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by German cartographers Martin Waldseem\u00fcller and Matthias Ringmann. Vespucci explored South America between 1497 and 1502, and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass then unknown to the Europeans. In 1507, Waldseem\u00fcller published a world map, and placed the word \"America\" on the continent of present-day South America. The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias. On a 1553 world map published by Petrus Apianus, North America was called \"Baccalearum\", meaning \"realm of the Cod fish\", in reference to the abundance of cod on the East Coast.\nWaldseem\u00fcller used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of \"America\", following the examples of \"Europa\", \"Asia\", and \"Africa\". Americus originated from Medieval Latin (see Saint Emeric of Hungary), coming from the Old High German name Emmerich. Map makers later extended the name America to North America.\nIn 1538, Gerardus Mercator used the term America on his world map of the entire Western Hemisphere. On his subsequent 1569 map, Mercator called North America \"America or New India\" (\"America sive India Nova\").\nThe Spanish Empire called its territories in North and South America \"Las Indias\", and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the Council of the Indies.\nDefinition.\nThe United Nations and its statistics division recognize North America as including three subregions: Northern America, Central America, and the Caribbean. \"Northern America\" is a term distinct from \"North America\", excluding the Caribbean and \"Central America\", which also includes Mexico. In the limited context of regional trade agreements, the term is used to reference three countries: Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\nFrance, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and the countries of Latin America use a six-continent model, with the Americas viewed as a single continent and \"North America\" designating a subregion comprising Canada, Mexico, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (politically a part of France), the United States, and often Bermuda, Clipperton Island, and Greenland.\nNorth America has historically been known by other names, including Spanish North America, New Spain, New France, British North America and Am\u00e9rica Septentrional, the first official name given to Mexico.\nRegions.\nNorth America includes several regions and subregions, each of which have their own respective cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions include several regions formalized in 20th- and 21st-century trade agreements, including NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and CAFTA between Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.\nNorth America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions, Anglo-America and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of North America, Belize, and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations. There are also regions, including Louisiana and Quebec, with large Francophone populations; in Quebec and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, French is the official language..\nThe southern portion of North America includes Central America and non-English-speaking Caribbean nations. The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of North America, which encompasses the whole North American continent, the term \"North America\" is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the U.S. The U.S. Census Bureau includes Saint Pierre and Miquelon, but excludes Mexico from its definition.\nThe term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America: the U.S., Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, and St. Pierre and Miquelon. Although the term does not refer to a unified region, Middle America includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.\nNorth America's largest countries by land area are Canada and the U.S., both of which have well-defined and recognized subregions. In Canada, these include (from east to west) Atlantic Canada, Central Canada, the Canadian Prairies, the British Columbia Coast, Western Canada, and Northern Canada. In the U.S., they include New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, and Pacific states. The Great Lakes region and the Pacific Northwest include areas in both the U.S. and Canada.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian era.\nThe indigenous peoples of the Americas have many creation myths, some of which assert that they have been present on the land since its creation, but there is no evidence that humans evolved there. The specifics of the initial settlement of the Americas by ancient Asians are subject to ongoing research and discussion. The traditional theory has been that hunters entered the Bering Land Bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska from 27,000 to 14,000 years ago. A growing viewpoint is that the first American inhabitants sailed from Beringia some 13,000 years ago, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the Last Glacial Period, in what is known as the Late Glacial Maximum, around 12,500 years ago. The oldest petroglyphs in North America date from 15,000 to 10,000 years before present. Genetic research and anthropology indicate additional waves of migration from Asia via the Bering Strait during the Early-Middle Holocene.\nPrior to the arrival of European explorers and colonists in North America, the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, ranging from small bands of a few families to large empires. They lived in several culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there, including the bison hunters of the Great Plains and the farmers of Mesoamerica. Native groups also are classified by their language families, which included Athabaskan and Uto-Aztecan languages. Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, however, and were not necessarily always allies. Anthropologists speculate that the Inuit of the high Arctic arrived in North America much later than other native groups, evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people.\nDuring the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest yet discovered is the Clovis culture (c.\u00a09550\u20139050\u00a0BCE) in modern New Mexico. Later groups include the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures, found in the Mississippi River valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the Four Corners. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes, squash, and maize. As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many other cultural advances were made there. The Mayans developed a writing system, built huge pyramids and temples, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero around 400\u00a0CE.\nThe first recorded European references to North America are in Norse sagas where it is referred to as Vinland. The earliest verifiable instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by any European culture with the North America mainland has been dated to around 1000\u00a0CE. The site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named Newfoundland, has provided unmistakable evidence of Norse settlement. Norse explorer Leif Erikson (c.\u00a0970\u20131020 CE) is thought to have visited the area. Erikson was the first European to make landfall on the continent (excluding Greenland).\nThe Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire, whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.\nPost-contact, 1492\u20131910.\nDuring the so-called Age of Discovery, Europeans explored overseas and staked claims to various parts of North America, much of which was already settled by indigenous peoples. Upon Europeans' arrival in the \"New World\", indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions, including curiosity, trading, cooperation, resignation, and resistance. The indigenous population declined substantially following European arrival, primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity, and because of violent conflicts with Europeans. Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups died out, and others changed quite quickly.\nOn North America's southeastern coast, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, who had accompanied Columbus's second voyage, visited and named in 1513 \"La Florida\". As the colonial period unfolded, Spain, England, and France appropriated and claimed extensive territories on North America's eastern and southern coastlines. Spain established permanent settlements on the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba in the 1490s, building cities, putting the resident indigenous populations to work, raising crops for Spanish settlers and panning gold to enrich the Spaniards. Much of the indigenous population died due to disease and overwork, spurring the Spaniards on to claim new lands and peoples. An expedition under the command of Spanish settler, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, sailed westward in 1519 to what turned out to be the mainland in Mexico. With local indigenous allies, the Spanish conquered the Aztec empire in central Mexico in 1521. Spain then established permanent cities in Mexico, Central America, and Spanish South America in the sixteenth century. Once Spaniards conquered the high civilization of the Aztecs and Incas, the Caribbean was a backwater of the Spanish empire.\nOther European powers began to intrude on areas claimed by Spain, including the Caribbean islands. France took the western half of Hispaniola and developed Saint-Domingue as a cane sugar producing colony worked by black slave labor. Britain took Barbados and Jamaica, and the Dutch and Danes took islands previously claimed by Spain. Britain did not begin settling on the North American mainland until a hundred years after the first Spanish settlements, since it sought first to control nearby Ireland.\nEnglish settlements.\nThe first permanent English settlement was in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, followed by additional colonial establishments on the east coast from present-day Georgia in the south to Massachusetts in the north, forming the Thirteen Colonies of British America. The English did not establish settlements north or east of the St. Lawrence Valley in present-day Canada until after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. Britain's early settlements in present-day Canada included St. John's, Newfoundland in 1630 and Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1749. The first permanent French settlement was in Quebec City, Quebec, established in 1608.\nSeven Years' War.\nWith the British victory in the Seven Years' War, France in 1763 ceded to Britain its claims of North American territories east of the Mississippi River. Spain, in turn, gained rights to the territories west of Mississippi, which then served as a border between Spain and Britain's territorial claims. French colonists settled Illinois Country after several generations of experience on North America, migrating over the Mississippi River to regions where Spain was not present and where they were able to leverage their earlier Louisiana French settlements around the Gulf of Mexico. These early French settlers partnered with midwest indigenous tribes, and their mixed ancestry descendants later followed a westward expansion all the way to the Pacific Ocean on the present-day U.S. West Coast.\nAmerican Revolution.\nIn 1776, after various attempts to reconcile differences with the British, the Thirteen Colonies in British America sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, who unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring it. In the Declaration, the thirteen colonies declared their independence from the British monarchy, then governed by King George III, and detailed the factors that contributed to their decision. With the signing and issuance of the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen colonies formalized and escalated the American Revolutionary War, which had begun the year before at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775. Gathered in Philadelphia following the war's outbreak, delegates from the thirteen colonies established the Continental Army from various patriot militias then engaged in resisting the British, and appointed George Washington as the Continental Army's military commander.\nAs the American Revolutionary War progressed, France and Spain, both then enemies of Britain, began to ultimately see the promise of a potential American victory in the war and began supporting Washington and the American Revolutionary cause. The British Army, in turn, was supported by Hessian military units from present-day Germany.\nIn 1783, after an eight-year attempt to defeat the American rebellion, King George III acknowledged Britain's defeat in the war, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 3 September 1783, which solidified the sovereign establishment of the United States.\nWestward expansion.\nBy the late 18th century, Russia was established on the Pacific Northwest northern coastline, where it was engaged in maritime fur trade and was supported by various indigenous settlements in the region. As a result, the Spanish were showing more interest in controlling the trade on the Pacific coast and mapped most of its coastline. The first Spanish settlements were attempted in Alta California during that period. Numerous overland explorations associated with voyageurs, fur trade, and U.S. led expeditions, including the Lewis and Clark, Fr\u00e9mont and Wilkes expeditions, reached the Pacific.\nIn 1803, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, Napoleon Bonaparte sold France's remaining North American territorial claims, which included regions west of the Mississippi River, to the U.S., in the Louisiana Purchase. Spain and the U.S. settled their western boundary dispute in 1819 in the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty. Mexico fought a lengthy war for independence from Spain, winning it for Mexico (which included Central America at the time) in 1821. The U.S. sought further westward expansion and fought the Mexican\u2013American War, gaining a vast territory that first Spain and then Mexico claimed but which they did not effectively control. Much of the area was in fact dominated by indigenous peoples, which did not recognize the claims of Spain, France, or the U.S. Russia sold its North American claims, which included the present-day U.S. state of Alaska, to the U.S. in 1867.\nCanada and Panama Canal.\nIn 1867, colonial settlers north of the United States, unified as the dominion of Canada. The U.S. sought to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama in present-day Panama in Central America, then a part of present-day Colombia. The U.S. aided Panamanians in a war that resulted in its separation from Colombia. The U.S. subsequently carved out the Panama Canal Zone, and claimed sovereignty over it. After decades of work, the Panama Canal was completed, which connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in 1913 and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation.\nGeography.\nNorth America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World, the Western Hemisphere, the Americas, or simply America, which, in many countries, is considered a single continent with North America a subcontinent. North America is the third-largest continent by area after Asia and Africa.\nNorth America's only land connection to South America is in present-day Panama at the Darien Gap on the Colombia\u2013Panama border, placing almost all of Panama within North America. Alternatively, some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, with Central America extending southeastward to South America from this point. The Caribbean islands, or West Indies, are considered part of North America. The continental coastline is long and irregular. The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by Hudson Bay. Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California.\nBefore the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge, which had connected North and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela.\nThere are several islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, the Aleutian Islands (some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere proper), the Alexander Archipelago, the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the world's largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American Plate) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago (mya). The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent.\nThe vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of California, including the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz, lie on the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate, with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas Fault. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the Caribbean Plate, whereas the Juan de Fuca Plate and Cocos Plate border the North American Plate on its western frontier.\nThe continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, California, and Alaska; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long plateaus and cordilleras, falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.\nThe western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, with the Great Basin\u2014a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts\u2014in between. The highest peak is Denali (also called Mount McKinley) in Alaska.\nThe U.S. Geographical Survey (USGS) states that the geographic center of North America is \"6 miles [10 km] west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota\" at about , about from Rugby, North Dakota. The USGS further states that \"No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 states, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.\" Nonetheless, there is a field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located from the nearest coastline, between Allen and Kyle, South Dakota at .\nCanada.\nCanada can be divided into roughly seven physiographic divisions:\nUnited States.\nThe lower 48 U.S. states can be divided into roughly eight physiographic divisions:\nMexico.\nMexico can be divided into roughly fifteen physiographic divisions:\nClimate.\nNorth America is a very large continent that extends from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Tropic of Cancer. Greenland, along with the Canadian Shield, is tundra with average temperatures ranging from , but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes.\nClimate west of the Cascade Range is described as being temperate weather with average precipitation .\nClimate in coastal California is described to be Mediterranean, with average temperatures in cities like San Francisco ranging from over the course of the year.\nStretching from the East Coast to eastern North Dakota, and stretching down to Kansas, is the humid continental climate featuring intense seasons, with a large amount of annual precipitation, with places like New York City averaging .\nStarting at the southern border of the humid continental climate and stretching to the Gulf of Mexico (while encompassing the eastern half of Texas) is the humid subtropical climate. This area has the wettest cities in the contiguous U.S., with annual precipitation reaching in Mobile, Alabama.\nStretching from the borders of the humid continental and subtropical climates, and going west to the Sierra Nevada, south to the southern tip of Durango, north to the border with tundra climate, the steppe/desert climates are the driest in the U.S. Highland climates cut from north to south of the continent, where subtropical or temperate climates occur just below the tropics, as in central Mexico and Guatemala. Tropical climates appear in the island regions and in the subcontinent's bottleneck, found in countries and states bathed by the Caribbean Sea or to the south of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Precipitation patterns vary across the region, and as such rainforest, monsoon, and savanna types can be found, with rains and high temperatures throughout the year.\nEcology.\nNotable North American fauna include the bison, black bear, jaguar, cougar, prairie dog, turkey, pronghorn, raccoon, coyote, and monarch butterfly. Notable plants that were domesticated in North America include tobacco, maize, squash, tomato, sunflower, blueberry, avocado, cotton, chile pepper, and vanilla.\nGeology.\nGeologic history.\nLaurentia is an ancient craton which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon. The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea, with Eurasia to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains, which formed some 480 mya, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 mya, North America became part of Laurasia, before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period. The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny, between 80 and 55 mya. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 mya, and the Great Lakes (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.\nNorth America is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods. The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country. According to paleontologist Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history. Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent. The most significant Late Jurassic dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison Formation of the western U.S.\nCanada.\nCanada is geologically one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of Precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era. Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield, there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less-known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater. The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\nUnited States.\nThe United States can be divided into twelve main geological provinces:\nEach province has its own geologic history and unique features. The geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot.\nCentral America.\nCentral America is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake, killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.\nVolcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968, the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas.\nCentral America has many mountain ranges; the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia, and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.\nEconomy.\nNorth America's GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be $41,830, making it the richest continent in the world, followed by Oceania.\nCanada, Mexico, and the U.S. have significant and multifaceted economic systems. The U.S. has the largest economy in the world. In 2016, the U.S. had an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $57,466 according to the World Bank, and is the most technologically developed economy of the three. The U.S.'s services sector comprises 77% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22% and agriculture comprises 1.2%. The U.S. economy is also the fastest-growing economy in North America and the Americas as a whole, with the highest GDP per capita in the Americas as well.\nCanada shows significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing. Canada's per capita GDP (PPP) was estimated at $44,656 and it had the 11th-largest GDP (nominal) in 2014. Canada's services sector comprises 78% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%. Mexico has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $16,111 and as of 2014 is the 15th-largest GDP (nominal) in the world. Being a newly industrialized country, Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations. Its main sources of income are oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.\nThe North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas. These areas are those under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), and the Central American Common Market (CACM). Of these trade blocs, the U.S. takes part in two. In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement among numerous other free-trade relations, often between the larger, more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries.\nNAFTA formed one of the four largest trade blocs in the world. Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. While Canada and the U.S. already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship\u2014and to present day still do\u2014in the world and Canada\u2013U.S. trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs, NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty-free trade. The free-trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on U.S.\u2013Mexico trade. Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion. The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617\u00a0trillion. This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U.S. is the world's largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010. The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other's largest trade partners. The U.S. is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico, while Canada and Mexico are each other's third-largest trade partners. In 2018, the NAFTA was replaced by the U.S.\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA).\nThe Caribbean trade bloc (CARICOM) came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free-trade agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations free-trade agreements have been signed into effect.\nIntegration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. The 2006 implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) left the future of the CACM unclear. The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the U.S., Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs.\nThese nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the G3 Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The U.S. has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free Trade Area between itself and the European Union; the U.S.\u2013Middle East Free Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.\nTransport.\nThe Pan-American Highway route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the U.S. and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U.S. border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly .\nThe first transcontinental railroad in the U.S. was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the Pacific coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system. Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U.S. railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway had, by 1867, already accumulated more than of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.\nCommunications.\nA shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories: the U.S. and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations.\nDemographics.\nCanada and the United States are the wealthiest and most developed nations on the continent followed by Mexico, a newly industrialized country. The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development. For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher GDP (PPP) per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations. Additionally, despite Greenland's vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.\nDemographically, North America is ethnically diverse. Its three largest groups are Whites, Mestizos, and Blacks. There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups.\nLanguages.\nThe dominant languages in North America are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic, and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the U.S., but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the Commonwealth Caribbean. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the U.S.) where the Romance languages, derived from Latin, of Spanish and Portuguese, (but French-speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana [France], and the Falkland Islands [UK]).\nThe U.S. has an ethnically diverse population, and 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members. The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the province of New Brunswick. Other French-speaking locales include the province of Ontario (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the province of Manitoba (co-official as \"de jure\" with English), the French West Indies and Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, as well as the U.S. state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English.\nIndigenous languages.\nA significant number of indigenous languages are spoken in North America, with roughly 6 million in Mexico speaking an indigenous language at home, 372,000 people in the U.S., and about 225,000 in Canada. In the U.S. and Canada, there are approximately 150 surviving indigenous languages of the 300 spoken prior to European contact.\nReligions.\nChristianity is the largest religion in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of the population considered themselves Christians. Christianity also is the predominant religion in the 23 dependent territories in North America. The U.S. has the largest Christian population in the world, with nearly 247\u00a0million Christians (70%), although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations. Mexico has the world's second-largest number of Catholics, surpassed only by Brazil.\nAccording to the same study, the religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 17% of the population of Canada and the U.S. Those with no religious affiliation make up about 24% of Canada's total population.\nCanada, the U.S., and Mexico host communities of Jews (6\u00a0million or about 1.8%), Buddhists (3.8\u00a0million or 1.1%) and Muslims (3.4\u00a0million or 1.0%). The largest number of Jews can be found in the U.S. (5.4\u00a0million), Canada (375,000) and Mexico (67,476). The U.S. hosts the largest Muslim population in North America with 2.7\u00a0million or 0.9%, while Canada hosts about one million Muslims or 3.2% of the population. In Mexico there were 3,700 Muslims in 2010. In 2012, \"U-T San Diego\" estimated U.S. practitioners of Buddhism at 1.2\u00a0million people, of whom 40% are living in Southern California.\nThe predominant religion in Mexico and Central America is Christianity (96%). Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was the only religion permitted by Spanish crown and Catholic church. A vast campaign of religious conversion, the so-called \"spiritual conquest\", was launched to bring the indigenous peoples into the Christian fold. The Inquisition was established to assure orthodox belief and practice. The Catholic Church remained an important institution, so that even after political independence, Roman Catholicism remained the dominant religion. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion. Christianity is also the predominant religion in the Caribbean (85%). Other religious groups in the region are Hinduism, Islam, Rastafari (in Jamaica), and Afro-American religions such as Santer\u00eda and Vodou.\nPopulation.\nNorth America is the fourth most populous continent after Asia, Africa, and Europe. Its most populous country is the U.S. with 329.7\u00a0million persons. The second-largest country is Mexico with a population of 112.3\u00a0million. Canada is the third-most-populous country with 37.0\u00a0million. The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico (a territory of the U.S.), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million. Greenland has a small population of 55,984 for its massive size (2.166\u00a0million\u00a0km2 or 836,300\u00a0mi2), and therefore, it has the world's lowest population density at 0.026 pop./km2 (0.067 pop./mi2).\nWhile the U.S., Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto, Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the U.S. border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is Tijuana, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages.\nEight of the top ten metropolitan areas are located in the U.S. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the New York City metropolitan area, Los Angeles metropolitan area, Chicago metropolitan area, and the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex. While the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the U.S., Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America: Greater Mexico City. Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million people. The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada\u2013United States border and the Mexico\u2013U.S. border has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas. These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most productive in Detroit\u2013Windsor and San Diego\u2013Tijuana and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13\u00a0billion was dependent on the Detroit\u2013Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego\u2013Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20\u00a0billion.\nNorth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. The United States includes eleven megaregions.\nCulture.\nThe cultures of North America are diverse. The United States and English Canada have many cultural similarities, while French Canada has a distinct culture from Anglophone Canada, which is protected by law. Since the United States was formed from portions previously part of the Spanish Empire and then independent Mexico, and there has been considerable and continuing immigration of Spanish speakers from south of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. In the southwest of the U.S. there are many Hispanic cultural traditions and considerable bilingualism. Mexico and Central America are part of Latin America and are culturally distinct from anglophone and francophone North America. However, they share with the United States the establishment of post-independence governments that are federated representative republics with written constitutions dating from their founding as nations. Canada is a federated parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy.\nCanada's constitution dates to 1867, with confederation, in the British North America Act, but not until 1982 did Canada have the power to amend its own constitution. Canada's Francophone heritage has been enshrined in law since the British parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774. In contrast to largely Protestant Anglo settlers in North America, French-speaking Canadians were Catholic and with the Quebec Act were guaranteed freedom to practice their religion, restored the right of the Catholic Church to impose tithes for its support, and established French civil law in most circumstances.\nThe distinctiveness of French language and culture has been codified in Canadian law, so that both English and French are designated official languages. The U.S. has no official language, but its national language is English.\nThe Canadian government took action to protect Canadian culture by limiting non-Canadian content in broadcasting, creating the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission to monitor Canadian content. In Quebec, the provincial government established the Quebec Office of the French Language, often called the \"language police\" by Anglophones, which mandates the use of French terminology and signage in French. Since 1968 the unicameral legislature has been called the Quebec National Assembly. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, 24 June, is the national holiday of Quebec and celebrated by francophone Canadians throughout Canada. In Quebec, the school system was divided into Catholic and Protestant, so-called confessional schools. Anglophone education in Quebec has been increasingly undermined.\nLatino culture is strong in the southwestern United States, as well as in the New York metropolitan area and Florida, which draw Latin Americans from many countries in the Western hemisphere. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and Mexicali, is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the U.S. Monterrey, a modern city with a significant industrial group, has been regarded as the most Americanized city in Mexico.\nThe Anglophone Caribbean states have witnessed and participated in the decline of the British Empire and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America in the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those remaining at home.\nGreenland has experienced many immigration waves from Northern Canada, e.g. by the Thule people. Therefore, Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous peoples of Canada. Greenland is also considered Nordic and has strong Danish ties due to centuries of colonization by Denmark.\nSport.\nThe United States and Canada have major sports teams that compete against each other, including baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer/football. Canada, Mexico, and the United States will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Native American game of lacrosse is considered a national sport in Canada. Curling is an important winter sport in Canada, and the Winter Olympics includes it in the roster. The English sport of cricket is popular in parts of anglophone Canada and very popular in parts of the former British empire, but in Canada is considered a minor sport. Boxing is also a major sport in some countries, such as Mexico, Panama and Puerto Rico, and it is considered one of the main individual sports in the United States. Canada has a separate Canadian Football League from the U.S. teams.\nThe following table shows the most prominent sports leagues in North America, in order of average revenue.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt; "}
{"id": "21140", "revid": "10274643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21140", "title": "Noble gas", "text": "Group of low-reactive, gaseous chemical elements\nThe noble gases (historically the inert gases, sometimes referred to as aerogens) are the members of group 18 of the periodic table: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), radon (Rn) and, in some cases, oganesson (Og). Under standard conditions, the first six of these elements are odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity and cryogenic boiling points. The properties of oganesson are uncertain.\nThe intermolecular force between noble gas atoms is the very weak London dispersion force, so their boiling points are all cryogenic, below .\nThe noble gases' inertness, or tendency not to react with other chemical substances, results from their electron configuration: their outer shell of valence electrons is \"full\", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions. Only a few hundred noble gas compounds are known to exist. The inertness of noble gases makes them useful whenever chemical reactions are unwanted. For example, argon is used as a shielding gas in welding and as a filler gas in incandescent light bulbs. Helium is used to provide buoyancy in blimps and balloons. Helium and neon are also used as refrigerants due to their low boiling points. Industrial quantities of the noble gases, except for radon, are obtained by separating them from air using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is also a byproduct of the mining of natural gas. Radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds.\nThe seventh member of group 18 is oganesson, an unstable synthetic element whose chemistry is still uncertain because only five very short-lived atoms (t1/2 = 0.69 ms) have ever been synthesized (as of 2020[ [update]]). IUPAC uses the term \"noble gas\" interchangeably with \"group 18\" and thus includes oganesson; however, due to relativistic effects, oganesson is predicted to be a solid under standard conditions and reactive enough not to qualify functionally as \"noble\".\nHistory.\n\"Noble gas\" is translated from the German noun , first used in 1900 by Hugo Erdmann to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity. The name makes an analogy to the term \"noble metals\", which also have low reactivity. The noble gases have also been referred to as \"inert gases\", but this label is deprecated as many noble gas compounds are now known. \"Rare gases\" is another term that was used, but this is also inaccurate because argon forms a fairly considerable part (0.94% by volume, 1.3% by mass) of the Earth's atmosphere due to decay of radioactive potassium-40.\nPierre Janssen and Joseph Norman Lockyer had discovered a new element on 18 August 1868 while looking at the chromosphere of the Sun, and named it helium after the Greek word for the Sun, (). No chemical analysis was possible at the time, but helium was later found to be a noble gas. Before them, in 1784, the English chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish had discovered that air contains a small proportion of a substance less reactive than nitrogen. A century later, in 1895, Lord Rayleigh discovered that samples of nitrogen from the air were of a different density than nitrogen resulting from chemical reactions. Along with Scottish scientist William Ramsay at University College, London, Lord Rayleigh theorized that the nitrogen extracted from air was mixed with another gas, leading to an experiment that successfully isolated a new element, argon, from the Greek word (, \"idle\" or \"lazy\"). With this discovery, they realized an entire class of gases was missing from the periodic table. During his search for argon, Ramsay also managed to isolate helium for the first time while heating cleveite, a mineral. In 1902, having accepted the evidence for the elements helium and argon, Dmitri Mendeleev included these noble gases as group\u00a00 in his arrangement of the elements, which would later become the periodic table.\nRamsay continued his search for these gases using the method of fractional distillation to separate liquid air into several components. In 1898, he discovered the elements krypton, neon, and xenon, and named them after the Greek words (, \"hidden\"), (, \"new\"), and (, \"stranger\"), respectively. Radon was first identified in 1898 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, and was named \"radium emanation\", but was not considered a noble gas until 1904 when its characteristics were found to be similar to those of other noble gases. Rayleigh and Ramsay received the 1904 Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry, respectively, for their discovery of the noble gases; in the words of J. E. Cederblom, then president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, \"the discovery of an entirely new group of elements, of which no single representative had been known with any certainty, is something utterly unique in the history of chemistry, being intrinsically an advance in science of peculiar significance\".\nThe discovery of the noble gases aided in the development of a general understanding of atomic structure. In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the \"octet rule\", which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.\nIn 1962, Neil Bartlett discovered the first chemical compound of a noble gas, xenon hexafluoroplatinate. Compounds of other noble gases were discovered soon after: in 1962 for radon, radon difluoride (RnF2), which was identified by radiotracer techniques and in 1963 for krypton, krypton difluoride (KrF2). The first stable compound of argon was reported in 2000 when argon fluorohydride (HArF) was formed at a temperature of .\nIn October 2006, scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory successfully created synthetically oganesson, the seventh element in group\u00a018, by bombarding californium with calcium.\nPhysical and atomic properties.\nThe noble gases have weak interatomic force, and consequently have very low melting and boiling points. They are all monatomic gases under standard conditions, including the elements with larger atomic masses than many normally solid elements. Helium has several unique qualities when compared with other elements: its boiling point at 1\u00a0atm is lower than those of any other known substance; it is the only element known to exhibit superfluidity; and, it is the only element that cannot be solidified by cooling at atmospheric pressure (an effect explained by quantum mechanics as its zero point energy is too high to permit freezing) \u2013 a pressure of must be applied at a temperature of to convert it to a solid while a pressure of about is required at room temperature. The noble gases up to xenon have multiple stable isotopes; krypton and xenon also have naturally occurring radioisotopes, namely 78Kr, 124Xe, and 136Xe, all have very long lives (&gt; 1021 years) and can undergo double electron capture or double beta decay. Radon has no stable isotopes; its longest-lived isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of 3.8\u00a0days and decays to form helium and polonium, which ultimately decays to lead. Oganesson also has no stable isotopes, and its only known isotope 294Og is very short-lived (half-life 0.7\u00a0ms). Melting and boiling points increase going down the group.\nThe noble gas atoms, like atoms in most groups, increase steadily in atomic radius from one period to the next due to the increasing number of electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential similar to that of the oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.\nThe macroscopic physical properties of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases with the size of the atom as a result of the increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group\u00a018, the atomic radius increases, and with it the interatomic forces increase, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.\nThe noble gases are nearly ideal gases under standard conditions, but their deviations from the ideal gas law provided important clues for the study of intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.\nChemical properties.\nThe noble gases are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonflammable under standard conditions. They were once labeled \"group\u00a00\" in the periodic table because it was believed they had a valence of zero, meaning their atoms cannot combine with those of other elements to form compounds. However, it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds, causing this label to fall into disuse.\nElectron configuration.\nLike other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior:\nThe noble gases have full valence electron shells. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium, making it easier to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.\nAs a result of a full shell, the noble gases can be used in conjunction with the electron configuration notation to form the \"noble gas notation\". To do this, the nearest noble gas that precedes the element in question is written first, and then the electron configuration is continued from that point forward. For example, the electron notation of\nphosphorus is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3, while the noble gas notation is [Ne] 3s2 3p3. This more compact notation makes it easier to identify elements, and is shorter than writing out the full notation of atomic orbitals.\nThe noble gases cross the boundary between blocks\u2014helium is an s-element whereas the rest of members are p-elements\u2014which is unusual among the IUPAC groups. All other IUPAC groups contain elements from \"one\" block each. This causes some inconsistencies in trends across the table, and on those grounds some chemists have proposed that helium should be moved to group 2 to be with other s2 elements, but this change has not generally been adopted.\nCompounds.\nThe noble gases show extremely low chemical reactivity; consequently, only a few hundred noble gas compounds have been formed. Neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not been formed (although some helium-containing ions exist and there is some theoretical evidence for a few neutral helium-containing ones), while xenon, krypton, and argon have shown only minor reactivity. \nIn 1933, Linus Pauling predicted that the heavier noble gases could form compounds with fluorine and oxygen. He predicted the existence of krypton hexafluoride (KrF6) and xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) and speculated that xenon octafluoride (XeF8) might exist as an unstable compound, and suggested that xenic acid could form perxenate salts. These predictions were shown to be generally accurate, except that XeF8 is now thought to be both thermodynamically and kinetically unstable.\nXenon compounds are the most numerous of the noble gas compounds that have been formed. Most of them have the xenon atom in the oxidation state of +2, +4, +6, or +8 bonded to highly electronegative atoms such as fluorine or oxygen, as in xenon difluoride (XeF2), xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), xenon hexafluoride (XeF6), xenon tetroxide (XeO4), and sodium perxenate (Na4XeO6). Xenon reacts with fluorine to form numerous xenon fluorides according to the following equations:\nXe + F2 \u2192 XeF2\nXe + 2F2 \u2192 XeF4\nXe + 3F2 \u2192 XeF6\nSome of these compounds have found use in chemical synthesis as oxidizing agents; XeF2, in particular, is commercially available and can be used as a fluorinating agent. As of 2007, about five hundred compounds of xenon bonded to other elements have been identified, including organoxenon compounds (containing xenon bonded to carbon), and xenon bonded to nitrogen, chlorine, gold, mercury, and xenon itself. Compounds of xenon bound to boron, hydrogen, bromine, iodine, beryllium, sulfur, titanium, copper, and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets.\nRadon is more reactive than xenon, and forms chemical bonds more easily than xenon does. However, due to the high radioactivity and short half-life of radon isotopes, only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice. Radon goes further towards metallic behavior than xenon; the difluoride RnF2 is highly ionic, and cationic Rn2+ is formed in halogen fluoride solutions. For this reason, kinetic hindrance makes it difficult to oxidize radon beyond the +2 state. Only tracer experiments appear to have succeeded in doing so, probably forming RnF4, RnF6, and RnO3.\nKrypton is less reactive than xenon, but several compounds have been reported with krypton in the oxidation state of +2. Krypton difluoride is the most notable and easily characterized. Under extreme conditions, krypton reacts with fluorine to form KrF2 according to the following equation:\nKr + F2 \u2192 KrF2\nCompounds in which krypton forms a single bond to nitrogen and oxygen have also been characterized, but are only stable below and respectively.\nKrypton atoms chemically bound to other nonmetals (hydrogen, chlorine, carbon) as well as some late transition metals (copper, silver, gold) have also been observed, but only either at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets. Similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of argon in 2000, such as argon fluorohydride (HArF), and some bound to the late transition metals copper, silver, and gold. As of 2007, no stable neutral molecules involving covalently bound helium or neon are known.\nExtrapolation from periodic trends predict that oganesson should be the most reactive of the noble gases; more sophisticated theoretical treatments indicate greater reactivity than such extrapolations suggest, to the point where the applicability of the descriptor \"noble gas\" has been questioned. Oganesson is expected to be rather like silicon or tin in group 14: a reactive element with a common +4 and a less common +2 state, which at room temperature and pressure is not a gas but rather a solid semiconductor. Empirical / experimental testing will be required to validate these predictions. (On the other hand, flerovium, despite being in group 14, is predicted to be unusually volatile, which suggests noble gas-like properties.)\nThe noble gases\u2014including helium\u2014can form stable molecular ions in the gas phase. The simplest is the helium hydride molecular ion, HeH+, discovered in 1925. Because it is composed of the two most abundant elements in the universe, hydrogen and helium, it was believed to occur naturally in the interstellar medium, and it was finally detected in April 2019 using the airborne SOFIA telescope. In addition to these ions, there are many known neutral excimers of the noble gases. These are compounds such as ArF and KrF that are stable only when in an excited electronic state; some of them find application in excimer lasers.\nIn addition to the compounds where a noble gas atom is involved in a covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.\nNoble gases can form endohedral fullerene compounds, in which the noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. In 1993, it was discovered that when C60, a spherical molecule consisting of 60\u00a0carbon\u00a0atoms, is exposed to noble gases at high pressure, complexes such as He@C60 can be formed (the \"@\" notation indicates He is contained inside C60 but not covalently bound to it). As of 2008, endohedral complexes with helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon have been created. These compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of the noble gas atom.\nNoble gas compounds such as xenon difluoride (XeF2) are considered to be hypervalent because they violate the octet rule. Bonding in such compounds can be explained using a three-center four-electron bond model. This model, first proposed in 1951, considers bonding of three collinear atoms. For example, bonding in XeF2 is described by a set of three molecular orbitals (MOs) derived from p-orbitals on each atom. Bonding results from the combination of a filled p-orbital from Xe with one half-filled p-orbital from each F atom, resulting in a filled bonding orbital, a filled non-bonding orbital, and an empty antibonding orbital. The highest occupied molecular orbital is localized on the two terminal atoms. This represents a localization of charge that is facilitated by the high electronegativity of fluorine.\nThe chemistry of the heavier noble gases, krypton and xenon, are well established. The chemistry of the lighter ones, argon and helium, is still at an early stage, while a neon compound is yet to be identified.\nOccurrence.\nThe abundances of the noble gases in the universe decrease as their atomic numbers increase. Helium is the most common element in the universe after hydrogen, with a mass fraction of about 24%. Most of the helium in the universe was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in stellar nucleosynthesis (and, to a very slight degree, the alpha decay of heavy elements). \nAbundances on Earth follow different trends; for example, helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere. The reason is that there is no primordial helium in the atmosphere; due to the small mass of the atom, helium cannot be retained by the Earth's gravitational field. Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust, and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits. The abundance of argon, on the other hand, is increased as a result of the beta decay of potassium-40, also found in the Earth's crust, to form argon-40, which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the Solar System. This process is the basis for the potassium-argon dating method. \nXenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere, in what has been called the \"missing xenon problem\"; one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth's crust. Radon is formed in the lithosphere by the alpha decay of radium. It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated. Due to its high radioactivity, radon presents a significant health hazard; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone. Oganesson does not occur in nature and is instead created manually by scientists.\nFor large-scale use, helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium.\nExtraction.\nNeon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air using the methods of liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.\nBiological chemistry.\nNone of the elements in this group has any biological importance.\nApplications.\nNoble gases have very low boiling and melting points, which makes them useful as cryogenic refrigerants. In particular, liquid helium, which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40\u00a0times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.\nHelium is used as a component of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or \"the bends\". The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.\nSince the \"Hindenburg\" disaster in 1937, helium has replaced hydrogen as a lifting gas in blimps and balloons: despite an 8.6% decrease in buoyancy compared to hydrogen, helium is not combustible.\nIn many applications, the noble gases are used to provide an inert atmosphere. Argon is used in the synthesis of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.\nNoble gases are commonly used in lighting because of their lack of chemical reactivity. Argon, mixed with nitrogen, is used as a filler gas for incandescent light bulbs. Krypton is used in high-performance light bulbs, which have higher color temperatures and greater efficiency, because it reduces the rate of evaporation of the filament more than argon; halogen lamps, in particular, use krypton mixed with small amounts of compounds of iodine or bromine. The noble gases glow in distinctive colors when used inside gas-discharge lamps, such as \"neon lights\". These lights are called after neon but often contain other gases and phosphors, which add various hues to the orange-red color of neon. Xenon is commonly used in xenon arc lamps, which, due to their nearly continuous spectrum that resembles daylight, find application in film projectors.\nThe noble gases are used in excimer lasers, which are based on short-lived electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light, which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248\u00a0nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.\nSome noble gases have direct application in medicine. Helium is sometimes used to improve the ease of breathing of people with asthma. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual nitrous oxide, and because it is readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.\nNoble gases, particularly xenon, are predominantly used in ion engines due to their inertness. Since ion engines are not driven by chemical reactions, chemically inert fuels are desired to prevent unwanted reaction between the fuel and anything else on the engine.\nOganesson is too unstable to work with and has no known application other than research.\nNoble gases in Earth sciences application.\nThe relative isotopic abundances of noble gases serve as an important geochemical tracing tool in earth science. They can unravel the Earth's degassing history and its effects to the surrounding environment (i.e., atmosphere composition). Due to their inert nature and low abundances, change in the noble gas concentration and their isotopic ratios can be used to resolve and quantify the processes influencing their current signatures across geological settings.\u00a0 \u00a0\nHelium.\nHelium has two abundant isotopes: helium-3, which is primordial with high abundance in earth's core and mantle, and helium-4, which originates from decay of radionuclides (232Th, 235,238U) abundant in the earth's crust. Isotopic ratios of helium are represented by RA value, a value relative to air measurement (3He/4He = 1.39*10\u22126). Volatiles that originate from the earth's crust have a 0.02-0.05 RA, which indicate an enrichment of helium-4. Volatiles that originate from deeper sources such as subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), have a 6.1\u00b1 0.9 RA and mid-oceanic ridge basalts (MORB) display higher values (8 \u00b1 1 RA). Mantle plume samples have even higher values than &gt; 8 RA. Solar wind, which represent an unmodified primordial signature is reported to have ~ 330 RA.\u00a0 \u00a0\nNeon.\nNeon has three main stable isotopes:20Ne, 21Ne and 22Ne, with 20Ne produced by cosmic nucleogenic reactions, causing high abundance in the atmosphere. 21Ne and 22Ne are produced in the earth's crust as a result of interactions between alpha and neutron particles with light elements; 18O, 19F and 24,25Mg. The neon ratios (20Ne/22Ne and 21Ne/22Ne) are systematically used to discern the heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle and volatile sources. Complimenting He isotope data, neon isotope data additionally provide insight to thermal evolution of Earth's systems.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nArgon.\nArgon has three stable isotopes: 36Ar, 38Ar and 40Ar. 36Ar and 38Ar are primordial, with their inventory on the earth's crust dependent on the equilibration of meteoric water with the crustal fluids. This explains huge inventory of 36Ar in the atmosphere. Production of these two isotopes (36Ar and 38Ar) is negligible within the earth's crust, only limited concentrations of 38Ar can be produced by interaction between alpha particles from decay of 235,238U and 232Th and light elements (37Cl and 41K). While 36Ar is continuously being produced by Beta-decay of 36Cl. 40Ar is a product of radiogenic decay of 40K. Different endmembers values for 40Ar/36Ar have been reported; Air = 295.5, MORB = 40,000, and crust = 3000.\u00a0 \u00a0\nKrypton.\nKrypton has several isotopes, with 78, 80, 82Kr being primordial, while 83,84, 86Kr results from spontaneous fission of 244Pu and radiogenic decay of 238U. Krypton's isotopes geochemical signature in mantle reservoirs resembling the modern atmosphere. preserves the solar-like primordial signature. Krypton isotopes have been used to decipher the mechanism of volatiles delivery to earth's system, which had great implication to evolution of earth (nitrogen, oxygen, and oxygen) and emergence of life. This is largely due to a clear distinction of krypton isotope signature from various sources such as chondritic material, solar wind and cometary. \u00a0\nXenon.\nXenon has nine isotopes, most of which are produced by the radiogenic decay. Krypton and xenon noble gases requires pristine, robust geochemical sampling protocol to avoid atmospheric contamination. Furthermore, sophisticated instrumentation is required to resolve mass peaks among many isotopes with narrow mass difference during analysis. \u00a0\u00a0\nSampling of noble gases.\nNoble gas measurements can be obtained from sources like volcanic vents, springs, and geothermal wells following specific sampling protocols. The classic specific sampling protocol include the following.\nAnalysis of noble gases.\nNoble gases have numerous isotopes and subtle mass variation that requires high-precision detection systems. Originally, scientists used magnetic sector mass spectrometry, which is time-consuming and has low sensitivity due to \"peak jumping mode\". Multiple-collector mass spectrometers, like Quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS), enable simultaneous detection of isotopes, improving sensitivity and throughput. Before analysis, sample preparation is essential due to the low abundance of noble gases, involving extraction, purification system. Extraction allows liberation of noble gases from their carrier (major phase; fluid or solid) while purification remove impurities and improve concentration per unit sample volume. Cryogenic traps are used for sequential analysis without peak interference by stepwise temperature raise.\nResearch labs have successfully developed miniaturized field-based mass spectrometers, such as the portable mass spectrometer (https://), which can analyze noble gases with an analytical uncertainty of 1-3% using low-cost vacuum systems and quadrupole mass analyzers. \nDischarge color.\nThe color of gas discharge emission depends on several factors, including the following:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21143", "revid": "50798611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21143", "title": "Natural monopoly", "text": "Concept in economics\nA natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructure costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors. Specifically, an industry is a natural monopoly if a single firm can supply the entire market at a lower long-run average cost than if multiple firms were to operate within it. In that case, it is very probable that a company (monopoly) or a minimal number of companies (oligopoly) will form, providing all or most of the relevant products and/or services. This frequently occurs in industries where capital costs predominate, creating large economies of scale in relation to the size of the market; examples include public utilities such as water services, electricity, telecommunications, mail, etc. Natural monopolies were recognized as potential sources of market failure as early as the 19th century; John Stuart Mill advocated government regulation to make them serve the public good.\nDefinition.\nTwo different types of cost are important in microeconomics: marginal cost and fixed cost. The marginal cost is the cost to the company of serving one more customer. In an industry where a natural monopoly does not exist, the vast majority of industries, the marginal cost decreases with economies of scale, then increases as the company has growing pains (overworking its employees, bureaucracy, inefficiencies, etc.). Along with this, the average cost of its products decreases and increases. A natural monopoly has a very different cost structure. A natural monopoly has a high fixed cost for a product that does not depend on output, but its marginal cost of producing one more good is roughly constant, and small.\nIt is generally believed that there are two reasons for natural monopolies: one is economies of scale, and the other is economies of scope.\nAll industries have costs associated with entering them. Often, a large portion of these costs is required for investment. Larger industries, like utilities, require an enormous initial investment. This barrier to entry reduces the number of possible entrants into the industry regardless of the earning of the corporations within. The production cost of an enterprise is not fixed, except for the effect of technology and other factors; even under the same conditions, the unit production cost of an enterprise can also tend to decrease with the increase in the total production output. The reason is that the actual product of the enterprise as it continues to expand, the original fixed costs are gradually diluted. This is particularly evident in companies with significant fixed-cost investments. Natural monopolies arise where the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, has an overwhelming cost advantage over other actual or potential competitors; this tends to be the case in industries where fixed costs predominate, creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market, as is the case in water and electricity services. The fixed cost of constructing a competing transmission network is so high, and the marginal cost of transmission for the incumbent so low, that it effectively bars potential competitors from the monopolist's market, acting as a nearly insurmountable barrier to entry into the market place.\nA firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment. This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels.\nIn real life, companies produce or provide single goods and services but often diversify their operations. Suppose the cost of having multiple products by one enterprise is lower than making them separately by several enterprises. In that case, it indicates that there is an economy of scope. Since the unit product price of a company that produces a specific product alone is higher than the corresponding unit product price of a joint production company, the companies that make it separately will lose money. These companies will either withdraw from the production field or be merged, forming a monopoly. Therefore, well-known American economists Samuelson and Nordhaus pointed out that economies of scope can also produce natural monopolies.\nCompanies that take advantage of economies of scale often run into problems of bureaucracy; these factors interact to produce an \"ideal\" size for a company, at which the company's average cost of production is minimized. If that ideal size is large enough to supply the whole market, then that market is a natural monopoly.\nOnce a natural monopoly has been established because of the large initial cost and that, according to the rule of economies of scale, the larger corporation (to a point) has a lower average cost and therefore an advantage over its competitors. With this knowledge, no firms will attempt to enter the industry and an oligopoly or monopoly develops.\nFormal definition.\nWilliam Baumol (1977) provides the current formal definition of a natural monopoly. He defines a natural monopoly as \"[a]n industry in which multi-firm production is more costly than production by a monopoly\" (p.\u00a0810). Baumol linked the definition to the mathematical concept of subadditivity; specifically, subadditivity of the cost function. Baumol also noted that for a firm producing a single product, scale economies were a sufficient condition but not a necessary condition to prove subadditivity, the argument can be illustrated as follows:\nProposition: Strict economies of scale are sufficient but not necessary for ray average cost to be strictly declining.\nProposition: Strictly declining ray average cost implies strict ray subadditivity.\nProposition: Neither ray concavity nor ray average costs that decline everywhere are necessary for strict subadditivity.\nCombining all propositions gives:\nProposition: Global scale economies are sufficient but not necessary for (strict) ray subadditivity, the condition for natural monopoly in the production of a single product or in any bundle of outputs produced in fixed proportions.\nMultiproduct case.\nOn the other hand, if firms produce many products scale economies are neither sufficient nor necessary for subadditivity:\nProposition: Strict concavity of a cost function is not sufficient to guarantee subadditivity.\nTherefore:\nProposition: Scale economies are neither necessary nor sufficient for subadditivity.\nMathematical notation of subadditivity.\nA cost function \"c\" is \"subadditive\" at an output \"x\" if formula_1 whenever formula_2. In other words, if all companies have the same production cost function, the one with the better technology should monopolize the entire market such that the total cost is minimized, thus causing natural monopoly due to its technological advantage or condition.\nHistory.\nThe development of the concept of natural monopoly is often attributed to John Stuart Mill, who (writing before the marginalist revolution) believed that prices would reflect the costs of production in absence of an artificial or natural monopoly. In \"Principles of Political Economy\" Mill criticised Smith's neglect of an area that could explain wage disparity (the term itself was already in use in Smith's times, but with a slightly different meaning). Taking up the examples of professionals such as jewellers, physicians and lawyers, he said,\nThe superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition, but of its absence: not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment, but an extra advantage; a kind of monopoly price, the effect not of a legal, but of what has been termed a natural monopoly... independently of... artificial monopolies [i.e. grants by government], there is a natural monopoly in favour of skilled labourers against the unskilled, which makes the difference of reward exceed, sometimes in a manifold proportion, what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages. \nMill's initial use of the term concerned natural abilities. In contrast, common contemporary usage refers solely to market failure in a particular type of industry such as rail, post or electricity. Mill's development of the idea that 'what is true of labour, is true of capital'. He continues;\nAll the natural monopolies (meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances, and not by law) which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labour, operate similarly between different employments of capital. If a business can only be advantageously carried on by a large capital, this in most countries limits so narrowly the class of persons who can enter into the employment, that they are enabled to keep their rate of profit above the general level. A trade may also, from the nature of the case, be confined to so few hands, that profits may admit of being kept up by a combination among the dealers. It is well known that even among so numerous a body as the London booksellers, this sort of combination long continued to exist. I have already mentioned the case of the gas and water companies.\nMill also applied the term to land, which can manifest a natural monopoly by virtue of it being the only land with a particular mineral, etc. Furthermore, Mill referred to network industries, such as electricity and water supply, roads, rail and canals, as \"practical monopolies\", where \"it is the part of the government, either to subject the business to reasonable conditions for the general advantage or to retain such power over it, that the profits of the monopoly may at least be obtained for the public.\" So, a legal prohibition against non-government competitors is often advocated. Whereby the rates are not left to the market but are regulated by the government; maximising profits, and subsequently societal reinvestment.\nFor a discussion of the historical origins of the term 'natural monopoly' see Mosca.\nRegulation.\nAs with all monopolies, a monopolist that has gained its position through natural monopoly effects may engage in behaviour that abuses its market position. In cases where exploitation occurs, it often leads to calls from consumers for government regulation. Government regulation may also come about at the request of a business hoping to enter a market otherwise dominated by a natural monopoly.\nCommon arguments in favour of regulation include the desire to limit a company's potentially abusive or unfair market power, facilitate competition, promote investment or system expansion, or stabilise markets. This is especially true in the case of essential utilities like electricity where a monopoly creates a captive market for a product few can refuse. In general, though, regulation occurs when the government believes that the operator, left to his own devices, would behave in a way that is contrary to the public interest. In some countries an early solution to this perceived problem was government provision of, for example, a utility service. Enabling a monopolistic company with the ability to change prices without regulation can have devastating effects in society. For example, in Bolivia's 2000 Cochabamba protests, a firm with a monopoly on the supply of water excessively increased water rates to fund a dam, leaving many unable to afford the essential good.\nHistory.\nA wave of nationalisation across Europe after World War II created state-owned companies in each of these areas, many of which operate internationally bidding on utility contracts in other countries. However, this approach can raise its own problems. In the past, some governments have used the state-provided utility services as a source of cash flow for funding other government activities, or as a means of obtaining hard currency. As a result, governments seeking funding began to seek other solutions, namely regulation and providing services on a commercial basis, often through private participation.\nIn recent years, bodies of information have observed the correlation between utility subsidies and welfare improvements. Today, across the world, public utilities are widely used to provide state-run water, electricity, gas, telecommunications, mass-transportation and postal services.\nAlternative regulation.\nAlternatives to a state-owned response to natural monopolies include both open source licensed technology and co-operatives management where a monopoly's users or workers own the monopoly. For instance, the web's open-source architecture has both stimulated massive growth and avoided a single company controlling the entire market. The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation is an American co-op that provides the majority of clearing and financial settlement across the securities industry ensuring they cannot abuse their market position to raise costs. In recent years a combined cooperative and open-source alternative to emergent web monopolies has been proposed, a platform cooperative, where, for instance, Uber could be a driver-owned cooperative developing and sharing open-source software.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a key law or mechanism of evolution which changes the heritable traits characteristic of a population or species over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term \"natural selection\", contrasting it with artificial selection, which is intentional, whereas natural selection is not. \nFor Darwin natural selection was a law or principle which resulted from three different kinds of process: \"inheritance\", including the \"transmission\" of heritable material from parent to offspring and its \"development\" (ontogeny) in the offspring; \"variation\", which partly resulted from an organism's own agency (see phenotype; Baldwin effect); and the struggle for existence, which included both competition between organisms and cooperation or 'mutual aid' (particularly in 'social' plants and social animals).\nVariation of traits, both genotypic and phenotypic, exists within all populations of organisms. However, some traits are more likely to facilitate survival and reproductive success. Thus, these traits are more likely to be passed on to the next generation. These traits can also become more common within a population if the environment that favours these traits remains fixed. If new traits become more favoured due to changes in a specific niche, microevolution occurs. If new traits become more favoured due to changes in the broader environment, macroevolution occurs. Sometimes, new species can arise especially if these new traits are radically different from the traits possessed by their predecessors.\nThe likelihood of these traits being 'selected' and passed down are determined by many factors. Some are likely to be passed down because they adapt well to their environments. Others are passed down because these traits are actively preferred by mating partners, which is known as sexual selection. Female bodies also prefer traits that confer the lowest cost to their reproductive health, which is known as fecundity selection.\nNatural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\". He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. \nNew evidence has prompted 21st century evolutionary biologists to challenge the 20th century's gene-centred view of evolution, producing several extended evolutionary syntheses which bring organisms back to the heart of the theory of natural selection. Convergently, the growth of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which compares the developmental processes of different organisms to infer how developmental processes evolved. While it is now recognised that genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.\nHistorical development.\nPre-Darwinian theories.\nSeveral philosophers of the classical era, including Empedocles and his intellectual successor, the Roman poet Lucretius, expressed the idea that nature produces a huge variety of creatures, randomly, and that only those creatures that manage to provide for themselves and reproduce successfully persist. Empedocles' idea that organisms arose entirely by the incidental workings of causes such as heat and cold was criticised by Aristotle in Book II of \"Physics\". He posited natural teleology in its place, and believed that form was achieved for a purpose, citing the regularity of heredity in species as proof. Nevertheless, he accepted in his biology that new types of animals, monstrosities (\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2), can occur in very rare instances (\"Generation of Animals\", Book IV). As quoted in Darwin's 1872 edition of \"The Origin of Species\", Aristotle considered whether different forms (e.g., of teeth) might have appeared accidentally, but only the useful forms survived:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So what hinders the different parts [of the body] from having this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example, grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident. And in like manner as to the other parts in which there appears to exist an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity, and whatsoever things were not thus constituted, perished, and still perish.\u2014\u200a\nBut Aristotle rejected this possibility in the next paragraph, making clear that he is talking about the development of animals as embryos with the phrase \"either invariably or normally come about\", not the origin of species:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0Yet it is impossible that this should be the true view. For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or normally come about in a given way; but of not one of the results of chance or spontaneity is this true. We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincidence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in the dog-days, but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for an end, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for an end; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature.\u2014\u200a\nThe struggle for existence was later described by the Islamic writer Al-Jahiz in the 9th century, particularly in the context of top-down population regulation, but not in reference to individual variation or natural selection.\nAt the turn of the 16th century Leonardo da Vinci collected a set of fossils of ammonites as well as other biological material. He extensively reasoned in his writings that the shapes of animals are not given once and forever by the \"upper power\" but instead are generated in different forms naturally and then selected for reproduction by their compatibility with the environment.\nThe more recent classical arguments were reintroduced in the 18th century by Pierre Louis Maupertuis and others, including Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin.\nUntil the early 19th century, the prevailing view in Western societies was that differences between individuals of a species were uninteresting departures from their Platonic ideals (or typus) of created kinds. However, the theory of uniformitarianism in geology promoted the idea that simple, weak forces could act continuously over long periods of time to produce radical changes in the Earth's landscape. The success of this theory raised awareness of the vast scale of geological time and made plausible the idea that tiny, virtually imperceptible changes in successive generations could produce consequences on the scale of differences between species.\nThe early 19th-century zoologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck suggested the inheritance of acquired characteristics as a mechanism for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing transmutation of species. This theory, Lamarckism, was an influence on the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko's ill-fated antagonism to mainstream genetic theory as late as the mid-20th century.\nBetween 1835 and 1837, the zoologist Edward Blyth worked on the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of \"On the Origin of Species\".\nDarwin's theory.\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for adaptation and speciation. He defined natural selection as the \"principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is preserved\". The concept was simple but powerful: individuals best adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce. As long as there is some variation between them and that variation is heritable, there will be an inevitable selection of individuals with the most advantageous variations. If the variations are heritable, then differential reproductive success leads to the evolution of particular populations of a species, and populations that evolve to be sufficiently different eventually become different species.\nDarwin's ideas were inspired by the observations that he had made on the second voyage of HMS \"Beagle\" (1831\u20131836), and by the work of a political economist, Thomas Robert Malthus, who, in \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" (1798), noted that population (if unchecked) increases exponentially, whereas the food supply grows only arithmetically; thus, inevitable limitations of resources would have demographic implications, leading to a \"struggle for existence\". When Darwin read Malthus in 1838 he was already primed by his work as a naturalist to appreciate the \"struggle for existence\" in nature. It struck him that as population outgrew resources, \"favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species.\" Darwin wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life, organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation, and I think this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species, at some age, season, or year, a severe struggle for life, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection.\u2014\u200a\nOnce he had this hypothesis, Darwin was meticulous about gathering and refining evidence of consilience to meet standards of methodology before making his scientific theory public. He was in the process of writing his \"big book\" to present his research when the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace independently conceived of the principle and described it in an essay he sent to Darwin to forward to Charles Lyell. Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker decided to present his essay together with unpublished writings that Darwin had sent to fellow naturalists, and \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\" was read to the Linnean Society of London announcing co-discovery of the principle in July 1858. Darwin published a detailed account of his evidence and conclusions in \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. In later editions Darwin acknowledged that earlier writers\u2014like William Charles Wells in 1813, and Patrick Matthew in 1831\u2014had proposed similar basic ideas. However, they had not developed their ideas, or presented evidence to persuade others that the concept was useful.\nDarwin thought of natural selection by analogy to how farmers select crops or livestock for breeding, which he called \"artificial selection\"; in his early manuscripts he referred to a \"Nature\" which would do the selection. At the time, mechanisms of evolution such as evolution by genetic drift were not yet explicitly formulated, but, even in 1859, Darwin clearly stated that selection was only part of the story: \"I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification\". The final edition of \"The Origin of Species\" documented several other contributors to evolutionary modification: sexual selection; the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts (see Baldwin effect); \"the direct action of external conditions\" (a process which has been revived in some 21st century evolutionary biologies); and \"variations which seem to us in our ignorance to arise spontaneously\" (see mutation). In a letter to Charles Lyell in September 1860, Darwin regretted the use of the term \"Natural Selection\", preferring the term \"Natural Preservation\".\nFor Darwin and his contemporaries, evolution was in essence synonymous with evolution by natural selection. After the publication of \"On the Origin of Species\", educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form. However, natural selection remained controversial as a law or mechanism, partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms, and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its \"unguided\" and non-progressive nature, a response that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the idea's acceptance. However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection; after reading Darwin, Herbert Spencer introduced the phrase \"survival of the fittest\", which became a popular summary of the theory. The fifth edition of \"On the Origin of Species\" published in 1869 included Spencer's phrase as an alternative to natural selection, with credit given: \"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\" Although the phrase is still often used by non-biologists, modern biologists avoid it because it is tautological if \"fittest\" is read to mean \"functionally superior\" and is applied to individuals rather than considered as an averaged quantity over populations.\nThe modern synthesis.\nNatural selection relies crucially on the idea of heredity, but developed before the basic concepts of genetics were invented. Although the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genetics, was a contemporary of Darwin's, his work lay in obscurity, only being rediscovered in 1900. With the early 20th-century integration of evolution with Mendel's laws of inheritance, the so-called modern synthesis, scientists generally came to accept natural selection. The synthesis grew from advances in different fields. Ronald Fisher developed the required mathematical language and wrote \"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\" (1930). J. B. S. Haldane introduced the concept of the \"cost\" of natural selection.\nSewall Wright elucidated the nature of selection and adaptation.\nIn his book \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\" (1937), Theodosius Dobzhansky established the idea that mutation, once seen as a rival to selection, actually supplied the raw material for natural selection by creating genetic diversity.\nA second synthesis.\nErnst Mayr recognised the key importance of reproductive isolation for speciation in his \"Systematics and the Origin of Species\" (1942).\nW. D. Hamilton conceived of kin selection in 1964. This synthesis cemented natural selection as the foundation of evolutionary theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about at the end of the 20th century by advances in molecular genetics, creating the field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\"), which seeks to explain the evolution of form in terms of the genetic regulatory programs which control the development of the embryo at molecular level. Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.\n21st century developments.\nDarwin's argument in On the Origin of Species portrayed natural selection as a law which resulted from other processes: \"inheritance\" (including both the \"transmission\" and \"development\" of heritable material); what we now call 'phenotypic' variation; and the metaphorical struggle for existence among living organisms. The 20th century's dominant theories of evolutionary biology treated natural selection differently, as if it were itself a \"causal mechanism\", the agency of which was attributed either to the machinations of selfish genes or to 'the environment'. Which meant that living organisms themselves dropped out of scientists' theoretical picture. Under the pressure of evidence, 21st century evolutionary biology has seen growing criticism of the 20th century's gene-centred view of evolution. In consequence we now have an array of extended evolutionary syntheses which have returned the agency of living organisms to the heart of the theory of natural selection.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"natural selection\" is most often defined as the differential survival and reproduction of different phenotypic variations, where these are supported by heritable traits. It is sometimes helpful to distinguish between the processes or mechanisms which result in selection and selection's effects. Traits that endow greater reproductive success on an organism are said to be \"selected for\", while those that reduce success are \"selected against\".\nMechanism.\nHeritable variation, differential reproduction.\nNatural or phenotypic variation occurs among the individuals of any population of organisms. Some variations may improve an individual's chances of surviving and reproducing such that its lifetime reproductive rate is increased, which means that it leaves more offspring. If the variations that give these individuals a reproductive advantage are also supported by heritable traits which are passed from parent to offspring, then there will be differential reproduction, that is, a slightly higher proportion of flying squirrels, fast rabbits or efficient algae in the next generation. Even if the reproductive advantage is very slight, over many generations any advantageous heritable trait becomes dominant in the population. In this way the natural environment of an organism \"selects for\" traits that confer a reproductive advantage, causing evolutionary change, as Darwin described. This gives the appearance of purpose, but in natural selection there is no intentional choice. Artificial selection is purposive where natural selection is not, though biologists often use teleological language to describe it.\nThe peppered moth exists in both light and dark colours in Great Britain, but during the Industrial Revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths a better chance of surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on peppered moth evolution. A recent study, using image analysis and avian vision models, shows that pale individuals more closely match lichen backgrounds than dark morphs and for the first time quantifies the camouflage of moths to predation risk. Modern genetic studies show that the switch from light to dark coloration is due to a transposable element insertion into the first intron of the gene cortex.\nAn example of natural selection in the wild involving a much larger number of genes is given by ash trees in Britain, under selection by an invasive fungus causing ash dieback. This fungus has killed large numbers of ash trees in Europe, and damaged many others, though some trees remain healthy. The genetic basis of health under ash dieback pressure has been shown to be quantitative and highly polygenic. Using genomic prediction models trained on planted trials, geneticists have shown that natural selection is acting on a woodland in Surrey England, causing the new generation of ash trees to be, on average, more genetically resistant to ash dieback than their parents generation. This is due to selection for beneficial gene combinations from among the variation present in the parents.\nFitness.\nThe concept of fitness is central to natural selection. In broad terms, individuals that are more \"fit\" have better potential for survival, as in the well-known phrase \"survival of the fittest\", but the precise meaning of the term is much more subtle. Modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing. If an organism lives half as long as others of its species, but has twice as many offspring surviving to adulthood, its genes become more common in the adult population of the next generation. Though natural selection acts on individuals, the effects of chance mean that fitness can only really be defined \"on average\" for the individuals within a population. The fitness of a particular genotype corresponds to the average effect on all individuals with that genotype.\nA distinction must be made between the concept of \"survival of the fittest\" and \"improvement in fitness\". \"Survival of the fittest\" does not give an \"improvement in fitness\", it only represents the removal of the less fit variants from a population. A mathematical example of \"survival of the fittest\" is given by Haldane in his paper \"The Cost of Natural Selection\". Haldane called this process \"substitution\" or more commonly in biology, this is called \"fixation\". This is correctly described by the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. On the other hand, \"improvement in fitness\" is not dependent on the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype, it is dependent on the absolute survival of the particular variant. The probability of a beneficial mutation occurring on some member of a population depends on the total number of replications of that variant. The mathematics of \"improvement in fitness was described by Kleinman. An empirical example of \"improvement in fitness\" is given by the Kishony Mega-plate experiment. In this experiment, \"improvement in fitness\" depends on the number of replications of the particular variant for a new variant to appear that is capable of growing in the next higher drug concentration region. Fixation or substitution is not required for this \"improvement in fitness\". On the other hand, \"improvement in fitness\" can occur in an environment where \"survival of the fittest\" is also acting. Richard Lenski's classic \"E. coli\" long-term evolution experiment is an example of adaptation in a competitive environment, (\"improvement in fitness\" during \"survival of the fittest\"). The probability of a beneficial mutation occurring on some member of the lineage to give improved fitness is slowed by the competition. The variant which is a candidate for a beneficial mutation in this limited carrying capacity environment must first out-compete the \"less fit\" variants in order to accumulate the requisite number of replications for there to be a reasonable probability of that beneficial mutation occurring.\nCompetition.\nIn biology, competition is an interaction between organisms in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another. This may be because both rely on a limited supply of a resource such as food, water, or territory. Competition may be within or between species, and may be direct or indirect. Species less suited to compete should in theory either adapt or die out, since competition plays a powerful role in natural selection, but according to the \"room to roam\" theory it may be less important than expansion among larger clades.\nCompetition is modelled by \"r/K\" selection theory, which is based on Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson's work on island biogeography. In this theory, selective pressures drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: \"r\"- or \"K\"-selection. These terms, \"r\" and \"K\", can be illustrated in a of population dynamics:\nformula_1\nwhere \"r\" is the growth rate of the population (\"N\"), and \"K\" is the carrying capacity of its local environmental setting. Typically, \"r\"-selected species exploit empty niches, and produce many offspring, each with a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood. In contrast, \"K\"-selected species are strong competitors in crowded niches, and invest more heavily in much fewer offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.\nSocial species.\nForeshadowing a central theme in 21st century evolutionary biology, Darwin argued that natural selection operated differently in social than in non-social species. The members of social species aided their conspecifics to survive, either passively (as in \"social plants\") or both passively and actively, as in \"social animals\". Darwin called plants like grasses and thistles social, because, in a \"somewhat strained sense\", they help each other by increasing their mutual chances of cross-fertilization (and hence vigour), and by reducing the depredations of their \"devourers\" (e.g. birds eating their seeds). This meant that often, if social plants \"did not live in numbers, they could not live at all.\"\nWhen it came to animals, Darwin said a truly social animal sought society beyond its own family. Unlike marmosets and tamarins, gorillas, lions, and tigers were not social in Darwin's sense, because, while they \"no doubt\" felt sympathy for the suffering of their young, they did not sympathize with \"any other animal\" beyond their own family.\nIn addition to the passive kinds of \"mutual aid\" that advantaged social plants, social animals could gain additional benefits through efficiencies due to divisions of labour like those found in social insects. Beyond this, some social species of bird and mammal \"actively\" signaled danger to other members of their community, some even posting sentinels to warn the group of approaching enemies. Thus rabbits stamp their hind-feet, and female seals act as look-outs. Social creatures may also actively groom each other, removing parasites, or licking each other\u2019s wounds. Animals like wolves, killer whales, and pelicans hunt in concert, sometimes with a combined strategy. Social animals mutually defend each other too, and thereby show their \"heroism.\" All these advantages mean that, in social animals, unlike non-social species, \"natural selection \"will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the whole community; if the community profits by the selected change.\"\" In The Descent of Man, Darwin attributes the evolution of all the most human of human characteristics\u2014rationality, intellect, language, conscience, moral qualities, and culture\u2014to the fact that our pre-human ancestors were group-living social animals \"par excellence\".\nAlthough the gene-centred view of evolution promulgated by the 20th century's modern synthesis in evolutionary biology denied the possibility of community or group selection of the kind proposed by Darwin, 21st century evolutionists are less dismissive.\nClassification.\nNatural selection can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, and selective pressure can be altered by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition or cooperation with members of the same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.\nSelection can be classified in several different ways, such as by its effect on a trait, on genetic diversity, by the life cycle stage where it acts, by the unit of selection, or by the resource being competed for.\nBy effect on a trait.\nSelection has different effects on phenotypic traits. Stabilizing selection acts to hold a trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait in more than one direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.\nBy effect on genetic diversity.\nAlternatively, selection can be divided according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by \"de novo\" mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, even in the absence of \"de novo\" mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.\nBy life cycle stage.\nAnother option is to classify selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.\nBy unit of selection.\nSelection can also be classified by the level or unit of selection. Individual selection acts on the individual, in the sense that adaptations are \"for\" the benefit of the individual, and result from selection among individuals. Gene selection acts directly at the level of the gene. In kin selection and intragenomic conflict, gene-level selection provides a more apt explanation of the underlying process. Group selection, if it occurs, acts on groups of organisms, on the assumption that groups replicate and mutate in an analogous way to genes and individuals. There is an ongoing debate over the degree to which group selection occurs in nature.\nBy resource being competed for.\nFinally, selection can be classified according to the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes at the expense of viability. Ecological selection is natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.\nSexual selection as first articulated by Darwin (using the example of the peacock's tail) refers specifically to competition for mates, which can be \"intrasexual\", between individuals of the same sex, that is male\u2013male competition, or \"intersexual\", where one gender chooses mates, most often with males displaying and females choosing. However, in some species, mate choice is primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family Syngnathidae.\nPhenotypic traits can be displayed in one sex and desired in the other sex, causing a positive feedback loop called a Fisherian runaway, for example, the extravagant plumage of some male birds such as the peacock. An alternate theory proposed by the same Ronald Fisher in 1930 is the sexy son hypothesis, that mothers want promiscuous sons to give them large numbers of grandchildren and so choose promiscuous fathers for their children. Aggression between members of the same sex is sometimes associated with very distinctive features, such as the antlers of stags, which are used in combat with other stags. More generally, intrasexual selection is often associated with sexual dimorphism, including differences in body size between males and females of a species.\nArms races.\nNatural selection is seen in action in the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. The widespread misuse of antibiotics has selected for microbial resistance to antibiotics in clinical use, to the point that the methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\" (MRSA) has been described as a \"superbug\" because of the threat it poses to health and its relative invulnerability to existing drugs. Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new strains of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs. This is an evolutionary arms race, in which bacteria develop strains less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers attempt to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects. Arms races are not necessarily induced by man; a well-documented example involves the spread of a gene in the butterfly \"Hypolimnas bolina\" suppressing male-killing activity by \"Wolbachia\" bacteria parasites on the island of Samoa, where the spread of the gene is known to have occurred over a period of just five years.\nEvolution by means of natural selection.\nWithout phenotypic variation, there would be no evolution by natural selection. A prerequisite for natural selection to result in adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation is the presence of heritable genetic variation that affects phenotypic fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous for phenotypic variations, but large effects on phenotypes are rare. \nIn the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.\nSome mutations occur in \"toolkit\" or regulatory genes. Changes in these often have large effects on the phenotype of the individual because they regulate the function of many other genes. Most, but not all, mutations in regulatory genes result in non-viable embryos. Some nonlethal regulatory mutations occur in HOX genes in humans, which can result in a cervical rib or polydactyly, an increase in the number of fingers or toes. When such mutations result in a higher fitness, natural selection favours these phenotypes and the novel trait spreads in the population.\nEstablished traits are not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one environmental context may be much less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, the eye of the blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.\nSpeciation.\nSpeciation requires a degree of reproductive isolation\u2014that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic to the concept of a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson\u2013Dobzhansky\u2013Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favour an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.\nGenetic basis.\nGenotype and phenotype.\nNatural selection results from the ways an organism's phenotypes, or observable characteristics, bear on its capacity to reproduce. Phenotypes are plastic which means they are less directly determined by a given organism's genetic make-up (genotype) than by the way that particular organism develops and behaves in the theatre of agency which constitutes its habitat or environment. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene affecting a certain phenotypic trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. (An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.) It is these genetic variations which affect fitness-relevant differences in phenotypic traits and so underpin the evolution of new adaptations and, ultimately, new species.\nSome traits are governed by only a single gene, but most traits are influenced by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many genes that contributes to a trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together, these genes can support a continuum of possible phenotypic values.\nDirectionality of selection.\nWhen some component of a phenotypic trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that affect the variants of the observed trait. Selection can be divided into three classes, on the basis of its effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and disruptive selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype\u2014that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Stabilizing selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants. Disruptive (or diversifying) selection is selection favouring extreme trait values over intermediate trait values. Disruptive selection may cause sympatric speciation through niche partitioning.\nSome forms of balancing selection do not result in fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and can result in a bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.\nSelection, genetic variation, and drift.\nA portion of all genetic variation is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or significant difference in fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by genetic drift proposes that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce genetic variation through population bottlenecks, which among other things can cause the founder effect in initially small new populations. When genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift. Natural selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation\u2013selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on the rate at which new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.\nGenetic linkage occurs when the loci of two alleles are close on a chromosome. During the formation of gametes, recombination reshuffles the alleles. The chance that such a reshuffle occurs between two alleles is inversely related to the distance between them. Selective sweeps occur when an allele becomes more common in a population as a result of positive selection. As the prevalence of one allele increases, closely linked alleles can also become more common by \"genetic hitchhiking\", whether they are neutral or even slightly deleterious. A strong selective sweep results in a region of the genome where the positively selected haplotype (the allele and its neighbours) are in essence the only ones that exist in the population. Selective sweeps can be detected by measuring linkage disequilibrium, or whether a given haplotype is overrepresented in the population. Since a selective sweep also results in selection of neighbouring alleles, the presence of a block of strong linkage disequilibrium might indicate a 'recent' selective sweep near the centre of the block.\nBackground selection is the opposite of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background selection is a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.\nImpact.\nDarwin's ideas, along with those of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, had a profound influence on 19th century thought, including his radical claim that \"elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner\" evolved from the simplest forms of life by a few simple principles. This inspired some of Darwin's most ardent supporters\u2014and provoked the strongest opposition. Natural selection had the power, according to Stephen Jay Gould, to \"dethrone some of the deepest and most traditional comforts of Western thought\", such as the belief that humans have a special place in the world.\nIn the words of the philosopher Daniel Dennett, \"Darwin's dangerous idea\" of evolution by natural selection is a \"universal acid,\" which cannot be kept restricted to any vessel or container, as it soon leaks out, working its way into ever-wider surroundings. Thus, in the last decades, the concept of natural selection has spread from evolutionary biology to other disciplines, including evolutionary computation, quantum Darwinism, evolutionary economics, evolutionary epistemology, evolutionary psychology, and cosmological natural selection. This unlimited applicability has been called universal Darwinism.\nOrigin of life.\nHow life originated from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent hypothesis is that life first appeared in the form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.\nCell and molecular biology.\nIn 1881, the embryologist Wilhelm Roux published \"Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus\" (\"The Struggle of Parts in the Organism\") in which he suggested that the development of an organism results from a Darwinian competition between the parts of the embryo, occurring at all levels, from molecules to organs. In recent years, a modern version of this theory has been proposed by . According to this cellular Darwinism, random variation at the molecular level generates diversity in cell types whereas cell interactions impose a characteristic order on the developing embryo.\nSocial and psychological theory.\nThe social implications of the theory of evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy. Friedrich Engels, a German political philosopher and co-originator of the ideology of communism, wrote in 1872 that \"Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and especially on his countrymen, when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the \"animal kingdom\".\" Herbert Spencer and the eugenics advocate Francis Galton's interpretation of natural selection as necessarily progressive, leading to supposed advances in intelligence and civilisation, became a justification for colonialism, eugenics, and social Darwinism. For example, in 1940, Konrad Lorenz, in writings that he subsequently disowned, used the theory as a justification for policies of the Nazi state. He wrote \"...\u00a0selection for toughness, heroism, and social utility\u00a0... must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished much in this respect.\" Others have developed ideas that human societies and culture evolve by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.\nMore recently, work among anthropologists and psychologists has led to the development of sociobiology and later of evolutionary psychology, a field that attempts to explain features of human psychology in terms of adaptation to the ancestral environment. The most prominent example of evolutionary psychology, notably advanced in the early work of Noam Chomsky and later by Steven Pinker, is the hypothesis that the human brain has adapted to acquire the grammatical rules of natural language. Other aspects of human behaviour and social structures, from specific cultural norms such as incest avoidance to broader patterns such as gender roles, have been hypothesised to have similar origins as adaptations to the early environment in which modern humans evolved. By analogy to the action of natural selection on genes, the concept of memes\u2014\"units of cultural transmission,\" or culture's equivalents of genes undergoing selection and recombination\u2014has arisen, first described in this form by Richard Dawkins in 1976 and subsequently expanded upon by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett as explanations for complex cultural activities, including human consciousness.\nInformation and systems theory.\nIn 1922, Alfred J. Lotka proposed that natural selection might be understood as a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.\nThe principles of natural selection have inspired a variety of computational techniques, such as \"soft\" artificial life, that simulate selective processes and can be highly efficient in 'adapting' entities to an environment defined by a specified fitness function. For example, a class of heuristic optimisation algorithms known as genetic algorithms, pioneered by John Henry Holland in the 1970s and expanded upon by David E. Goldberg, identify optimal solutions by simulated reproduction and mutation of a population of solutions defined by an initial probability distribution. Such algorithms are particularly useful when applied to problems whose energy landscape is very rough or has many local minima.\nIn fiction.\nDarwinian evolution by natural selection is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Among major responses is Samuel Butler's 1872 pessimistic \"Erewhon\" (\"nowhere\", written mostly backwards). In 1893 H. G. Wells imagined \"The Man of the Year Million\", transformed by natural selection into a being with a huge head and eyes, and shrunken body.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest of the four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and west. It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Belgium. The official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. Dutch, English, and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories. People from the Netherlands are referred to as Dutch.\n\"Netherlands\" literally means \"lower countries\", in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, 26% of which is below sea level. Most of the areas below sea level, known as \"polders\", are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century. In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world. While neutral in the First World War, the Netherlands was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940 during the Second World War, which lasted until the end of the war in 1945.\nWith a population of over 18 million people, all living within a total area of \u2014of which the land area is \u2014the Netherlands is the 26th most densely populated country, with a density of . Nevertheless, it is the world's second largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness. The four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal capital, though the primary national political institutions are in The Hague.\nThe Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. The country has a tradition of pillarisation (separation of citizens into groups by religion and political beliefs) and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised prostitution and euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919 and was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001. Its mixed-market advanced economy has the eleventh-highest per capita income globally. The Hague holds the seat of the States General, cabinet, and Supreme Court. The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest in Europe.&lt;ref name=\"Ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20200402-2_2021-11-25\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the fourth busiest in Europe. Being a developed country, the Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are in The Hague.\nEtymology.\nNetherlands and the Low Countries.\nThe countries that comprise the region called the Low Countries (Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) all have comparatively the same toponymy. Place names with , , , , or (in Germanic languages) and or (in Romance languages) are in use in low-lying places all over Europe. The Romans made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream Germania Inferior (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream Germania Superior. Thus, in the case of the Low Countries and the Netherlands, the geographical location of this \"lower\" region is more or less downstream and near the sea, compared to that of the upper region of Germania Superior. The designation 'Low' returned in the 10th-century Duchy of Lower Lorraine, which covered much of the Low Countries.\nThe Dukes of Burgundy used the term (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries. Under Habsburg rule, this became (\"lands down here\"). This was translated as in contemporary Dutch official documents. From a regional point of view, \"Niderlant\" was also the area between the Meuse and the lower Rhine in the late Middle Ages. From the mid-sixteenth century, the \"Low Countries\" and the \"Netherlands\" lost their original deictic meaning.\nIn most Romance languages, the term \"Low Countries\" is officially used as the name for the Netherlands.\nHolland.\nThe term \"Holland\" has frequently been used informally to refer to the whole of the modern country of the Netherlands in various languages, including Dutch and English. In some languages, Holland is used as the formal name for the Netherlands. However, Holland is a region within the Netherlands that consists of the two provinces of North and South Holland. Formerly these were a single province, and earlier the County of Holland, which also included parts of present-day Utrecht. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the Dutch Republic, the Eighty Years' War, and the Anglo-Dutch Wars in the 17th and 18th centuries made Holland a \"pars pro toto\" for the entire country.\nMany Dutch people object to the country being referred to as \"Holland\" instead of \"the Netherlands\", on much the same grounds as many Welsh or Scottish people object to the United Kingdom being referred to as England. In particular, those from regions other than Holland find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term Holland for the whole country, as the Holland region only comprises two of the twelve provinces, and 38% of Dutch citizens. As of 2019, the Dutch government officially has preferred \"the Netherlands\" instead of \"Holland\" when talking about the country\".\"\nOften \"Holland\" or \"Hollanders\" is used by the Flemish to refer to the Dutch in the Netherlands, and by the southern Dutch (the Dutch living \"below the great rivers\", a natural cultural, social, and religious boundary formed by the rivers Rhine and Meuse) to refer to the northern Dutch (the Dutch living north of these rivers). The use of the term in this context by the southern Dutch is in a derogatory fashion. In the southern province of Limburg, the term is used for the Dutch from the other 11 provinces.\nDutch.\n\"Dutch\" is used in English as the adjective for the Netherlands, as well as the demonym. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic (Latinised into \"Theodiscus\"), meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\", the origin of Old Dutch and Old English , meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used \"Dutch\" to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages. The term gradually came to be used more narrowly to refer to the West Germanic people the English had the most contact with.\nHistory.\nPrehistory (before 800 BC).\nThe oldest human (Neanderthal) traces in the Netherlands, believed to be about 250,000 years old, were found near Maastricht. At the end of the Ice Age, the nomadic late Upper Palaeolithic Hamburg culture (13,000\u201310,000 BC) hunted reindeer in the area, using spears. The later Ahrensburg culture (11,200\u20139,500 BC) used bow and arrow. From Mesolithic Maglemosian-like tribes (c. 8000 BC), the world's oldest canoe was found in Drenthe.\nIndigenous late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from the Swifterbant culture (c. 5600 BC), related to the southern Scandinavian Erteb\u00f8lle culture, were strongly linked to rivers and open water. Between 4800 and 4500 BC, the Swifterbant people started to adopt from the neighbouring Linear Pottery culture the practice of animal husbandry, and between 4300 and 4000 BC agriculture. The Funnelbeaker culture (4300\u20132800 BC) erected the dolmens, large stone grave monuments found in Drenthe. There was a quick transition from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the pan-European Corded Ware pastoralist culture (c. 2950 BC). In the southwest, the Seine-Oise-Marne culture\u2014related to the Vlaardingen culture (c. 2600 BC)\u2014survived well into the Neolithic period, until it too was succeeded by the Corded Ware culture.\nThe subsequent Bell Beaker culture (2700\u20132100 BC) introduced metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze and opened new international trade routes, reflected in copper artefacts. Finds of rare bronze objects suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Bronze Age (2000\u2013800 BC). The Bell Beaker culture developed locally into the Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100\u20131800 BC) and later the Elp culture (1800\u2013800 BC), a Middle Bronze Age culture marked by earthenware pottery. The southern region became dominated by the related Hilversum culture (1800\u2013800 BC).\nCelts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC\u2013410 AD).\nFrom 800 BC onwards, the Iron Age Celtic Hallstatt culture became influential, replacing the Hilversum culture. Iron ore brought a measure of prosperity and was available throughout the country. Smiths travelled from settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand. The King's grave of Oss (700 BC) was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in Western Europe.\nThe deteriorating climate in Scandinavia from 850 BC and 650 BC might have triggered the migration of Germanic tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged. The North Sea Germanic Ingaevones inhabited the northern part of the Low Countries. They would later develop into the Frisii and the early Saxons. The Weser\u2013Rhine Germanic (or Istvaeones) extended along the middle Rhine and Weser and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. These tribes would eventually develop into the Salian Franks. The Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture (c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest) expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the Low Countries. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the Nordwestblock culture.\nThe first author to describe the coast of Holland and Flanders was the geographer Pytheas, who noted in c. 325 BC that in these regions, \"more people died in the struggle against water than in the struggle against men.\" During the Gallic Wars, the area south and west of the Rhine was conquered by Roman forces under Julius Caesar from 57 BC to 53 BC. Caesar describes two main Celtic tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands: the Menapii and the Eburones. Under Augustus, the Roman Empire conquered the entirety of the modern day Netherlands, incorporating it into the province of Germania Antiqua in 7 BC, and was repelled back across the Rhine after the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9; the Rhine became fixed as Rome's permanent northern frontier about AD 12. Notable towns would arise along the Limes Germanicus: Nijmegen and Voorburg. In the first part of Gallia Belgica, the area south of the Limes became part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule, while the Germanic border tribes of the Batavi and Cananefates served in the Roman cavalry. The Batavi rose against the Romans in the Batavian rebellion of AD 69 and were defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged in the first half of the third century. Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. They were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in West Flanders and the Southwest Netherlands, they were raiding the English Channel. Roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of Julian the Apostate (358) when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as \"foederati\" in Texandria.\nEarly Middle Ages (411\u20131000).\nAfter the Roman government in the area collapsed in roughly the year 406, the Franks expanded their territories into numerous kingdoms. By the 490s, Clovis I had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one Frankish kingdom, and from there continued his conquests into Gaul. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south (modern territory of France and Walloon part of Belgium) eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population. A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. the southern Netherlands and Flanders), who kept on speaking Old Frankish, which by the ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch. A Dutch-French language boundary hence came into existence.\nTo the north of the Franks, climatic conditions improved, and during the Migration Period Saxons, the closely related Angles, Jutes, and Frisii settled the coast. Many moved on to England and came to be known as Anglo-Saxons, but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians and their language as Frisian. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. By the seventh century, a Frisian Kingdom (650\u2013734) under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Traiectum (Utrecht) as its centre of power, while Dorestad was a flourishing trading place. Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the Battle of the Boarn, the Frisians were defeated after a series of wars. With the approval of the Franks, the Anglo-Saxon missionary Willibrord converted the Frisian people to Christianity and established the Archdiocese of Utrecht. However, his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in 754.\nThe Frankish Carolingian empire controlled much of Western Europe. In 843, it was divided into three parts\u2014East, Middle, and West Francia. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of Middle Francia, which was a weak kingdom and subject to numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from Frisia in the north to the Kingdom of Italy in the south. Around 850, Lothair I of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking Rorik of Dorestad as ruler of most of Frisia. When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the Alps passed to Lothair II and subsequently were named Lotharingia. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into Upper and Lower Lotharingia, the latter comprising the Low Countries that became part of East Francia in 870. Around 879, another Viking expedition led by Godfrid, Duke of Frisia, raided the Frisian lands. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was Gerolf of Holland, who assumed lordship in Frisia, and Viking rule came to an end.\nHigh Middle Ages (1000\u20131384).\nThe Holy Roman Empire ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. Holland, Hainaut, Flanders, Gelre, Brabant, and Utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became Old Low Franconian (or Old Dutch).\nAround 1000 AD, agrarian conditions started to improve, which led to increase in population, reclamation of wasteland by farmers, and steady growth of trade and industry. Towns grew around monasteries and castles, and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders, and later Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign.\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from Flanders and Utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of Count of Holland was fought over in the Hook and Cod Wars between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy to conquer Holland.\nBurgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581).\nMost of the Imperial and French fiefs in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium were united in a personal union by Philip the Good in 1433. The House of Valois-Burgundy and their Habsburg heirs would rule the Low Countries from 1384 to 1581. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of the County of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\nUnder Habsburg Charles V, all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the Seventeen Provinces, which included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of France and Germany. In 1568, under Phillip II, the Eighty Years' War between the Provinces and their Spanish ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:\nOn more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks... A Spaniard had ceased to be human in their eyes. On one occasion, a surgeon at Veer cut the heart from a Spanish prisoner, nailed it on a vessel's prow, and invited the townsmen to come and fasten their teeth in it, which many did with savage satisfaction.\nThe Duke of Alba attempted to suppress the Protestant movement in the Netherlands. Netherlanders were \"burned, strangled, beheaded, or buried alive\" by his \"Blood Council\" and Spanish soldiers. Bodies were displayed along roads to terrorise the population into submission. Alba boasted of having executed 18,600; this figure does not include those who perished by war and famine.\nThe first great siege was Alba's effort to capture Haarlem and thereby cut Holland in half. It dragged on from December 1572 to the next summer, when Haarlemers finally surrendered on 13 July upon the promise that the city would be spared from being sacked. It was a stipulation Don Fadrique was unable to honour, when his soldiers mutinied, angered over pay owed and the miserable conditions of the campaign. On 4 November 1576, Spanish tercios seized Antwerp and subjected it to the worst pillage in the Netherlands' history. The citizens resisted but were overcome; seven thousand were killed and a thousand buildings were torched.\nAfter the sack of Antwerp, delegates from Catholic Brabant, Protestant Holland and Zeeland agreed to join Utrecht and William the Silent in driving out Spanish troops and forming a new government for the Netherlands. Don Juan of Austria, the new Spanish governor, was forced to concede initially, but within months returned to active hostilities. The Dutch looked for help from the Protestant Elizabeth I of England, but she initially stood by her commitments to the Spanish in the Treaty of Bristol of 1574. When the next large-scale battle occurred at Gembloux in 1578, the Spanish forces won easily. In light of the defeat at Gembloux, the southern states of the Seventeen Provinces distanced themselves from the rebels in the north with the 1579 Union of Arras. Opposing them, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the Union of Utrecht in which they committed to support each other against the Spanish. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands.\nSpanish troops sacked Maastricht in 1579, killing over 10,000 civilians. In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration, the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II. Against the rebels Philip could draw on the resources of the Spanish Empire. Elizabeth I sympathised with the Dutch struggle and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid them. English forces faced the Spanish in the Netherlands under the Duke of Parma in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of Spanish troops and bought time for the Dutch to reorganise their defences. The war continued until 1648, when Spain under King Philip IV recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the Peace of M\u00fcnster. Parts of the southern provinces became \"de facto\" colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire.\nDutch Republic (1581\u20131795).\nAfter the declaration of independence, the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Groningen, Friesland, Utrecht, Overijssel, and Gelderland entered into a confederation. All these duchies, lordships and counties enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy and were governed by their own administrative bodies known as the States-Provincial. The confederal government, known as the States General, was headquartered in The Hague and comprised representatives from each of the seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of Drenthe was part of the republic, albeit not considered a province in its own right. Moreover, during the Eighty Years' War, the Republic came to occupy a number of Generality Lands in Flanders, Brabant and Limburg. These areas were primarily inhabited by Roman Catholics and lacked a distinct governmental structure of their own. They were utilized as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands.\nIn the Dutch Golden Age, spanning much of the 17th century, the Dutch Empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers. Science, military and art (especially painting) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the Dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships. The Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company established colonies and trading posts all over the world. The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam in 1614. In South Africa, the Dutch settled the Cape Colony in 1652. Dutch colonies in South America were established along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains, among them Colony of Surinam (now Suriname). In Asia, the Dutch established a presence in India, the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), Formosa (now Taiwan), and the only western trading post in Japan, Dejima. During the period of Proto-industrialisation, the empire received 50% of textiles and 80% of silks import from the India's Mughal Empire.\nMany economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country. In early modern Europe, it had the wealthiest trading city in Amsterdam, and the first full-time stock exchange. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle, the world's first asset-inflation bubble, the tulip mania of 1636\u20131637, and the world's first bear raider, Isaac le Maire. In 1672 \u2013 known in Dutch history as the Rampjaar (Disaster Year) \u2013 the Dutch Republic was attacked by France, England and two German bishoprics simultaneously, in what would become known as the Franco-Dutch War. At sea, it could successfully prevent the English and French navies from blockading the western shores. On land the Republic was almost overrun by the advancing French and German armies from the east, but the Dutch managed to turn the tide by inundating parts of Holland.\nFrom 1672 to 1712, the Republic, led by William III of Orange and Anthonie Heinsius would regularly clash with France in what some historians have come to call the \"Forty Years' War\". In the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, the Republic was at the centre of anti-French coalitions. The Dutch ultimately successfully defended the Spanish Netherlands, established a barrier there, and their troops proved central to the alliance which halted French territorial expansion in Europe until a new cycle began in 1792 with the French Revolutionary Wars. However, the wars left them effectively bankrupt, and inflicted permanent damage on the Dutch merchant navy; while they remained the dominant economic power in the Far East, Britain took over as the pre-eminent global commercial and maritime power. Between 1590 and 1713, the Dutch army had been one of Europe's largest and most capable armies. However, after the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession, other major powers, such as Prussia, Austria, Britain, and Russia, significantly expanded their military forces. The Republic struggled to match these developments, and gradually assumed the status of a mid-tier power. However, historians have sometimes overstated the extent of this decline, especially when considering the period up to the 1750s.\nBatavian Republic and Kingdom (1795\u20131890).\nIn the 18th century the Dutch Republic had seen a state of a general decline, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the republican \"Staatsgezinden\" and the supporters of the stadtholder the \"Prinsgezinden\" as main political factions. With the armed support of revolutionary France, Dutch republicans proclaimed the Batavian Republic, modelled after the French Republic and rendering the Netherlands a unitary state on 19 January 1795. The stadtholder William V of Orange had fled to England. From 1806 to 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was set up by Napoleon Bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother Louis Bonaparte. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until November 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Leipzig.\nWilliam Frederick, son of the last stadtholder, returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself Sovereign Prince. Two years later, the Congress of Vienna added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France. William Frederick raised this United Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself as King William I in 1815. William became hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg in exchange for his German possessions. However, the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and rebelled. The south gained independence in 1830 as Belgium (recognised by the Northern Netherlands in 1839 as the Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by decree), while the personal union between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890, when William III died with no surviving male heirs. Ascendancy laws prevented his daughter Queen Wilhelmina from becoming the next Grand Duchess.\nThe Belgian Revolution and the Java War in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. However, the Cultivation System was introduced in 1830; in the Dutch East Indies, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export. The policy brought the Dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient. The Netherlands abolished slavery in its colonies in 1863. Enslaved people in Suriname would be fully free only in 1873.\nWorld wars and beyond (1890\u2013present).\nThe Netherlands remained neutral during World War I, in part because the import of goods through the Netherlands proved essential to German survival until the blockade by the British Royal Navy in 1916. That changed in World War II, when Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. The Rotterdam Blitz forced most of the Dutch army to surrender. During the occupation, over 100,000 Dutch Jews were transported to Nazi extermination camps; only a few survived. Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany, civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers, and the countryside was plundered for food. Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans, over 20,000 Dutch fascists joined the Waffen SS. Political collaborators were members of the fascist NSB, the only legal political party in the occupied Netherlands. On 8 December 1941, the Dutch government-in-exile in London declared war on Japan, but could not prevent the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. In 1944\u201345, the First Canadian Army liberated much of the Netherlands. Soon after VE Day, the Dutch fought a colonial war against the new Republic of Indonesia.\nDecolonisation.\nIn 1954, the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands reformed the political structure as a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation. The Dutch colonies of Surinam and Cura\u00e7ao and Dependencies became constituent countries within the Kingdom, on the basis of an equal partnership with the European territories. Indonesia had declared its independence in August 1945. Suriname followed in 1975. The Netherlands was one of the founding members of Benelux and NATO. In the 1950s, the Netherlands became one of the six founding countries of the European Communities, after the 1952 establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, and subsequent 1958 creations of the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community. In 1993, the former two were incorporated into the European Union.\nGovernment-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 Dutch to leave the country after the war. The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-pillarisation. Students and other youth rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as women's rights, sexuality, disarmament and environmental issues. In 2002 the euro was introduced as fiat money, and in 2010 the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. Referendums were held on each island. As a result, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (the BES islands) were incorporated as \"special municipalities\" upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. The special municipalities are collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands.\nGeography.\nThe European Netherlands has a total area of , including water bodies, and a land area of . The Caribbean Netherlands has a total area of It lies between latitudes 50\u00b0 and 54\u00b0 N, and longitudes 3\u00b0 and 8\u00b0 E.\nThe Netherlands is geographically very low relative to sea level and is considered a flat country, with about 26% of its area and 21% of its population below sea level. The European part of the country is for the most part flat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast, up to a height of no more than at the Vaalserberg, and some low hill ranges in the central parts. Most of the areas below sea level are caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation. Since the late 16th century, large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes, canals and pumping stations.\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large European rivers: the Rhine (\"Rijn\"), the Meuse (\"Maas\") and the Scheldt (\"Schelde\"), as well as their tributaries. The south-western part of the Netherlands is a river delta of these rivers, the Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta.\nThe European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the Waal, its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. These rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (\"de Grote Rivieren\"). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the IJssel river, discharges into Lake IJssel, the former Zuiderzee ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak Dutch Low Saxon dialects (except for the province of Friesland, which has its own language).\nGeology.\nThe Netherlands is mostly composed of deltaic, coastal and aeolian derived sediments during the Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods.\nNearly the entire west Netherlands is composed of the Rhine-Meuse river estuary. In the east of the Netherlands, remains are found of the last ice age, which ended approximately ten thousand years ago. As the continental ice sheet moved in from the north, it pushed moraine forward. The ice sheet halted as it covered the eastern half of the Netherlands. After the ice age ended, the moraine remained in the form of a long hill-line. The cities of Arnhem and Nijmegen are built on these hills.\nFloods.\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\nOn 14 December 1287, St. Lucia's flood affected the Netherlands and neighbouring Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history. The St. Elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder, replacing it with the \"Biesbosch\" tidal floodplains. The huge North Sea flood of February 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the southwest Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"Delta Works\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than 40 years.\nThe consequences of disasters were, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying swampland was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop; groundwater levels were lowered to compensate, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\nTo guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium AD, villages and farmhouses were built on hills called \"terps\". Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called \"waterschappen\" (\"water boards\") or \"hoogheemraadschappen\" (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous polders.\nIn 1932 the \"Afsluitdijk\" (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former \"Zuiderzee\" (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake). It became part of the larger Zuiderzee Works in which four polders totalling were reclaimed from the sea.\nThe Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change. Not only is the rising sea a problem, but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow.\nDelta Works.\nAfter the 1953 disaster, the Delta Works was constructed, which is a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. The main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland. This was achieved by raising of outer sea-dikes and of the inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea estuaries of Zeeland. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dike reinforcements. The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world.\nIt is anticipated that global warming will result in a rise in sea level. The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea-level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea-level rise of and a simultaneous land height decline of . The plan encompasses the reinforcement of existing coastal defences like dikes and dunes with of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the coast, but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another programme is already being executed. The Room for the River plan grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. The few residents who lived in these so-called \"overflow areas\" have been moved to higher ground, some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels.\nClimate change.\nThe Netherlands is already affected by climate change. The average temperature in the Netherlands rose by more than 2\u00b0C from 1901 to 2020. Climate change has resulted in increased frequency of droughts and heatwaves. Because significant portions of the Netherlands have been reclaimed from the sea or otherwise are near sea level, the Netherlands is very vulnerable to sea level rise.\nThe Netherlands has the fourth largest greenhouse gas emissions per capita of the European Union, in part due to the large number of cows. The Dutch response to climate change is driven by a number of unique factors, including larger green recovery plans by the European Union in the face of the COVID-19 and a climate change litigation case, State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation, which created mandatory climate change mitigation through emissions reductions 25% below 1990 levels. In 2021 CO2 emissions were down 14% compared to 1990 levels. The goal of the Dutch government is to reduce emissions in 2030 by 49%.\nNature.\nThe Netherlands has 21 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves. Most of these are owned by Staatsbosbeheer, the national department for forestry and nature conservation and Natuurmonumenten, a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Wadden Sea in the north, with its tidal flats and wetlands, is rich in biological diversity, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Nature Site. The Eastern Scheldt, formerly the northeast estuary of the river Scheldt was designated a national park in 2002, making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of .\nPhytogeographically, the European Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the European territory of the Netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests. In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down. These woods were planted on anthropogenic heaths and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) (Veluwe). The Netherlands had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.6/10, ranking it 169th globally out of 172 countries.\nNitrogen pollution is a problem. The number of flying insects in the Netherlands has dropped by 75% since the 1990s.\nCaribbean islands.\nIn the Lesser Antilles islands of the Caribbean, the territories of Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba and Sint Maarten have a constituent country status within the wider Kingdom of the Netherlands. Another three territories which make up the Caribbean Netherlands are designated as special municipalities. The Caribbean Netherlands have maritime borders with Anguilla, Cura\u00e7ao, France (Saint Barth\u00e9lemy), Saint Kitts and Nevis, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. The islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a tropical climate with warm weather all year round.\nWithin this island group:\nGovernment and politics.\nThe Netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848. The Netherlands is described as a consociational state. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues. According to International IDEA\u2019s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, the Netherlands performs in the high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in political representation, including elected government and inclusive suffrage. Furthermore, the Netherlands was ranked as the 17th best electoral democracy in the world by V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023 and 9th most democratic country in the world by the Democracy Index (The Economist) in 2022.\nThe monarch is the head of state, at present King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers due to ministerial responsibility.\nThe executive power is formed by the government that includes the monarch and the Council of Ministers, the deliberative organ of the Dutch cabinet. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries. One to three ministers are ministers without portfolio. The council of ministers is presided over by the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a \"primus inter pares\", with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. Dick Schoof has been prime minister since July 2024, succeeding the longest-serving prime minister, Mark Rutte.\nThe cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament, the States General, which also has legislative powers. The 150 members of the House of Representatives, the lower house, are elected in direct elections on the basis of party-list proportional representation. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls. The provincial assemblies, the States Provincial, are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the Senate, the upper house, which has the power to reject laws, but not amend them.\nPolitical culture.\nBoth trade unions and employers organisations are consulted in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the Social-Economic Council.\nThe Netherlands has a tradition of social tolerance. In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation, in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. Protection for LGBTQ and abortion rights are enshrined within the Netherlands' foreign aid policy.\nNo single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century, and as a result, coalition cabinets had to be formed. Since male suffrage became universal in 1917, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: Christian Democrats (currently the CDA), Social Democrats (currently the PvdA), and Liberals (currently the VVD). In November 2025, the centrist-liberal Democrats 66 of Rob Jetten was the winner of a general election, securing 26 out of 150 seats in the House of Representatives. A cabinet formation was ongoing as of \u00a02025[ [update]] to form a new government.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, each under a King's Commissioner. All provinces are divided into municipalities (\"gemeenten\"), of which there are 342 (2023).\nThe country is subdivided into 21 water districts, governed by a water board (\"waterschap\" or \"hoogheemraadschap\"), each having authority in matters concerning water management. The creation of water boards pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196. The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence. Direct elections of the water boards take place every four years.\nWithin the Dutch town of Baarle-Nassau, are 22 Belgian exclaves and within those are 8 Dutch enclaves.\nThe administrative structure on the three BES islands, collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands, is outside the twelve provinces. These islands have the status of \"openbare lichamen (public bodies)\". In the Netherlands these administrative units are often referred to as \"special municipalities\".\nForeign relations.\nThe history of Dutch foreign policy has been characterized by its neutrality. According to the 2024 Global Peace Index, Netherlands is the 18th most peaceful country in the world. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, NATO and the EU.\nThe foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs.\nThe historical ties inherited from its colonial past in Indonesia and Suriname still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. Many with heritage from these countries now live permanently in the Netherlands.\nMilitary.\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established in the late 1500s. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a conscription army. The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the Treaty of Brussels, and became a founding member of NATO in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in Cold War Europe. In 1983 the (ceremonial) function of commander of chief of the monarch was transferred to the government, which means the monarch (nominal head of state) has no formal military function. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War, it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, and it was engaged in Afghanistan. The Netherlands has ratified many international conventions concerning war law. The Netherlands decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix \"Koninklijke\" (Royal):\nThe submarine service opened to women on 1 January 2017. The Korps Commandotroepen, the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for a woman to become a commando. The Dutch Ministry of Defence employs more than 70,000 personnel, including over 20,000 civilians and over 50,000 military personnel.\nEconomy.\nSince the 16th century, shipping, fishing, agriculture, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy. The Netherlands has a high level of economic freedom. The Netherlands is one of the top countries in the Global Enabling Trade Report (2nd in 2016), and was ranked the fifth most competitive economy in the world by the Swiss International Institute for Management Development in 2017. The country was ranked the 8th most innovative nation in the world in the 2025 Global Innovation Index down from 2nd in 2018.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], the key trading partners of the Netherlands were Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, China and Russia. The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries. Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector. Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, trade, services and tourism. Examples of international Dutch companies operating in the Netherlands include Randstad NV, Heineken, KLM, financial services (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank), chemicals (DSM, AKZO), petroleum refining (Shell plc), electronic machinery (Philips, ASML), and satellite navigation (TomTom).\nThe Netherlands has the 17th-largest economy in the world, and ranks 11th in GDP (nominal) per capita. The Netherlands has low income inequality, but wealth inequality is relatively high. Despite ranking 11th in GDP per capita, UNICEF ranked the Netherlands 1st in child well-being in rich countries, both in 2007 and in 2013.\nAmsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX), part of Euronext, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. As a founding member of the euro, the Netherlands replaced (for accounting purposes) its former currency, the \"gulden\" (guilder), on 1 January 1999. Actual euro coins and banknotes followed on 1 January 2002. One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders. In the Caribbean Netherlands, the United States dollar is used instead. The Netherlands is a \"conduit country\" that helps to funnel profits from high-tax countries to tax havens. It has been ranked as the 4th largest tax haven in the world.\nThe Dutch location gives it prime access to markets in the United Kingdom and Germany, the Port of Rotterdam being the largest port in Europe. Other important parts of the economy are international trade, banking and transport. The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners. Amsterdam is the 5th-busiest tourist destination in Europe, with more than 4.2\u00a0million international visitors. Since the enlargement of the EU, large numbers of migrant workers have arrived in the Netherlands from Central and Eastern Europe.\nThe Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007. The Netherlands is the fourth-most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report.\nEnergy.\nBeginning in the 1950s, the Netherlands discovered huge natural gas resources. The sale of natural gas generated enormous revenues for the Netherlands for decades, adding, over sixty years, hundreds of billions of euros to the government's budget, about 1.5% of GNP. However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's huge energy wealth affected the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy, leading to the theory of Dutch disease. The field is operated by government-owned Gasunie and output is jointly exploited by the government, Royal Dutch Shell, and ExxonMobil. Gas production caused earthquakes which damaged housing. After a large public backlash, the government decided to phase out gas production from the field.\nThe Netherlands has made notable progress in its transition to a carbon-neutral economy. Thanks to increasing energy efficiency, energy demand shows signs of decoupling from economic growth. The share of energy from renewable sources doubled from 2008 to 2019, with especially strong growth in offshore wind and rooftop solar. However, the Netherlands remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels and has a concentration of energy- and emission-intensive industries that will not be easy to decarbonise. Its 2019 Climate Agreement defines policies and measures to support the achievement of Dutch climate targets and was developed through a collaborative process involving parties from across Dutch society. As of 2018, the Netherlands had one of the highest rates of carbon dioxide emissions per person in the European Union.\nAgriculture and natural resources.\nThe Netherlands' biocapacity totals only 0.8 global hectares per person in 2016, 0.2 of which are dedicated to agriculture. The Dutch biocapacity per person is just about half of the 1.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person available worldwide. In contrast, in 2016, the Dutch used on average 4.8 global hectares of biocapacity \u2013 their ecological footprint of consumption. As a result, the Netherlands was running a biocapacity deficit of 4.0 global hectares per person in 2016. The Dutch waste more food than any other EU citizen, at over three times the EU average.\nThe Dutch agricultural sector is highly mechanised, and has a strong focus on international exports. It employs about 4% of the Dutch labour force but produces large surpluses in the food-processing industry and accounts for 21% of the Dutch total export value. The Dutch rank first in the European Union and second worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind only the United States, with agricultural exports earning \u20ac80.7\u00a0billion in 2014, up from \u20ac75.4\u00a0billion in 2012. In 2019 agricultural exports were worth \u20ac94.5\u00a0billion. In an effort to reduce agricultural pollution, the Dutch government is imposing strict limits on the productivity of the farming sector, triggering Dutch farmers' protests.\nOne-third of the world's exports of chilis, tomatoes, and cucumbers go through the country. The Netherlands exports one-fifteenth of the world's apples. A significant portion of Dutch agricultural exports consists of fresh-cut plants, flowers, and flower bulbs, the Netherlands exporting two thirds of the world's total.\nDemographics.\nThe Netherlands had an estimated population of 18,080,943 as of June 2025. It is the 6th most densely populated country in Europe and the 33rd most densely populated country in the world with a density of . Between 1900 and 1950, the country's population almost doubled from 5.1 to 10 million. From 1950 to 2000, the population further increased, to 15.9\u00a0million.\nThe fertility rate in the Netherlands is 1.78 children per woman (2018 estimate), which is high compared with many other European countries, but below the rate of 2.1 children per woman required for natural population replacement. The Netherlands has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 42.7 years. Life expectancy is high in the Netherlands: 84.3 years for newborn girls and 79.7 for boys (2020 estimate). The Dutch are the tallest people in the world, by nationality, with an average height of for men and for women in 2009. The average height of young men in the Netherlands increased from 5 feet, 4 inches to approximately 6 feet between the 1850s until the early 2000s.\nThe country has a migration rate of 1.9 migrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year. The majority of the population of the Netherlands is ethnically Dutch. In 2022, the population was 74.8% ethnically Dutch, 8.3% other European, 2.4% Turkish, 2.4% Moroccan, 2.0% Indonesian, 2.0% Surinamese, and 8.1% others. Some 150,000 to 200,000 people living in the Netherlands are expatriates, mostly concentrated in and around Amsterdam and The Hague, now constituting almost 10% of the population of these cities. Significant minorities in the country include Frisians 700,000, Jews 41,000-45,000 and the Roma and the Sinti 40,000.\nAccording to Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1.8 million foreign-born residents in the Netherlands, corresponding to 11.1% of the total population. Of these, 1.4 million (8.5%) were born outside the EU and 0.43 million (2.6%) were born in another EU Member State. In 2022, there were 4.4 million residents in the Netherlands with at least one foreign-born parent. Over half the young people in Amsterdam and Rotterdam have a non-western background, as of 2006. Dutch people, or descendants of Dutch people, are found in migrant communities worldwide, notably in South Africa and the United States.\nThe Randstad is the country's largest conurbation in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam in the province North Holland, Rotterdam and The Hague in the province South Holland, and Utrecht in the province Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of about 8.2\u00a0million inhabitants and is the 5th largest metropolitan area in Europe. According to Dutch Central Statistics Bureau, in 2015, 28 per cent of the Dutch population had a spendable income above 45,000 euros (which does not include spending on health care or education).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguage.\nThe official language of the Netherlands is Dutch, which is spoken by the vast majority of inhabitants. The dialects most spoken in the Netherlands are the Brabantian-Hollandic dialects.\nBesides Dutch, West Frisian is recognised as a second official language in the northern province of Friesland (\"Frysl\u00e2n\" in West Frisian). West Frisian has a formal status for government correspondence in that province. Four other languages are protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The first of these recognised regional languages is Low Saxon (\"Nedersaksisch\" in Dutch). Low Saxon consists of several dialects of the Low German language spoken in the north and east of the Netherlands, like Tweants in the region of Twente, and Drents in the province of Drenthe.\nLimburgish is recognised as a regional language. It consists of Dutch varieties of Meuse-Rhenish and is spoken in the south-eastern province of Limburg. Yiddish and the Romani language were recognised in 1996 as non-territorial languages.\nEnglish has a formal status in the special municipalities of Saba and Sint Eustatius. It is widely spoken on these islands. Papiamento has a formal status in the special municipality of Bonaire.\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of learning foreign languages, formalised in Dutch education laws. Some 90% of the total population are able to converse in English, 70% in German, and 29% in French. English is a mandatory course in all secondary schools. In most lower level secondary school educations (vmbo), one additional modern foreign language is mandatory during the first two years. In higher level secondary schools (havo and vwo), the acquisition of two additional modern foreign language skills is mandatory. Besides English, the standard modern languages are French and German, although schools can replace one of these with Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Italian, Turkish or Arabic. Additionally, schools in Friesland teach and have exams in West Frisian.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the Netherlands for more than 1,200 years, and by the middle of the sixteenth century the country was strongly Protestant (Calvinist). The population was predominantly Christian until the late 20th century. Although significant religious diversity remains, there has been a decline of religious adherence.\nIn 2020, Statistics Netherlands found that 55% of the total population declared itself non-religious. Groups that represent the non-religious in the Netherlands include Humanistisch Verbond. Catholics comprised 19.8% of the total population, Protestants 14.4%. Muslims comprised 5.2% of the total population and followers of other Christian denominations and other religions (like Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism) comprised the remaining 5.1%. A 2015 survey from another source found that Protestants outnumbered Catholics.\nThe southern provinces of North Brabant and Limburg have historically been strongly Catholic, and some residents consider the Catholic Church as a base for their cultural identity. This can be seen in for example the regional celebration of Carnival. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), a united church which is Calvinist and Lutheran in orientation. It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church. Several orthodox Calvinist and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although Christianity has become a minority in the Netherlands, there is a Bible Belt from Zeeland to the northern parts of the province Overijssel, in which orthodox Protestant beliefs remain strong. Statistically, areas of the Bible Belt also have the highest fertility rates and the youngest populations in the Netherlands. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, and the Ascension of Jesus).\nIslam is the second largest religion in the state. The Muslim population increased from the 1960 as a result of large numbers of migrant workers. This included migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco, as well as migrants from former Dutch colonies, such as Suriname and Indonesia. During the 1990s, Muslim refugees arrived from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and Afghanistan. Since 2000 there has been raised awareness of religion, mainly due to Islamic extremism.\nAnother religion practised is Hinduism, with about 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are Indo-Surinamese. There are sizeable populations of Hindu immigrants from India and Sri Lanka, and Western adherents of Hinduism-orientated new religious movements such as Hare Krishnas. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 Buddhists or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 30,000 Jews in the Netherlands, though the Institute for Jewish Policy Research estimates range from 30,000 to 63,000, depending on how the number is calculated.\nThe Constitution of the Netherlands guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Catholic and Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, (CDA, and two small parties, ChristianUnion and SGP) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost and the Ascension of Jesus).\nA survey in December 2014 concluded that for the first time there were more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands, while the remainder of the population was agnostic (31%) or ietsistic (27%). In 2015, a vast majority of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they had never been to a church. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006. The expected rise of spirituality has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006, 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual; in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.\nEducation.\nEducation in the Netherlands is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16. If a child does not have a \"starting qualification\" (HAVO, VWO or MBO 2+ degree) they are still forced to attend classes until they achieve such a qualification or reach the age of 18.\nChildren in the Netherlands attend elementary school from (on average) ages 4 to 12. It has eight grades and the first is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education.\nThe VMBO has four grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the VMBO results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education that primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The HAVO has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are universities of professional education (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. An HBO degree gives access to the university system. The VWO (comprising atheneum and gymnasium) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two-year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a doctoral degree programme.\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the EU, and 15,000 euros for non-EU students.\nHealthcare.\nIn 2016, the Netherlands maintained its position at the top of the annual Euro Health Consumer Index (EHCI), which compares healthcare systems in Europe, scoring 916 of a maximum 1,000 points. The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.\nThe Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the health care systems of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.\nAccording to the Health Consumer Powerhouse (HCP), patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare. Healthcare decisions are made in dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals. Healthcare in the Netherlands is split 3 ways: in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (\"huisartsen\", comparable to general practitioners) form the largest part of the first level. Being referred by a member of the first level is mandatory for access to the second and third level. The health care system is, in comparison to other Western countries, effective but not the most cost-effective.\nHealthcare is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses. Other sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to buy their own basic healthcare insurance, except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents. Insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments. This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over 18, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it is illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac135 per month.\nTransport.\nMobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year, three quarters of which are done by car. Around half of all trips in the Netherlands are made by car, 25% by bicycle, 20% walking, and 5% by public transport.\nRoad transport.\nThe Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world. The Netherlands has a relatively high uptake of electric vehicles, as the government implemented ambitious policy on both charging infrastructure and tax benefits. As of 2019, the Netherlands hosts approximately 30% of all recharging stations in the European Union. Moreover, newly sold cars in the Netherlands have on average the lowest CO2 emissions in the EU.\nPublic transport.\nAbout 13% of all distance is travelled by public transport, the majority of which is by train. The Dutch rail network of route is also rather dense. The network is mostly focused on passenger rail services and connects all major cities, with over 400 stations. Trains are frequent, with two trains per hour on lesser lines, two to four trains per hour on average, and up to eight trains an hour on the busiest lines. The Dutch national train network includes the HSL-Zuid, a high-speed line between the Amsterdam metropolitan area and the Belgian border for trains running from Paris and London, to the Netherlands.\nCycling.\nCycling is a ubiquitous mode of transport. Almost as many kilometres are covered by bicycle as by train. The Dutch are estimated to have at least 18 million bicycles, which makes more than one per capita, and twice as many as the circa 9 million motor vehicles on the road. In 2013, the European Cyclists' Federation ranked the Netherlands and Denmark as the most bike-friendly countries in Europe. Cycling infrastructure is extensive. Busy roads have received some 35,000\u00a0km of dedicated cycle tracks, physically segregated from motorised traffic. Busy junctions are often equipped with bicycle-specific traffic lights. There are large bicycle parking facilities, particularly in city centres and train stations.\nWater transport.\nThe Port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe and the largest port outside East Asia, the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream. As of 2022[ [update]], Rotterdam was the world's tenth largest container port. The port's main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment. The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the European continent and overseas. The Volkeraksluizen between Rotterdam and Antwerp are the biggest sluices for inland navigation in terms of tonnage. In 2007, the Betuweroute, a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed. Amsterdam is Europe's 4th largest port. The inland shipping fleet of the Netherlands is the largest in Europe. Passenger boats in the Netherlands includes a ferry network in Amsterdam, and waterbusses and taxis in Rotterdam.\nAir transport.\nSchiphol Airport, just southwest of Amsterdam, is the main international airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest airport in Europe by number of passengers. Schiphol is the main hub for KLM, the nation's flag carrier and the world's oldest airline. In 2016, the Royal Schiphol Group airports handled 70 million passengers. All air traffic is international and Schiphol Airport is connected to over 300 destinations worldwide, more than any other European airport. The airport is a major freight hub as well, processing 1.44 million tonnes of cargo in 2020. Smaller international airports are in or near Eindhoven, Rotterdam, Maastricht and Groningen. Air transport is of vital significance for the Caribbean part of the Netherlands, all islands having their own airports. This includes the shortest runway in the world on Saba.\nCulture.\nArt, architecture and philosophy.\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters. In the Middle Ages Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder were leading Dutch pioneers. During the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch Republic was prosperous and witnessed a flourishing artistic movement. The \"Dutch Masters\", spanning this 17th century era, included Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, and Jacob van Ruisdael. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century included Vincent van Gogh and Piet Mondrian.\nLiterature flourished during the Dutch Golden Age, Joost van den Vondel and P. C. Hooft being the most famous writers. In the 19th century, Multatuli wrote Max Havelaar, a book about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch East Indies. \"Diary of a Young Girl\" by Anne Frank is the most translated book from Dutch. Other important 20th century authors include Harry Mulisch, Jan Wolkers, Hella Haasse, Willem Frederik Hermans, Cees Nooteboom and Gerard Reve.\nVarious architectural styles can be distinguished in the Netherlands. The Romanesque architecture was built between 950 and 1250. Gothic architecture was used from about 1230. Gothic buildings had large windows, pointed arches and were richly decorated. Brabantine Gothic originated with the rise of the Duchy of Brabant and spread throughout the Burgundian provinces. Dutch Baroque architecture (1525\u20131630) and classicism (1630\u20131700) is especially evident in the west. Other architectural styles are Art Nouveau, Expressionism, De Stijl, Traditionalism and Brutalism.\nErasmus and Spinoza were famous Dutch philosophers. The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629\u201395) discovered Saturn's moon Titan, argued that light travelled as waves, invented the pendulum clock, and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms with a microscope.\nWindmills, tulips, clogs, cheese, and cannabis have grown to symbolize the Netherlands, especially among tourists.\nDutch value system.\nThe Dutch are proud of their cultural heritage, rich history in art, and involvement in international affairs. A predominant attitude in the Netherlands is to think of the nation as being \"both tolerant and cosmopolitan.\"\nA Dutch saying indicating their sense of national pride in their reclamation of land from the sea and marshes is \"God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands.\"\nDutch manners are open and direct with a no-nonsense attitude\u2014informality combined with adherence to basic behaviour. \"Dealing with the Dutch\" by Jacob Vossestein states: \"Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status.\"\nThe Netherlands is one of the most secular countries in Europe. Religion in the Netherlands is generally considered a personal matter which is not supposed to be propagated in public, although it often remains a discussion subject.\nMusic.\nThe Netherlands has multiple music traditions. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"Levenslied\", meaning \"Song of life\". These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of verses and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include love, death and loneliness. Traditional musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists use synthesisers and guitars.\nContemporary Dutch rock and pop music (Nederpop) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the United States and Britain. Bands such as Shocking Blue, Golden Earring, Tee Set, George Baker Selection and Focus enjoyed international success. From the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band Doe Maar.\nCurrent symphonic metal bands Epica, Delain, ReVamp, The Gathering, Asrai, Autumn, Ayreon and Within Temptation as well as jazz and pop singer Caro Emerald are having international success. Metal bands like Hail of Bullets, God Dethroned, Izegrim, Asphyx, Textures, Heidevolk, and Slechtvalk are popular guests at the biggest metal festivals in Europe. Contemporary local stars include pop singer Anouk, country pop singer Ilse DeLange, Limburgish dialect singing folk band Rowwen H\u00e8ze, rock band BL\u00d8F and duo Nick &amp; Simon.\nEarly 1990s Dutch and Belgian house music came together in Eurodance project 2 Unlimited. Selling 18 million records, the two singers in the band are the most successful Dutch music artists to this day. Tracks like \"Get Ready for This\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events. In the mid-1990s Dutch language rap and hip hop (\"Nederhop\") came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nSince the 1990s, Dutch electronic dance music (EDM) gained widespread popularity in the world in many forms. Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including Armin van Buuren, Ti\u00ebsto, Hardwell, Martin Garrix, Dash Berlin, Julian Jordan, Nicky Romero, W&amp;W, Don Diablo, Ummet Ozcan, Headhunterz, Sander van Doorn, and Afrojack; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by DJ Mag Top 100 DJs. The Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet. The Netherlands has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since its first edition in 1956, and has won five times.\nIn classical music, Jan Sweelinck is a famous Dutch composer; Louis Andriessen is among the best-known contemporary Dutch classical composers. Ton Koopman is a Dutch conductor, organist, and harpsichordist. Notable violinists are Janine Jansen and Andr\u00e9 Rieu.\nFilm and television.\nSome Dutch films \u2013 mainly by director Paul Verhoeven \u2013 have received international distribution and recognition, such as \"Turkish Delight\" (\"\"Turks Fruit\", 1973), \"Soldier of Orange\" (\"Soldaat van Oranje\", 1977), \"Spetters\" (1980), and \"The Fourth Man\" (\"De Vierde Man\", 1983). Verhoeven then went on to direct big Hollywood movies like \"RoboCop\" (1987), \"Total Recall\" (1990), and \"Basic Instinct\" (1992), and returned with Dutch film \"Black Book\" (\"Zwartboek\"\", 2006).\nOther well-known Dutch film directors are Jan de Bont, Anton Corbijn, Dick Maas, Fons Rademakers, and documentary makers Bert Haanstra and Joris Ivens. Film director Theo van Gogh achieved international notoriety in 2004 when he was murdered by Mohammed Bouyeri in the streets of Amsterdam after directing the short film \"Submission\".\nDirectors of photography from the Netherlands include Hoyte van Hoytema and Theo van de Sande. Internationally successful Dutch actors include Famke Janssen, Carice van Houten, Rutger Hauer, and Jeroen Krabb\u00e9.\nThe Netherlands has a well developed television market, with commercial and public broadcasters. Imported TV programmes, as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language, are virtually always shown with the original sound and subtitled. Only foreign shows for children are dubbed.\nTV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises, most notably was the internationally active TV production conglomerate Endemol, founded by Dutch media tycoons John de Mol and Joop van den Ende. Endemol and its subsidiaries created and ran reality, talent, and game show franchises worldwide, including \"Big Brother\" and \"Deal or No Deal\". Endemol merged with Shine Group in 2015, and again with Banijay in 2020.\nSports.\nApproximately 4.5 million of the 16.8 million people in the Netherlands are registered in one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country. About two-thirds of the population between 15 and 75 participate in sports weekly. Football is the most popular team sport, followed by field hockey and volleyball. Tennis, gymnastics and golf are the three most widely engaged in individual sports. Organisation of sports began at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established, rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912.\nThe national football team was runner-up in the World Cup of 1974, 1978, and 2010, and won the European Championship of 1988. Of SI's 50 greatest footballers of all time, Johan Cruyff (#5), Marco van Basten (#19), Ruud Gullit (#25), and Johan Neeskens (#36) are Dutch. The women's national team was runner-up in 2019 World Cup and won the European Championship of 2017. The Netherlands women's field hockey team won 9 out of 15 World Cups. The Netherlands baseball team have won the European championship 24 times out of 33 events. The volleyball national women's team won the European Championship in 1995 and the World Grand Prix in 2007.\nThe Netherlands has won 266 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and 110 at the Winter Olympic Games. Joop Zoetemelk won the 1979 Vuelta a Espana, the 1980 Tour de France, and the 1985 UCI World Championship. Jan Janssen won the 1968 Tour de France, Tom Dumoulin the 2017 Giro d'Italia. Max Verstappen, the youngest Formula 1 driver to make his debut and to win a race, was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix and a Formula One World Drivers Championship. Dutch K-1 kickboxers have won the K-1 World Grand Prix 15 times out of 19 tournaments.\nCuisine.\nDutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings; cereal is an option. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, meat, and vegetables. The Dutch diet was high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. During the twentieth century, this diet changed and became more cosmopolitan, most global cuisines being represented in the major cities. In early 2014, Oxfam ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food. Modern culinary writers distinguish between three regional forms of Dutch cuisine: northeast, west and south:\nThe regions in the northeast are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late 18th century introduction of large scale agriculture means the cuisine is known for its meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and husbandry, though dishes near the coastal regions include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the metworst-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region. Smoked sausages are common, of which (\"Gelderse\") \"rookworst\" is the most renowned. Larger sausages are eaten alongside \"stamppot\", \"hutspot,\" or \"zuurkool\" (sauerkraut); whereas smaller ones are eaten as a street food. The provinces are home to hard textured rye bread, pastries and cookies. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. Cookies are produced in great number and contain a lot of butter and sugar. The traditional alcoholic beverages are beer (strong pale lager) and \"Jenever\", a high proof juniper-flavoured spirit, that came to be known in England as gin. An exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, \"Advocaat\", a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is native to this region.\nIn the west, the abundance of water and flat grasslands, mean the area is known for its dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as Gouda, Leyden (spiced cheese with cumin), and Edam (traditionally in small spheres) as well as Leerdammer and Beemster, while the adjacent Zaanstreek in North Holland has since the 16th century been known for its mayonnaise and typical whole-grain mustards. A by-product of the butter-making process, \"karnemelk\" (buttermilk), is considered typical for this region. Seafood such as soused herring, mussels, eels, oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region.\nThe southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium. It is renowned for its rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the \"Vlaai\" from Limburg and the \"Moorkop\" and \"Bossche bol\" from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries abound, the (a roll with a sausage of ground beef, literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The alcoholic beverage of the region is beer, there are many local brands, ranging from \"Trappist\" to \"Kriek\".\nCheeses.\nThe Netherlands is well known for its cheese production, with internationally recognised varieties, such as Gouda, Edam, and Leyden. Traditional cheese markets are still held in towns like Alkmaar, Gouda, and Edam.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nGovernment\nTravel"}
{"id": "21149", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21149", "title": "N.W.A", "text": "American hip hop group\nN.W.A (an abbreviation for Niggaz Wit Attitudes) was an American hip-hop group formed in Compton, California, in 1987. Among the earliest and most significant figures of the gangsta rap subgenre, the group is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential acts in hip hop music.\nActive from 1987 to 1991, N.W.A endured controversy owing to their music's explicit lyrics, which some viewed as misogynistic or homophobic, as well as to its glorification of drugs and crime. The group was subsequently banned from many mainstream American radio stations. In spite of this, they have sold over ten million units in the United States alone. Drawing on its members' own stories of racism and excessive policing, N.W.A made inherently political music. N.W.A's consistent accusations of institutional racism within the American police significantly contributed to the political awareness and involvement of American youth against racism.\nThe original lineup, formed in early 1987, consisted of Arabian Prince, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube, with DJ Yella joining shortly and MC Ren recruited as the sixth member of the group in mid-1988. Their first release was the compilation/split album, \"N.W.A. and the Posse\" (1987), which peaked at No. 39 on \"Billboard\" magazine's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and it was followed by their debut studio album \"Straight Outta Compton\" (1989). Arabian Prince left N.W.A. in October 1988, about three months before the release of \"Straight Outta Compton\", with Ice Cube following suit in December of the following year. The group continued on as a four-piece, with no replacements for Arabian Prince and Ice Cube, and disbanded shortly after the release of their second album \"Niggaz4Life\" (1991).\nEazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and Dr. Dre later became Platinum-selling solo artists in their own right in the 1990s. Eazy-E died from AIDS on March 26, 1995. The surviving members of N.W.A have continued to occasionally work together since Eazy-E's death, including a reunion of the \"Straight Outta Compton\" lineup (sans Eazy-E and Arabian Prince) from 1999 to 2001, during which a third album was in the works but abandoned due to issues with the rights to the N.W.A name.\nThe group's debut album marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era, as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre. \"Niggaz4Life\" was the first hardcore rap album to reach number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 sales charts. In general, N.W.A had a lasting impact on generations of hip-hop artists and, in the late 1980s, played a crucial role in shaping rap as it evolved in the subsequent generations, both musically and lyrically. Moreover, the group was credited with being the first to open up rap to a white American audience, contributing to the rapid spread of rap within the American population in general, starting from the late 1980s.\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked N.W.A at number 83 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In 2016, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, following three previous nominations. In 2024 they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\nHistory.\nFormation and \"Panic Zone\" (1987\u20131988).\nN.W.A was assembled by Compton-based Eazy-E, who co-founded Ruthless Records with Jerry Heller. Eazy-E sought an introduction to Steve Yano. Although Yano initially rebuffed him, he was impressed by Eazy-E's persistence, and arranged a meeting with Dr. Dre. Initially, N.W.A consisted of Eazy-E and Dr. Dre. Together with fellow producer Arabian Prince, Ice Cube was added to the roster after he had started out as a rapper for the group C.I.A. Dre later brought DJ Yella on board as well.\nDre and Yella were both formerly members of the World Class Wreckin' Cru as DJs and producers. Ruthless released the single \"Panic Zone\" in 1987 with Macola Records, which was later included on the compilation album \"N.W.A. and the Posse\". N.W.A was still in its developing stages, and is only credited on three of the eleven tracks, notably the uncharacteristic record \"Panic Zone\", \"8-Ball\", and \"Dopeman\", which marked the first collaboration of Arabian Prince, DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube. Mexican rapper Krazy-Dee co-wrote \"Panic Zone\", which was originally called \"Hispanic Zone\", but the title was later changed when Dr. Dre advised Krazy-Dee that the word \"hispanic\" would hinder sales. Also included was Eazy-E's solo track \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\".\n\"Eazy-Duz-It\" and \"Straight Outta Compton\" (1988\u20131989).\nN.W.A released their debut studio album, \"Straight Outta Compton\", in January 1989. With its famous opening salvo of three tracks, the group reflected the rising anger of the urban youth. The opening song \"Straight Outta Compton\" introduced the group, \"Fuck tha Police\" protested police brutality and racial profiling, and \"Gangsta Gangsta\" painted the worldview of the inner-city youth. While the group was later credited with pioneering the burgeoning subgenre of gangsta rap, N.W.A referred to their music as \"reality rap\".\nTwenty-six years later, member and co-producer of the \"Straight Outta Compton\" film, Ice Cube, commented \"they were talking about what really led into the style that we ended up doing, which is now called hardcore gangster rap.\" Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, as HighPowered Productions, composed the beats for each song, with Dre making occasional rapping appearances. The D.O.C., Ice Cube, and MC Ren wrote most of the group's lyrics, including \"Fuck tha Police\", perhaps the group's most notorious song, which brought them into conflict with various law enforcement agencies. Under pressure from Focus on the Family, Milt Ahlerich, an assistant director of the FBI sent a letter to Ruthless and its distributing company Priority Records, advising the rappers that \"advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.\" This letter can still be seen at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Policemen refused to provide security for the group's concerts, hurting their plans to tour. Nonetheless, the FBI's letter only served to draw more publicity to the group.\n\"Straight Outta Compton\" was also one of the first albums to adhere to the new Parental Advisory label scheme, then still in its early stages: the label at the time consisted of \"WARNING: Moderate impact coarse language and/or themes\" only. However, the taboo nature of N.W.A's music was the most important factor of its mass appeal. Media coverage compensated for the group's lack of airplay, and its album eventually went double platinum. Two months before \"Straight Outta Compton\", Eazy-E's solo debut \"Eazy-Duz-It\" was released. The album was dominated by Eazy's persona (MC Ren was the only guest rapper) but behind the scenes it was a group effort.\nMusic was handled by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella; the lyrics were largely written by MC Ren, with contributions from Ice Cube and The D.O.C. The album was another double platinum success for Ruthless (in addition to girl group J.J. Fad in 1988 and singer Michel'le in 1989). 1989 saw the reissue of \"N.W.A and the Posse\" on CD, and the release of The D.O.C.'s \"No One Can Do It Better\". His album was essentially a collaboration with Dr. Dre and notably free of \"gangsta rap\" content, including the N.W.A posse cut \"The Grand Final\u00e9\". It became another No. 1 album for the record label.\n\"100 Miles and Runnin\"' and \"Niggaz4Life\" (1989\u20131991).\nIce Cube left the group in December 1989 over royalty disputes; having written almost half of the lyrics on \"Straight Outta Compton\" himself, he felt he was not getting a fair share of the profits. A lawsuit brought by Ice Cube against band manager Jerry Heller was settled out of court. He wasted little time putting together his solo debut, 1990's \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\", but he avoided mentioning his former label mates. N.W.A's title track from their 1990 EP \"100 Miles and Runnin\"', however, included a diss towards Cube:\n\"We started with five, but yo / One couldn't take it\u2014So now it's four / Cuz the fifth couldn't make it.\" The video for the song depicted the remaining members of N.W.A together in a jail cell, while an Ice Cube look-alike is released.\nAlso heard on the EP (which found its way on the \"Efil4zaggin\" album) was \"Real Niggaz\", a full-blown diss to Ice Cube where the remaining members accuse him of cowardice, and question his authenticity, longevity and originality: \"How the fuck you think a rapper lasts / With your ass sayin' shit that was said in the past / Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy / Get off the dick, you motherfuckin' carbon-copy\", and \"We started out with too much cargo / So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold, yo.\"\nThe song \"100 Miles and Runnin'\" was Dr. Dre's final uptempo recording, which had been a common feature of late 1980s hip hop. After this, he focused on a midtempo, synthesizer based sound which became known as G-funk, starting with \"Alwayz Into Somethin'\" from \"Efil4zaggin\" in 1991. The G-funk style dominated both the West and East Coast hip hop music scene for several years to come.\nN.W.A is referenced on Ice Cube's 1990 EP, \"Kill at Will\", where he name-checks his former group (likely in a mocking manner) on the song \"Jackin' For Beats\". On \"I Gotta Say What Up!!!\", Ice Cube gives shout-outs to his rap peers at the time, among them Public Enemy, Geto Boys, and Sir Jinx. At the end of the track, in what appears to be an on-the-phone interview, Ice Cube is asked, \"Since you went solo, what's up with the rest of the crew?\" and the phone is abruptly hung up on the interviewer.\nThe group's second full-length release, 1991's \"Efil4zaggin\" (\"Niggaz4Life\" spelled backwards), re-established the band in the face of Ice Cube's continued solo success. The album is considered by many Dr. Dre's finest production work, and it heralded the beginning of the G-Funk era. It also showed a clear animosity towards their former member, and derogatory references to Ice Cube are found in several songs. The interlude \"A Message to B.A.\" echoes the beginning of his song \"Turn Off the Radio\" from \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\": Ice Cube is first addressed by the name Benedict Arnold (after the infamous traitor of the American Revolution) but then named outright in a torrent of abuse from both the group and its fans: \"When we see yo' ass, we gon' cut yo' hair off and fuck you with a broomstick\" spoken by MC Ren.\nThe N.W.A\u2013Ice Cube feud eventually escalated, both on record and in real life. \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\" had avoided direct attacks on N.W.A, but on \"Death Certificate\", Ice Cube's second full-length release, he retaliated. He sampled and mocked the \"Message to B.A.\" skit before embarking on a full-blown tirade, the infamous \"No Vaseline\". In a series of verses, Ice Cube verbally assaulted the group: \"You lookin' like straight bozos / I saw it comin' that's why I went solo / Kept on stompin' / When y'all Muthafuckas moved Straight outta Compton / You got jealous when I got my own company / But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humpin' me.\"\nHe also responded to members MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Eazy-E individually to \"100 Miles and Runnin'\", claiming \"I started off with too much cargo / Dropped four niggaz and now I'm makin' all the dough\", using homophobic metaphors to describe their unequal business relationship with Jerry Heller, who became the target of harsh insults:\n\"Get rid of that devil real simple / Put a bullet in his temple / Cuz you can't be the 'Niggaz 4 Life' crew / With a white Jew tellin' you what to do.\" The song attracted controversy for its antisemitism (the beginning of such accusations against Ice Cube during his affiliation with the Nation of Islam), based on the bashing of Heller's religion.\nThe track was omitted from the UK release, and later pressings included a censored version of the song. In September 1990, members of hip hop act Above the Law clashed with Ice Cube and his posse Da Lench Mob during the annual New Music Seminar conference, forcing the latter to flee the premises of Times Square's Marriott Marquis, the venue of the event. On January 27, 1991, Dr. Dre assaulted Dee Barnes, host of the hip hop show \"Pump It Up\", after its coverage of the N.W.A/Ice Cube beef. According to \"Rolling Stone\" reporter Alan Light:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He picked her up and \"began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway\" as his bodyguard held off the crowd. After Dre tried to throw her down the stairs and failed, he began kicking her in the ribs and hands. She escaped and ran into the women's rest room. Dre followed her and \"grabbed her from behind by the hair and proceeded to punch her in the back of the head.\"\nIn response, Dre commented: \"People talk all this shit, but you know, if somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Ain't nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain't no big thing\u2014I just threw her through a door.\"\nThe end of N.W.A and death of Eazy-E (1991\u20131999).\n1991's \"Niggaz4Life\" was the group's final album. After Dr. Dre, The D.O.C. and Michel'le departed from Ruthless to join Death Row Records and allegations over Eazy-E being coerced into signing away their contracts (while however retaining a portion of their publishing rights), a bitter rivalry ensued. Dr. Dre began the exchange in 1992 with Death Row's first release, \"Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')\", and its accompanying video featured a character named \"Sleazy-E\" (played by actor A.J. Johnson) who ran around desperately trying to get money. The insults continued on \"The Chronic\" with \"Bitches Ain't Shit\". Eazy-E responded in 1993 with the EP \"It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa\" on the tracks \"Real Muthaphuckkin G's\" and \"It's On\".\nEazy-E accused Dr. Dre of being a homosexual, calling him a \"she thang\", and criticizing Dre's new image by calling him and Snoop \"studio gangsters\". The music video for \"Real Muthaphuckkin G's\" showed a still of Dre wearing make-up and a sequined jumpsuit. The photos dated back to Dr. Dre's World Class Wreckin' Cru days, when such fashion was common among West Coast electro hop artists, prior to N.W.A's popularization of gangsta rap. Eazy-E kept dissing Dre and Death Row on most of his songs until his AIDS-related death on March 26, 1995.\nDespite continuing to work together after the N.W.A split, MC Ren voiced his strong criticism for Eazy-E in 1994, calling the latter a \"big-head\" and \"wannabe mega-star\", and even suggesting that N.W.A should reunite without him. MC Ren later said that the only relationship he had with Eazy-E was through Ruthless Records, where he released the platinum-selling EP \"Kizz My Black Azz\" (1992) and the album \"Shock of the Hour\" (1993). Eazy-E and MC Ren ended their feud shortly before the former's death in their 1995 duet '\"Tha Muthaphukkin' Real\" after two years of not talking to each other. All bad blood finally ceased within the rest of the group. Dr. Dre, MC Ren and Ice Cube later expressed their re-evaluated feelings to their old friend on 1998's \"Ruthless for Life\", 1999's \"What's the Difference\" and \"Chin Check\", 2000's \"Hello\", 2006's \"Growin' Up\", and in the 2011 music video \"I Need a Doctor\". DJ Yella was reportedly the only member of N.W.A who got along so well with Eazy-E that he dedicated his 1996 album \"One Mo Nigga ta Go\" to him.\nReunion of N.W.A, aborted third album and aftermath (1999\u2013present).\nHaving both parted with Ruthless Records on bad terms, tensions between Ice Cube and Dr. Dre eventually eased on their own. After Ice Cube made a cameo appearance in Dr. Dre's \"Let Me Ride\" video in 1993, the two recorded the hit song \"Natural Born Killaz\" for Snoop Dogg's 1994 short film and soundtrack \"Murder Was the Case\". Ice Cube also later appeared on MC Ren's album \"Ruthless for Life\" on the track \"Comin' After You\". MC Ren appeared on Dre's 1999 album \"2001\", and the three remaining N.W.A emcees reunited for \"Hello\" on Ice Cube's 2000 album \"War &amp; Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)\", and the song \"Chin Check\" in 1999 for the \"Next Friday\" soundtrack, a movie starring Ice Cube.\nThe West Coast and \"gangsta\" music scene had however fallen out of the spotlight since the death of Tupac Shakur in 1996, and it was only after Dr. Dre's successful patronage of Eminem and Dre's ensuing comeback album \"2001\" that the genre and its artists regained the national spotlight. 2000's all-star Up In Smoke Tour reunited much of the N.W.A and Death Row families, and during time spent on the road, Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, featured special guest Snoop Dogg and Eminem began recording in a mobile studio. A comeback album entitled \"Not These Niggaz Again\" was planned (and included DJ Yella, who had not been present on the tour).\nHowever, due to busy and conflicting schedules as well as the obstacles of coordinating three different record labels (Priority, No Limit and Interscope), obtaining the rights to the name N.W.A and endorsing the whole project to gain exclusive rights, the album never materialized. Only two tracks from these sessions were released: the aforementioned \"Chin Check\" (with Snoop Dogg as a member of N.W.A) from 2000's \"Next Friday\" soundtrack and \"Hello\" from Ice Cube's 2000 album \"War &amp; Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)\". Both songs also appeared on N.W.A's remastered \"Greatest Hits\". There were also partial reunions on other projects, notably \"Set It Off\", from Snoop Dogg's \"Tha Last Meal\" (2000), which featured MC Ren and Ice Cube, and The D.O.C.'s \"The Shit\", from his 2003 album \"Deuce\", featuring MC Ren, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg and Six-Two. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella were present in the studio for the latter song.\nIn addition to the \"Greatest Hits\" initially released by Priority in 1996, Capitol and Ruthless Records jointly released ' in 1999, a compilation that contained songs by other rap artists and only three songs from the actual group but various solo tracks from the five members. The success of the album prompted a second volume, \"The N.W.A Legacy, Vol. 2\", three years later. It emulated the format of its predecessor, containing only three genuine N.W.A tracks and many solo efforts by the crew members. In 2007, a new greatest hits package was released, entitled '.\nIn 2014, Ice Cube appeared on MC Ren's remix for \"Rebel Music\". This was the first time the duo had worked together since the N.W.A reunion in 2000.\nOn June 27, 2015, MC Ren and DJ Yella joined Ice Cube during his solo set as part of the BET Experience show at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. This marked the first reunion performance of the group (minus Dr. Dre) in 15 years. Following a 27-year hiatus, the group reunited with surviving members Ice Cube, MC Ren, Dr. Dre and DJ Yella taking the stage during the second weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2016, just days following the group's Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame induction.\nLegacy.\nMusical legacy.\nAlthough the group disbanded in 1991, it remains one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop groups, leaving a lasting legacy on hip hop music in the following decades. Its influence, from the use of funky, bass-driven beats to its exaggerated lyrics, was evident throughout the 1990s and even into the present, and is often credited as bridging the white/black American musical lines with its appeal to white Americans in the late 1980s. The group's influence, impact and initial rejection by critics and cultural elites was compared to the Sex Pistols for rock.\nThe first album of the group, \"Straight Outta Compton\", has been described by Gerrick D. Kennedy as one of the loudest \"big bangs\" in hip-hop music and \"a sonic Molotov cocktail that ignited a firestorm when it debuted in the summer of 1988\". In 2017, \"Straight Outta Compton\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, who deemed it to be \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nThey were influential in appearance of West and East Coast hip hop genres and artists, as well in development of alternative and nu metal acts such as System of a Down, Slipknot and Korn.\nPolitical legacy.\nN.W.A were among the first to popularize political speech within rap.\nDespite significant controversies regarding misogyny or homophobia in the lyrics of certain songs, the group left a significant mark on American politics, and more generally, worldwide. This was notably achieved by offering a dissenting discourse in response to the state speeches during the War on Crime era. Such discourse was later adopted by numerous artists. N.W.A's repeated attacks against the institutional racism of the American police, particularly with the song \"Fuck tha Police\", played a crucial role in the politicization of African-American youth and subsequently in the politicization of White American youth against police brutality and, more broadly, racism.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, rap was perceived by American political elites as an \"existential threat\" to the United States social order. According to researcher Bryan J. McCann:The political and cultural mainstream of the 1980s regarded gangsta rap as a genuine threat to the social order rather than a playful destabilization of the period\u2019s law-and-order discourses. (...) Indeed, a seismic cultural force had emerged (...) NWA\u2019s iconic album became a popular window into black inner-city life by enacting, exaggerating, and celebrating the practices and locales at the heart of 1980s law-and-order politics. In other words, the album represented an alternative, and business-savvy, rendition of the mark of criminality.More specifically, the song \"Fuck tha Police,\" like other songs from the group, became a symbol of resistance against neoliberalism.\nLegacy among artists.\nIn Dr. Dre's 1999 single \"Forgot About Dre\", Eminem paid homage to the group, rapping \"So what do you say to somebody you hate / Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way? / Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? / Just study a tape of N.W.A\", possibly referring to the negative reception of N.W.A's works by mainstream radio, which considered the group's songs violent and thus unusable for radio.\nA scene in the music video for the 2005 single \"Hate It or Love It\" by The Game featuring 50 Cent shows Tequan Richmond and Zachary Williams (portraying a youthful Game &amp; 50 Cent respectively) being caught spraypainting \"N.W.A\" on a wall, resulting in their subsequent arrest by two policemen. The Game also has a tattoo that says \"N.W.A\" on the right side of his chest.\nBiopic.\nNew Line Cinema representatives announced to \"Entertainment Weekly's\" \"Hollywood Insider Blog\" that N.W.A's story was in development to become a feature film for theatrical release in 2012. However, it was delayed to sometime in 2014. The script was researched and written by filmmaker S. Leigh Savidge and radio veteran Alan Wenkus, who worked closely with Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright. Ice Cube and Dr. Dre act as producers of the film. In September 2011, John Singleton was selected as director. Ice Cube and Singleton previously collaborated on \"Boyz n the Hood\", a movie that was nominated for an Academy Award, and Ice Cube also played the part of the character \"Fudge\" in Singleton's \"Higher Learning\".\nCasting calls began in the summer of 2010. There were rumors of Lil Eazy-E playing his late father Eazy-E, and Ice Cube's son and fellow rapper O'Shea Jackson Jr. playing his father as well. Ice Cube stated of the movie, \"We're taking it to the nooks and crannies, I think deeper than any other article or documentary on the group,\" he said. \"These are the intimate conversations that helped forge N.W.A. To me, I think it's interesting to anybody who loves that era and I don't know any other movie where you can mix Gangster Rap, the F.B.I., L.A. riots, HIV, and fucking feuding with each other. This movie has everything from Darryl Gates and the battering ram.\"\nIn August 2012, F. Gary Gray was selected as director rather than Singleton. The film, named \"Straight Outta Compton\", had been picked up by Universal Pictures who hired Jonathan Herman in December 2013 to draft a new script and brought in Will Packer to executive produce. On February 21, 2014, director F. Gary Gray announced a March 9, 2014 open casting call for the film via his Twitter account. There were also open casting calls in Atlanta and Chicago. Rapper YG auditioned to play MC Ren in the film. The project was scheduled to start filming in April 2014 but was pushed backed due to casting delays.\nOn June 18, 2014, Universal announced that the N.W.A biopic \"Straight Outta Compton\" would be released August 14, 2015. Ice Cube's son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., plays a younger version of his father in the movie, while Jason Mitchell plays Eazy-E, Corey Hawkins plays Dr. Dre, Aldis Hodge plays MC Ren, and Neil Brown Jr. plays DJ Yella. In early July 2014, casting directors for the N.W.A biopic issued a casting call for extras and vintage cars in the Los Angeles area for scenes in the movie. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $200 million worldwide.\nAwards.\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked N.W.A at number 83 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In 2016, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, following three previous nominations.\n\"Straight Outta Compton\" was the first rap album ever to gain five stars from Rolling Stone at initial review, it placed 70th among the magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in its 2020 revised list.\"\" \"Time\", in 2006, named it one of the 100 greatest albums of all time. \"Vibe\" appraised it as one of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. In 2012, \"Slant Magazine\" listed it 18th among the \"Best Albums of the 1980s\". In any case, in November 2016, \"Straight Outta Compton\" became the first rap album inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nExtended plays\nCompilation albums\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The unit is alternatively called nyble, nybl, half-byte or tetrade. In networking or telecommunications, the unit is often called a semi-octet, quadbit, or quartet.\nAs a nibble can represent sixteen (24) possible values, a nibble value is often shown as a hexadecimal digit (hex digit). A byte is two nibbles, and therefore, a value can be shown as two hex digits.\nFour-bit computers use nibble-sized data for storage and operations; as the word unit. Such computers were used in early microprocessors, pocket calculators and pocket computers. They continue to be used in some microcontrollers. In this context, 4-bit groups were sometimes also called characters rather than nibbles.\nHistory.\nThe term \"nibble\" originates from its representing half a byte, with \"byte\" a homophone of the English word \"bite\".\nAround 1958, David B. Benson might have originated the term. As a professor emeritus at Washington State University in a 2014 interview, he recalled that he playfully used (and might have possibly coined) the term \"nibble\" as half a byte and unit of storage required to hold a binary-coded decimal (BCD) digit when talking to a programmer from Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory at that time.\nIn 1977, an early use of the spelling \"nybble\" for the term was recorded within the consumer-banking technology group at Citibank. It created a pre-ISO 8583 standard for transactional messages between cash machines and Citibank's data centers that used the basic data unit \"nabble\".\nIn the early 1980s, the alternative spelling \"nybble\" reflected the spelling of \"byte\", as noted in editorials of \"Kilobaud\" and \"Byte\".\nUsage.\n\"Nibble\" is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in packed decimal format (BCD) within an IBM mainframe. This technique is used to make computations faster and debugging easier. An 8-bit byte is split in half and each nibble is used to store one decimal digit. The last (rightmost) nibble of the variable is reserved for the sign. Thus a variable which can store up to nine digits would be \"packed\" into 5 bytes. Ease of debugging resulted from the numbers' being readable in a hex dump where two hex numbers are used to represent the value of a byte, as 16\u00d716 \n 28. For example, a five-byte BCD value of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 represents a decimal value of +314159265.\nHistorically, \"nybble\" was used in many cases for a group of bits greater than 4. On the Apple II, much of the disk drive control and group-coded recording was implemented in software. Writing data to a disk was done by converting 256-byte pages into sets of 5-bit (later, 6-bit) nibbles and loading disk data required the reverse. Moreover, 1982 documentation for the Integrated Woz Machine refers consistently to an \"8 bit nibble\". The term \"byte\" once had the same ambiguity and meant a set of bits but not necessarily 8, hence the distinction of \"bytes\" and \"octets\" or of \"nibbles\" and \"quartets\" (or \"quadbits\"). Today, the terms \"byte\" and \"nibble\" almost always refer to 8-bit and 4-bit collections, respectively, and are very rarely used to express any other sizes.\nValue representation.\nA nibble-sized value can be represented in different numeric bases:\nLow and high nibbles.\nThe low and high nibbles of a byte are its two halves, which are the least and the most significant bits within the byte, respectively. In a graphical representation of bits within a byte, the leftmost bit could represent the most significant bit (MSB), corresponding to ordinary decimal notation in which the digit at the left of a number is the most significant. In such an illustration, the four bits on the left end of the byte form the high nibble, and the remaining four bits form the low nibble. For example,\n ninety-seven \n 9710 \n (0110 0001)2 \n 6116\nthe high nibble is 01102 (616), and the low nibble is 00012 (116). The total value is high-nibble \u00d7 1610 + low-nibble (6 \u00d7 16 + 1 \n 9710).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21151", "revid": "35256104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21151", "title": "New wave music", "text": "Music genre from the 1970s and 1980s\nNew wave is a music genre that encompasses pop-oriented styles that emerged in the mid- to late 1970s as a lighter and more melodic \"broadening of punk culture\". The term new wave initially held distinct regional differences between the United States and United Kingdom. In the US, \"new wave\" had originally been used by music critics to label New York punk bands during the early-to mid 1970s. The term was later adopted by Sire Records founder Seymour Stein, who launched the \"Don't Call It Punk\" campaign in October 1977 to replace \"punk\" with \"new wave\". In the UK, new wave was less rooted in punk and had a more diverse definition. Over time, the genre became a catch-all for several musical styles that emerged after the initial popularity of punk rock, such as synth-pop, alternative dance and post-punk.\nNew wave commercially peaked during the late 1970s into the early 1980s with an abundance of one-hit wonders. In 1981, the MTV channel was launched, which heavily promoted and popularized new-wave acts in the United States. While regional new wave scenes developed across Europe, particularly the Netherlands' ultra, Germany's Neue Deutsche Welle, Spain's La Movida Madrile\u00f1a, France, Poland and Belgium's coldwave, as well as the Yugoslav new wave. Additionally, the movement inspired subgenres such as minimal wave and darkwave.\nBy the mid- to late 1980s, new wave was overtaken in the UK by the new pop and New Romantic movement, alongside the Second British Invasion in the US, where the style later declined in popularity as other music genres gained commercial success. In the 1990s and 2000s, new wave experienced a brief revival, labelled the \"new wave of new wave\" or \"new new wave\" by the press. The genre influenced later internet microgenres such as zolo, bloghouse, new rave, chillwave, synthwave, vaporwave and devocore.\nEtymology and characteristics.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, new wave music encompassed a wide variety of pop-oriented styles that shared a quirky, lighthearted, and humorous tone. Though the term was originally coined by Seymour Stein of Sire Records as a catch-all for the various styles of music that emerged after punk rock. The phrase also alluded to the French New Wave, a 1960s film movement known for its experimental approach and departure from traditional forms.\nCommon characteristics of new wave music include a humorous or quirky pop approach, the use of electronic sounds, and a distinctive visual style in music videos and fashion. According to Simon Reynolds, new wave music had a twitchy, agitated feel. New wave musicians often played choppy rhythm guitars with angular riffs and fast tempos; keyboards, and stop-start song structures and melodies are common, with the use of jerky rhythms, and synthesizers. Reynolds noted new-wave vocalists sound high-pitched, geeky, and suburban.\nIn America, new wave became widely popularized by channels like MTV, which would play British new wave music videos because most American hit records did not have music videos to play. British videos, according to head of S-Curve Records and music producer Steve Greenberg, \"were easy to come by since they'd been a staple of UK pop music TV programs like \"Top of the Pops\" since the mid-70s.\" This rise in technology made the visual style of new wave musicians important for their success. In the early 1980s, virtually every new pop and rock act \u2013 and particularly those that employed synthesizers \u2013 were tagged as \"new wave\" in the United States, while the term was also later used to label bands in the British post-punk scene. The term has been described as so loose and wide-ranging as to be \"virtually meaningless\", according to the \"New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock\".\nA nervous, nerdy persona was a common characteristic of new wave fans, and acts such as Talking Heads, Devo, and Elvis Costello. This took the forms of robotic dancing, jittery high-pitched vocals, and clothing fashions that hid the body such as suits and big glasses. This seemed radical to audiences accustomed to post-counterculture genres such as disco dancing and macho \"cock rock\" that emphasized a \"hang loose\" philosophy, open sexuality, and sexual bravado.\nNew wave may be seen as an attempt to reconcile \"the energy and rebellious attitude of punk\" with traditional forms of pop songwriting, as seen in the rockabilly riffs and classic craftsmanship of Elvis Costello and the 1960s mod influences of the Jam. Paul Weller, who called new wave \"the pop music of the Seventies\", explained to Chas de Whalley in 1977:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's just pop music and that's why I like it. It's all about hooks and guitar riffs. That's what the new wave is all about. It's not heavy and negative like all that Iggy and New York stuff. The new wave is today's pop music for today's kids, it's as simple as that.\nAlthough new wave shares punk's do-it-yourself artistic philosophy, the musicians were more influenced by the light strains of 1960s pop while opposed to mainstream \"corporate\" rock, which they considered creatively stagnant, as well as the generally abrasive and political bents of punk rock. In the early 1980s, particularly in the United States, notable new wave acts embraced a crossover of pop and rock music with African and African-American styles. Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow, both acts with ties to former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, used Burundi-style drumming. Talking Heads' album \"Remain in Light\" was marketed and positively reviewed as a breakthrough melding of new wave and African styles, although drummer Chris Frantz said he found out about this supposed African influence after the fact. As the decade continued, new wave elements would be adopted by African-American musicians such as Grace Jones, Janet Jackson, and Prince, who in particular used new wave influences to lay the groundwork for the Minneapolis sound.\nHistory.\nForerunners.\nThe Velvet Underground have been heralded for their influence on new wave. The glam and art rock inspired style of Roxy Music and Sparks were also influential to the genre alongside the works of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Brian Eno. The work of experimental rock artists such as Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, and the Residents, underground psychedelic bands Lothar and the Hand People as well as Germany's krautrock and electronic-based kosmische musik scene, particularly the work of Kraftwerk, have been described as influencing or presaging the movement.\nThe influence of avant-garde and abstract art movements such as Dada, Cubism and the Bauhaus school would also influence the visual aesthetic and sound of new wave artists, which became contemporaneous with the development of the Memphis Design aesthetic adopted by MTV and many new wave artists during the 1980s. Additionally, Peter Ivers early output was later recognized as a precursor to new wave with Ivers contributing to the \"Eraserhead\" soundtrack and later hosting the influential show New Wave Theatre which helped popularize many early Californian new wave acts.\n1970s.\nOrigins.\nAs early as 1973, critics including Nick Kent and Dave Marsh were using the term \"new wave\" to classify New York\u2013based groups such as the Velvet Underground and New York Dolls. In the US, many of the first new wave groups were found in the early New York punk scene, with acts such as Milk 'N' Cookies, the Shirts, Mumps, Talking Heads, Mink DeVille, and Blondie who drew influences from glam, art rock, and power pop and were primarily associated with the CBGB scene. Alongside Devo and Pere Ubu who emerged out of the early Ohio punk scene, followed by Ultravox in London. Some influential bands, such as New York's Suicide and Boston's the Modern Lovers debuted even earlier, with drummer David Robinson later joining early new wave band the Cars. CBGB owner Hilly Kristal, referring to the first show by Television at his club in March 1974, said; \"I think of that as the beginning of new wave\". \nBetween 1976 and 1977, the terms \"new wave\" and \"punk\" were used somewhat interchangeably.\nMusic historian Vernon Joynson said new wave emerged in the UK in late 1976, when many bands began disassociating themselves from punk. That year, the term gained currency when it appeared in UK punk fanzines such as \"Sniffin' Glue\", and music weeklies such as \"Melody Maker\" and \"New Musical Express\". In November 1976, Caroline Coon used the term \"new wave\" to designate music by bands that were not exactly punk but were related to the punk-music scene. The mid-1970s British pub rock scene became another source of many of the most-commercially-successful new wave acts, such as Ian Dury and Nick Lowe, as well as Ireland's Boomtown Rats. \nIn the US, Sire Records chairman Seymour Stein, believing the term \"punk\" would mean poor sales for Sire's acts who had frequently played the New York club CBGB, launched a \"Don't Call It Punk\" campaign in October 1977 in order to replace the term with \"new wave\". At the time, due to the emergence of the Sex Pistols, the American media portrayed punk rock as dangerous and violent, leading to a stigma that made music \"virtually unmarketable,\" emerging groups who stemmed from the American punk scene, began to adopt \"new wave\" as a form of marketing that distanced themselves from the \"punk\" label. A 1977 Phonogram Records compilation album of the same name (\"New Wave\") includes American punk rock bands such as the Dead Boys and Ramones alongside Talking Heads and the Runaways.\n\"The New York Rocker\", which was suspicious of the term \"punk\", had been using the term \"new wave\" since December 1976 and was the first American journal to enthusiastically use the term, at first for British acts and later for acts associated with the CBGB scene. At first, most American writers used the term \"new wave\" exclusively in reference to British punk acts. The music's stripped-back style and upbeat tempos, which Stein and others viewed as a much-needed return to the energetic rush of rock and roll and 1960s rock that had dwindled in the 1970s with progressive rock and stadium spectacles, attracted them to new wave.\nIn England, the terms \"post-punk\" and \"new musick\" were popularized and coined by \"Sounds\" magazine, with music journalists Jane Suck and Jon Savage publishing editorials in the November 26, 1977 issue of \"Sounds\" entitled \"New Musick\" to describe a strain of bands that were moving passed the garage rock conventions of punk rock and incorporating wider influences. The terms \"post-punk\" and \"new wave\" were used interchangeably to describe these groups before the genres perceptibly narrowed, some artists adopted synthesizers. In London, artists such as Ultravox, Elvis Costello and Gary Numan's Tubeway Army later released influential new wave albums during this period. While punk rock wielded a major influence on the popular music scene in the UK, in the US it remained a fixture of the underground.\nBy the end of 1977, \"new wave\" had replaced \"punk\" as the term for new underground music in the UK. In early 1978, XTC released the single \"This Is Pop\" as a direct response to tags such as \"new wave\". Songwriter Andy Partridge later stated of bands such as themselves who were given those labels; \"Let's be honest about this. This is pop, what we're playing\u00a0... don't try to give it any fancy new names, or any words that you've made up, because it's blatantly just pop music. We were a new pop group. That's all.\"\nIn October 1978, the Cars released the single \"My Best Friend's Girl\" which was one of the first new wave singles to enter the Top 40 peaking at number 35 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and reaching number three in the UK. In January 1979, Blondie released \"Heart of Glass\" which became the first new wave single to reach number 1 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. This success was followed by other new wave hits including M's \"Pop Muzik\", Tubeway Army's \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\", the Police's \"Roxanne\" and \"Message in a Bottle\", Gary Numan's \"Cars\", the Knack's \"Good Girls Don't\" and the Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which not only became a hit but later made history in 1981 as the first music video played on MTV.\n1980s.\n&lt;section begin=\"overview\"/&gt;In the early 1980s, new wave gradually lost its associations with punk in popular perception among some Americans. Writing in 1989, music critic Bill Flanagan said; \"Bit by bit the last traces of Punk were drained from New Wave, as New Wave went from meaning Talking Heads to meaning the Cars to Squeeze to Duran Duran to, finally, Wham!\". Among many critics, however, new wave remained tied to the punk/new wave period of the late 1970s. Writing in 1990, the \"Dean of American Rock Critics\" Robert Christgau, who gave punk and new wave bands major coverage in his column for \"The Village Voice\" in the late 1970s, defined \"new wave\" as \"a polite term devised to reassure people who were scared by punk, it enjoyed a two- or three-year run but was falling from favor as the '80s began.\"\nLester Bangs, another critical promoter of punk and new wave in the 1970s, when asked if new wave was \"still going on\" in 1982, stated that \"The only trouble with New Wave is that nobody followed up on it ... But it was really an exciting burst there for like a year, year and a half.\" Starting around 1983, the US music industry preferred the more generic term \"new music\", which it used to categorize new movements like new pop and New Romanticism. In 1983, music journalist Parke Puterbaugh wrote that new music \"does not so much describe a single style as it draws a line in time, distinguishing what came before from what has come after.\" Chuck Eddy, who wrote for \"The Village Voice\" in the 1980s, said in a 2011 interview that by the time of British new pop acts' popularity on MTV, \"New Wave had already been over by then. New wave was not synth music; it wasn't even this sort of funny-haircut music. It was the guy in the Boomtown Rats wearing pajamas.\" Similarly in Britain, journalists and music critics largely abandoned the term \"new wave\" with the rise of synth-pop. According to authors Stuart Borthwick and Ron Moy, \"After the monochrome blacks and greys of punk/new wave, synth-pop was promoted by a youth media interested in people who wanted to be pop stars, such as Boy George and Adam Ant\".\nIn 2005, Andrew Collins of \"The Guardian\" offered the breakup of the Jam, and the formation of Duran Duran, as two possible dates marking the \"death\" of new wave. British rock critic Adam Sweeting, who described the Jam as \"British New Wave at its most quintessential and successful\", remarked that the band broke up \"just as British pop was being overrun by the preposterous leisurewear and over-budgeted videos of Culture Club, Duran Duran and ABC, all of which were anathema to the puritanical Weller.\" Scholar Russ Bestley noted that while punk, new wave, and post-punk songs had featured on the Top of the Pops album series between mid-1977 and early 1982, by the time of the first \"Now That's What I Call Music!\" compilation in 1983 punk and new wave was \"largely dead and buried as a commercial force\".&lt;section end=\"overview\"/&gt;\nNew wave was closely tied to punk, and came and went more quickly in the UK and Western Europe than in the US. At the time punk began, it was a major phenomenon in the UK and a minor one in the US. When new wave acts started being noticed in the US, the term \"punk\" meant little to mainstream audiences, and it was common for rock clubs and discos to play British dance mixes and videos between live sets by American guitar acts.\nIllustrating the varied meanings of \"new wave\" in the UK and the US, Collins recalled how growing up in the 1970s he considered the Photos, who released one album in 1980 before splitting up a year later, as the most \"truly definitive new wave band\". In the same article, reviewing the American book \"This Ain't No Disco: New Wave Album Covers\", Collins noted that the book's inclusion of such artists as Big Country, Roxy Music, Wham!, and Bronski Beat \"strikes an Englishman as patently ridiculous\", but that the term means \"all things to all cultural commentators.\" By the 2000s, critical consensus favored \"new wave\" to be an umbrella term that encompasses power pop, synth-pop, ska revival, and the soft strains of punk rock. In the UK, some post-punk music developments became mainstream. According to music critic David Smay writing in 2001:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Current critical thought discredits new wave as a genre, deriding it as a marketing ploy to soft-sell punk, a meaningless umbrella term covering bands too diverse to be considered alike. Powerpop, synth-pop, ska revival, art school novelties and rebranded pub rockers were all sold as \"New Wave\".\nPopularity in the United States (1970s\u20131980s).\n1970s.\nIn mid-1977, arena rock and disco dominated the U.S. charts while acts associated with punk/new wave received little or no radio airplay and music industry support, despite favorable lead stories by \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\".&lt;ref name=\"punk/newwave\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Small new wave scenes developed in major cities, but public support remained limited to elements of the artistic, bohemian, and intellectual population. In early 1979, Eve Zibart of \"The Washington Post\" noted the contrast between \"the American audience's lack of interest in New Wave music\" compared to critics, with a \"stunning two-thirds of the Top 30 acts\" in the 1978 Pazz &amp; Jop poll falling into the \"New Wave-to-rock 'n' roll revivalist spectrum\". A month later, Zibart called Elvis Costello the \"Best Shot of the New Wave\" in America, speculating that \"If New Wave is to take hold here, it will be through the efforts of those furthest from the punk center\" due to \"inevitable\" American middle-class resistance to the \"jarring rawness of New Wave and its working-class angst.\"\nIn late 1978 and 1979, punk acts and acts that mixed punk with other genres began to make chart appearances and receive airplay on rock stations and rock discos. Blondie, Talking Heads, the Police, and the Cars charted during this period. In 1979, \"My Sharona\" by the Knack was \"Billboard\" magazine's number-one single; its success, combined with new wave albums being much cheaper to produce during the music industry's worst slump in decades, prompted record companies to sign new wave groups. At the end of 1979, Dave Marsh wrote in \"Time\" that the Knack's success confirmed rather than began the new wave movement's commercial rise, which had been signaled in 1978 by hits for the Cars and Talking Heads. In 1980, there were brief forays into new wave-style music by non-new wave artists Billy Joel (\"Glass Houses\"), Donna Summer (\"The Wanderer\"), and Linda Ronstadt (\"Mad Love\").\n1980s.\nEarly in 1980, influential radio consultant Lee Abrams wrote a memo saying with a few exceptions, \"we're not going to be seeing many of the new wave circuit acts happening very big [in the US]. As a movement, we don't expect it to have much influence.\" A year earlier, Bart Mills of \"The Washington Post\" asked \"Is England's New Wave All Washed Up?\", writing that \"The New Wave joined the Establishment, buying a few hits at the price of its anarchism. Not a single punk band broke through big in America, and in Britain John Travolta sold more albums than the entire New Wave.\" Lee Ferguson, a consultant to KWST, said in an interview Los Angeles radio stations were banning disc jockeys from using the term and noted; \"Most of the people who call music new wave are the ones looking for a way not to play it\". Second albums by new wave musicians who had successful debut albums, along with newly signed musicians, failed to sell and stations pulled most new wave programming, such as Devo's socially critical but widely misunderstood song \"Whip It\".\nIn 1981, the start of MTV began new wave's most successful era in the US. British musicians, unlike many of their American counterparts, had learned how to use the music video early on. Several British acts on independent labels were able to outmarket and outsell American musicians on major labels, a phenomenon journalists labeled the \"Second British Invasion\" of \"new music\", which included many artists of the New Romantic movement. In 1981, \"Rolling Stone\" contrasted the movement with the previous new wave era, writing that \"the natty Anglo-dandies of Japan\", having been \"reviled in the New Wave era\", seemed \"made to order for the age of the clothes-conscious New Romantic bands.\" MTV continued its heavy rotation of videos by \"post-New Wave pop\" acts \"with a British orientation\" until 1987, when it changed to a heavy metal and rock-dominated format.\nIn a December 1982 Gallup poll, 14% of teenagers rated new wave as their favorite type of music, making it the third-most-popular genre. New wave had its greatest popularity on the West Coast. Unlike other genres, race was not a factor in the popularity of new wave music, according to the poll. Urban contemporary radio stations were the first to play dance-oriented new wave bands such as the B-52's, Culture Club, Duran Duran, and ABC.\nNew wave soundtracks were used in mainstream Brat Pack films such as \"Sixteen Candles\", \"Pretty in Pink\", and \"The Breakfast Club\", as well as in the low-budget hit \"Valley Girl\". John Hughes, the director of several of these films, was enthralled with British new wave music, and placed songs from acts such as the Psychedelic Furs, Simple Minds, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and Echo and the Bunnymen in his films, helping to keep new wave in the mainstream. Several of these songs remain standards of the era. Critics described the MTV acts of the period as shallow or vapid. Homophobic slurs were used to describe some of the new wave musicians. Despite the criticism, the danceable quality of the music and the quirky fashion sense associated with new wave musicians appealed to audiences. Peter Ivers, who started his career in the late 1960s, went on to become the host for the television program New Wave Theatre that showcased rising acts in the underground new wave scene. He has been described by NTS Radio as \"a virtuosic songwriter and musician whose antics bridged not just 60s counterculture and New Wave music but also film, theater, and music television.\"\nIn September 1988, \"Billboard\" launched its Modern Rock chart, the acts on which reflected a wide variety of stylistic influences. New wave's legacy remained in the large influx of acts from the UK, and acts that were popular in rock discos, as well as the chart's name, which reflects the way new wave was marketed as \"modern\". According to Steve Graves, new wave's indie spirit was crucial to the development of college rock and grunge/alternative rock in the latter half of the 1980s and onward. Conversely, according to Robert Christgau, \"in America, the original New Wave was a blip commercially, barely touching the nascent alt-rock counterculture of the '80s.\"\n1990s.\nIn the US, new wave continued into the mid-1980s but declined with the popularity of the New Romantic, new pop, and new music genres. Some new wave acts, particularly R.E.M., maintained new wave's indie label orientation through most of the 1980s, rejecting potentially more lucrative careers from signing to a major label. In the UK, new wave \"survived through the post-punk years, but after the turn of the decade found itself overwhelmed by the more outrageous style of the New Romantics.\" In response, many British indie bands adopted \"the kind of jangling guitar work that had typified New Wave music\", with the arrival of the Smiths characterised by the music press as a \"reaction against the opulence/corpulence of nouveau rich New Pop\" and \"part of the move back to guitar-driven music after the keyboard washes of the New Romantics\". In the aftermath of grunge, the British music press launched a campaign to promote the new wave of new wave that involved overtly punk and new-wave-influenced acts such as Elastica, but it was eclipsed by Britpop, which took influences from both 1960s rock and 1970s punk and new wave. Robert Christgau identified the mid-1990s NWONW movement as the peak of a new wave revival that has continued on and off since, stating in 1996, \"1994 was the top of a curve we can't be certain we've reached the bottom of\".\n2000s\u20132010s.\nDuring the 2000s, a number of artists that exploited a diversity of new wave and post-punk influences emerged through the alternative rock scene. In New York, these acts were encompassed by the electroclash and post-punk revival movement, sometimes labeled \"New New Wave\".\nAccording to British music journalist Chris Nickson, Scottish band Franz Ferdinand revived both Britpop and the music of the late 1970s \"with their New Wave influenced sound\". AllMusic notes the emergence of these acts \"led journalists and music fans to talk about a post-punk/new wave revival\" while arguing it was \"really more analogous to a continuum, one that could be traced back as early as the mid-'80s\". In England, the resurgence of indie rock music that emerged through the 2000s post-punk revival scene led to a proliferation of formulaic acts collectively labelled \"landfill indie\". James New of Mumm-Ra, an artist associated with this era, stated \"I went into a weird new-wave band, because it felt so saturated seeing the same bands with kids in skinny jeans.\"\nNew wave revivalism influenced later internet microgenres such as zolo, bloghouse, chillwave, synthwave and vaporwave. In the mid- to late 2010s, an online internet meme, led to the coining of a microgenre originally known as \"devo-core\", and later renamed \"egg punk\". The style was pioneered by Indiana band the Coneheads and characterized by the zany, lo-fi and edgier aspects of new wave band Devo.\n2020s.\nIn 2021, the New York electroclash and bloghouse scenes of the 2000s which drew inspiration from new wave music, led a woman named Olivia V. to coin an internet aesthetic known as \"indie sleaze\", through the launching of the Instagram account @indiesleaze, which was dedicated to documenting the visual style of that period.\nRegional scenes.\nSoviet Union.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, under the Soviet Union, an underground music scene influenced by the punk subculture in the United States and UK led to the development of several post-punk and new wave influenced acts in countries such as Bosnia, Estonia, Russia, Serbia, and Belarus. In Russia, prominent post-punk acts were centered in Leningrad such as Kino, Akvarium, Auktyon, Nautilus Pompilius and Piknik.\nSpain.\nIn post-Francoist Spain during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of punk rock led to La Movida Madrile\u00f1a (The Madrid Scene), a countercultural movement centered in Madrid that emerged after the death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. The movement musically drew influences from post-punk, synth-pop and new wave music. In the 2010s and 2020s, the Spanish post-punk scene became encompassed by acts such as Depresi\u00f3n Sonora.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21161", "revid": "50404235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21161", "title": "Transport in the Netherlands", "text": " \nThe Netherlands is both a very densely populated and a highly developed country in which transport is a key factor of the economy. Correspondingly it has a very dense and modern infrastructure, facilitating transport with road, rail, air and water networks. In its Global Competitiveness Report for 2014-2015, the World Economic Forum ranked the Dutch transport infrastructure fourth in the world.\nWith a total road network of 139,000\u00a0km, including 3,530\u00a0km of expressways, the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world; much denser than Germany and France, though not as dense as Belgium. The Dutch also have a well developed railway network, that connects most towns and cities, as well as a comprehensive dedicated cycling infrastructure, featuring some 35,000\u00a0km of track physically segregated from motorised traffic.\nThe port of Rotterdam is the world's largest seaport outside East Asia, and the largest port of Europe. It connects with its hinterland in Germany, Switzerland and France through the rivers Rhine and Meuse. Two thirds of all inland water freight shipping within the EU, and 40% of containers, pass through the Netherlands. Additionally, the port of Amsterdam is Europe's fifth busiest seaport, according to Eurostat.\nMobility in the Netherlands is considerable. On the roads it has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year, three quarters of which are done by car. Around half of all trips in the Netherlands are made by car, 25% by bicycle, 20% walking, and 5% by public transport. Additionally, Dutch airports handled at least 70 million passengers in 2016. Excluding air travel, the Dutch journey more than 30\u00a0km a day on average, which takes them just over an hour.\nIn 2010, 1.65 billion tons of goods traffic was registered, half of which moved by sea and inland shipping, and 40% by road transport. The remainder was mostly by pipelines; rail transport only handles 2% of freight movements through the Netherlands.\nRoad transport.\nWith 139,000\u00a0km of public roads, the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world - much denser than Germany and France, but still not as dense as Belgium. In 2013, 5,191\u00a0km were national roads, 7,778\u00a0km were provincial roads, and 125,230\u00a0km were municipality and other roads.\nDutch roads include 3,530\u00a0km of motorways and expressways, and with a motorway density of 64 kilometres per 1,000\u00a0km\u00b2, the country also has one of the densest motorway networks in the world. The Netherlands' main highway network (\"hoofdwegennet\") - comparable to Britain's network of trunk roads - consists of most of its 5,200\u00a0km of national roads, supplemented with the most prominent provincial roads. Although only about 2,500\u00a0km are fully constructed to motorway standards, much of the remainder are also expressways for fast motor vehicles only.\nMobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year, three quarters of which are done by car, meaning that while Dutch roads are numerous, they are also used more intensely than in almost any other country. Car ownership in the Netherlands is high but not exceptional, and slightly lower than in surrounding countries. Goods vehicles account for 20% of total traffic.\nThe busiest Dutch motorway is the A13 between The Hague and Rotterdam, with a traffic volume of 140,000 motor vehicles per day. The widest Dutch motorway is the A15/A16 just south of Rotterdam with 16 lanes in a 4+4+4+4 setup.\nTraffic congestion is common in the Netherlands. The high population density generates significant traffic volumes on both motorways and regular highways. Most congestion occurs in the Randstad, but congestion is a daily structural problem around many larger cities. The Netherlands tries to counter this with an advanced motorway network, with Variable Message Signs and electronic signalization across most of the network. The number of passing motor vehicles is counted every minute of the day at some 20,000 measuring stations on the Dutch motorway network. A special feature of the motorways is the use of Porous Asphalt Concrete, which reduces noise levels, and allows rain water to be drained efficiently, for safety and expedient traffic flow under precipitation.\nCycling.\nCycling is a ubiquitous mode of transport in the Netherlands. 27% of all trips are by bicycle - the highest modal share of any country in the world. Moreover: 36% of the Dutch list the bike as their most frequent mode of transport on a typical day. Some 85% of the people own at least one bicycle. All in all the Dutch are estimated to have at least 18 million functioning bikes, which makes more than one per capita, and much more than the 11.3 million motor vehicles registered on the road. Almost as many passenger kilometres are covered by bicycle as by train.\nCycling infrastructure is comprehensive, and public policy, urban planning &amp; laws are bike-friendly. Most roads except for motorways support cyclists, and bikeways are clearly signposted, well maintained and well lit. Dedicated cycle tracks are common on busy roads - some 35,000\u00a0km of track has been physically segregated from motor traffic, equal to a quarter of the country's entire road network. Busy junctions often give priority to cyclists, or they are equipped with cycle-specific traffic lights.\nThere are large bicycle parking facilities, particularly in city centres and at train stations. Since the start of the 21st century, parking spaces for 450,000 bicycles were built and modernized at over 400 train stations, and Dutch railways organizations ProRail and NS are calling for an expansion by another 250,000 by 2027. Already half of all Dutch train travelers cycle to the railway station, amounting to half a million cyclists daily.\nIn 2013, the European Cyclists' Federation ranked the Netherlands, together with Denmark as the most bike-friendly country in Europe.\nRail transport.\nMost distance travelled on Dutch public transport goes by rail. Like many other European countries, the Netherlands has a dense railway network, totalling between and of track, or 3,013 \"route\" km, three quarters of which has been electrified. The network is mostly focused on passenger transport and connects almost all major towns and cities, counting just over 400 train stations, more than there are municipalities in the Netherlands. The national rail infrastructure is managed by public task company ProRail, and a number of different operators have concessions to run their trains. ProRail also coordinates the totality of scheduling and proper meshing of the Dutch railway services.\nPublic passenger rail transport is operated mainly by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) (\"Dutch Railways\"); minor parts by Arriva, Keolis Nederland, Connexxion, Breng, DB Regio, NMBS, Veolia and DB Regionalbahn Westfalen. During week days all railway stations are serviced at least twice an hour in each direction. Large parts of the network are serviced by two to four trains per hour on average. Heavily used routes can be serviced by 8 to 16 trains an hour.\nIn recent years, the four largest railway stations in the Netherlands, the central stations of each of the largest cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, have all entered into major reconstruction and expansion. Rotterdam Central station was completely rebuilt, and was the first to complete, reopening in March 2014.\nThe Hague Central station and Utrecht Central station were reopened, after extensive reconstructions, in February and December 2016, respectively.\nAmsterdam Central station has been undergoing a string of reconstruction works that started in 1997, and is yet to complete.\nIn 2015 a consultancy comparison of Europe's railway systems found the Dutch network the most cost effective for its performance, together with Finland's. Per kilometre of track, the Dutch rail network is the busiest in the European Union, handling over a million passengers a day. For 2019 some 2.2 million train journeys are scheduled to travel a record number of 165 million \"train\" kilometres (103 million train miles) \u2014 a growth of 28%, up from 124 million km in 2004. Until 2030 ProRail projects a further growth of \"passenger\" kilometres by another 45 percent. For 2019, also 8 percent more freight trains are scheduled than in 2018.\nFuture developments.\nOn the initiative of two European parties: RailNetEurope and Forum Train Europe, a project called \"Redesign of the International Timetabling Process (TTR)\" should help to harmonise planning freight- and passenger trains across Europe, to optimize usage of existing rail tracks. Currently, almost all freight trains (96%) deviate from their original schedule, due to the dynamic nature of cargo transport. The new TTR must facilitate ProRail to let unscheduled freight trains run more easily, without requiring complex shifting in the regular passenger train timetables. As of 2020, timetables will be detailed to tenths of minutes (six second units), instead of whole minutes, to further optimise planning.\nIn the long term, significant capacity gains could only be achieved by adding more rail tracks, \"or\" transforming large portions of the Dutch railway system to run more like a metro / subway system, which could support up to 24 to 30 trains per hour on the busiest lines. This would however require a structural disentanglement of the current situation, in which trains, train drivers and conductors all have their own work schedules, following the Japanese model. However, at the moment there are no real plans for such steps.\nPublic transport.\nFor longer distances the main public transport in the Netherlands is the train. Long-distance buses are limited to a few missing railway connections. Regional and rural public transport, serving small(er) towns is by bus. Local and urban public transport is also generally by bus, but the three largest cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague) all have extensive tram systems, that in each case also connect with adjacent cities in their respective urban agglomerations.\nIn addition, Amsterdam and Rotterdam also have several metro lines. Amsterdam's subway was expanded by a new \"North-South\" line in July 2018, after 15 years of construction, costing \u20ac3.1 billion.\nAdditionally, Rotterdam, The Hague and suburbs in between are connected by a light rail system called RandstadRail, and one line of the Rotterdam metro system connects all the way to The Hague Central station. Utrecht has its own light rail system, called fast tram, connecting the city with adjacent Nieuwegein and IJsselstein. Arnhem is the only Dutch city that still operates a trolleybus system.\nDue to the large number of waterways in the Netherlands, not every road connection has been bridged, and there are still some ferries in operation. In the Rotterdam and \"-Drecht\" towns region, a water bus public transport service operates as well.\nPublic transport operators are both the public transport companies run by the local government of the cities: GVB (Amsterdam), RET (Rotterdam) and HTM (The Hague), as well as private enterprise companies like Arriva, Connexxion, Qbuzz and Keolis Nederland.\nAir travel.\nAir travel in the Netherlands peaked at a Dutch record number of over 81 million passengers in 2019.\nAmsterdam Schiphol Airport, located southwest of Amsterdam, is the main international airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest airport in Europe in terms of passengers. Offering direct flights to 326 destination airports around the planet, Schiphol is the world's second best connected airport. The airport handled 63.6 million passengers in 2016, a growth of 9.1% over 2015, peaking at 71.7 million passengers in 2019. Airfreight tonnage increased by 1.8% to 1.7 million metric tons.\nOpened in 1916 as a military airbase, Schiphol saw 479,000 flights in 2016, and practically hit its environmentally mandated maximum of 500,000 yearly flight operations the year prior, recording 499,000 take-offs and landings in 2018. This makes Schiphol one of the world's busiest airports, \"on average\" handling 57 starts and landings per hour on one of its six runways, and thus frequently exceeding levels of over one aircraft movement per minute.\nSchiphol is the primary hub for Dutch flag carrier airline KLM and its regional affiliate KLM Cityhopper, as well as for other Dutch airlines Corendon Dutch Airlines, Martinair, Transavia and TUI Airlines Netherlands. The airport also serves as a European hub for Delta Air Lines, and as a base for EasyJet and Vueling airlines.\nIn other regions there are much smaller international airports, the most prominent being Eindhoven Airport, Rotterdam The Hague Airport, Maastricht Aachen Airport and Groningen Airport. The airports of Eindhoven and Rotterdam/The Hague are both part of the Schiphol Group, and both experienced growth in 2016. Eindhoven Airport grew by 9.3% to 4.7 million passengers, whereas Rotterdam/The Hague Airport's growth was a modest 0.2%, reaching 1.6 million travellers in 2016. At the Maastricht Aachen, and Groningen airports, a considerable share of flights is seasonal in nature. For transport within the country, air travel is hardly used.\nThe airports of the Netherlands handled 71 million air passengers in 2023. In the previous years Dutch airports handled 61 million air passengers in 2022, 29 million in 2021, and 23.6 million in 2020.\nIn 2015 Dutch airports handled passengers at a ratio of 47 million on European flights versus 18 million on intercontinental flights, and in 2013 a slightly less 1.6 million metric tons of airfreight.\nWater transport.\nPorts and harbours.\nThe Netherlands has thirteen seaports, three of which have international significance. Handling 440 million metric tons of cargo in 2013, the port of Rotterdam is the biggest port of Europe \u2013 as big as the next three biggest combined, and the eighth largest in the world. The Amsterdam seaport is the second in the country, and the fifth largest in Europe. Additionally, since 1998 the ports of Vlissingen and Terneuzen are working as one, under the name of Zeeland Seaports. Handling 34 million metric tons of cargo in 2012, this is now the third biggest Dutch seaport. For comparison: the nearby port of London handled 44 million tons in that year.\nThrough the rivers Rhine and Meuse, Rotterdam has excellent access to its hinterland upstream, reaching to Germany, France and Switzerland. The port's main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment. The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. In 2007, the Betuweroute, a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed.\nThree Dutch ports are deepwater ports, that can handle fully laden Panamax ships: Rotterdam, Zeeland Seaports and the port of IJmuiden. Besides Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Zeeland, the ports of Moerdijk and Vlaardingen also support container liner shipping. Other notable port cities are Dordrecht, Haarlem and Den Helder, as well as Groningen, which controls the seaports of Delfzijl and Eemshaven. Den Helder is home to the Netherlands' main naval base.\nMerchant marine.\n\"note:\" many Dutch-owned ships are also operating under the ship registry of Netherlands Antilles (1998 est.)\nInland waters.\n6,237\u00a0km of rivers and canals are navigable for ships of 50 tons. Some 3,740\u00a0km of this consists of canals. At least 4,326\u00a0km of waterways are usable by craft up to 400 metric ton capacity, and over 3,000\u00a0km are usable by ships up to 1,250 metric ton capacity. Although another source states that all of 6,230\u00a0km is navigable for craft up to 400 tons, and over 4,000\u00a0km is usable by ships up to 1,500 metric ton capacity.\nThe Dutch inland shipping fleet is the biggest in Europe. Consisting of some 7,000 vessels, it takes a share of 35% of the national total annual freight transport, and as much as 80% of bulk transport. Also two thirds of all inland water freight transports within the EU, and 40% of the EU's inland container shipping, pass through the Netherlands. All in all the Netherlands has so many waterways that virtually all major industrial areas and population centres can be reached by water via inland ports (200) and transhipment terminals (350).\nPipelines.\nPipeline transport:\nThe distribution network for natural gas is the most dense in Europe and of very high quality, with a total length of 12,200 kilometres of transmission pipelines and 136,400 kilometres of distribution pipelines. A technical investigation has concluded that the existing Dutch high-pressure gas infrastructure could feasibly be converted for transport of hydrogen in the future.\nThe Netherlands has a well-developed pipeline network essential for transporting natural gas, oil, chemicals, and CO2. Natural gas transmission network is managed by Gasunie Transport Services (GTS), it connects gas producers, storage facilities, and major consumers across the country. The network is divided into two main systems, catering to different types of gas. The low-calorific gas system primarily supplies households, while the high-calorific gas system serves industries and power plants.\nOil pipelines transport crude oil from the Port of Rotterdam to refineries in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Pernis Chemical Complex is interconnected by pipelines transporting various chemical feedstocks and products between different industrial facilities. In addition, Organic CO2 for Assimilation by Plants (OCAP) is a notable CO2 transport system that supplies purified CO2 from industrial sources to greenhouses in the Westland area for enhancing plant growth.\nGovernment.\nTransport in the Netherlands falls under the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. With regard to public transport, not involving national rail, a total of 14 public bodies have been delegated the authority to grant concessions to public transport operators, namely the twelve provinces, plus the two transport-regions specifically for Amsterdam and Rotterdam / The Hague. These 14 parties are united in a cooperation called \"DOVA\" (\"Decentrale Openbaar Vervoer Autoriteiten\"), or \"Decentralised Public Transport Authorities\". The provinces in turn sometimes delegate this authority to their municipalities.\nRoads are controlled by authorities at all four administrative levels in the Netherlands. About 5,200\u00a0km of national roads (\"Rijkswegen\") are controlled by central national government agency Rijkswaterstaat, and the country's twelve provinces manage about 7,800\u00a0km of provincial roads. Most motorways are national roads, and the remaining national roads are mostly expressways. Only a few motorways are provincial ones, and they are much shorter and serve mostly regional traffic. Frequently, they were previously national roads.\nMunicipal roads make up the bulk of the network, totalling some 120,000\u00a0km. They are mostly local roads. Aside from the division in provinces, the Netherlands is also divided in 21 water management boards. Together with miscellaneous authorities, they own and control another 7,500\u00a0km of roads. For some roads, it is because they are a physical element of water barriers, like dikes and dams while others provide primary access to critical water control structures and may not be open to the public.\nEconomics.\nAlthough transport economics is much more than just the economy of the transport sector itself, the latter is much easier to quantify. In 2012 the Dutch goods transport and storage sectors by themselves accounted for almost 400,000 full-time jobs, employing some 500,000 people. Gross revenues totalled 77 billion euro, leading to results of 4.3 billion euro.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The armed forces consist of four service branches: the Royal Netherlands Navy (), the Royal Netherlands Army (), the Royal Netherlands Air and Space Force () and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (). The service branches are supplemented by various joint support organizations. In addition, local conscript forces exist on the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao. These operate under the auspices of the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Netherlands Marine Corps. The armed forces are part of the Ministry of Defence.\nSupreme command of the armed forces is determined in Article 97 of the constitution, which states \"The Government shall have supreme authority over the armed forces\". Service members swear allegiance to the King in his role as head of state. \nThe military ranks of the Netherlands armed forces are similar to those of fellow NATO member states and were established by Royal Decree. The highest-ranking officer in the Dutch military is the Chief of Defence, who is a four-star officer (NATO OF-9).\nAfter initial cooperation with the German army in 1995 through a M\u00fcnster-located corps and increasing cross-linking during the following decades, all three Royal Netherlands Army combat brigades have fully integrated into German divisions as of March 2023.\nIn 2024 the Netherlands Armed Forces was awarded the Wateler Peace Prize.\nFoundation in law and purpose.\nThe Netherlands armed forces exist by declaration in the constitution of the Netherlands. Article 97 of the constitution determines that the armed forces exist\nThis means that the role and responsibility of the Dutch military in international stability and peacekeeping is constitutionally determined.\nThe same article of the constitution determines that supreme command of the Dutch military resides with the Government of the Netherlands. This has been the case since the constitution was changed in 1983; before then, supreme command of the armed forces of the Netherlands was held by the Monarch.\nOverview.\nOrganization.\nThe existence of, authority over, and tasks of the armed forces are determined in the constitution of the Netherlands. The Government, which consists of cabinet members led by the Prime Minister and the King, functions as the head of the armed forces. Although service members swear allegiance to the King of the Netherlands, the monarch does not hold the position of commander-in-chief. Therefore, in practice, important decisions are made by Cabinet, while the Minister of Defence assumes political responsibility over the Ministry.\nThe Ministry of Defence is the government ministry which is responsible for formulating and executing defence policy. The ministry consists of the Minister, State Secretary, the Central Staff, the Netherlands Armed Forces and two independent support organizations. The Central Staff () of the Ministry comprises several directorates responsible for executing policy, advising the Minister and State Secretary, and controlling the Defence organization. The Central Staff is led by the highest civil servant of the defence organization, the Secretary General. Moreover, the Central Staff incorporates the Defence Staff, which is the highest military organ under command of the Chief of Defence. The Chief of Defence is the military leader of the Netherlands Armed Forces and the most senior military adviser to the Minister of Defence. The Chief of Defence has command over the Armed Forces, the Netherlands Special Operations Command (NLD SOCOM) and the Defence Cyber Command. Several special executive organizations, including the Military Intelligence and Security Service and the office of the Inspector General, are incorporated into the Central Staff as well.\nPersonnel.\nThe Netherlands Armed Forces are a professional military, conscription in the Netherlands having been suspended in 1996 with the exception of Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao. All military branches are open to female recruits. In 2018 the Ministry of Defence announced that the submarine service will begin accepting female recruits for positions as officer, NCO and sailor.\nThe Dutch Ministry of Defence employs over 70,000 personnel, including both civilian and military personnel. The distribution of personnel in the Defence organization, including the Armed Forces, on 1 September 2025 was as follows:\nIn March 2025 it was announced that the Dutch government wants to increase the size of the Netherlands Armed Forces from 70,000 to 200,000 personnel.\nRanks.\nThe Dutch military is part of the NATO militaries and therefore conforms to the structure of a NATO military. It also uses conforming rank structures.\nOath.\nAll Dutch military personnel, officers and enlisted personnel, are required to take an oath of allegiance. This oath is recorded in the law on General Military Personnel Regulations (Algemeen Militair Ambtenarenregelement) in Article 126a and states the following:\nTranslated in English:\n\"I swear (pledge) loyalty to the King, obedience to the law and submission to martial discipline. So help me God (That, I pledge).\"\nUnionized military.\nUnlike many military organizations, Dutch military members are allowed to form and join unions.\nThere is a wide variety of unions, including unions exclusive to officers or particular service branches. Some of the larger unions include:\nService branches.\nRoyal Netherlands Navy.\nThe Royal Netherlands Navy () is the Netherlands Armed Forces' maritime force which consists of 24 commissioned ships and an additional number of support ships of various types. The Navy is commanded by the Commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy (), an officer in the rank of Vice Admiral or Lieutenant General of the Marines, who reports directly to the Chief of Defence. In addition to being the commanding officer of the Royal Netherlands Navy, the holds the position of Admiral Benelux. As such, the is the commanding officer of the operational units of the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Belgian Naval Component.\nThe surface fleet of the Navy consist of frigates, amphibious warfare ships, patrol vessels, mine-countermeasure vessels and multiple auxiliary ships. All major surface vessels of the Royal Netherlands Navy are constructed at the Dutch shipyard Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding. This includes the technologically advanced air-defence frigates of the \"De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn\"-class. Thales Nederland produces various types of high-end sensors and radars for the Dutch fleet.\nThe Royal Netherlands Navy Submarine Service () was established in 1906 and is responsible for the operation of all Dutch submarines. As of 2021, the operates four \"Walrus\"-class submarines and one submarine tender, HNLMS \"Mercuur\". The Dutch submarines fulfill a considerable role within NATO as their small size and expeditionary capacities allow them to operate in waters that are off-limits to larger submarines. The Ministry of Defence initiated a replacement program in November 2014. in March 2024 the winning bid was announced with the newer class being called Orka-class and are planned to enter service in the late 2030s.https://\nNetherlands Marine Corps.\nThe Netherlands Marine Corps is the Navy's naval infantry corps. The Corps consist of two battalion-sized Marine Combat Groups, various support units and the Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces. The Marines are specialized in amphibious, arctic and mountain warfare as well as special operations. The Corps operates a fleet of landing craft that can operate from one of the two Navy's amphibious transport docks.\nRoyal Netherlands Army.\nThe Royal Netherlands Army () consists of regular Army personnel and the National Reserve Corps. The Army is headed by the Commander of the Royal Netherlands Army (), its headquarters are located on the in Utrecht. The core fighting element of the Army consist of three combat brigades: 11 Airmobile Brigade, 13 Light Brigade and 43 Mechanized Brigade. The brigade-sized Operational Support Command Land fields a variety of combat support and combat service support units while the Army's special operations forces are part of the . The Army's infantry regiments fulfil several distinct roles, these include air assault, armoured infantry, light infantry and special operations. Furthermore, the Army fields cavalry, artillery, engineering and medical regiments.\nRoyal Netherlands Air and Space Force.\nThe Royal Netherlands Air and Space Force () is the military aviation and space warfare branch of the Netherlands Armed Forces and is led by the Commander of the Royal Netherlands Air and Space Force (). The Air and Space Force operates a diverse fleet of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, in addition to operating and maintaining multiple airbases. Moreover, Air and Space Force personnel contributes to the Joint Ground-based Air Defence Command by operating various air-defence systems while other units are dedicated to force protection. The Air and Space Force operates modern fighter aircraft, such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-35 Lightning II, tankers, transports, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, and various types of training aircraft. Until 2025, the Royal Netherlands Air and Space Force was called the Royal Netherlands Air Force.\nRoyal Netherlands Marechaussee.\nThe Royal Netherlands Marechaussee () is a gendarmerie force which performs both military and civilian police duties. In addition to the military police duties, the Marechaussee has a wide variety of duties and responsibilities. This includes guarding the national borders and airports, fighting illegal immigration and transnational crime and guarding the royal palaces.\nThe Marechaussee was established as one of the separate Armed Forces in 1998; before then the Marechaussee was organized as one of the arms within the Army.\nWhile the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee operates under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence, the branch often performs duties delegated by the Ministry of Justice and Security and the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. Moreover, several brigades of the Marechaussee are permanently stationed in the Dutch Caribbean.\nContemporary campaigns.\nSince the 1990s, the Dutch military has been involved in several military campaigns and peace-keeping missions, these include:\nAfghanistan.\nContribution to ISAF.\nAs part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Netherlands deployed aircraft which were integrated in the European Participating Air Force (EPAF) in support of ground operations in Afghanistan. Additionally, Dutch naval frigates were tasked with policing the waters of the Middle East and Indian Ocean. Between 2001 and 2003, a reinforced army company was deployed to Afghanistan to provide support in maintaining public order and providing security in and around the capital Kabul. Furthermore, military assistance was provided to the Afghan National Army and local security forces. The troops were deployed under the command of NATO's International Security Assistance Force mission.\nThe Netherlands deployed further troops and helicopters to Afghanistan in 2006 as part of a new security operation in the south of the country. In mid-2006, Dutch special forces of the Korps Commandotroepen as part of the Deployment Task Force successfully deployed to Tarin Kowt to lay the ground for the increasing numbers of engineers who were due to build a base there. By August 2006 the Netherlands had deployed the majority of 1,400 troops to Uruzgan province in southern Afghanistan at Kamp Holland in Tarin Kowt (1,200) and Kamp Hadrian in Deh Rahwod (200). PzH 2000 self-propelled artillery pieces were deployed and used in combat for the first time. The Dutch forces operated under the command of the ISAF Task Force Uruzgan and were involved in some of the more intensive combat operations in southern Afghanistan, including Operation Medusa and the Battle of Chora. On 18 April 2008, on the second day of his command, the son of \"then\"-Chief of Defence general Peter van Uhm, Lieutenant Dennis van Uhm, was one of two servicemen killed by a road-side explosion. As of 1 September 2008, the Netherlands had a total of 1,770 troops in Afghanistan excluding special forces troops.\nBetween 2002 and 2021, Dutch military personnel worked successively in the Afghan provinces of Kabul, Baghlan, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Kunduz and Balkh, with the aim, among other things, to bring stability and to build up the security apparatus, the army and the police.\nIn total, 25 Dutch servicemen were killed in action during the deployment.\nResolute Support Mission.\nFrom 2015 until 2021, approximately 160 Dutch troops of the Korps Commandotroepen, NLMARSOF and multiple conventional support elements were deployed to the city of Mazar-e-Sharif as part of NATO's Resolute Support Mission. Dutch troops co-operated with personnel of the German Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte as part of the German-Dutch lead Special Operations Advisory Team (SOAT). The SOAT provided advice and assistance during operations of the Afghan police tactical unit, the Afghan Territorial Force-888 (ATF-888). The SOAT was granted authority to deploy in the entirety of Afghanistan in 2019. The operations ended with the withdrawal of all United States and allied troops from Afghanistan in 2021.\nIraq.\nMultinational force in Iraq.\nA contingent of 1,345 Army and Marines Corps personnel, supported by Royal Netherlands Air Force helicopters, was deployed to Iraq in 2003, based at Camp Smitty near As Samawah (southern Iraq) with responsibility for the Muthanna Province, as part of the Multinational force in Iraq. On June 1, 2004, the Dutch government renewed their stay through 2005. The Netherlands removed its troops from Iraq in March 2005, leaving half a dozen liaison officers until late 2005. The Netherlands lost two soldiers in separate attacks.\nIntervention against ISIL.\nOn 24 September 2014, the Dutch government announced its participation in the military campaign against ISIL, and sent six F-16 fighter jets to Iraq to bomb ISIL. Their motivations to join this war: ISIL's advance in Iraq and Syria, while displaying \"unprecedented violence\" and \"perpetrating terrible crimes against population groups\", formed \"a direct threat for that region\"; ISIL's advance in Iraq and Syria \"causes instability at the borders of Europe\" which threatens \"our own [Dutch] safety\". Figures requested by in August 2015 showed that the Netherlands was among the most active countries within the coalition, third behind only the United States and the United Kingdom. In January 2016, the Netherlands extended their bombings of ISIL to Syrian territory. By the end of July 2016 the Dutch Air Task Force flew more than 2100 missions and carried out over 1800 air strikes. At the end of the Dutch contribution to the Air Task Force, in December 2018, the Royal Netherlands Air Force had flown over 3000 missions and conducted approximately 2100 air strikes.\nFrom 2015 until the spring of 2018, KCT and NLMARSOF special operations forces deployed advice and assist teams to northern Iraq in cooperation with the Belgian Special Forces Group. During this deployment, they provided support to Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi Army forces before, during and after operations in the battle against ISIL, as part of the Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve.\nCounterpiracy.\nAs a maritime nation and birthplace of the earliest maritime law, the Netherlands have historically highly valued the \"mare liberum\" principle. Hence, the Dutch government decided to contribute a significant amount of naval assets to combating piracy off the coast of Somalia since its most recent surge starting in 2005. The Royal Netherlands Navy was an active contributor to NATO's Operation Allied Protector and Operation Ocean Shield, as well as to the European Union's Operation Atalanta. Ships partaking in these missions included \"De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn\"-class frigates, landing platform docks HNLMS \"Rotterdam\" and HNLMS \"Johan de Witt\", and submarines of the \"Walrus\"-class. Additionally, surface combatants permanently carried boarding teams of the Netherlands Marine Corps. These boarding parties were often composed of operators of the Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces (NLMARSOF). In addition, conventional marine units supply Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) which continue to guard Dutch merchant vessels during transits through piracy-prone waters as of 2021.\nThe Dutch naval forces were regularly engaged in combat. Firefights between the naval ships and Somali pirates have cost the lives of pirates on multiple occasions. During the Action of 5 April 2010, a boarding team of the Unit Interventie Mariniers liberated container ship MV \"Taipan\" after rappelling down from HNLMS \"Tromp\"'s helicopter onto containers on the ship's deck under the cover of machine gun fire. The successful operation was filmed with a helmet camera, the video footage reached worldwide news media and gained millions of views on YouTube. Moreover, NLMARSOF frogmen have successfully conducted sabotage operations of pirates' motherships by clandestinely attaching explosives to the ships' bilge.\nMali.\nSpecial forces of the Korps Commandotroepen were deployed to Mali since 2014 as part of the UN mission MINUSMA. The primary task of the Dutch forces was to gather intelligence on local Islamist and rebel groups and to protect the people of Mali against said groups. Since 2016, conventional detachments consisting of 11 Air Assault Brigade and 13 Light Brigade troops were part of the MINUSMA rotations as well. Additionally, the Dutch contribution consisted of a RNLAF AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook detachment which provided the necessary air support and transport for the infantry units on the ground.\nOn 16 March 2015, a Dutch AH-64D Apache attack helicopter of the Dutch MINUSMA air detachment crashed during a firing exercise, killing the two pilots. On 6 July 2016, two servicemen of 11 Air Assault Brigade were killed during a mortar-firing exercise, while a third serviceman was severely wounded. The incident lead to the resignation of the minister of Defence Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and Chief of Defence General Tom Middendorp after a critical report by the Dutch Safety Board found that the safety standards were subpar. The Netherlands ended their sizable contribution to the peacekeeping mission in May 2019 to send additional troops to Afghanistan instead.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While historically the Kingdom of the Netherlands was a neutral state, since 1945 it has become a member of NATO, the United Nations, the European Union and many other international organizations. The Dutch economy is very open and relies on international trade. During and after the 17th century\u2014its Golden Age\u2014the Dutch built up a commercial and colonial empire. It was a leading shipping and naval power and was often at war with England, its main rival. Its main colonial holding was Indonesia, which fought for and achieved independence after 1945. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. Foreign trade policy is handled by the European Union. The Dutch have been active in international peacekeeping roles.\nHistory.\nIn the Dutch Golden Age, which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences. A rich worldwide Dutch empire developed and the Dutch East India Company became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.\nDuring the 18th century, the power and wealth of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful British and French neighbors weakened it. Britain seized the North American colony of New Amsterdam, turning it into New York. There was growing unrest and conflict between the Orangists and the Patriots. The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French Batavian Republic was established in 1795\u20131806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the Kingdom of Holland (1806\u20131810), and later simply a French imperial province.\nIn 1815\u20131940 it was neutral and played a minor role in world diplomacy, apart from a failed effort to control the seceding Southern provinces that became Belgium before giving up in 1839.\nUnlike most European countries, the Netherlands succeeded in remaining neutral throughout The Great War. This approach failed during the Second World War however and the kingdom quickly fell to an unprovoked German invasion in 1940 and would remain under Nazi occupation until being liberated by the allies in 1945. After the war, as a member of the allies, the Netherlands was included in the first class of U.N. members. During the Cold War like most Western European countries, the Dutch aligned with the United States against the Soviet Union, co-founding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in 1949. The Dutch were also at the forefront of promoting European cooperation and integration during this time period; co-founding the European Coal and Steel Community and becoming one of the European Union's (EU) original members.\nEuropean integration.\nThe Dutch have been strong advocates of European integration, and most aspects of their foreign, economic, and trade policies are coordinated through the European Union (EU). The Dutch postwar customs union with Belgium and Luxembourg (the Benelux group) paved the way for the formation of the European Community (precursor to the EU), of which the Netherlands was a founding member. Likewise, the Benelux abolition of internal border controls was a model for the wider Schengen Accord, which today has 29 European signatories (including the Netherlands) pledged to common visa policies and free movement of people across common borders.\nThe Dutch stood at the cradle of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty and have been the architects of the Treaty of Amsterdam concluded in 1998. The Dutch have thus played an important role in European political and monetary integration; indeed, until the year 2003, Dutchman Wim Duisenberg headed the European Central Bank. In addition, Dutch financial minister Gerrit Zalm was the main critic of the violation of the Stability and Growth Pact by France and Germany in 2004 and 2005.\nInvolvement in developing countries.\nThe Netherlands was the 9th-largest donor country in 2021, giving about $5\u00a0billion, about 0.5% of its gross national income (GNI), in official development assistance (ODA). The country contributes through multilateral channels, especially the United Nations Development Programme, the international financial institutions, and EU programs. A large portion of Dutch aid funds is also channeled through private (\"co-financing\") organizations that have almost total autonomy in choice of projects.\nThe Netherlands is a member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which recently initiated economic reforms in central Europe. The Dutch strongly support the Middle East peace process and in 1998 earmarked $29\u00a0million in contributions to international donor-coordinated activities for the occupied territories and also for projects in which they worked directly with Palestinian authorities. These projects included improving environmental conditions and support for multilateral programs in cooperation with local non-governmental organizations. In 1998, the Dutch provided significant amounts of aid to the former Yugoslavia and Africa. The Dutch consistently provide significant amounts of humanitarian relief aid to the victims of the worst natural disasters, such as Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in South and Southeast Asia, Hurricane Katrina in the United States in 2005, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and more recent catastrophes in Pakistan and Burma including Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013, and the 2015 Nepal earthquake.\nExport assistance grants.\n\"Developing countries aspiring to purchase foreign goods and services to invest in, inter alia, port facilities, roads, public transport, health care, or drinking water facilities may be eligible for a special Dutch grant facility. The grant facility, known as ORET (a Dutch acronym for Ontwikkelingsrelevante Exporttransacties, or Development-Related Export) serves to award grants to governments of developing countries for making payments to foreign suppliers.\"\nInternational organizations.\nAs a relatively small country, the Netherlands generally pursues its foreign policy interests within the framework of multilateral organizations. The Netherlands is an active and responsible participant in the United Nations system as well as other multilateral organizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), and International Monetary Fund.\nThe Netherlands is one of the founding members of what today is the European Union. It was one of the first countries to start European integration, through the Benelux in 1944 and the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. Being a small country with a history of neutrality it was the host country for the important Maastricht Treaty and Amsterdam Treaty and is the seat of the International Court of Justice.\nInternational issues.\nThe Dutch work with the U.S. and other countries on international programs against drug trafficking and organized crime. The Dutch-U.S. cooperation focuses on joint anti-drug operations in the Caribbean, including an agreement establishing Forward Operating Locations on the Dutch Kingdom islands of Cura\u00e7ao and Aruba. The Netherlands is a signatory to international counter-narcotics agreements, a member of the United Nations International Drug Control Program, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, and is a contributor to international counter-narcotics.\nFrom June 26 until December 22, 2006, two children, Ammar (12\u201313) and Sara (10\u201311), lived in the Dutch embassy in Damascus because of a child custody dispute between the Dutch mother, supported by Dutch law and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, and the Syrian father, supported by Syrian law (Syria is no participant of this convention). The children had been living in Syria since 2004, after an alleged international child abduction by the father from the Netherlands to Syria, during a family contact in which he supposedly would visit Paris with them. The children fled to the embassy because they would like to live with their mother in the Netherlands. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ben Bot traveled to Damascus, negotiated and on December 22 the children finally could return to the Netherlands.\nThe father claims that the Dutch government has promised not to prosecute him for the abduction. However, a Dutch prosecutor claims that he is free to prosecute the father and may well do that and that the Dutch have only retracted the international request to arrest him outside the Netherlands.\nMark Rutte's government provided materials to the Levant Front rebel group in Syria. In September 2018, the Dutch public prosecution department declared the Levant Front to be a \"criminal organisation of terrorist intent\", describing it as a \"salafist and jihadistic\" group that \"strives for the setting up of the caliphate\".\nIn July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including the Netherlands, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC condemning China's mistreatment of the Uyghurs as well as its mistreatment of other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the Xinjiang internment camps.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which the Netherlands maintains diplomatic relations with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21164", "revid": "21678789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21164", "title": "Drug policy of the Netherlands", "text": "While recreational use, possession and trade of non-medicinal drugs described by the Opium Law are all technically illegal under Dutch law, official policy since the late 20th century has been to openly tolerate all recreational use while tolerating possession and trade under certain circumstances. This pragmatic approach was motivated by the idea that a drug-free Dutch society is unrealistic and unattainable, and efforts would be better spent trying to minimize harm caused by recreational drug use. As a result of this gedoogbeleid (lit. \"tolerance policy\" or \"policy of tolerance\"), the Netherlands is typically seen as much more tolerant of drugs than most other countries.\nLegal distinctions are made in the Opium Law between drugs with a low risk of harm and/or addiction, called 'soft drugs', and drugs with a high risk of harm and/or addiction, called 'hard drugs'. Soft drugs include hash, marijuana, sleeping pills and sedatives, while hard drugs include heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD and ecstasy. Policy has been to largely tolerate the sale of soft drugs while strongly suppressing the sale, circulation and use of hard drugs, effectively separating it into two markets. Establishments that have been permitted to sell soft drugs under certain circumstances are called \"coffee shops\". Laws established in January 2013 required visitors of coffee shops to be Dutch residents, but these laws were only applied in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg after much local criticism. Possession of a soft drug for personal use in quantities below a certain threshold (5 grams of cannabis or 5 cannabis plants) is tolerated, but larger quantities or possession of hard drugs may lead to prosecution. Prosecution for possession, trade and (in some rare cases) use are typically handled by the municipal government except where large-scale criminal activity is suspected.\nNotably absent from toleration of drugs is its production, particularly the cultivation of cannabis. This has led to a seemingly paradoxical system where coffee shops are allowed to buy and sell soft drugs but where production is nearly always punished. Because coffee shops have to get their goods from somewhere, criticism has been raised over the years against continued prosecution of soft drug producers. It was first challenged in court in 2014 when a judge found two people guilty of producing cannabis in large quantities but refused to punish them. A significant change occurred in early 2017, when a slight majority in the House of Representatives allowed for a law to pass that would partly legalize production of cannabis. In late 2017, the newly formed coalition announced that they would seek to implement an experimental pilot program in smaller cities where coffee shops could acquire cannabis from a state-appointed producer. The program went into effect in two cities - Breda and Tilburg - in December 2023.\nWhile the legalization of cannabis remains controversial, the introduction of heroin-assisted treatment in 1998 has been lauded for considerably improving the health and social situation of opiate-dependent patients in the Netherlands.\nPublic health.\nLarge-scale dealing, production, import and export are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, even if it does not supply end users or \"coffeeshops\" with more than the allowed amounts. Exactly how coffeeshops get their supplies is rarely investigated, however. The average concentration of THC in the cannabis sold in coffeeshops has increased from 9% in 1998 to 18% in 2005. This means that less plant material has to be consumed to achieve the same effect. One of the reasons is plant breeding and use of greenhouse technology for illegal growing of cannabis in Netherlands.\nThe former minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner announced in June 2007 that cultivation of cannabis shall continue to be illegal.\nNon-enforcement.\nThe drug policy of the Netherlands is marked by its distinguishing between so called soft and hard drugs. An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug, is legal and a soft drug cannot be more dangerous to society if it is controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, and as a result the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.\nCannabis remains a controlled substance in the Netherlands and both possession and production for personal use are still misdemeanors, punishable by fines. Coffeeshops are also technically illegal but are flourishing nonetheless. However, a policy of non-enforcement has led to a situation where reliance upon non-enforcement has become common, and because of this the courts have ruled against the government when individual cases were prosecuted.\nThis is because the Dutch Ministry of Justice applies a \"gedoogbeleid\" (tolerance policy) with regard to the category of soft drugs: an official set of guidelines telling public prosecutors under which circumstances offenders should not be prosecuted. This is a more official version of a common practice in other European countries wherein law enforcement sets priorities regarding offenses on which it is important enough to spend limited resources.\nAccording to current \"gedoogbeleid\" the possession of a maximum amount of five grams cannabis for personal use is not prosecuted. Cultivation is treated in a similar way. Cultivation of 5 plants or less is usually not prosecuted when they are renounced by the cultivator.\nProponents of \"gedoogbeleid\" argue that such a policy practices more consistency in legal protection than without it. Opponents of the Dutch drug policy either call for full legalization, or argue that laws should penalize morally wrong or deviant behavior, whether enforceable or not. In the Dutch courts, however, it has long been determined that the institutionalized non-enforcement of statutes with well defined limits constitutes \"de facto\" decriminalization. The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties. A November 2008 poll showed that a 60% majority of the Dutch population support the legalisation of soft drugs. The same poll showed that 85% supported closing of all cannabis coffeeshops within 250 meters walking distance from schools.\nDrug law enforcement.\nImporting and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is hard drug trade, maximum 4 years for import or export of large quantities of cannabis. It is prohibited to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of any drug that affects driving ability to such an extent that you are unable to drive properly. (Section 8 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act section 1). The Dutch police have the right to do a drug test if they suspect influenced driving. For example, anybody involved in a traffic accident may be tested. Causing an accident that inflicts bodily harm, while under influence of any drug, is seen as a crime that may be punished by up to 3 years in prison (9 years in case of a fatal accident). Suspension of driving license is also normal in such a case (maximum 5 years). Amsterdam Airport Schiphol has long practiced a zero tolerance policy regarding airline passengers carrying drugs. In 2006 there were 20,769 drug crimes registered by public prosecutors and 4,392 persons received an unconditional prison sentence The rate of imprisonment for drug crimes is about the same as in Sweden, which has a zero tolerance policy for drug crimes.\nDespite the high priority given by the Dutch government to fighting illegal drug trafficking, the Netherlands continue to be an important transit point for drugs entering Europe. The Netherlands is a major producer and leading distributor of cannabis, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and other synthetic drugs, and a medium consumer of illicit drugs. Despite the crackdown by Interpol on traffic and illicit manufacture of temazepam, the country has also become a major exporter of illicit temazepam of the jelly variety, trafficking it to the United Kingdom and other European nations. The government has intensified cooperation with neighbouring countries and stepped up border controls. In recent years, it also introduced so-called 100% checks and body scans at Schiphol Airport on incoming flights from Dutch overseas territories Aruba and Netherlands Antilles to prevent importing cocaine by means of swallowing balloons by mules.\nAlthough drug use, as opposed to trafficking, is seen primarily as a public health issue, responsibility for drug policy is shared by both the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sports, and the Ministry of Justice.\nThe Netherlands spends more than \u20ac130 million annually on facilities for addicts, of which about fifty percent goes to drug addicts. The Netherlands has extensive demand reduction programs, reaching about ninety percent of the country's 25,000 to 28,000 hard drug users. The number of hard drug addicts has stabilized in the past few years and their average age has risen to 38 years, which is generally seen as a positive trend. Notably, the number of drug-related deaths in the country remains amongst the lowest in Europe as of 2008.\nOn 27 November 2003, the Dutch Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner announced that his government was considering rules under which coffeeshops would only be allowed to sell soft drugs to Dutch residents in order to satisfy both European neighbors' concerns about the influx of drugs from the Netherlands, as well as those of Netherlands border town residents unhappy with the influx of \"drug tourists\" from elsewhere in Europe. The European Court of Justice ruled in December 2010 that Dutch authorities can ban coffeeshops from selling cannabis to foreigners. The EU court said the southern Dutch city of Maastricht was within its rights when it introduced a \"weed passport\" in 2005 to prevent foreigners from entering caf\u00e9s that sell cannabis.\nIn 2010 the owner of Netherlands's largest cannabis selling coffeeshop was fined 10 million euros for breaking drug laws by keeping more than the tolerated amount of cannabis in the shop. He was also sentenced to a 16-week prison term.\nResults of the drug policy.\nCriminal investigations into more serious forms of organized crime mainly involve drugs (72%). Most of these are investigations of hard drug crime (specifically cocaine and synthetic drugs) although the number of soft drug cases is rising and currently accounts for 69% of criminal investigations.\nIn a study of the levels of cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, methamphetamine and other amphetamine in wastewater from 42 major cities in Europe Amsterdam came near the top of the list in every category but methamphetamine.\nThe Netherlands tolerates the sale of soft drugs in 'coffee shops'. A coffee shop is an establishment where cannabis may be sold subject to certain strict conditions, but no alcoholic drinks may be sold or consumed. The Dutch government does not prosecute members of the public for possession or use of small quantities of soft drugs.\nIn the province of North Brabant in the south of the Netherlands, organized crime organizations form the main producer of MDMA, amphetamine and cannabis in Europe. Together with the proximity of the ports of Antwerp and especially Rotterdam where heroin and cocaine enter the European continent, this causes these substances to be readily available for a relative low price. Therefore, there is a large quantity of drugs of a relative high purity/quality available. This means that users will not have to rely on more polluted substances with greater health risks. Together with an approach that focuses on easily accessible health care, harm reduction and prevention, this causes the medical condition of the Dutch addicts to be less severe than that of many other countries.\nImplications of international law.\nThe Netherlands is a party to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The 1961 convention prohibits cultivation and trade of naturally occurring drugs such as cannabis; the 1971 treaty bans the manufacture and trafficking of synthetic drugs such as barbiturates and amphetamines; and the 1988 convention requires states to criminalize illicit drug possession:\nSubject to its constitutional principles and the basic concepts of its legal system, each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances for personal consumption contrary to the provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended or the 1971 Convention.\nThe International Narcotics Control Board typically interprets this provision to mean that states must prosecute drug possession offenses. The conventions clearly state that controlled substances are to be restricted to scientific and medical uses. However, Cindy Fazey, former Chief of Demand Reduction for the United Nations Drug Control Programme, believes that the treaties have enough ambiguities and loopholes to allow some room to maneuver. In her report entitled \"The Mechanics and Dynamics of the UN System for International Drug Control\", she notes:\nMany countries have now decided not to use the full weight of criminal sanctions against people who are in possession of drugs that are for their personal consumption. The Conventions say that there must be an offence under domestic criminal law, it does not say that the law has to be enforced, or that when it is what sanctions should apply. . . . Despite such grey areas latitude is by no means unlimited. The centrality of the principle of limiting narcotic and psychotropic drugs for medical and scientific purposes leaves no room for the legal possibility of recreational use. . . . Nations may currently be pushing the boundaries of the international system, but the pursuit of any action to formally legalize non-medical and non-scientific drug use would require either treaty revision or a complete or partial withdrawal from the current regime.\nThe Dutch policy of keeping anti-drug laws on the books while limiting enforcement of certain offenses is carefully designed to reduce harm while still complying with the letter of international drug control treaties. This is necessary in order to avoid criticism from the International Narcotics Board, which historically has taken a dim view of any moves to relax official drug policy. In their annual report, the Board has criticised many governments, including Canada, for permitting the medicinal use of cannabis, Australia for providing injecting rooms and the United Kingdom for proposing to downgrade the classification of cannabis, which it has since done (although this change was reversed by the Home Secretary on 7 May 2008 against the advice of its own commissioned report).\nDevelopments from 2003\u20132015.\nThe liberal drug policy of the authorities in the Netherlands especially led to problems in \"border hot spots\" that attracted \"drug tourism\" as well as trafficking and related law enforcement problems in towns like Enschede in the East and Terneuzen, Venlo, Maastricht and Heerlen in the South. In 2006, Gerd Leers, then mayor of the border city of Maastricht, on the Dutch-Belgian border, criticised the current policy as inconsistent, by recording a song with the Dutch punk rock band De Heideroosjes. By allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis, but not cultivation or wholesale, the government creates numerous problems of crime and public safety, he alleges, and therefore he would like to switch to either legalising and regulating production, or to the full repression that his party (CDA) officially advocates. The latter suggestion has widely been interpreted as rhetorical. Leers's comments have garnered support from other local authorities and put the cultivation issue back on the agenda.\nIn November 2008, Pieter van Geel, the leader of the CDA (Christian Democrats) in the Dutch parliament, called for a ban on the caf\u00e9s where cannabis is sold. He said the practice of allowing so-called coffeeshops to operate had failed. The CDA had the support of its smaller coalition partner, the CU (ChristenUnie), but the third party in government, PvdA (Labour), opposed. The coalition agreement worked out by the three coalition parties in 2007 stated that there would be no change in the policy of tolerance. Prominent CDA member Gerd Leers spoke out against him: cannabis users who now cause no trouble would be viewed as criminals if an outright ban was to be implemented. Van Geel later said that he respected the coalition agreement and would not press for a ban during the current government's tenure.\n27 \"coffeeshops\" selling cannabis in Rotterdam, all within 200 metres of schools, were ordered to close down by 2009. This was nearly half of the \"coffeeshops\" that operated within its municipality. This was due to the new policy of city mayor Ivo Opstelten and the town council. The higher levels of the active ingredient in cannabis in the Netherlands create a growing opposition to the traditional Dutch view of cannabis as a relatively innocent soft drug. Supporters of \"coffeeshops\" state that such claims are often exaggerated and ignore the fact that higher content means a user needs to use less of the plant to get the desired effects, making it in effect safer. Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content. Closing of \"coffeeshops\" is not unique to Rotterdam. Many other towns have done the same in the last 10 years.\nIn 2008, the municipality of Utrecht imposed a Zero Tolerance Policy to all events like the big dance party Trance Energy held in Jaarbeurs. However, such zero-tolerance policy at dance parties are now becoming common in the Netherlands and are even stricter in cities like Arnhem.\nThe two towns Roosendaal and Bergen op Zoom announced in October 2008 that they would start closing all \"coffeeshops\", each week visited by up to 25,000 French and Belgian drug tourists, with closures beginning in February 2009.\nIn May 2011 the Dutch government announced that tourists are to be banned from Dutch coffeeshops, starting in the southern provinces and at the end of 2011 in the rest of the country. In a letter to the parliament, the Dutch health and justice ministers said that, \"In order to tackle the nuisance and criminality associated with coffeeshops and drug trafficking, the open-door policy of coffeeshops will end\".\nA government committee delivered in June 2011 a report about cannabis to the Dutch government. It includes a proposal that cannabis with more than 15 percent THC should be labeled as hard drugs. Higher concentrations of THC and drug tourism have challenged the current policy and led to a re-examination of the current approach; e.g. ban of all sales of cannabis to tourists in coffeeshops from end of 2011 was proposed but currently only the border city of Maastricht has adopted the measure in order to test out its feasibility. According to the initial measure, starting in 2012, each coffeeshop was to operate like a private club with some 1,000 to 1,500 members. In order to qualify for a membership card, applicants would have to be adult Dutch citizens, membership was only to be allowed in one club.\nIn Amsterdam 26 coffeeshops in the De Wallen area were ordered to close their doors between 1 September 2012 and 31 August 2015.\nA Dutch judge has ruled that tourists can legally be banned from entering cannabis caf\u00e9s, as part of new restrictions which come into force in 2012.\nA study conducted by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction report that 25.3% of Irish people smoked cannabis at some stage in their life, and 25.7% of Dutch people have tried cannabis.\nLaw banning \"magic mushrooms\".\nIn October 2007, the prohibition of psychedelic or \"magic mushrooms\" was announced by the Dutch authorities.\nOn 25 April 2008, the Dutch government, backed by a majority of members of parliament, decided to ban cultivation and use of all magic mushrooms. Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen proposed a three-day cooling period in which clients would be informed three days before actually procuring the mushrooms and if they would still like to go through with it they could pick up their spores from the smart shop.\nThe ban has been considered a retreat from liberal drug policies. This followed a few deadly incidents mostly involving tourists. These deaths were not directly caused by the use of the drug \"per se\", but by deadly accidents occurring while under the influence of magic mushrooms.\nAs of 1 December 2008, all psychedelic mushrooms are banned. However, sclerotia (what are termed as \"truffles\" and which have similar effects to magic mushrooms), mushroom spores, and active mycellium cultures remain legal and are readily available in \"smartshops\", which are urban stores that sell legal drugs, herbs and related gadgets.\nSupply control.\nThe relatively recent increase in the cocaine trafficking business has been largely focused on the Caribbean area. Since early 2003, a special law court with prison facilities has been operational at Schiphol airport. Since the beginning of 2005, there has been 100% control of all flights from key countries in the Caribbean. In 2004, an average of 290 drug couriers per month were arrested, decreasing to 80 per month by early 2006.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, \"11\" represents the number \"eleven\" in the decimal or base-10 numeral system (today, the most common system globally), the number \"three\" in the binary or base-2 numeral system (used in modern computers), and the number \"two\" in the unary numeral system (used in tallying scores).\nThe number the numeral represents is called its \"value\". Additionally, not all number systems can represent the same set of numbers; for example, Roman, Greek, and Egyptian numerals don't have an official representation of the number zero.\nIdeally, a numeral system will:\nFor example, the usual decimal representation gives every nonzero natural number a unique representation as a finite sequence of digits, beginning with a non-zero digit.\nNumeral systems are sometimes called \"number systems\", but that name is ambiguous, as it could refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of real numbers, the system of complex numbers, various hypercomplex number systems, the system of \"p\"-adic numbers, etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.\nHistory.\nEarly numeral systems varied across civilizations, with the Babylonians using a base-60 system, the Egyptians developing hieroglyphic numerals, and the Chinese employing rod numerals. The Mayans independently created a vigesimal (base-20) system that included a symbol for zero. Indian mathematicians, such as Brahmagupta in the 7th century, played a crucial role in formalizing arithmetic rules and the concept of zero, which was later refined by scholars like Al-Khwarizmi in the Islamic world. As these numeral systems evolved, the efficiency of positional notation and the inclusion of zero helped shape modern numerical representation, influencing global commerce, science, and technology. The first true written positional numeral system is considered to be the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system. This system was established by the 7th\u00a0century in India, but was not yet in its modern form because the use of the digit zero had not yet been widely accepted. Instead of a zero sometimes the digits were marked with dots to indicate their significance, or a space was used as a placeholder. The first widely acknowledged use of zero was in 876. The original numerals were very similar to the modern ones, even down to the glyphs used to represent digits.\nBy the 13th century, Western Arabic numerals were accepted in European mathematical circles (Fibonacci used them in his ). Initially met with resistance, Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals gained wider acceptance in Europe due to their efficiency in arithmetic operations, particularly in banking and trade. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century helped standardize their use, as printed mathematical texts favored this system over Roman numerals. They began to enter common use in the 15th\u00a0century. By the 17th century, the system had become dominant in scientific works, influencing mathematical advancements by figures like Isaac Newton and Ren\u00e9 Descartes. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the widespread adoption of Arabic numerals facilitated global finance, engineering, and technological developments, forming the foundation for modern computing and digital data representation. By the end of the 20th\u00a0century virtually all non-computerized calculations in the world were done with Arabic numerals, which have replaced native numeral systems in most cultures.\nOther historical numeral systems using digits.\nThe exact age of the Maya numerals is unclear, but it is possible that it is older than the Hindu\u2013Arabic system. The system was vigesimal (base\u00a020), so it has twenty digits. The Mayas used a shell symbol to represent zero. Numerals were written vertically, with the ones place at the bottom. The Mayas had no equivalent of the modern decimal separator, so their system could not represent fractions.\nThe Thai numeral system is identical to the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system except for the symbols used to represent digits. The use of these digits is less common in Thailand than it once was, but they are still used alongside Arabic numerals.\nThe rod numerals, the written forms of counting rods once used by Chinese and Japanese mathematicians, are a decimal positional system used for performing decimal calculations. Rods were placed on a counting board and slid forwards or backwards to change the decimal place. The \"S\u016bnz\u012d Su\u00e0nj\u012bng\", a mathematical treatise dated to between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD, provides detailed instructions for the system, which is thought to have been in use since at least the 4th century BC. Zero was not initially treated as a number, but as a vacant position. Later sources introduced conventions for the expression of zero and negative numbers. The use of a round symbol for zero is first attested in the \"Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections\" of 1247 AD. The origin of this symbol is unknown; it may have been produced by modifying a square symbol. The Suzhou numerals, a descendant of rod numerals, are still used today for some commercial purposes.\nMain numeral systems.\nThe most commonly used system of numerals is decimal. Indian mathematicians are credited with developing the integer version, the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system. Aryabhata of Kusumapura developed the place-value notation in the 5th\u00a0century and a century later Brahmagupta introduced the symbol for zero. The system slowly spread to other surrounding regions like Arabia due to their commercial and military activities with India. Middle-Eastern mathematicians extended the system to include negative powers of 10 (fractions), as recorded in a treatise by Syrian mathematician Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi in 952\u2013953, and the decimal point notation was introduced by Sind ibn Ali, who also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals. The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system then spread to Europe due to merchants trading, and the digits used in Europe are called Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs.\nThe simplest numeral system is the unary numeral system, in which every natural number is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol / is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by ///////. Tally marks represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it plays an important role in theoretical computer science. Elias gamma coding, which is commonly used in data compression, expresses arbitrarily sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral.\nThe unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, these values are powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, \u2212 for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as +++ //// and the number 123 as + \u2212 \u2212 /// without any need for zero. This is called sign-value notation. The ancient Egyptian numeral system was of this type, and the Roman numeral system was a modification of this idea.\nMore useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for \"one occurrence\", B \"two occurrences\", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304 (the number of these abbreviations is sometimes called the \"base\" of the system). This system is used when writing Chinese numerals and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the English language is of this type (\"three hundred [and] four\"), as are those of other spoken languages, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is \"soixante dix-neuf\" (60 + 10 + 9) and in Welsh is \"pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain\" (4 + (5 + 10) + (3 \u00d7 20)) or (somewhat archaic) \"pedwar ugain namyn un\" (4 \u00d7 20 \u2212 1). In English, one could say \"four score less one\", as in the famous Gettysburg Address representing \"87 years ago\" as \"four score and seven years ago\".\nMore elegant is a \"positional system\", also known as place-value notation. The positional systems are classified by their \"base\" or \"radix\", which is the number of symbols called \"digits\" used by the system. In base\u00a010, ten different digits 0,\u00a0..., 9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with, as in 304 \n 3\u00d7100 + 0\u00d710 + 4\u00d71 or more precisely 3\u00d7102 + 0\u00d7101 + 4\u00d7100. Zero, which is not needed in the other systems, is of crucial importance here, in order to be able to \"skip\" a power. The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and is now used throughout the world, is a positional base\u00a010 system.\nArithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones; furthermore, additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10; a positional system needs only ten different symbols (assuming that it uses base\u00a010).\nThe positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing. The base\u00a01000 is also used (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit. This is the meaning of the common notation 1,000,234,567 used for very large numbers.\nIn computers, the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base\u00a02 (binary numeral system), with two binary digits, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three (octal numeral system) or four (hexadecimal numeral system) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases\u00a0232 or 264 (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the machine word) are used, as, for example, in GMP.\nIn certain biological systems, the unary coding system is employed. Unary numerals used in the neural circuits responsible for birdsong production. The nucleus in the brain of the songbirds that plays a part in both the learning and the production of bird song is the HVC (high vocal center). The command signals for different notes in the birdsong emanate from different points in the HVC. This coding works as space coding which is an efficient strategy for biological circuits due to its inherent simplicity and robustness.\nThe numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the arithmetic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the geometric numerals (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the Ionic system), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses \"both\" arithmetic and geometric numerals.\nIn some areas of computer science, a modified base \"k\" positional system is used, called bijective numeration, with digits 1, 2,\u00a0..., \"k\" (\"k\" \u2265 1), and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a bijection between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by leading zeros. Bijective base-\"k\" numeration is also called \"k\"-adic notation, not to be confused with \"p\"-adic numbers. Bijective base\u00a01 is the same as unary.\nPositional systems in detail.\nIn a positional base \"b\" numeral system (with \"b\" a natural number greater than 1 known as the radix or \"base\" of the system), \"b\" basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first \"b\" natural numbers including zero are used. To generate the rest of the numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by \"b\".\nFor example, in the decimal system (base 10), the numeral 4327 means (4\u00d7103) + (3\u00d7102) + (2\u00d7101) + (7\u00d7100), noting that 100 \n 1.\nIn general, if \"b\" is the base, one writes a number in the numeral system of base \"b\" by expressing it in the form \"a\"\"n\"\"b\"\"n\" + \"a\"\"n\" \u2212 1\"b\"\"n\" \u2212 1 + \"a\"\"n\" \u2212 2\"b\"\"n\" \u2212 2 + ... + \"a\"0\"b\"0 and writing the enumerated digits \"a\"\"n\"\"a\"\"n\" \u2212 1\"a\"\"n\" \u2212 2 ... \"a\"0 in descending order. The digits are natural numbers between 0 and \"b\" \u2212 1, inclusive.\nIf a text (such as this one) discusses multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, the base (itself represented in base\u00a010) is added in subscript to the right of the number, like this: numberbase. Unless specified by context, numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal.\nBy using a dot to divide the digits into two groups, one can also write fractions in the positional system. For example, the base\u00a02 numeral 10.11 denotes 1\u00d721 + 0\u00d720 + 1\u00d72\u22121 + 1\u00d72\u22122 \n 2.75.\nIn general, numbers in the base \"b\" system are of the form:\nformula_1\nThe numbers \"b\"\"k\" and \"b\"\u2212\"k\" are the weights of the corresponding digits. The position \"k\" is the logarithm of the corresponding weight \"w\", that is formula_2. The highest used position is close to the order of magnitude of the number.\nThe number of tally marks required in the unary numeral system for \"describing the weight\" would have been w. In the positional system, the number of digits required to describe it is only formula_3, for \"k\" \u2265 0. For example, to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because formula_4. The number of digits required to \"describe the position\" is formula_5 (in positions 1, 10, 100... only for simplicity in the decimal example).\nformula_6\nA number has a terminating or repeating expansion if and only if it is rational; this does not depend on the base. A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another (thus 0.310 \n 0.0100110011001...2). An irrational number stays aperiodic (with an infinite number of non-repeating digits) in all integral bases. Thus, for example in base\u00a02, can be written as the aperiodic 11.001001000011111...2.\nPutting overscores, \"n\", or dots, \"\u1e45\", above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions. Thus:\n14/11 = 1.272727272727... = 1.27 \u00a0 or \u00a0 321.3217878787878... = 321.32178.\nIf \"b\" = \"p\" is a prime number, one can define base-\"p\" numerals whose expansion to the left never stops; these are called the \"p\"-adic numbers.\nIt is also possible to define a variation of base \"b\" in which digits may be positive or negative; this is called a signed-digit representation.\nGeneralized variable-length integers.\nMore general is using a mixed radix notation (here written little-endian) like formula_7 for formula_8, etc.\nThis is used in Punycode, one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non-negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters, of \"digits\" from a collection of 36: a\u2013z and 0\u20139, representing 0\u201325 and 26\u201335 respectively. There are also so-called threshold values (formula_9) which are fixed for every position in the number. A digit formula_10 (in a given position in the number) that is lower than its corresponding threshold value formula_11 means that it is the most-significant digit, hence in the string this is the end of the number, and the next symbol (if present) is the least-significant digit of the next number.\nFor example, if the threshold value for the first digit is \"b\" (i.e. 1) then \"a\" (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, first-digit range is only b\u20139 (i.e. 1\u201335), therefore the weight \"b\"1 is 35 instead of 36. More generally, if \"tn\" is the threshold for the \"n\"-th digit, it is easy to show that formula_12.\nSuppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are \"c\" (i.e. 2), then the second-digit range is a\u2013b (i.e. 0\u20131) with the second digit being most significant, while the range is c\u20139 (i.e. 2\u201335) in the presence of a third digit. Generally, for any \"n\", the weight of the (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)-th digit is the weight of the previous one times (36 \u2212 threshold of the \"n\"-th digit). So the weight of the second symbol is formula_13. And the weight of the third symbol is formula_14.\nSo we have the following sequence of the numbers with at most 3 digits:\n\"a\" (0), \"ba\" (1), \"ca\" (2), ..., 9\"a\" (35), \"bb\" (36), \"cb\" (37), ..., 9\"b\" (70), \"bca\" (71), ..., 99\"a\" (1260), \"bcb\" (1261), ..., 99\"b\" (2450).\nUnlike a regular \"n\"-based numeral system, there are numbers like 9\"b\" where 9 and \"b\" each represent 35; yet the representation is unique because \"ac\" and \"aca\" are not allowed \u2013 the first \"a\" would terminate each of these numbers.\nThe flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization for number of digits depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes.\nThe case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to bijective numeration, where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero."}

The vast majority of languages in the world are natural languages. As a category, natural language includes both standard dialects (ones with high social prestige) as well as nonstandard or vernacular dialects. \nEven an official language with a regulating academy such as Standard French, overseen by the , is still classified as a natural language (e.g. in the field of natural language processing), as its prescriptive aspects do not make it regulated enough to be considered a constructed or controlled natural language. Linguists broadly consider writing to be a static visual representation of a particular natural language, though, in many cases in highly literate modern societies, writing itself can also be considered natural language.\nExcluded from the definition of natural language are: artificial and constructed languages, such as those developed for works of fiction; languages of formal logic, such as those in computer programming; and non-human communication systems in nature, such as whale vocalizations or honey bees' waggle dance. The academic consensus is that particular key features prevent animal communication systems from being classified as languages at all. Certain human communication or linguistic systems with no native speakers, as sometimes used in cross-cultural contexts, are also not natural languages.\nControlled languages.\nControlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce ambiguity and complexity. This may be accomplished by decreasing usage of superlative or adverbial forms, or irregular verbs. Typical purposes for developing and implementing a controlled natural language are to aid understanding by non-native speakers or to ease computer processing. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is Simplified Technical English, which was originally developed for aerospace and avionics industry manuals.\nInternational constructed languages.\nBeing constructed, International auxiliary languages such as Esperanto and Interlingua are not considered natural languages, with the possible exception of true native speakers of such languages. Natural languages evolve, through fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax, to incrementally improve human communication. In contrast, Esperanto was created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in the late 19th century.\nSome natural languages have become organically \"standardized\" through the synthesis of two or more pre-existing natural languages over a relatively short period of time through the development of a pidgin, which is not considered a language, into a stable creole language. A creole such as Haitian Creole has its own grammar, vocabulary and literature. It is spoken by over 10 million people worldwide and is one of the two official languages of the Republic of Haiti.\nAs of 1996, there were 350 attested families with one or more native speakers of Esperanto. Latino sine flexione, another international auxiliary language, is no longer widely spoken.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Flaherty\nNanook of the North is a 1922 American silent film that combines elements of documentary and docudrama/docufiction, at a time when the concept of separating films into documentary and drama did not yet exist. In the tradition of what would later be called salvage ethnography, the film follows the struggles of the Inuk man named Nanook and his family in the Canadian Arctic. It is written and directed by Robert J. Flaherty, who also served as cinematographer, editor, and producer.\nSome have criticized Flaherty for staging several sequences, but the film has been described by Roger Ebert as \"stand[ing] alone\" among Flaherty's films \"in its stark regard for the courage and ingenuity of its heroes.\"\nIt was the first feature-length documentary to achieve commercial success, proving the financial viability of the genre and inspiring many films to come.\nIn 1989, \"Nanook of the North\" was among the first group of 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nThe documentary follows the lives of an Inuk, Nanook, and his family as they travel, search for food, and trade in the Ungava Peninsula of northern Quebec, Canada. Nanook, his wife Nyla and their family are introduced as fearless heroes who endure rigors no other race could survive. The audience sees Nanook, often with his family, hunt a walrus, build an igloo, go about his day, and perform other tasks.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1910, Flaherty was hired by Sir William Mackenzie as an explorer and prospector searching for iron ore and other mineral deposits along the Hudson Bay for the Canadian Northern Railway. Learning about the lands and people there, Flaherty decided on his third expedition in 1913 to bring with him a glass-plate still camera and movie camera as well as a small portable printer and processor. Knowing nothing about film, he took a three-week course on the elementary techniques of filmmaking and film processing with the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York.\nFilming.\nUsing a Bell &amp; Howell camera, a portable developing and printing machine, and some lighting equipment, Flaherty spent 1914 and 1915 shooting hours of film of Inuit life. By 1916, Flaherty had enough footage to begin evaluating screenings and was met with wide enthusiasm. However, in 1916, Flaherty dropped a cigarette onto the original camera negative (which was highly flammable nitrate stock) and lost 30,000 feet of film. With his first attempt ruined, Flaherty decided to not only return for new footage, but also to refocus the film on one Inuit family as he felt his earlier footage was too much like a travelogue. Spending four years raising money, Flaherty was eventually funded by French fur company Revillon Fr\u00e8res and returned to the North and shot from August 1920 to August 1921. As a main character, Flaherty chose the celebrated hunter of the Itivimuit tribe, Allakariallak. The full collaboration of the Inuit was key to Flaherty's success as the Inuit were his film crew and many of them knew his camera better than he did.\nBuilding of the igloo.\nThe building of the igloo is one of the most celebrated sequences in the film, but interior photography presented a problem. Building an igloo large enough for a camera to enter resulted in the dome collapsing, and when they finally succeeded in making the igloo it was too dark for photography. Instead, the images of the inside of the igloo in the film were actually shot in a special three-walled igloo for Flaherty's bulky camera so that there would be enough light for it to capture interior shots. This instead is what Flaherty said: \"The average Eskimo igloo, about 12 feet in diameter, was much too small. On the dimensions I laid out for him, a diameter of 25 feet, Nanook and his companions started to build the biggest igloo of their lives. For two days they worked, the women and children helping them. Then came the hard part\u2014to cut insets for the five large slab-ice windows without weakening the dome. They had hardly begun when the dome fell into pieces to the ground. 'Never mind,' said Nanook, 'I can do it next time.' For two days more they worked, but again with the same result; as soon as they began sitting in the ice windows their structure fell to the ground. It was a huge joke by this time and holding their sides they laughed their misfortune away. Again, Nanook began on the 'big Aggie igloo', but this time the women and children hauled barrels of water on sledges from the waterhole and iced the walls as they went up. Finally, the igloo was finished, and they stood eyeing it as satisfied as so many small children over a house of blocks. The light from the ice-windows proved inadequate, however, and when the interiors were finally filmed the dome's half just over the camera had to be cut away, so Nanook and his family went to sleep and awakened with all the cold of out-of-doors pouring in.\"\nControversy.\nHoax claims.\n\"Nanook\" was in fact named Allakariallak (); Flaherty chose \"Nanook\" (\"polar bear\" in Inuktitut mythology) because he felt its seeming genuineness made it more marketable. The \"wife\" shown in the film was not really his wife. According to Charlie Nayoumealuk, who was interviewed in \"Nanook Revisited\" (1990), \"the two women in \"Nanook\" \u2013 Nyla (Alice [?] Nuvalinga) and Cunayou (whose real name we do not know) were not Allakariallak's wives, but were in fact common-law wives of Flaherty.\" Nyla's real name was later revealed as Maggie Nujarluktuk, and she would later give birth to Flaherty's son, Josephie. And although Allakariallak normally used a gun when hunting, Flaherty encouraged him to hunt after the fashion of his recent ancestors in order to capture the way the Inuit lived before European colonization of the Americas. Flaherty also exaggerated the peril to Inuit hunters with his claim, often repeated, that Allakariallak had died of starvation less than two years after the film was completed, whereas in fact he died at home, likely of tuberculosis.\nFurthermore, it has been criticized for portraying Inuit as without technology or culture, and situates them outside modern history. It was also criticized for comparing Inuit to animals. The film is considered by some to be an artifact of popular culture at the time and also a result of a historical fascination for Inuit performers in exhibitions, zoos, fairs, museums and early cinema.\nFlaherty defended his work by stating, \"one often has to distort a thing in order to catch its true spirit.\" Later filmmakers have pointed out that the only cameras available to Flaherty at the time were both large and immobile, making it impossible to effectively capture most interior shots or unstructured exterior scenes without significantly modifying the environment and subject action.\nVisit to the trading post.\nIn one scene, Nanook and his family arrive in a kayak at the trading post. Going to trade his hunt from the year, including the skins of foxes, seals, and polar bears, Nanook comes in contact with white people and there is an amusing interaction as the two cultures meet. The trader plays music on a gramophone and tries to explain how a man 'cans' his voice. Bending forward and staring at the machine, Nanook puts his ear closer as the trader cranks the mechanism again. The trader removes the record and hands it to Nanook who at first peers at it and then puts it in his mouth and bites it. The scene is meant to be a comical one as the audience laughs at the naivete of Nanook and people isolated from Western culture. In truth, the scene was entirely scripted and Allakariallak knew what a gramophone was.\nHunting of the walrus.\nIt has been noted that in the 1920s, when Nanook was filmed, the Inuit had already begun integrating the use of Western clothing and were using rifles to hunt rather than harpoons, but this does not negate that the Inuit knew how to make traditional clothing from animals found in their environment, could still fashion traditional weapons and were perfectly able to make use of them if found to be preferable for a given situation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The film is not technically sophisticated; how could it be, with one camera, no lights, freezing cold, and everyone equally at the mercy of nature? But it has an authenticity that prevails over any complaints that some of the sequences were staged. If you stage a walrus hunt, it still involves hunting a walrus, and the walrus hasn't seen the script. What shines through is the humanity and optimism of the Inuit.\u2014\u200a\nReception.\nAs the first \"nonfiction\" work of its scale, \"Nanook of the North\" was ground-breaking cinema. It captured many authentic details of a culture little known to outsiders, and it was filmed in a remote location. Hailed almost unanimously by critics, the film was a box-office success in the United States and abroad. In the following years, many others would try to follow Flaherty's success with \"primitive peoples\" films. In \"The Nation\" in 1946, critic James Agee wrote: \"\"Nanook\" has a beautiful simplicity, cheer, and hardiness which no subsequent documentary has improved on and which most have lost or perverted.\" In 2005, film critic Roger Ebert described the film's central figure, Nanook, as \"one of the most vital and unforgettable human beings ever recorded on film.\" In a 2014 \"Sight and Sound\" poll, film critics voted \"Nanook of the North\" the seventh-best documentary film of all time.\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 8.68/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \"An enthralling documentary and a visual feat, \"Nanook of the North\" fascinates with its dramatic depiction of life in an extremely hostile environment.\"\nHome media.\nIn 1999, \"Nanook of the North\" was digitally remastered and released on DVD by The Criterion Collection. It includes an interview with Flaherty's widow (and \"Nanook of the North\" co-editor), Frances Flaherty, photos from Flaherty's trip to the arctic, and excerpts from a TV documentary, \"Flaherty and Film.\" In 2013, Flicker Alley released a remastered Blu-ray version that includes six other arctic films.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21175", "revid": "50479220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21175", "title": "Nitrogen", "text": "element with atomic number 7 (N)\nNitrogen is a chemical element; it has symbol N and atomic number 7. Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \"azote\", from the \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N\u2261N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems. Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue.\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.\nHistory.\nNitrogen compounds have a very long history, ammonium chloride having been known to Herodotus. They were well known by the Middle Ages. Alchemists knew nitric acid as \"aqua fortis\" (strong water), as well as other nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts and nitrate salts. The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as \"aqua regia\" (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold, the king of metals.\nThe discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it \"noxious air\". Though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance, he clearly distinguished it from Joseph Black's \"fixed air\", or carbon dioxide. The fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to Rutherford, although he was not aware that it was an element. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley, who referred to it as \"burnt air\" or \"phlogisticated air\". French chemist Antoine Lavoisier referred to nitrogen gas as \"mephitic air\" or \"azote\", from the Greek word (azotikos), \"no life\", because it is asphyxiant. In an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, animals died and flames were extinguished. Though Lavoisier's name was not accepted in English since it was pointed out that all gases but oxygen are either asphyxiant or outright toxic, it is used in many languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Albanian, Turkish, etc.; the German \"Stickstoff\" similarly refers to the same characteristic, viz. \"ersticken\" \"to choke or suffocate\") and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds, such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion. Finally, it led to the name \"pnictogens\" for the group headed by nitrogen, from the Greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \"to choke\".\nThe English word nitrogen (1794) entered the language from the French , coined in 1790 by French chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756\u20131832), from the French \"nitre\" (potassium nitrate, also called saltpetre) and the French suffix \"-g\u00e8ne\", \"producing\", from the Greek -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 (-genes, \"begotten\"). Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of nitric acid, which in turn was produced from nitre. In earlier times, nitre had been confused with Egyptian \"natron\" (sodium carbonate)\u00a0\u2013 called \u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (nitron) in Greek\u00a0\u2013 which, despite the name, contained no nitrate.\nThe earliest military, industrial, and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpetre (sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate), most notably in gunpowder, and later as fertiliser. In 1910, Lord Rayleigh discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced \"active nitrogen\", a monatomic allotrope of nitrogen. The \"whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light\" produced by his apparatus reacted with mercury to produce explosive mercury nitride.\nFor a long time, sources of nitrogen compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank\u2013Caro process (1895\u20131899) and Haber\u2013Bosch process (1908\u20131913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, to the extent that half of global food production now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.\nProperties.\nAtomic.\nA nitrogen atom has seven electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It, therefore, has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It has one of the highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). (The light noble gases, helium, neon, and argon, would presumably also be more electronegative, and in fact are on the Allen scale.) Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71\u00a0pm is smaller than those of boron (84\u00a0pm) and carbon (76\u00a0pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66\u00a0pm) and fluorine (57\u00a0pm). The nitride anion, N3\u2212, is much larger at 146\u00a0pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2\u2212: 140\u00a0pm) and fluoride (F\u2212: 133\u00a0pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577\u00a0MJ\u00b7mol\u22121, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is . Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.\nThe lack of radial nodes in the 2p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the p-block, especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating orbital hybridisation. It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities. Hypervalency is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich three-center four-electron bond since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.\nNitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours' carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Although each period 2 element from lithium to oxygen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group (from magnesium to chlorine; these are known as diagonal relationships), their degree drops off abruptly past the boron\u2013silicon pair. The similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present.\nNitrogen does not share the proclivity of carbon for catenation. Like carbon, nitrogen tends to form ionic or metallic compounds with metals. Nitrogen forms an extensive series of nitrides with carbon, including those with chain-, graphitic-, and fullerenic-like structures.\nIt resembles oxygen with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. There are some parallels between the chemistry of ammonia NH3 and water H2O. For example, the capacity of both compounds to be protonated to give NH4+ and H3O+ or deprotonated to give NH2\u2212 and OH\u2212, with all of these able to be isolated in solid compounds.\nNitrogen shares with both its horizontal neighbours a preference for forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, oxygen, or other nitrogen atoms, through p\"\u03c0\"\u2013p\"\u03c0\" interactions. Thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and therefore has very much lower melting (\u2212210\u00a0\u00b0C) and boiling points (\u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen. Setting aside their differences, nitrogen and phosphorus form an extensive series of compounds with one another; these have chain, ring, and cage structures.\nTable of thermal and physical properties of nitrogen (N2) at atmospheric pressure:\nIsotopes.\nNitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N. The first is much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is slightly heavier) makes up the remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007\u00a0u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common as its proton capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N is one of the five stable odd\u2013odd nuclides (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.\nThe relative abundance of 14N and 15N is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid. Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.\nThe heavy isotope 15N was first discovered by S. M. Naud\u00e9 in 1929, and soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more common 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called \"\u03b4\"15N.\nOf the thirteen other isotopes produced synthetically, ranging from 9N to 23N, 13N has a half-life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives less than eight seconds. Given the half-life difference, 13N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in positron emission tomography (PET), although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of 16O producing 13N and an alpha particle.\nThe radioisotope 16N is the dominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction, in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1\u00a0s, but its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7\u00a0MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation. It is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle and is the primary means of detection for such leaks.\nAllotropes.\nAtomic nitrogen, also known as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three unpaired electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1\u20132\u00a0mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.\nGiven the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at \u2212210\u00a0\u00b0C and boils at \u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, but it will nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N\u2261N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76\u00a0pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41\u00a0kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's low level of chemical reactivity.\nAt atmospheric pressure, molecular nitrogen condenses (liquefies) at 77\u00a0K (\u2212195.79\u00a0\u00b0C) and freezes at 63\u00a0K (\u2212210.01\u00a0\u00b0C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4\u00a0K (\u2212237.6\u00a0\u00b0C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808\u00a0g/mL), is a common cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows in the form of glaciers, and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.\nOther allotropes of nitrogen exist or have been explored theoretically. Beyond dinitrogen, chemists have long sought to synthesize and stabilize other neutral allotropes, which are typically much less stable and often exist only fleetingly or under extreme conditions. These chemicals may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives.\nChemistry and compounds.\nDinitrogen complexes.\nThe first example of a dinitrogen complex to be discovered was [Ru(NH3)5(N2)]2+ (see figure at right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one lone pair of electrons to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers.\nDinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M\u2190N\u2261N (\"\u03b7\"1) and M\u2190N\u2261N\u2192M (\"\u03bc\", bis-\"\u03b7\"1), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations (\"\u03bc\", bis-\"\u03b7\"2) or to just one (\"\u03b7\"2). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (\"\u03bc\"3-N2). A few complexes feature multiple N2 ligands and some feature N2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N2 is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide (CO) and acetylene (C2H2), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in carbonyl compounds, although N2 is a weaker \"\u03c3\"-donor and \"\u03c0\"-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that \"\u03c3\" donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the M\u2013N bond than \"\u03c0\" back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N\u2013N bond, and end-on (\"\u03b7\"1) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (\"\u03b7\"2) donation.\nToday, dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the transition metals, accounting for several hundred compounds. They are normally prepared by three methods:\nOccasionally the N\u2261N bond may be formed directly within a metal complex, for example by directly reacting coordinated ammonia (NH3) with nitrous acid (HNO2), but this is not generally applicable. Most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white-yellow-orange-red-brown; a few exceptions are known, such as the blue [{Ti(\"\u03b7\"5-C5H5)2}2-(N2)].\nNitrides, azides, and nitrido complexes.\nNitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first two noble gases, helium and neon, and some of the very short-lived elements after bismuth, creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications. Many binary compounds are known: with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides, oxides, and fluorides, these are typically called nitrides. Many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements (e.g. MnN, Mn6N5, Mn3N2, Mn2N, Mn4N, and Mn\"x\"N for 9.2 &lt; \"x\" &lt; 25.3). They may be classified as \"salt-like\" (mostly ionic), covalent, \"diamond-like\", and metallic (or interstitial), although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies. They are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia (sometimes after heating), or by thermal decomposition of metal amides:\n3 Ca + N2 \u2192 Ca3N2\n3 Mg + 2 NH3 \u2192 Mg3N2 + 3 H2 (at 900\u00a0\u00b0C)\n3 Zn(NH2)2 \u2192 Zn3N2 + 4 NH3\nMany variants on these processes are possible. The most ionic of these nitrides are those of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, Li3N (Na, K, Rb, and Cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons) and M3N2 (M = Be, Mg, Ca Sr, Ba). These can formally be thought of as salts of the N3\u2212 anion, although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements. However, the alkali metal azides NaN3 and KN3, featuring the linear N3- anion, are well-known, as are Sr(N3)2 and Ba(N3)2. Azides of the B-subgroup metals (those in groups 11 through 16) are much less ionic, have more complicated structures, and detonate readily when shocked.\nMany covalent binary nitrides are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent silicon nitride (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride, in particular, would make a promising ceramic if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B\u2013N unit is isoelectronic to C\u2013C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron\u2013nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine (\"inorganic benzene\"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.\nThe largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500\u00a0\u00b0C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.\nThe nitride anion (N3\u2212) is the strongest \"\u03c0\" donor known among ligands (the second-strongest is O2\u2212). Nitrido complexes are generally made by the thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia, and they usually involve a terminal {\u2261N}3\u2212 group. The linear azide anion (N3-), being isoelectronic with nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and cyanate, forms many coordination complexes. Further catenation is rare, although N44- (isoelectronic with carbonate and nitrate) is known.\nHydrides.\nIndustrially, ammonia (NH3) is the most important compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (\u221278\u00a0\u00b0C) and boiling (\u221233\u00a0\u00b0C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant, and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH3 is weaker than that in H2O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH3 rather than two in H2O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution (p\"K\"\"b\" 4.74); its conjugate acid is ammonium, NH4+. It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, NH2-. It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride. Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.\nMany other binary nitrogen hydrides are known, but the most important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similar to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0\u00a0\u00b0C, boiling point 113.5\u00a0\u00b0C, density 1.00\u00a0g/cm3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.\nHydrazine is generally made by reaction of ammonia with alkaline sodium hypochlorite in the presence of gelatin or glue:\nNH3 + OCl\u2212 \u2192 NH2Cl + OH\u2212\nNH2Cl + NH3 \u2192 N2H5+ + Cl\u2212 (slow)\nN2H5+ + OH\u2212 \u2192 N2H4 + H2O (fast)\n(The attacks by hydroxide and ammonia may be reversed, thus passing through the intermediate NHCl\u2212 instead.) The reason for adding gelatin is that it removes metal ions such as Cu2+ that catalyses the destruction of hydrazine by reaction with monochloramine (NH2Cl) to produce ammonium chloride and nitrogen.\nHydrogen azide (HN3) was first produced in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell and is a potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.\nHalides and oxohalides.\nAll four simple nitrogen trihalides are known. A few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known, but are mostly unstable; examples include NClF2, NCl2F, NBrF2, NF2H, NFH2, NCl2H, and NClH2.\nNitrogen trifluoride (NF3, first prepared in 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily produced by the electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Like carbon tetrafluoride, it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with copper, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine (N2F4). The cations NF4+ and N2F3+ are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride), as is ONF3, which has aroused interest due to the short N\u2013O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N\u2013F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF2\u2022. Fluorine azide (FN3) is very explosive and thermally unstable. Dinitrogen difluoride (N2F2) exists as thermally interconvertible \"cis\" and \"trans\" isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN3.\nNitrogen trichloride (NCl3) is a dense, volatile, and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of carbon tetrachloride, although one difference is that NCl3 is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl4 is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by Pierre Louis Dulong, who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour. Nitrogen tribromide (NBr3), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at \u2212100\u00a0\u00b0C. Nitrogen triiodide (NI3) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known earlier, is very shock-sensitive: it can be set off by the touch of a feather, shifting air currents, or even alpha particles. For this reason, small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of \"chemical magic\". Chlorine azide (ClN3) and bromine azide (BrN3) are extremely sensitive and explosive.\nTwo series of nitrogen oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first is very reactive gases that can be made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves in much the same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.\nOxides.\nNitrogen forms nine molecular oxides, some of which were the first gases to be identified: N2O (nitrous oxide), NO (nitric oxide), N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), N2O4 (dinitrogen tetroxide), N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), N4O (nitrosylazide), and N(NO2)3 (trinitramide). All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole (N4O), an aromatic ring.\nNitrous oxide (N2O), better known as laughing gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250\u00a0\u00b0C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot be considered to be the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N\u2013N\u2013O (N\u2261N+O\u2212\u2194\u2212N=N+=O): above 600\u00a0\u00b0C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N\u2013O bond.\nNitric oxide (NO) is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, it is an important cellular signalling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100\u20131200\u00a0\u00b0C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a \"\u03c0\"* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N\u2013N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the \"cis\" isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N\u2013O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.\nBlue dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them, although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is because it is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.\nThe thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is the anhydride of nitric acid, and can be made from it by dehydration with phosphorus pentoxide. It is of interest for the preparation of explosives. It is a deliquescent, colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light. In the solid state it is ionic with structure [NO2]+[NO3]\u2212; as a gas and in solution it is molecular O2N\u2013O\u2013NO2. Hydration to nitric acid comes readily, as does analogous reaction with hydrogen peroxide giving peroxonitric acid (HOONO2). It is a violent oxidising agent. Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows:\nN2O5 \u21cc NO2 + NO3 \u2192 NO2 + O2 + NO\nN2O5 + NO \u21cc 3 NO2\nOxoacids, oxoanions, and oxoacid salts.\nMany nitrogen oxoacids are known, though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solutions or as salts. Hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) is a weak diprotic acid with the structure HON=NOH (p\"K\"a1 6.9, p\"K\"a2 11.6). Acidic solutions are quite stable but above pH 4 base-catalysed decomposition occurs via [HONNO]\u2212 to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion. Hyponitrites (involving the N2O22- anion) are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves. They are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, which occurs in the nitrogen cycle. Hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand.\nNitrous acid (HNO2) is not known as a pure compound, but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous nitrite (NO2-, bent) solutions, although already at room temperature disproportionation to nitrate and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with p\"K\"\"a\" 3.35 at 18\u00a0\u00b0C. They may be titrimetrically analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by permanganate. They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by sulfur dioxide, to hyponitrous acid with tin(II), and to ammonia with hydrogen sulfide. Salts of hydrazinium N2H5+ react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen. Sodium nitrite is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100\u00a0mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage. It is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows:\nArNH2 + HNO2 \u2192 [ArNN]Cl + 2 H2O\nNitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable.\nNitric acid (HNO3) is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids. It is one of the three most used acids (the other two being sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid) and was first discovered by alchemists in the 13th century. It is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide, which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide, and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid. In the United States of America, over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year, most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives, among other uses. Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark. It can only be made in the solid state, because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide, and liquid nitric acid undergoes self-ionisation to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows:\n2 HNO3 \u21cc H2NO3+ + NO3- \u21cc H2O + [NO2]+ + [NO3]\u2212\nTwo hydrates, HNO3\u00b7H2O and HNO3\u00b73H2O, are known that can be crystallised. It is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents, though gold, platinum, rhodium, and iridium are immune to attack. A 3:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, called \"aqua regia\", is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum, because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes. In concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid is protonated to form nitronium, which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration:\nHNO3 + 2 H2SO4 \u21cc NO2+ + H3O+ + 2 HSO4-\nThe thermal stabilities of nitrates (involving the trigonal planar NO3- anion) depends on the basicity of the metal, and so do the products of decomposition (thermolysis), which can vary between the nitrite (for example, sodium), the oxide (potassium and lead), or even the metal itself (silver) depending on their relative stabilities. Nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination.\nFinally, although orthonitric acid (H3NO4), which would be analogous to orthophosphoric acid, does not exist, the tetrahedral orthonitrate anion NO43- is known in its sodium and potassium salts:\n&lt;chem&gt;NaNO3{} + Na2O -&gt;[\\ce{Ag~crucible}][\\ce{300^\\circ C~for~7 days}] Na3NO4&lt;/chem&gt;\nThese white crystalline salts are very sensitive to water vapour and carbon dioxide in the air:\nNa3NO4 + H2O + CO2 \u2192 NaNO3 + NaOH + NaHCO3\nDespite its limited chemistry, the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short N\u2013O bond lengths, implying significant polar character to the bonding.\nOrganic nitrogen compounds.\nNitrogen is one of the most important elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon\u2013nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates (ROCN), isocyanates (RNCO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles (RCN), isonitriles (RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RC(=NOH)R), and pyridine derivatives. C\u2013N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as bases at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not basic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.\nOccurrence.\nNitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the volume of the atmosphere (75.5% by mass), around 3.89 million gigatonnes (). Despite this, it is not very abundant in Earth's crust, making up somewhere around 19\u00a0parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. (This represents 300,000 to a million gigatonnes of nitrogen, depending on the mass of the crust.) The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and soda nitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.\nNitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or \"fixed\", into a plant-usable form, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides, but most is done by diazotrophic bacteria through enzymes known as nitrogenases (although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant). When the ammonia is taken up by plants, it is used to synthesise proteins. These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their proteins and excrete nitrogen-bearing waste. Finally, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and denitrification, returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the Haber process is mostly used as fertiliser, although excess nitrogen\u2013bearing waste, when leached, leads to eutrophication of freshwater and the creation of marine dead zones, as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is produced during denitrification, attacks the atmospheric ozone layer.\nMany saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish. In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.\nNitric oxide's rapid reaction with water in animals results in the production of its metabolite nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in the excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in the excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine, respectively, in decaying proteins.\nProduction.\nNitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk-delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20\u00a0ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2\u00a0ppm oxygen and 10\u00a0ppm argon are also available.\nIn a chemical laboratory, it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite.\nNH4Cl + NaNO2 \u2192 N2 + NaCl + 2 H2O\nSmall amounts of the impurities NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate.\nIt can also be obtained by the thermal decomposition of ammonium dichromate.\n3(NH4)2Cr2O7 \u2192 2N2 + 9H2O + 3Cr2O3 + 2NH3 + 32O2\nVery pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide.\n2 NaN3 \u2192 2 Na + 3 N2\nApplications.\nThe applications of nitrogen compounds are naturally extremely widely varied due to the huge size of this class: hence, only applications of pure nitrogen itself will be considered here. Two-thirds (2/3) of nitrogen produced by industry is sold as gas and the remaining one-third (1/3) as a liquid.\nGas.\nThe gas is mostly used as a low reactivity safe atmosphere wherever the oxygen in the air would pose a fire, explosion, or oxidising hazard. Some examples include:\nNitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation in chemical analysis. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples. Directing a pressurised stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind.\nNitrogen can be used as a replacement, or in combination with, carbon dioxide to pressurise kegs of some beers, particularly stouts and British ales, due to the smaller bubbles it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier. A pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a \"widget\" allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles. Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns. Nitrogen must be kept at a higher pressure than CO2, making N2 tanks heavier and more expensive.\nEquipment.\nSome construction equipment uses pressurised nitrogen gas to help hydraulic system to provide extra power to devices such as hydraulic hammer. Nitrogen gas, formed from the decomposition of sodium azide, is used for the inflation of airbags.\nExecution.\nAs nitrogen is an asphyxiant gas in itself, some jurisdictions have considered asphyxiation by inhalation of pure nitrogen as a means of capital punishment (as a substitute for lethal injection). In January 2024, Kenneth Eugene Smith became the first person executed by nitrogen asphyxiation.\nLiquid.\nLiquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid which looks like water. When insulated in proper containers such as dewar flasks, it can be transported and stored with a low rate of evaporative loss.\nLike dry ice, the main use of liquid nitrogen is for cooling to low temperatures. It is used in the cryopreservation of biological materials such as blood and reproductive cells (sperm and eggs). It is used in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin by freezing them. It is used in laboratory cold traps, and in cryopumps to obtain lower pressures in vacuum pumped systems. It is used to cool heat-sensitive electronics such as infrared detectors and X-ray detectors. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures where necessary. Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is often used for cooling even when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.\nSafety.\nGas.\nAlthough nitrogen is non-toxic, when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid body is a relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before the launch of the first Space Shuttle mission on March 19, 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Space Shuttle's mobile launcher platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.\nWhen inhaled at high partial pressures (more than about 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30\u00a0m in scuba diving), nitrogen is an anaesthetic agent, causing nitrogen narcosis, a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication.\nNitrogen dissolves in the blood and body fats. Rapid decompression (as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness (formerly known as caisson sickness or \"the bends\"), when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream, nerves, joints, and other sensitive or vital areas. Bubbles from other \"inert\" gases (gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen) cause the same effects, so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent nitrogen narcosis, but does not prevent decompression sickness.\nLiquid.\nAs a cryogenic liquid, liquid nitrogen can be dangerous by causing cold burns on contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, a young woman in England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.\nBecause the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006, at Texas A&amp;M University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0m off their foundations.\nLiquid nitrogen readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, and hence the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen. For example, oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.\nVessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air. The liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (boiling point \u2212183\u00a0\u00b0C, higher than that of nitrogen) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.\nOxygen deficiency monitors.\nOxygen sensors are used to measure oxygen levels in confined spaces and any place where nitrogen gas or liquid are stored or used. In the event of a nitrogen leak, and a decrease in oxygen to a pre-set alarm level, an oxygen deficiency monitor can be programmed to set off audible and visual alarms. Most commonly, the oxygen range to alert personnel is when oxygen levels drop below 19.5%. In the U.S., OSHA specifies that a hazardous atmosphere may include one where the oxygen concentration is below 19.5% or above 23.5%.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are two main versions of nominalism. One denies the existence of universals\u2014that which can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g., strength, humanity). The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects \"as such\"\u2014objects that do not exist in space and time.\nMost nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only \"post res\", that is, subsequent to particular things. However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities (e.g., numbers), whilst others are concrete entities \u2013 entities that do exist in space and time (e.g., pillars, snakes, and bananas). Nominalism is primarily a position on the problem of universals. It is opposed to realist philosophies, such as Platonic realism, which assert that universals do exist over and above particulars, and to the hylomorphic substance theory of Aristotle, which asserts that universals are immanently real within them; however, the name \"nominalism\" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with Roscellinus.\nThe term \"nominalism\" stems from the Latin \"nomen\", \"name\". John Stuart Mill summarised nominalism in his aphorism \"there is nothing general except names\". In philosophy of law, nominalism finds its application in what is called constitutional nominalism.\nHistory.\nAncient Greek philosophy.\nPlato was perhaps the first writer in Western philosophy to clearly state a realist, i.e., non-nominalist, position:\n... We customarily hypothesize a single form in connection with each of the many things to which we apply the same name.\u00a0... For example, there are many beds and tables.\u00a0... But there are only two forms of such furniture, one of the bed and one of the table. (\"Republic\" 596a\u2013b, trans. Grube) \nWhat about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe in the beautiful itself\u00a0...? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than a wakened state? (\"Republic\" 476c)\nThe Platonic universals corresponding to the names \"bed\" and \"beautiful\" were the Form of the Bed and the Form of the Beautiful, or the \"Bed Itself\" and the \"Beautiful Itself\". Platonic Forms were the first universals posited as such in philosophy.\nOur term \"universal\" is due to the English translation of Aristotle's technical term \"katholou\" which he coined specially for the purpose of discussing the problem of universals. \"Katholou\" is a contraction of the phrase \"kata holou\", meaning \"on the whole\".\nAristotle famously rejected certain aspects of Plato's Theory of Forms, but he clearly rejected nominalism as well:\n... 'Man', and indeed every general predicate, signifies not an individual, but some quality, or quantity or relation, or something of that sort. (\"Sophistical Refutations\" xxii, 178b37, trans. Pickard-Cambridge)\nThe first philosophers to explicitly describe nominalist arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.\nMedieval philosophy.\nIn medieval philosophy, the French philosopher and theologian Roscellinus (c.\u20091050 \u2013 c.\u20091125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism. Nominalist ideas can be found in the work of Peter Abelard and reached their flowering in William of Ockham, who was the most influential and thorough nominalist. Abelard's and Ockham's version of nominalism is sometimes called conceptualism, which presents itself as a middle way between nominalism and realism, asserting that there \"is\" something in common among like individuals, but that it is a concept in the mind, rather than a real entity existing independently of the mind. Ockham argued that only individuals existed and that universals were only mental ways of referring to sets of individuals. \"I maintain\", he wrote, \"that a universal is not something real that exists in a subject\u00a0... but that it has a being only as a thought-object in the mind [objectivum in anima]\". As a general rule, Ockham argued against assuming any entities that were not necessary for explanations. Accordingly, he wrote, there is no reason to believe that there is an entity called \"humanity\" that resides inside, say, Socrates, and nothing further is explained by making this claim. This is in accord with the analytical method that has since come to be called Ockham's razor, the principle that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible. Critics argue that conceptualist approaches answer only the psychological question of universals. If the same concept is \"correctly\" and non-arbitrarily applied to two individuals, there must be some resemblance or shared property between the two individuals that justifies their falling under the same concept and that is just the metaphysical problem that universals were brought in to address, the starting-point of the whole problem (MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, \u00a73d). If resemblances between individuals are asserted, conceptualism becomes moderate realism; if they are denied, it collapses into nominalism.\nModern and contemporary philosophy.\nIn modern philosophy, nominalism was revived by Thomas Hobbes and Pierre Gassendi.\nIn contemporary analytic philosophy, it has been defended by Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman, H. H. Price, and D. C. Williams.\nLately, some scholars have been questioning what kind of influences nominalism might have had in the conception of modernity and contemporaneity. According to Michael Allen Gillespie, nominalism profoundly influences these two periods. Even though modernity and contemporaneity are secular eras, their roots are firmly established in the sacred. Furthermore, \"Nominalism turned this world on its head,\" he argues. \"For the nominalists, all real being was individual or particular and universals were thus mere fictions.\"\nAnother scholar, Victor Bruno, follows the same line. According to Bruno, nominalism is one of the first signs of rupture in the medieval system. \"The dismembering of the particulars, the dangerous attribution to individuals to a status of totalization of possibilities in themselves, all this will unfold in an existential fissure that is both objective and material. The result of this fissure will be the essays to establish the nation state.\"\nIndian philosophy.\nIndian philosophy encompasses various realist and nominalist traditions. Certain orthodox Hindu schools defend the realist position, notably Purva Mimamsa, Nyaya and Vaisheshika, maintaining that the referent of the word is both the individual object perceived by the subject of knowledge and the universal class to which the thing belongs. According to Indian realism, both the individual and the universal exist objectively, with the second underlying the former.\nBuddhists take the nominalist position, especially those of the Sautr\u0101ntika and Yog\u0101c\u0101ra schools; they were of the opinion that words have as referent not true objects, but only concepts produced in the intellect. These concepts are not real since they do not have efficient existence, that is, causal powers. Words, as linguistic conventions, are useful to thought and discourse, but even so, it should not be accepted that words apprehend reality as it is.\nDign\u0101ga formulated a nominalist theory of meaning called \"apohavada\", or \"theory of exclusions\". The theory seeks to explain how it is possible for words to refer to classes of objects even if no such class has an objective existence. Dign\u0101ga's thesis is that classes do not refer to positive qualities that their members share in common. On the contrary, universal classes are exclusions (\"apoha\"). As such, the \"cow\" class, for example, is composed of all exclusions common to individual cows: they are all non-horse, non-elephant, etc.\nThe problem of universals.\nNominalism arose in reaction to the problem of universals, specifically accounting for the fact that some things are of the same type. For example, Fluffy and Kitzler are both cats, or, the fact that certain properties are repeatable, such as: the grass, the shirt, and Kermit the Frog are green. One wants to know by virtue of \"what\" are Fluffy and Kitzler both cats, and \"what\" makes the grass, the shirt, and Kermit green.\nThe Platonist answer is that all the green things are green in virtue of the existence of a universal: a single abstract thing that, in this case, is a part of all the green things. With respect to the color of the grass, the shirt and Kermit, one of their parts is identical. In this respect, the three parts are literally one. Greenness is repeatable because there is one thing that manifests itself wherever there are green things.\nNominalism denies the existence of universals. The motivation for this flows from several concerns, the first one being where they might exist. Plato famously held, on one interpretation, that there is a realm of abstract forms or universals apart from the physical world (see theory of the forms). Particular physical objects merely exemplify or instantiate the universal. But this raises the question: Where is this universal realm? One possibility is that it is outside space and time. A view sympathetic with this possibility holds that, precisely because some form is immanent in several physical objects, it must also transcend each of those physical objects; in this way, the forms are \"transcendent\" only insofar as they are \"immanent\" in many physical objects. In other words, immanence implies transcendence; they are not opposed to one another. (Nor, in this view, would there be a separate \"world\" or \"realm\" of forms that is distinct from the physical world, thus shirking much of the worry about where to locate a \"universal realm\".) However, naturalists assert that nothing is outside of space and time. Some Neoplatonists, such as the pagan philosopher Plotinus and the Christian philosopher Augustine, imply (anticipating conceptualism) that universals are contained within the \"mind\" of God. To complicate things, what is the nature of the instantiation or exemplification relation?\nConceptualists hold a position intermediate between nominalism and realism, saying that universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality.\nModerate realists hold that there is no realm in which universals exist, but rather there universals are located in space and time however they are manifest. Suppose that a universal, for example greenness, is supposed to be a single thing. Nominalists consider it unusual that there could be a single thing that exists in multiple places simultaneously. The realist maintains that all the instances of greenness are held together by the exemplification relation, but that this relation cannot be explained. Additionally, in lexicology there is an argument against color realism, namely the subject of the blue-green distinction. In some languages the equivalent words for blue and green may be colexified (and furthermore there may not be a straightforward translation either \u2013 in Japanese \"\u9752\", which is usually translated as \"blue\", is sometimes used for words which in English may be considered as \"green\" (such as green apples).)\nFinally, many philosophers prefer simpler ontologies populated with only the bare minimum of types of entities, or as W. V. O. Quine said \"They have a taste for 'desert landscapes.'\" They try to express everything that they want to explain without using universals such as \"catness\" or \"greenness.\"\nVarieties.\nThere are various forms of nominalism ranging from extreme to almost-realist. One extreme is predicate nominalism, which states that Fluffy and Kitzler, for example, are both cats simply because the predicate 'is a cat' applies to both of them. And this is the case for all similarity of attribute among objects. The main criticism of this view is that it does not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of universals. It fails to provide an account of what makes it the case that a group of things warrant having the same predicate applied to them.\nProponents of resemblance nominalism believe that 'cat' applies to both cats because Fluffy and Kitzler resemble an exemplar cat closely enough to be classed together with it as members of its kind, or that they differ from each other (and other cats) quite less than they differ from other things, and this warrants classing them together. Some resemblance nominalists will concede that the resemblance relation is itself a universal, but is the only universal necessary. Others argue that each resemblance relation is a particular, and is a resemblance relation simply in virtue of its resemblance to other resemblance relations. This generates an infinite regress, but many argue that it is not vicious.\nClass nominalism argues that class membership forms the metaphysical backing for property relationships: two particular red balls share a property in that they are both members of classes corresponding to their properties \u2013 that of being red and of being balls. A version of class nominalism that sees some classes as \"natural classes\" is held by Anthony Quinton.\nConceptualism is a philosophical theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind. The conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside of the mind's perception of them.\nAnother form of nominalism is trope nominalism. A trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific greenness of a shirt. One might argue that there is a primitive, objective resemblance relation that holds among like tropes. Another route is to argue that all apparent tropes are constructed out of more primitive tropes and that the most primitive tropes are the entities of complete physics. Primitive trope resemblance may thus be accounted for in terms of causal indiscernibility. Two tropes are exactly resembling if substituting one for the other would make no difference to the events in which they are taking part. Varying degrees of resemblance at the macro level can be explained by varying degrees of resemblance at the micro level, and micro-level resemblance is explained in terms of something no less robustly physical than causal power. David Armstrong, perhaps the most prominent contemporary realist, argues that such a trope-based variant of nominalism has promise, but holds that it is unable to account for the laws of nature in the way his theory of universals can.\nIan Hacking has also argued that much of what is called social constructionism of science in contemporary times is actually motivated by an unstated nominalist metaphysical view. For this reason, he claims, scientists and constructionists tend to \"shout past each other\".\nMark Hunyadi characterizes the contemporary Western world as a figure of a \"libidinal nominalism.\" He argues that the insistence on the individual will that has emerged in medieval nominalism evolves into a \"libidinal nominalism\" in which desire and will are conflated.\nMathematical nominalism.\nA notion that philosophy, especially ontology and the philosophy of mathematics, should abstain from set theory owes much to the writings of Nelson Goodman (see especially Goodman 1940 and 1977), who argued that concrete and abstract entities having no parts, called \"individuals\", exist. Collections of individuals likewise exist, but two collections having the same individuals are the same collection. Goodman was himself drawing heavily on the work of Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski, especially his mereology, which was itself a reaction to the paradoxes associated with Cantorian set theory. Le\u015bniewski denied the existence of the empty set and held that any singleton was identical to the individual inside it. Classes corresponding to what are held to be species or genera are concrete sums of their concrete constituting individuals. For example, the class of philosophers is nothing but the sum of all concrete, individual philosophers.\nThe principle of extensionality in set theory assures us that any matching pair of curly braces enclosing one or more instances of the same individuals denote the same set. Hence {\"a\", \"b\"}, {\"b\", \"a\"}, {\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"b\"} are all the same set. For Goodman and other proponents of mathematical nominalism, {\"a\", \"b\"} is also identical to {\"a\", {\"b\"}}, {\"b\", {\"a\", \"b\"}}, and any combination of matching curly braces and one or more instances of \"a\" and \"b\", as long as \"a\" and \"b\" are names of individuals and not of collections of individuals. Goodman, Richard Milton Martin, and Willard Quine all advocated reasoning about collectivities by means of a theory of \"virtual sets\" (see especially Quine 1969), one making possible all elementary operations on sets except that the universe of a quantified variable cannot contain any virtual sets.\nIn the foundations of mathematics, nominalism has come to mean doing mathematics without assuming that sets in the mathematical sense exist. In practice, this means that quantified variables may range over universes of numbers, points, primitive ordered pairs, and other abstract ontological primitives, but not over sets whose members are such individuals. Only a small fraction of the corpus of modern mathematics can be rederived in a nominalistic fashion.\nCriticisms.\nHistorical origins of the term.\nAs a category of late medieval thought, the concept of 'nominalism' has been increasingly queried. Traditionally, the fourteenth century has been regarded as the heyday of nominalism, with figures such as John Buridan and William of Ockham viewed as founding figures. However, the concept of 'nominalism' as a movement (generally contrasted with 'realism'), first emerged only in the late fourteenth century, and only gradually became widespread during the fifteenth century. The notion of two distinct ways, a \"via antiqua\", associated with realism, and a \"via moderna\", associated with nominalism, became widespread only in the later fifteenth century \u2013 a dispute which eventually dried up in the sixteenth century.\nAware that explicit thinking in terms of a divide between 'nominalism' and 'realism\u2019 emerged only in the fifteenth century, scholars have increasingly questioned whether a fourteenth-century school of nominalism can really be said to have existed. While one might speak of family resemblances between Ockham, Buridan, Marsilius and others, there are also striking differences. More fundamentally, Robert Pasnau has questioned whether any kind of coherent body of thought that could be called 'nominalism' can be discerned in fourteenth century writing. This makes it difficult, it has been argued, to follow the twentieth century narrative which portrayed late scholastic philosophy as a dispute which emerged in the fourteenth century between the \"via moderna\", nominalism, and the \"via antiqua\", realism, with the nominalist ideas of William of Ockham foreshadowing the eventual rejection of scholasticism in the seventeenth century.\nNominalist reconstructions in mathematics.\nA critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics was undertaken by Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). Burgess distinguished two types of nominalist reconstructions. Thus, \"hermeneutic nominalism\" is the hypothesis that science, properly interpreted, already dispenses with mathematical objects (entities) such as numbers and sets. Meanwhile, \"revolutionary nominalism\" is the project of replacing current scientific theories by alternatives dispensing with mathematical objects (see Burgess, 1983, p.\u00a096). A recent study extends the Burgessian critique to three nominalistic reconstructions: the reconstruction of analysis by Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, and Karl Weierstrass that dispensed with infinitesimals; the constructivist re-reconstruction of Weierstrassian analysis by Errett Bishop that dispensed with the law of excluded middle; and the hermeneutic reconstruction, by Carl Boyer, Judith Grabiner, and others, of Cauchy's foundational contribution to analysis that dispensed with Cauchy's infinitesimals.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21178", "revid": "4842600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21178", "title": "Non-cognitivism", "text": "Meta-ethical theory\nNon-cognitivism is the meta-ethical view that ethical sentences do not express propositions (i.e., statements) and thus cannot be true or false (they are not truth-apt). A noncognitivist denies the cognitivist claim that \"moral judgments are capable of being objectively true, because they describe some feature of the world.\" If moral statements cannot be true, and if one cannot know something that is not true, noncognitivism implies that moral knowledge is impossible.\nNon-cognitivism entails that non-cognitive attitudes underlie moral discourse and this discourse therefore consists of non-declarative speech acts, although accepting that its surface features may consistently and efficiently work as if moral discourse were cognitive. The point of interpreting moral claims as non-declarative speech acts is to explain what moral claims mean if they are neither true nor false (as philosophies such as logical positivism entail). Utterances like \"Boo to killing!\" and \"Don't kill\" are not candidates for truth or falsity, but have non-cognitive meaning.\nVarieties.\nEmotivism, associated with A. J. Ayer, the Vienna Circle and C. L. Stevenson, though first defended by Axel H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m in the early 1900s, suggests that ethical sentences are primarily emotional expressions of one's own attitudes and are intended to influence the actions of the listener. Under this view, \"Killing is wrong\" is translated as \"Killing, boo!\" or \"I disapprove of killing.\"\nA close cousin of emotivism, developed by R. M. Hare, is called universal prescriptivism. Prescriptivists interpret ethical statements as being universal \"imperatives\", prescribing behavior for all to follow. According to prescriptivism, \nphrases like \"Thou shalt not murder!\" or \"Do not steal!\" are the clearest expressions of morality, while reformulations like \"Killing is wrong\" tend to obscure the meaning of moral sentences.\nOther forms of non-cognitivism include Simon Blackburn's quasi-realism and Allan Gibbard's norm-expressivism.\nArguments in favour.\nAs with other anti-realist meta-ethical theories, non-cognitivism is largely supported by the argument from queerness: ethical properties, if they existed, would be different from any other thing in the universe, since they have no observable effect on the world. People generally have a negative attitude towards murder, which presumably keeps most of us from murdering. But does the actual \"wrongness\" of murder play an \"independent\" role? Is there any evidence that there is a property of wrongness that some types of acts have? Some people might think that the strong feelings we have when we see or consider a murder provide evidence of murder's wrongness. But it is not difficult to explain these feelings without saying that \"wrongness\" was their cause. Thus there is no way of discerning which, if any, ethical properties exist; by Occam's razor, the simplest assumption is that none do. The non-cognitivist then asserts that, since a proposition about an ethical property would have no referent, ethical statements must be something else.\nUniversal prescriptivism.\nArguments for prescriptivism focus on the \"function\" of normative statements.\nPrescriptivists argue that factual statements and prescriptions are totally different, because of different expectations of change in cases of a clash between word and world.\nIn a descriptive sentence, if one premises that \"red is a number\" then according to the rules of English grammar said statement would be false. Since said premise describes the objects \"red\" and \"number\", anyone with an adequate understanding of English would notice the falseness of such description and the falseness of said statement. However, if the norm \"thou shalt not kill!\" is uttered, and this premise is negated (by the fact of a person being murdered), the speaker is not to change his sentence upon observation of this into \"kill other people!\", but is to reiterate the moral outrage of the act of killing. Adjusting statements based upon objective reality and adjusting reality based upon statements are contrary uses of language; that is to say, descriptive statements are a different kind of sentence to normative statements. If truth is understood according to correspondence theory, the question of the truth or falsity of sentences not contingent upon external phenomena cannot be tested (see tautologies).\nSome cognitivists argue that some expressions like \"courageous\" have both a factual as well as a normative component which cannot be distinguished by analysis. Prescriptivists argue that according to context, either the factual or the normative component of the meaning is dominant. The sentence \"Hero A behaved courageously\" is wrong, if A ran away in the face of danger. But the sentence \"Be brave and fight for the glory of your country!\" has no truth value and cannot be falsified by someone who does not join the army.\nPrescriptivism is also supported by the actual way of speaking. Many moral statements are de facto uttered as recommendations or commands, e.g. when parents or teachers forbid children to do wrong actions. The most famous moral ideas are prescriptions: the Ten Commandments, the command of charity, the categorical imperative, and the Golden Rule command to do or not to do something rather than state that something is or is not the case.\nPrescriptivism can fit the theist idea of morality as obedience towards god. It is however different from the cognitivist supernaturalism which interprets morality as subjective will of god, while prescriptivism claims that moral rules are universal and can be found by reason alone without reference to a god.\nAccording to Hare, prescriptivists cannot argue that amoralists are logically wrong or contradictory. Everyone can choose to follow moral commands or not. This is the human condition according to the Christian reinterpretation of the Choice of Heracles. According to prescriptivism, morality is not about knowledge (of moral facts), but about character (to choose to do the right thing). Actors cannot externalize their responsibility and freedom of will towards some moral truth in the world, virtuous people do not need to wait for some cognition to choose what's right.\nPrescriptivism is also supported by imperative logic, in which there are no truth values for imperatives, and by the idea of the naturalistic fallacy: even if someone could prove the existence of an ethical property and express it in a factual statement, he could never derive any command from this statement, so the search for ethical properties is pointless.\nEmotivism.\nArguments for emotivism focus on what normative statements \"express\" when uttered by a speaker. A person who says that killing is wrong certainly expresses her disapproval of killing. Emotivists claim that this is \"all\" she does, that the statement \"killing is wrong\" is not a truth-apt declaration, and that the burden of evidence is on the cognitivists who want to show that in addition to expressing disapproval, the claim \"killing is wrong\" is also true. Emotivists ask whether there really is evidence that killing is wrong. We have evidence that Jupiter has a magnetic field and that birds are oviparous, but as yet, we do not seem to have found evidence of moral properties, such as \"goodness\". Emotivists ask why, without such evidence, we should think there \"is\" such a property. Ethical intuitionists think the evidence comes not from science or reason but from our own feelings: good deeds make us feel a certain way and bad deeds make us feel very differently. But is this enough to show that there are genuinely good and bad deeds? Emotivists think not, claiming that we do not need to postulate the existence of moral \"badness\" or \"wrongness\" to explain why considering certain deeds makes us feel disapproval; that all we really observe when we introspect are feelings of disapproval. Thus the emotivist asks why not adopt the simple explanation and say that this is all there is, rather than insist that some intrinsic \"badness\" (of murder, for example) must be causing feelings when a simpler explanation is available.\nArguments against.\nOne argument against non-cognitivism is that it ignores the external \"causes\" of emotional and prescriptive reactions. If someone says, \"John is a good person,\" something about John must have inspired that reaction. If John gives to the poor, takes care of his sick grandmother, and is friendly to others, and these are what inspire the speaker to think well of him, it is plausible to say, \"John is a good person because he gives to the poor, takes care of his sick grandmother, and is friendly to others\". If, in turn, the speaker responds positively to the idea of giving to the poor, then some aspect of that idea must have inspired a positive response; one could argue that that aspect is also the basis of its goodness.\nAnother argument is the \"embedding problem\" in which ethical sentences are embedded into more complex sentences. Consider the following examples:\nAttempts to translate these sentences in an emotivist framework seem to fail (e.g. \"She does not realize 'Boo to eating meat!'\"). Prescriptivist translations fare only slightly better (\"She does not realize that she is not to eat meat\"). Even the act of forming such a construction indicates some sort of cognition in the process.\nAccording to some non-cognitivist points of view, these sentences simply assume the false premise that ethical statements are either true or false. They might be literally translated as:\nThese translations, however, seem divorced from the way people actually use language. A non-cognitivist would have to disagree with someone saying, \"'Eating meat is wrong' is a false statement\" (since \"Eating meat is wrong\" is not truth-apt at all), but may be tempted to agree with a person saying, \"Eating meat is not wrong.\"\nOne might more constructively interpret these statements to describe the underlying emotional statement that they express, i.e.: I disapprove/do not disapprove of eating meat, I used to, he doesn't, I do and she doesn't, etc.; however, this interpretation is closer to ethical subjectivism than to non-cognitivism proper.\nA similar argument against non-cognitivism is that of ethical argument. A common argument might be, \"If killing an innocent human is always wrong, and all fetuses are innocent humans, then killing a fetus is always wrong.\" Most people would consider such an utterance to represent an analytic proposition which is true \"a priori\". However, if ethical statements do not represent cognitions, it seems odd to use them as premises in an argument, and even odder to assume they follow the same rules of syllogism as true propositions. However, R.M. Hare, proponent of universal prescriptivism, has argued that the rules of logic are independent of grammatical mood, and thus the same logical relations may hold between imperatives as hold between indicatives.\nMany objections to non-cognitivism based on the linguistic characteristics of what purport to be moral judgments were originally raised by Peter Glassen in \"The Cognitivity of Moral Judgments\", published in \"Mind\" in January 1959, and in Glassen's follow-up article in the January 1963 issue of the same journal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the Atlantic Ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, covering .\nIt hosts key north European shipping lanes and is a major fishery. The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries, and a rich source of energy resources, including wind and wave power.\nThe North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs, particularly in Northern Europe, from the Middle Ages to the modern era. It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era. The North Sea was the centre of the Vikings' rise. The Hanseatic League, the Dutch Republic, and Britain all sought to gain command of the North Sea and access to the world's markets and resources. As Germany's only outlet to the ocean, the North Sea was strategically important through both world wars.\nThe coast has diverse geology and geography. In the north, deep fjords and sheer cliffs mark much of its Norwegian and Scottish coastlines respectively, whereas in the south, the coast consists mainly of sandy beaches, estuaries of long rivers and wide mudflats. Due to the dense population, heavy industrialisation, and intense use of the sea and the area surrounding it, various environmental issues affect the sea's ecosystems. Adverse environmental issues\u00a0\u2013 commonly including overfishing, industrial and agricultural runoff, dredging, and dumping, among others\u00a0\u2013 have led to several efforts to prevent degradation and to safeguard long-term economic benefits.\nGeography.\n \nNorwegianSea\nSk\nKa\nEng Ch\nSk\nSkagerrak\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ka=KattegatEng Ch=English Channel \nThe North Sea is bounded by the Orkney Islands and east coast of Great Britain to the west and the northern and central European mainland to the east and south, including Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. In the southwest, beyond the Straits of Dover, the North Sea becomes the English Channel connecting to the Atlantic Ocean. In the east, it connects to the Baltic Sea via the Skagerrak and Kattegat, narrow straits that separate Denmark from Norway and Sweden respectively. In the north it is bordered by the Shetland Islands, and connects with the Norwegian Sea, which is a marginal sea in the Arctic Ocean.\nThe North Sea is more than long and wide, with an area of and a volume of . Around the edges of the North Sea are sizeable islands and archipelagos, including Shetland, Orkney, and the Frisian Islands. The North Sea receives freshwater from a number of European continental watersheds, as well as the British Isles. A large part of the European drainage basin empties into the North Sea, including water from the Baltic Sea. The largest and most important rivers flowing into the North Sea are the Elbe and the Rhine \u2013 Meuse. Around 185\u00a0million people live in the catchment area of the rivers discharging into the North Sea encompassing some highly industrialized areas.\nMajor features.\nFor the most part, the sea lies on the European continental shelf with a mean depth of . The only exception is the Norwegian trench, which extends parallel to the Norwegian shoreline from Oslo to an area north of Bergen. It is between wide and has a maximum depth of .\nThe Dogger Bank, a vast moraine, or accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris, rises to a mere below the surface. This feature has produced the finest fishing location of the North Sea. The Long Forties and the Broad Fourteens are large areas with roughly uniform depth in fathoms (forty fathoms and fourteen fathoms or deep, respectively). These great banks and others make the North Sea particularly hazardous to navigate, which has been alleviated by the implementation of satellite navigation systems. The Devil's Hole lies east of Dundee, Scotland. The feature is a series of asymmetrical trenches between long, wide and up to deep.\nOther areas which are less deep are Cleaver Bank, Fisher Bank and Noordhinder Bank.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the North Sea as follows:\n\"On the Southwest\". A line joining the \"Phare de Walde\" (Walde Lighthouse, in France, 50\u00b059'37\"N, 1\u00b054'53\"E) and Leathercoat Point (England, 51\u00b010'01.4\"N 1\u00b024'07.8\"). northeast of Dover.\n\"On the Northwest.\" From Dunnet Head (58\u00b040'20\"N, 3\u00b022'30\"W) in Scotland to Tor Ness (58\u00b047'N) in the Island of Hoy, thence through this island to the Kame of Hoy (58\u00b055'N) on to Breck Ness on Mainland (58\u00b058'N) through this island to Costa Head (3\u00b014'W) and Inga Ness (59'17'N) in Westray through Westray, to Bow Head, across to Mull Head (North point of Papa Westray) and on to Seal Skerry (North point of North Ronaldsay) and thence to Horse Island (South point of the Shetland Islands).\n\"On the North.\" From the North point (Fethaland Point) of the Mainland of the Shetland Islands, across to Graveland Ness (60\u00b039'N) in the Island of Yell, through Yell to Gloup Ness (1\u00b004'W) and across to Spoo Ness (60\u00b045'N) in Unst island, through Unst to Herma Ness (60\u00b051'N), on to the SW point of the Rumblings and to Muckle Flugga () all these being included in the North Sea area; thence up the meridian of 0\u00b053' West to the parallel of 61\u00b000' North and eastward along this parallel to the coast of Norway, the whole of Viking Bank is thus included in the North Sea.\n\"On the East.\" The Western limit of the Skagerrak [A line joining Hanstholm () and the Naze (Lindesnes, )].\nHydrology.\nTemperature and salinity.\nThe average temperature is in the summer and in the winter. The average temperatures have been trending higher since 1988, which has been attributed to climate change. Air temperatures in January range on average between and in July between . The winter months see frequent gales and storms.\nThe salinity averages between of water. The salinity has the highest variability where there is fresh water inflow, such as at the Rhine and Elbe estuaries, the Baltic Sea exit and along the coast of Norway.\nWater circulation and tides.\nThe main pattern to the flow of water in the North Sea is an anti-clockwise rotation along the edges.\nThe North Sea is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean receiving the majority of ocean current from the northwest opening, and a lesser portion of warm current from the smaller opening at the English Channel. These tidal currents leave along the Norwegian coast. Surface and deep water currents may move in different directions. Low salinity surface coastal waters move offshore, and deeper, denser high salinity waters move inshore.\nThe North Sea located on the continental shelf has different waves from those in deep ocean water. The wave speeds are diminished and the wave amplitudes are increased. In the North Sea there are two amphidromic systems and a third incomplete amphidromic system. In the North Sea the average tide difference in wave amplitude is between zero and . \nThe Kelvin tide of the Atlantic Ocean is a semidiurnal wave that travels northward. Some of the energy from this wave travels through the English Channel into the North Sea. The wave continues to travel northward in the Atlantic Ocean, and once past the northern tip of Great Britain, the Kelvin wave turns east and south and once again enters the North Sea.\nCoasts.\nThe eastern and western coasts of the North Sea are jagged, formed by glaciers during the ice ages. The coastlines along the southernmost part are covered with the remains of deposited glacial sediment. The Norwegian mountains plunge into the sea creating deep fjords and archipelagos. South of Stavanger, the coast softens, the islands become fewer. The eastern Scottish coast is similar, though less severe than Norway. From north east of England, the cliffs become lower and are composed of less resistant moraine, which erodes more easily, so that the coasts have more rounded contours. In the Netherlands, Belgium and in East Anglia the littoral is low and marshy. The east coast and south-east of the North Sea (Wadden Sea) have coastlines that are mainly sandy and straight owing to longshore drift, particularly along Belgium and Denmark.\nCoastal management.\nThe southern coastal areas were originally flood plains and swampy land. In areas especially vulnerable to storm surges, people settled behind elevated levees and on natural areas of high ground such as spits and geestland. As early as 500 BC, people were constructing artificial dwelling hills higher than the prevailing flood levels. It was only around the beginning of the High Middle Ages, in 1200 AD, that inhabitants began to connect single ring dikes into a dike line along the entire coast, thereby turning amphibious regions between the land and the sea into permanent solid ground.\nThe modern form of the dikes supplemented by overflow and lateral diversion channels, began to appear in the 17th and 18th centuries, built in the Netherlands. The North Sea Floods of 1953 and 1962 were the impetus for further raising of the dikes as well as the shortening of the coast line so as to present as little surface area as possible to the punishment of the sea and the storms. Currently, 27% of the Netherlands is below sea level protected by dikes, dunes, and beach flats.\nCoastal management today consists of several levels. The dike slope reduces the energy of the incoming sea, so that the dike itself does not receive the full impact. Dikes that lie directly on the sea are especially reinforced. The dikes have, over the years, been repeatedly raised, sometimes up to and have been made flatter to better reduce wave erosion. Where the dunes are sufficient to protect the land behind them from the sea, these dunes are planted with beach grass (\"Ammophila arenaria\") to protect them from erosion by wind, water, and foot traffic.\nStorm tides.\nStorm surges threaten, in particular, the coasts of the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Denmark and low-lying areas of eastern England particularly around The Wash and Fens.\nStorm surges are caused by changes in barometric pressure combined with strong wind created wave action.\nThe first recorded storm tide flood was the \"Julianenflut\", on 17 February 1164. In its wake, the Jadebusen, (a bay on the coast of Germany), began to form.\nA storm tide in 1228 is recorded to have killed more than 100,000 people. In 1362, the Second Marcellus Flood, also known as the \"Grote Manndrenke\", hit the entire southern coast of the North Sea. Chronicles of the time again record more than 100,000 deaths, large parts of the coast were lost permanently to the sea, including the now legendary lost city of Rungholt.\nIn the 20th century, the North Sea flood of 1953 flooded several nations' coasts and cost more than 2,000 lives.\n315 citizens of Hamburg died in the North Sea flood of 1962.\nTsunamis.\nThough rare, the North Sea has been the site of a number of historically documented tsunamis. The Storegga Slides were a series of underwater landslides, in which a piece of the Norwegian continental shelf slid into the Norwegian Sea. The immense landslips occurred between 8150 BCE and 6000 BCE, and caused a tsunami up to high that swept through the North Sea, having the greatest effect on Scotland and the Faeroe Islands.\nThe Dover Straits earthquake of 1580 is among the first recorded earthquakes in the North Sea measuring between 5.6 and 5.9 on the Richter scale. This event caused extensive damage in Calais both through its tremors and possibly triggered a tsunami, though this has never been confirmed. The theory is a vast underwater landslide in the English Channel was triggered by the earthquake, which in turn caused a tsunami. The tsunami triggered by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake reached Holland, although the waves had lost their destructive power. The largest earthquake ever recorded in the United Kingdom was the 1931 Dogger Bank earthquake, which measured 6.1 on the Richter magnitude scale and caused a small tsunami that flooded parts of the British coast.\nIn 1995, the tall Draupner wave occurred in the North Sea, becoming the first rogue wave to be observed using scientific instruments.\nGeology.\nShallow epicontinental seas like the current North Sea have since long existed on the European continental shelf. The rifting that formed the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, from about https://\u00a0million years ago, caused tectonic uplift in the British Isles. Since then, a shallow sea has almost continuously existed between the uplands of the Fennoscandian Shield and the British Isles. This precursor of the current North Sea has grown and shrunk with the rise and fall of the eustatic sea level during geologic time. Sometimes it was connected with other shallow seas, such as the sea above the Paris Basin to the south-west, the Paratethys Sea to the south-east, or the Tethys Ocean to the south.\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, about https://\u00a0million years ago, all of modern mainland Europe except for Scandinavia was a scattering of islands. By the Early Oligocene, https:// 28, the emergence of Western and Central Europe had almost completely separated the North Sea from the Tethys Ocean, which gradually shrank to become the Mediterranean as Southern Europe and South West Asia became dry land. The North Sea was cut off from the English Channel by a narrow land bridge until that was breached by at least two catastrophic floods between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago. Since the start of the Quaternary period about https://\u00a0million years ago, the eustatic sea level has fallen during each glacial period and then risen again. Every time the ice sheet reached its greatest extent, the North Sea became almost completely dry, the dry landmass being known as Doggerland, whose northern regions were themselves known to have been glaciated. The present-day coastline formed after the Last Glacial Maximum when the sea began to flood the European continental shelf.\nIn 2006 a bone fragment was found while drilling for oil in the North Sea. Analysis indicated that it was a Plateosaurus from 199 to 216\u00a0million years ago. This was the deepest dinosaur fossil ever found and the first find for Norway.\nNature.\nFish and shellfish.\nCopepods and other zooplankton are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial elements of the food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.\nCrustaceans are also commonly found throughout the sea. Norway lobster, deep-water prawns, and brown shrimp are all commercially fished, but other species of lobster, shrimp, oyster, mussels and clams all live in the North Sea. Recently non-indigenous species have become established including the Pacific oyster and Atlantic jackknife clam.\nBirds.\nThe coasts of the North Sea are home to nature reserves including the Ythan Estuary, Fowlsheugh Nature Preserve, and Farne Islands in the UK and the Wadden Sea National Parks in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. These locations provide breeding habitat for dozens of bird species. Tens of millions of birds make use of the North Sea for breeding, feeding, or migratory stopovers every year. Populations of black-legged kittiwakes, Atlantic puffins, northern gannets, northern fulmars, and species of petrels, seaducks, loons (divers), cormorants, gulls, auks, and terns, and many other seabirds make these coasts popular for birdwatching.\nMarine mammals.\nThe North Sea is also home to marine mammals. Common seals, grey seals, and harbour porpoises can be found along the coasts, at marine installations, and on islands. The very northern North Sea islands such as the Shetland Islands are occasionally home to a larger variety of pinnipeds including bearded, harp, hooded and ringed seals, and even walrus. North Sea cetaceans include various porpoise, dolphin and whale species.\nFlora.\nPlant species in the North Sea include species of wrack, among them bladder wrack, knotted wrack, and serrated wrack. Algae, macroalgal, and kelp, such as oarweed and laminaria hyperboria, and species of maerl are found as well. Eelgrass, formerly common in the entirety of the Wadden Sea, was nearly wiped out in the 20th century by a disease. Similarly, sea grass used to coat huge tracts of ocean floor, but have been damaged by trawling and dredging have diminished its habitat and prevented its return. Invasive Japanese seaweed has spread along the shores of the sea, clogging harbours and inlets and has become a nuisance.\nBiodiversity and conservation.\nDue to the heavy human populations and high level of industrialization along its shores, the wildlife of the North Sea has suffered from pollution, overhunting, and overfishing. Flamingos and pelicans were once found along the southern shores of the North Sea, but became extinct over the second millennium. Walruses frequented the Orkney Islands through the mid-16th\u00a0century, as both Sable Island and Orkney Islands lay within their normal range. Grey whales also resided in the North Sea but were driven to extinction in the Atlantic in the 17th\u00a0century Other species have dramatically declined in population, though they are still found. North Atlantic right whales, sturgeon, shad, rays, skates, salmon, and other species were common in the North Sea until the 20th\u00a0century, when numbers declined due to overfishing.\nOther factors like the introduction of non-indigenous species, industrial and agricultural pollution, trawling and dredging, human-induced eutrophication, construction on coastal breeding and feeding grounds, sand and gravel extraction, offshore construction, and heavy shipping traffic have also contributed to the decline. For example, a resident orca pod was lost in the 1960s, presumably due to the peak in PCB pollution in this time period.\nThe OSPAR commission manages the OSPAR convention to counteract the harmful effects of human activity on wildlife in the North Sea, preserve endangered species, and provide environmental protection. All North Sea border states are signatories of the MARPOL 73/78 Accords, which preserve the marine environment by preventing pollution from ships. Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands also have a trilateral agreement for the protection of the Wadden Sea, or mudflats, which run along the coasts of the three countries on the southern edge of the North Sea.\nNames.\nThe North Sea has had various names throughout history. One of the earliest recorded names was , or \"Northern Ocean\", which was cited by Pliny. He also noted that the Cimbri called it \"Morimarusa\" \u2013 \"Dead Sea\". The name \"North Sea\" probably came into English, however, via the Dutch , who named it thus either in contrast with the (\"South Sea\"), located south of Frisia, or because the sea is generally to the north of the Netherlands. Before the adoption of \"North Sea\", the names used in English were \"German Sea\" or \"German Ocean\", referred to as the Latin names and , and these persisted in use until the First World War. Other common names in use for long periods were the Latin terms , as well as the English equivalent, \"Frisian Sea\". The modern names of the sea in the other local languages are: or , , , , , , , , , , , and .\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe North Sea has provided waterway access for commerce and conquest. Many areas have access to the North Sea because of its long coastline and the European rivers that empty it. There is little documentary evidence concerning the North Sea before the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 CE, however, archaeological evidence reveals the diffusion of cultures and technologies from across or along the North Sea to Great Britain and Scandinavia and reliance by some prehistoric cultures on fishing, whaling, and seaborne trade on the North Sea. The Romans established organised ports in Britain, which increased shipping and began sustained trade and many Scandinavian tribes participated in raids and wars against the Romans and Roman coinage and manufacturing were important trade goods. When the Romans abandoned Britain in 410, the Germanic Angles, Frisians, Saxons, and Jutes began the next great migration across the North Sea during the Migration Period. They made successive invasions of the island from what is now the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany.\nThe Viking Age began in 793 with the attack on Lindisfarne; for the next quarter-millennium, the Vikings ruled the North Sea. In their superior longships, they raided, traded, and established colonies and outposts along the coasts of the sea. From the Middle Ages through the 15th century, the northern European coastal ports exported domestic goods, dyes, linen, salt, metal goods and wine. The Scandinavian and Baltic areas shipped grain, fish, naval necessities, and timber. In turn, the North Sea countries imported high-grade cloths, spices, and fruits from the Mediterranean region. Commerce during this era was mainly conducted by maritime trade due to underdeveloped roadways.\nIn the 13th century the Hanseatic League, though centred on the Baltic Sea, started to control most of the trade through important members and outposts on the North Sea. The League lost its dominance in the 16th century, as neighbouring states took control of former Hanseatic cities and outposts. Their internal conflict prevented effective cooperation and defence. As the League lost control of its maritime cities, new trade routes emerged that provided Europe with Asian, American, and African goods.\nAge of sail.\nThe 17th century Dutch Golden Age saw Dutch maritime power at its zenith. Important overseas colonies, a vast merchant marine, a large fishing fleet, powerful navy, and sophisticated financial markets made the Dutch the ascendant power in the North Sea, to be challenged by an ambitious England. This rivalry led to the first three Anglo-Dutch Wars between 1652 and 1673, which ended with Dutch victories. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Dutch prince William ascended to the English throne. With unified leadership, commercial, military, and political power began to shift from Amsterdam to London.\nThe British did not face a challenge to their dominance of the North Sea until the 20th century.\nModern era.\nTensions in the North Sea were again heightened in 1904 by the Dogger Bank incident. During the Russo-Japanese War, several ships of the Russian Baltic Fleet, which was on its way to the Far East, mistook British fishing boats for Japanese ships and fired on them, and then upon each other, near the Dogger Bank, nearly causing Britain to enter the war on the side of Japan.\nDuring the First World War, Great Britain's Grand Fleet and Germany's Kaiserliche Marine faced each other in the North Sea, which became the main theatre of the war for surface action. Britain's larger fleet and North Sea Mine Barrage were able to establish an effective blockade for most of the war, which restricted the Central Powers' access to many crucial resources. Major battles included the Battle of Heligoland Bight, the Battle of the Dogger Bank, and the Battle of Jutland.\nWorld War I also brought the first extensive use of submarine warfare, and a number of submarine actions occurred in the North Sea.\nThe Second World War also saw action in the North Sea, though it was restricted more to aircraft reconnaissance and action by fighter/bomber aircraft, submarines and smaller vessels such as minesweepers and torpedo boats.\nAfter the war, hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical weapons were disposed of by being dumped in the North Sea.\nAfter the war, the North Sea lost much of its military significance because it is bordered only by NATO member-states. However, it gained significant economic importance in the 1960s as the states around the North Sea began full-scale exploitation of its oil and gas resources. The North Sea continues to be an active trade route.\nEconomy.\nPolitical status.\nCountries that border the North Sea all claim the of territorial waters, within which they have exclusive fishing rights. The Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union (EU) exists to coordinate fishing rights and assist with disputes between EU states and the EU border state of Norway.\nAfter the discovery of mineral resources in the North Sea during the early 1960s, the Convention on the Continental Shelf established country rights largely divided along the median line. The median line is defined as the line \"every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured\".\nThe ocean floor border between Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark was only reapportioned in 1969 after protracted negotiations and a judgment of the International Court of Justice.\nOil and gas.\nAs early as 1859, oil was discovered in onshore areas around the North Sea and natural gas as early as 1910. Onshore resources, for example the K12-B field in the Netherlands continue to be exploited today.\nOffshore test drilling began in 1966 and then, in 1969, Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the Ekofisk oil field distinguished by valuable, low-sulphur oil. Commercial exploitation began in 1971 with tankers and, after 1975, by a pipeline, first to Teesside, England and then, after 1977, also to Emden, Germany.\nThe exploitation of the North Sea oil reserves began just before the 1973 oil crisis, and the climb of international oil prices made the large investments needed for extraction much more attractive.\nThe start in 1973 of the oil reserves by the UK allowed them to stop the declining position in international trade in 1974, and a huge increase after the discovery and exploitation of the huge oil field by Phillips group in 1977 as the Brae field.\nAlthough the production costs are relatively high, the quality of the oil, the political stability of the region, and the proximity of important markets in western Europe have made the North Sea an important oil-producing region. The largest single humanitarian catastrophe in the North Sea oil industry was the destruction of the offshore oil platform Piper Alpha in 1988 in which 167 people lost their lives.\nBesides the Ekofisk oil field, the Statfjord oil field is also notable as it was the cause of the first pipeline to span the Norwegian trench. The largest natural gas field in the North Sea, Troll gas field, lies in the Norwegian trench, dropping over , requiring the construction of the enormous Troll A platform to access it.\nThe price of Brent Crude, one of the first types of oil extracted from the North Sea is used today as a standard price for comparison for crude oil from the rest of the world. The North Sea contains western Europe's largest oil and natural gas reserves and is one of the world's key non-OPEC producing regions.\nIn the UK sector of the North Sea, the oil industry invested \u00a314.4\u00a0billion in 2013 and was on track to spend \u00a313\u00a0billion in 2014. Industry body Oil &amp; Gas UK put the decline down to rising costs, lower production, high tax rates, and less exploration.\nIn January 2018, The North Sea region contained 184 offshore rigs, which made it the region with the highest number of offshore rigs in the world at the time.&lt;br&gt;\nThe British North Sea's oil and gas production, peaking in 2000, had declined by 2024, while offshore wind projects like Dogger Bank grew to support renewable energy goals, with windfall taxes funding the transition.\nFishing.\nThe North Sea is Europe's main fishery accounting for over 5% of international commercial fish caught. Fishing in the North Sea is concentrated in the southern part of the coastal waters. The main method of fishing is trawling.\nIn 1995, the total volume of fish and shellfish caught in the North Sea was approximately 3.5\u00a0million tonnes. Besides saleable fish, it is estimated that one million tonnes of unmarketable by-catch is caught and discarded to die each year.\nIn recent decades, overfishing has left many fisheries unproductive, disturbing marine food chain dynamics and costing jobs in the fishing industry. Herring, cod and plaice fisheries may soon face the same plight as mackerel fishing, which ceased in the 1970s due to overfishing.\nThe objective of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy is to minimize the environmental impact associated with resource use by reducing fish discards, increasing the productivity of fisheries, stabilising markets of fisheries and fish processing, and supplying fish at reasonable prices for the consumer.\nWhaling.\nWhaling was an important economic activity from the 9th until the 13th century for Flemish whalers. The medieval Flemish, Basque and Norwegian whalers who were replaced in the 16th century by Dutch, English, Danes, and Germans, took massive numbers of whales and dolphins and nearly depleted the right whales. This activity likely led to the extinction of the Atlantic population of the once common grey whale. By 1902 the whaling had ended. After being absent for 300 years a single grey whale returned in 2010, it probably was the first of many more to find its way through the now ice-free Northwest Passage.\nMineral resources.\nIn addition to oil, gas, and fish, the states along the North Sea also take millions of cubic metres per year of sand and gravel from the ocean floor. These are used for beach nourishment, land reclamation\nand construction.\nRolled pieces of amber may be picked up on the east coast of England.\nRenewable energy.\nDue to the strong prevailing winds, and shallow water, countries on the North Sea, particularly Germany and Denmark, have used the shore for wind power since the 1990s. The North Sea is the home of one of the first large-scale offshore wind farms in the world, Horns Rev 1, completed in 2002. Since then many other wind farms have been commissioned in the North Sea (and elsewhere). As of 2013, the 630\u00a0megawatt (MW) London Array is the largest offshore wind farm in the world, with the 504 (MW) Greater Gabbard wind farm the second largest, followed by the 367\u00a0MW Walney Wind Farm. All are off the coast of the UK. These projects will be dwarfed by subsequent wind farms that are in the pipeline, including Dogger Bank at 4,800\u00a0MW, Norfolk Bank (7,200\u00a0MW), and Irish Sea (4,200\u00a0MW). At the end of June 2013 total European combined offshore wind energy capacity was 6,040\u00a0MW. The UK installed 513.5\u00a0MW of offshore wind power in the first half-year of 2013. The development of the offshore wind industry in UK-controlled areas of the North Sea is traced to three phases: coastal, off-coastal and deep offshore in the period 2004 \u2013 2021.\nThe expansion of offshore wind farms has met with some resistance. Concerns have included shipping collisions and environmental effects on ocean ecology and wildlife such as fish and migratory birds, however, these concerns were found to be negligible in a long-term study in Denmark released in 2006 and again in a UK government study in 2009.\nThere are also concerns about reliability, and the rising costs of constructing and maintaining offshore wind farms. Despite these, development of North Sea wind power is continuing, with plans for additional wind farms off the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. There have also been proposals for a transnational power grid in the North Sea to connect new offshore wind farms.\nEnergy production from tidal power is still in a pre-commercial stage. The European Marine Energy Centre has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of Eday. Since 2003, a prototype Wave Dragon energy converter has been in operation at Nissum Bredning fjord of northern Denmark.\nTourism.\nThe beaches and coastal waters of the North Sea are destinations for tourists. The English, Belgian, Dutch, German and Danish coasts are developed for tourism. The North Sea coast of the United Kingdom has tourist destinations with beach resorts and links golf courses; the coastal town of St. Andrews in Scotland is renowned as the home of golf, and is a popular location among golfing pilgrims.\nThe North Sea Trail is a long-distance trail linking seven countries around the North Sea. Windsurfing and sailing are popular sports because of the strong winds. Mudflat hiking, recreational fishing and birdwatching are among other activities.\nThe climatic conditions on the North Sea coast have been claimed to be healthy. As early as the 19th century, travellers visited the North Sea coast for curative and restorative vacations. The sea air, temperature, wind, water, and sunshine are counted among the beneficial conditions that are said to activate the body's defences, improve circulation, strengthen the immune system, and have healing effects on the skin and the respiratory system.\nThe Wadden Sea in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands is an UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nMarine traffic.\nThe North Sea is important for marine transport and its shipping lanes are among the busiest in the world. Major ports are located along its coasts: Rotterdam, the busiest port in Europe and the fourth busiest port in the world by tonnage as of 2013[ [update]], Antwerp (was 16th) and Hamburg (was 27th), Bremen/Bremerhaven and Felixstowe, both in the top 30 busiest container seaports, as well as the Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge, Europe's leading ro-ro port.\nFishing boats, service boats for offshore industries, sport and pleasure craft, and merchant ships to and from North Sea ports and Baltic ports must share routes on the North Sea. The Dover Strait alone sees more than 400 commercial vessels a day. Because of this volume, navigation in the North Sea can be difficult in high traffic zones, so ports have established elaborate vessel traffic services to monitor and direct ships into and out of port.\nThe North Sea coasts are home to numerous canals and canal systems to facilitate traffic between and among rivers, artificial harbours, and the sea. The Kiel Canal, connecting the North Sea with the Baltic Sea, is the most heavily used artificial seaway in the world reporting an average of 89 ships per day not including sporting boats and other small watercraft in 2009. It saves an average of , instead of the voyage around the Jutland peninsula. The North Sea Canal connects Amsterdam with the North Sea.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who become lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.\nThe film is based on an original screenplay by Quentin Tarantino that was heavily revised by Stone, writer David Veloz, and associate producer Richard Rutowski. Tarantino received a story credit though he subsequently disowned the film. Jane Hamsher, Don Murphy, and Clayton Townsend produced the film, with Arnon Milchan, Thom Mount, and Stone as executive producers.\n\"Natural Born Killers\" was released by Warner Bros. on August 26, 1994, in the United States, and screened at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 1994 where it won Grand Jury Prize. It was a box office success, grossing $110 million against a production budget of $34 million, but received polarized reviews. Some critics praised the plot, acting, humor, and combination of action and romance, while others found the film overly violent and graphic. Notorious for its violent content and inspiring \"copycat\" crimes, the film was named the eighth most controversial film in history by \"Entertainment Weekly\" in 2006.\nPlot.\nMickey Knox and his wife Mallory stop at a diner in the New Mexico desert. A duo of rednecks arrive and begin sexually harassing Mallory as she dances by a jukebox. She initially encourages it before beating one of the men viciously. Mickey joins her, and the couple murder everyone in the diner, save one customer, to whom they proudly declare their names before leaving. The couple camp in the desert, and Mallory reminisces about how she met Mickey, a meat deliveryman who serviced her family's household. After a whirlwind romance, Mickey is arrested for grand theft auto and sent to prison; he escapes and returns to Mallory's home. The couple murders Mallory's sexually abusive father and neglectful mother, but spare the life of Mallory's little brother, Kevin. The couple then have an unofficial marriage ceremony on a bridge.\nLater, Mickey and Mallory hold a woman hostage in their hotel room. Angered by Mickey's desire for a threesome, Mallory leaves, and Mickey rapes the hostage. Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with a mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but after Mallory suffers a flashback of being raped by her father, and the mechanic recognizes her as a wanted murderer, Mallory kills him. The pair continue their killing spree, ultimately claiming 52 victims in New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada. Pursuing them is detective Jack Scagnetti, who became obsessed with mass murderers at the age of eight after having witnessed the murder of his mother at the hand of Charles Whitman. Beneath his heroic fa\u00e7ade, he is also a violent psychopath and has murdered prostitutes in his past. Following the pair's murder spree is self-serving tabloid journalist Wayne Gale, who profiles them on his show \"American Maniacs\", soon elevating them to cult-hero status.\nMickey and Mallory become lost in the desert after taking psychedelic mushrooms, and they stumble upon a ranch owned by Warren Red Cloud, a Navajo man who provides them food and shelter. As Mickey and Mallory sleep, Warren, sensing evil in the couple, attempts to exorcise the demon that he perceives in Mickey, chanting over him as he sleeps. Mickey, who has nightmares of his abusive parents, awakens during the exorcism and shoots Warren to death. As the couple flee, they feel inexplicably guilty and come across a giant field of rattlesnakes, where they are badly bitten. They reach a drugstore to purchase snakebite antidote, but the store is sold out. A pharmacist recognizes the couple and triggers an alarm before Mickey kills him. Police arrive shortly after and accost the couple and a shootout ensues. The police end the showdown by beating the couple while a news crew films the action.\nOne year later, the imprisoned Mickey and Mallory are thought to be criminally insane and are scheduled to be transferred to psychiatric hospitals, with Scagnetti overseeing their transfer. Warden Dwight McClusky tells the detective that he should kill the Knoxes during their transfer and claim they had tried to escape.\nMeanwhile, Gale has persuaded Mickey to submit to a live interview that will air after the Super Bowl. During the interview, Mickey declares himself a \"natural born killer\", inspiring the other inmates to start a prison riot. After McClusky terminates the interview, Mickey is left alone with Gale, the film crew and several guards. He manages to overpower a guard and kill most of the people in the room, taking Gale and several others hostage. Gale and his crew give a live television report that profiles the riot. Meanwhile, when Scagnetti attempts to seduce Mallory in her cell, she beats him viciously before another guard subdues her with tear gas. Mickey and Gale reach Mallory's cell, where Mickey kills the guards and engages in a Mexican standoff with Scagnetti before Mallory kills him.\nGale's entire television crew is killed trying to escape the riot, while Gale himself begins indulging in violence, shooting at prison guards. Mickey and Mallory steal a van and escape into the woods with Gale, to whom they give a final interview before declaring that he must die. He attempts various arguments to change their minds, appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor. Mickey informs him that they are leaving a witness to tell the tale: his camera. Gale accepts his fate and is shot to death. Unbeknownst to the three, the entire exchange is transmitted to a horrified news anchor through Gale's in-ear microphone.\nSeveral years later, Mickey and Mallory, still fugitives, travel in an RV, as a pregnant Mallory watches their two children play.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Woody Harrelson as Mickey Knox\nDirector's cut.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Ashley Judd as Grace Mulberry\nAnalysis and themes.\nOne of the central themes of \"Natural Born Killers\" is the relationship between real-life violence and the mass media's coverage of it. This thematic preoccupation was declared in the film's promotional materials, with its theatrical poster advertising it as a \"bold new film that takes a look at a country seduced by fame, obsessed by crime, and consumed by the media.\"\nThe character of Wayne Gale, the television host of \"American Maniacs\", functions in the film as a figurehead of lurid true crime television documentaries, which recycle real-life incidents of violence and criminal activity into entertainment for the general public. On several occasions, expressionistic edits featuring Gale as a blood-soaked Satan are interspersed into the film, which Muir suggests emphasizes the film's assertion that mass media and crime mutually reinforce one another.\nMedia representation of the nuclear family has been identified as another theme in the film, particularly with the depiction of Mallory's dysfunctional family life, which includes a neglectful mother and a sexually abusive father. Muir notes that the sequence depicting Mallory's home life\u2014presented as a television sitcom with the title \"I Love Mallory\" (a parody of \"I Love Lucy\")\u2014charts \"the colossal gulf between the imagery sold to America regarding family life and the truth, for many Americans, of such family life in the 1990s.\" The \"sitcom\" representation of Mallory's household results in a visual dichotomy between her \"life as she imagined it should be (replete with an oppressive laugh track eradicating any scary sense of ambiguity)\" and the \"grim truth of it.\"\nIan Cooper wrote that Mickey Knox's prison interview \"parodies Geraldo Rivera's jailhouse interview with [Charles] Manson.\"\nProduction.\nConcept.\n\"Natural Born Killers\" was based on a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino, in which a married couple suddenly decide to go on a killing spree. Tarantino had sold an option for his script to producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy for $10,000 after he had tried, and failed, to direct it himself for $500,000. Hamsher and Murphy subsequently sold the screenplay to Warner Bros. Around the same time, Oliver Stone was made aware of the script. He was keen to find something more straightforward than his previous production, \"Heaven &amp; Earth\" (1993), a difficult shoot which had left him exhausted.\nDavid Veloz, associate producer Richard Rutowski, and Stone rewrote Tarantino's script, keeping much of the dialogue but changing the focus of the film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory. The script was revised so drastically that Tarantino was credited for the story only. In a 1993 interview, Tarantino stated that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone, and that he wished the film well.\nInitially, when producers Hamsher and Murphy had first brought the script to Stone's attention, he had envisioned it as an action film; \"something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of.\" As the project developed however, incidents such as the O. J. Simpson case, the Menendez brothers case, the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident, the Rodney King incident, and the Waco siege all took place. Stone came to feel that the media was heavily involved in the outcome of all of these cases, and that the media had become an all-pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for the good of ratings. As such, he changed the tone of the film from one of purely action to a \"vicious, coldhearted farce\" on the media. Coloring Stone's approach to the material, and contributing to the violent nature of the film, were the anger and sadness he felt at the breakdown of his second marriage. He also said in an interview that the film was influenced by the \"vitality\" of Indian cinema.\nCasting.\nStone cast Woody Harrelson partly because, \"frankly, he had that American, trashy look. There's something about Woody that evokes Kentucky or white trash.\" At the time, Harrelson was primarily known for his comedic performances, namely his role on the sitcom \"Cheers\", and Stone was compelled to cast him against type. Stone cast Lewis for a similar reason, noting that, despite her success as portraying a defiled teenage daughter in \"Cape Fear\" (1991), he felt she could \"pull off white trash, too. Juliette has malice in her eyes. She's got adorable eyes, but they jump and they gleam. I just felt they [were both] right. They didn't feel like they were upper-class people.\" Stone tried to convince Lewis to gain muscle mass for her role as Mallory so that she looked tougher, but she refused, saying she wanted the character to look like a pushover, not a bodybuilder.\nRobert Downey Jr. was cast as Wayne Gale, the reporter chronicling the Knoxes; Downey prepared for his role as reporter Wayne Gale by spending time with Australian TV shock-king Steve Dunleavy, and later convinced Stone to allow him to portray Gale with an Australian accent. Tom Sizemore was cast as Detective Jack Scagnetti, the psychotic police officer with murderous impulses himself, while Tommy Lee Jones was cast as Dwight McClusky, a prison warden who appears in the last act of the film. Rodney Dangerfield, primarily known as a stand-up comedian, portrayed Mallory's rapist father and was allowed by Stone to rewrite all of his own character's lines.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography took 56 days to shoot. Filming locations included the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge just west of Taos, New Mexico, where the wedding scene was filmed, and Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois, where the prison riot was filmed. In Stateville, 80% of the prisoners are incarcerated for violent crimes. For the first two weeks on location at the prison, the extras were actual inmates with rubber weapons. For the subsequent two weeks, 200 extras were needed because the Stateville inmates were on lockdown. According to Tom Sizemore, during filming on the prison set, Stone would play African tribal music at full blast between takes to keep the frantic energy up. While shooting the POV scene wherein Mallory runs into the wire mesh, director of photography Robert Richardson broke his finger and the replacement cameraman cut his eye. According to Oliver Stone, he was not popular with the camera department on set that day. For the scenes involving rear projection, the projected footage was shot prior to principal photography, then edited together, and projected onto the stage, behind the live actors. For example, when Mallory drives past a building and flames are projected onto the wall, this was shot live using footage projected onto the facade of a real building. An alternate ending was filmed but not used, in which Mickey and Mallory are shot dead by Arliss Howard's character. Stone decided against using this ending because he believed \"the 1990s were a time when the bad guys got away with it\".\nThe famous Coca-Cola polar bear ad is seen twice during the film. According to Stone, Coca-Cola approved the use of the ad without having a full idea of what the film was about. When they saw the completed film, they were furious.\nVisual style.\n\"Natural Born Killers\" was filmed and edited in a frenzied and psychedelic style and features both color and black and white cinematography, as well as animation (directed by Mike Smith), and other unusual color schemes and visual compositions. Editing of the film lasted approximately 11 months, with the final film containing almost 3,000 cuts (most films have 600\u2013700). The film also employs a wide range of camera angles, featuring Dutch tilts prominently throughout, with the camera rarely angling along a horizontal field of vision. Film scholar Robert Kolker notes that the Dutch angle's employment in the film is \"the visual equivalent of a profound dislocation, a loss of object constancy, the slipperiness of subjectivity itself.\" Kolker comments that, unlike such films as \"Bonnie and Clyde\" from which \"Natural Born Killers\" draws influence, \"from the very beginning...\u00a0 the viewer is forced into a dual situation, neither one of which allows easy access to the main characters. One situation, continued throughout the film, is a kind of rhythmic attention created by a startling flow of images. Stone builds his visuals on unexpected linkages and disorienting juxtapositions within the shots and edits.\"\nBecause the film is thematically preoccupied with media, Stone sought to implement visual elements of popular television into the film's visual tableau: \"It had never quite been done before\u00a0\u2013 a mixture of stocks and styles. I was influenced, I have to say, by MTV and some of the styles I saw in the early '80s and '90s on television. But no one had tried that style over the course of 90, 100 minutes.\" Commercials which were commonly on the air at the time of the film's release make brief, intermittent appearances as well.\nConcurrent with Stone's preoccupation with television as both a visual and thematic reference point, portions of the film are narrated through parodies of popular television series, including a sequence presented in the style of a sitcom about Mallory's dysfunctional family (titled \"I Love Mallory\"), a parody of \"I Love Lucy\". In the film's final montage, splices of real-life television news coverage of various criminal cases of the time are included, such as the O. J. Simpson case, the Menendez brothers, and the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident. Film scholar John Kenneth Muir notes this inclusion as an \"exclamation point\" concluding the film's thesis: \"It seems to say, 'Welcome to the tabloid-TV culture of America in the 1990s, where crime pays and pays well.'\"\nMusic.\nThe film's soundtrack was produced by Stone and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who reportedly watched the film over 50 times to \"get in the mood\". Reznor reportedly produced the soundtrack while on tour. On his approach to compiling the soundtrack, Reznor told MTV:\nI suggested to Oliver [Stone] to try to turn the soundtrack into a collage-of-sound, kind of the way the movie used music: make edits, add dialog, and make it something interesting, rather than a bunch of previously released music.\nSome songs were written especially for the film or soundtrack, such as \"Burn\" by Nine Inch Nails.\nRelease, reception and legacy.\nBox office.\nIn its opening weekend, \"Natural Born Killers\" grossed a total of $11.2 million in 1,510 theaters, finishing first at the US box office. It finished its theatrical run in the United States and Canada with a total gross of $50.3 million. It grossed an estimated $60 million internationally for a worldwide total of $110 million against its $34 million budget.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Natural Born Killers\" has an approval rating of 50% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Natural Born Killers\" explodes off the screen with style, but its satire is too blunt to offer any fresh insight into celebrity or crime \u2013 pummeling the audience with depravity until the effect becomes deadening.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average weighted score of 74 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \"Seeing this movie once is not enough. The first time is for the visceral experience, the second time is for the meaning.\" On his television show, his partner Gene Siskel agreed with him, adding extra praise to the scene featuring Rodney Dangerfield.\nCriticism.\nOther critics found the film unsuccessful in its aims. Much of the criticism centered around the perception that the film was not effective as a satire and its message was muddled. Janet Maslin of the \"New York Times\" wrote, \"While '\"Natural Born Killers\"' affects occasional disgust at the lurid world of Mickey and Mallory, it more often seems enamored of their exhilarating freedom. If there is a juncture at which these caricatures start looking like nihilist heroes, then the film passes that point many times.\" Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" voiced a similar concern, saying \"\"'Killers\"' is intended as a gonzo critique of the mass media and, by extension, of the bloodthirsty legions of couch potatoes whose prurient taste guarantees that the garbage rises to the top of the charts. But the film doesn't make it as a piece of social criticism. Primarily this is because the movie's jittery, psychedelic style is so obviously a kick for Stone to orchestrate. Bloody, pulpy excess is his thing; it's what he does best.\" Hinson noted the film also loses its \"symbolic footing\" when it transitions into a prison film.\nSome critics felt the film's focus on the mass media as the main culprit of society's ills rang hollow or that the film did not adequately hold the characters of Mickey and Mallory accountable for their actions. Maslin continued, \"for all its surface passions, \"Natural Born Killers\" never digs deep enough to touch the madness of such events, or even to send them up in any surprising way. Mr. Stone's vision is impassioned, alarming, visually inventive, characteristically overpowering. But it's no match for the awful truth.\"\nJames Berardinelli gave the film a negative review but his criticism was different from many other such pans, which generally said that Oliver Stone was a hypocrite for making an ultra-violent film in the guise of a critique of American attitudes. Berardinelli noted that the movie \"hits the bullseye\" as a satire of America's lust for bloodshed, but repeated Stone's main point so often and so loudly that it became unbearable.\nStone got in trouble with the Native American community for the use of Russell Means.\nIn 2015, Taste of Cinema ranked the film 22nd among the \"30 Great Psychopath Movies That Are Worth Your Time\", and GamesRadar+ named the two lead characters among the \"50 Creepiest Movie Psychopaths.\nAccolades.\nAt the 1994 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Harrelson was nominated for Worst Actor but lost to Bruce Willis for \"Color of Night\" and \"North\". The film was nominated for Worst Picture but lost to \"North\".\nRetrospective.\nFor the film's 25th anniversary in 2019, critics wrote about the film's impact in popular culture and its relevance today. Writing for \"The Guardian\", Charles Bramesco argued the film's rebuke of the media as responsible for violence does not hold up to current times. Bramesco wrote, \"With every public bloodbath [in the news today], discourse inches closer to accepting their root cause as a combination of lax gun laws and an undercurrent of psychosis endemic to those feeling marginalized from society. Stone\u2019s inquest may have been a shock to the system at the time, but his tracing of that psychosis back to the evils of television scans as borderline reactionary to present-day sensibilities.\" Bramesco also noted the film's inclusion of Native American mysticism into its plot felt like a \"white understanding of native culture.\"\nCritic Owen Gleiberman said the film still \"captures how our parasitical relationship to pop culture can magnify the cycle of violence...\"'Natural Born Killers\"' was the movie that glimpsed the looking glass we were passing through, the new psycho-metaphysical space we were living inside \u2014 the roller-coaster of images and advertisements, of entertainment and illusion, of demons that come up through fantasy and morph into daydreams, of vicarious violence that bleeds into real violence.\u201d\nIn recent retrospective critiques, \"Natural Born Killers\" has been reexamined for its provocativeness and its media satire edge.\nHome media.\n\"Natural Born Killers\" was released on VHS in 1995 by Warner Home Video. A director's cut version of the film was released the following year on VHS by Vidmark/Lionsgate, who also released a non-anamorphic DVD of the director's cut in 2000. Distribution rights to Stone's director's cut reverted from Lionsgate to Warner Bros. in 2009, after which Warner issued an anamorphic DVD edition as well as a Blu-ray. Shout Factory licensed the title for a 4K UHD release and released it on September 26, 2023.\nControversies.\nQuentin Tarantino.\nAfter Quentin Tarantino attempted to publish his original screenplay to \"Natural Born Killers\" as a paperback book, as he had done with his scripts for \"True Romance\" and his own directorial efforts, \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\", the producers of \"Natural Born Killers\" filed a lawsuit against Tarantino, claiming that when he sold the script to them, he had forfeited the publishing rights; eventually, Tarantino was allowed to publish his original script. Tarantino disowned the film, saying, \"I hated that fucking movie. If you like my stuff, don't watch that movie.\" He also claimed to have never watched the film from beginning to end.\nCensorship.\nWhen the film was first submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), employees told Stone they would give it an NC-17 unless he edited it. As such, Stone removed some violence by cutting approximately four minutes of footage and the MPAA re-rated the film as an R. In 1996, a Director's Cut was released on home video by Vidmark Entertainment and Pioneer Entertainment. Warner Home Video later released this cut on Blu-ray.\nThe film was banned in Ireland, including\u00a0\u2013 controversially\u00a0\u2013 from cinema clubs. The ban was later lifted. In the UK, though the cinema release was delayed while the BBFC investigated reports that the film caused copycat murders in the US and France, it was finally shown in cinemas in February 1995. The BBFC classified the film uncut at 18, citing strong bloody violence and sexual violence. The film was also banned in the Philippines by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), a government agency.\nThe original intended UK home video release in March 1996 was cancelled due to the Dunblane massacre in Scotland. In the meantime, Channel Five showed the film in November 1997. It was finally released on video in July 2001. \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the film as the eighth most controversial film ever.\n\"Copycat\" crimes.\nFrom almost the moment of its release, the film has been accused of encouraging and inspiring numerous murderers in North America, including the perpetrators of the 1997 Heath High School shooting and the Columbine High School massacre. The Columbine killers even code-named their attack \"NBK\", an initialism for \"Natural Born Killers\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After her parents separated, she lived in Maryland with an aunt and uncle for six years. When her mother remarried in 1929, she moved to Chicago and was adopted by her mother's second husband. As Nancy Davis, she was a Hollywood actress in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in films such as \"The Next Voice You Hear...\", \"Night into Morning\", and \"Donovan's Brain\". In 1952, she married Ronald Reagan, who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild. He had two children from his previous marriage to Jane Wyman, and he and Nancy had two children together. Nancy Reagan was the first lady of California when her husband was governor from 1967 to 1975, and she began to work with the Foster Grandparents Program.\nReagan became First Lady of the United States in January 1981, following her husband's victory in the 1980 presidential election. Early in his first term, she was criticized largely due to her decisions both to replace the White House china, which had been paid for by private donations, and to accept free clothing from fashion designers. She championed opposition to recreational drug use when she founded the \"Just Say No\" drug awareness campaign, considered her major initiative as First Lady, although it received substantial criticism for stigmatizing poor communities affected by the crack epidemic. More discussion of her role ensued following a 1988 revelation that she had consulted an astrologer to assist in planning the president's schedule after the attempted assassination of her husband in 1981. She generally had a strong influence on her husband and played a role in a few of his personnel and diplomatic decisions.\nThe couple returned to their home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, after leaving the White House. Reagan devoted most of her time to caring for her husband, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, until his death at the age of 93 on June 5, 2004. Reagan remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics, particularly in support of embryonic stem cell research, until her death from congestive heart failure at age 94 in 2016. She gained high approval ratings in later life for her devotion to her husband in his final illness.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and education.\nAnne Frances Robbins was born in Manhattan on July 6, 1921, but throughout her life she told others she was born in 1923. Her parents were used car salesman Kenneth Robbins and retired actress Edith Luckett. The actress Alla Nazimova was her godmother. She was named Anne after her great-great-great-grandmother, but her mother took to calling her \"Nancy\" until that became the name she was known by. Robbins lived her first two years in Flushing, a neighborhood in Queens, in a two-story house on Roosevelt Avenue between 149th and 150th Streets. \nRobbins' parents split in 1923 when her mother decided to return to acting and the couple could not agree on where to live. Her father removed himself from her life, and her mother resumed work as a stage actress. Robbins was placed with her mother's sister, Virginia Galbraith, in Bethesda, Maryland, along with her uncle and cousin. She attended Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. Robbins missed her mother while living with her aunt, and they made trips to New York so she could see her mother perform on stage. She emulated her mother by wearing makeup and pretending to be an actress. Robbins' parents finalized their divorce in 1928. Later analysis of her life has focused on this unstable family environment as a reason why she held marriage as a life goal.\nRobbins's mother remarried in 1929, giving her a stepfather at age seven. Loyal Davis was a neurosurgeon, and the family moved to Chicago together where she formed a close bond with her stepfather. She would always refer to him as her father. She also had a stepbrother but did not develop a close relationship with him. She attended Girls' Latin School in Chicago, where she involved in Drama Club, field hockey, and student government. In her senior year, she had the lead role in the school play \"First Lady\".\nHaving a wealthy neurosurgeon as a stepfather meant a comfortable childhood where Robbins lived beyond the means of most Americans, and the family socialized in high society. Her mother's career also meant that Robbins had regular interactions with famous actors of the day, especially with their family friends Katharine Hepburn, Walter Huston, and Spencer Tracy. Her stepfather's conservative beliefs were a strong influence on her own politics.\nRobbins was adopted by her stepfather at age fourteen, and she changed her legal name to Nancy Davis. In 1939, Davis left Girls' Latin School and began attending Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she studied English and drama. Among her instructors was Federal Theatre Project director Hallie Flanagan. Davis was a debutante that December, where she met Frank Birney, who kept introducing himself to her under different names to make her comfortable. They were eventually engaged, but he was struck by a train and killed before they were married.\nDavis graduated from Smith College in 1943. She took a job as a sales clerk at Marshall Field's in Chicago, but she left the job before long and volunteered as a nurse's aide.\nActing career.\nDavis moved to New York to work as an actress and model under the tutelage of Walter Huston and Spencer Tracy. This began when family friend ZaSu Pitts got her a role in the play \"Ramshackle Inn\" on Broadway in 1945. She had a total of three lines. Although the play closed soon after, she followed it with a role in \"Lute Song\". Davis dated Clark Gable for one week, which brought her a higher public profile.\nIn 1940, a young Davis had appeared as a National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis volunteer in a memorable short subject film shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against polio. \"The Crippler\" featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms, laughing over its victims, until finally dispelled by the volunteer. It was very effective in raising contributions.\nShe landed the role of Si-Tchun, a lady-in-waiting, in the 1946 Broadway musical about the Orient, \"Lute Song\", starring Mary Martin and a pre-fame Yul Brynner. The show's producer told her, \"You look like you could be Chinese.\"\nDavis went to Hollywood in 1949 when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer asked her to participate in a screen test. Her mother worked with Tracy to get director George Cukor to evaluate the test, and Davis was offered a seven-year contract. She appeared in eleven movies over the following years, where she was typecast as a wife and mother. She later remarked, \"Joining Metro was like walking into a dream world.\" Her combination of attractive appearance\u2014centered on her large eyes\u2014and somewhat distant and understated manner made her hard at first for MGM to cast and publicize. Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, Leslie Caron, and Janet Leigh were among the actresses with whom she competed for roles at MGM.\nDavis' film career began with small supporting roles in two films that were released in 1949, \"The Doctor and the Girl\" with Glenn Ford and \"East Side, West Side\" starring Barbara Stanwyck. She played a child psychiatrist in the film noir \"Shadow on the Wall\" (1950) with Ann Sothern and Zachary Scott; her performance was called \"beautiful and convincing\" by \"New York Times\" critic A. H. Weiler. She co-starred in 1950's \"The Next Voice You Hear...\", playing a pregnant housewife who hears the voice of God from her radio. Influential reviewer Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"Nancy Davis [is] delightful as [a] gentle, plain, and understanding wife.\" In 1951, Davis appeared in \"Night into Morning\", her favorite screen role, a study of bereavement starring Ray Milland. Crowther said that Davis \"does nicely as the fianc\u00e9e who is widowed herself and knows the loneliness of grief\", while another noted critic, \"The Washington Post\"'s Richard L. Coe, said Davis \"is splendid as the understanding widow\". MGM released Davis from her contract in 1952; she sought a broader range of parts, but also married Reagan, keeping her professional name as Davis, and had her first child that year. She soon starred in the science fiction film \"Donovan's Brain\" (1953); Crowther said that Davis, playing the role of a possessed scientist's \"sadly baffled wife\", \"walked through it all in stark confusion\" in an \"utterly silly\" film. In her next-to-last movie, \"Hellcats of the Navy\" (1957), she played nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair, and appeared in a film for the only time with her husband, playing what one critic called \"a housewife who came along for the ride\". Another reviewer, however, stated that Davis plays her part satisfactorily, and \"does well with what she has to work with\".\nAuthor Garry Wills has said that Davis was generally underrated as an actress because her constrained part in \"Hellcats\" was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her \"greatest ambition\" was to have a \"successful happy marriage\"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, \"I was never really a career woman but [became one] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress.\" Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a \"reliable\" and \"solid\" performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, \"Crash Landing\" (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the \"Zane Grey Theatre\" episode \"The Long Shadow\" (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as \"Wagon Train\" and \"The Tall Man\", until she retired as an actress in 1962.\nDuring her career, Davis served for nearly ten years on the board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild. Decades later, Albert Brooks attempted to coax her out of acting retirement by offering her the title role opposite himself in his 1996 film \"Mother\". She declined in order to care for her husband, and Debbie Reynolds played the part.\nMarriage and family.\nDuring her Hollywood career, Davis dated many actors, including Clark Gable, Robert Stack, and Peter Lawford; she later called Gable the nicest of the stars she had met. On November 15, 1949, she met Ronald Reagan, who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild. She had noticed that her name had appeared on the Hollywood blacklist. Davis sought Reagan's help to maintain her employment as a guild actress in Hollywood and for assistance in having her name removed from the list. Ronald Reagan informed her that she had been confused with another actress of the same name. The two began dating and their relationship was the subject of many gossip columns; one Hollywood press account described their nightclub-free times together as \"the romance of a couple who have no vices\". Ronald Reagan was skeptical about marriage, however, following his painful 1949 divorce from Jane Wyman, and he still saw other women.\nAfter three years of dating, they eventually decided to marry while discussing the issue in the couple's favorite booth at Chasen's, a restaurant in Beverly Hills. The couple wed on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, in a simple, hastily arranged ceremony designed to avoid the press; the marriage was her first and his second. The only people in attendance were fellow actor William Holden (the best man) and his wife, actress Brenda Marshall (the matron of honor). In her second memoir, Nancy acknowledged that she was already pregnant; the couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (later better known by her professional name, Patti Davis), was born less than eight months later on October 21, 1952. Their son, Ronald Prescott Reagan (later better known as Ron Reagan) was born six years later on May 20, 1958. Reagan also became stepmother to Maureen Reagan (1941\u20132001) and Michael Reagan (b. 1945), her husband's children from his marriage to Jane Wyman.\nObservers described Nancy and Ronald's relationship as intimate. As president and first lady, the Reagans were reported to display their affection frequently, with one press secretary noting, \"They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting.\" Ronald often called Nancy \"Mommy\"; she called him \"Ronnie\". While the president was recuperating in the hospital after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy wrote in her diary, \"Nothing can happen to my Ronnie. My life would be over.\" In a letter to Nancy, Ronald wrote, \"whatever I treasure and enjoy ... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you.\" In 1998, a few years after her husband had been given a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Nancy told \"Vanity Fair\", \"Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him.\" Nancy was known for the focused and attentive look, termed \"the Gaze\", that she fastened upon her husband during his speeches and appearances.\nPresident Reagan's death in June 2004 ended what Charlton Heston called \"the greatest love affair in the history of the American Presidency\".\nNancy frequently quarreled with her biological children and her stepchildren, and was estranged from all of them at various points, as was Ronald. Her relationship with Patti was the most contentious; Patti flouted American conservatism, rebelled against her parents by joining the nuclear freeze movement, and authored many anti-Reagan books. Patti became estranged from her parents. Soon after her father's Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed, Patti and her mother reconciled and began to speak on a daily basis. Nancy's disagreements with Michael were also public matters; in 1984, she was quoted as saying that the two were in an \"estrangement right now\". Michael responded that Nancy was trying to cover up for the fact she had not met his daughter, Ashley, who had been born nearly a year earlier. They too eventually made peace. Nancy was thought to be \"closest\" to her stepdaughter Maureen during the White House years, but earned a reputation for being a poor mother.\nFirst Lady of California (1967\u20131975).\nNancy Reagan was First Lady of California during her husband's two terms as governor. She disliked living in the state capital of Sacramento, which lacked the excitement, social life, and mild climate to which she was accustomed in Los Angeles. She first attracted controversy early in 1967; after four months' residence in the California Governor's Mansion in Sacramento, she moved her family into a wealthy suburb because fire officials had labelled the mansion as a \"firetrap\". Though the Reagans had leased the new house at their expense, the move was viewed as snobbish when the matter was brought to the attention of the general public. Reagan defended her actions as being for the good of her family, a judgment with which her husband readily agreed. Friends of the family later helped support the cost of the leased house, while Reagan supervised construction of a new ranch-style governor's residence in nearby Carmichael. The new residence was finished just as Ronald Reagan left office in 1975, but his successor, Jerry Brown, refused to live there. It was sold in 1982, and California governors lived in improvised arrangements until Brown moved into the Governor's Mansion in 2015.\nIn 1967, Governor Reagan appointed his wife to the California Arts Commission, and a year later she was named \"Los Angeles Times\" Woman of the Year; in its profile, the \"Times\" labeled her \"A Model First Lady\". Her glamour, style, and youthfulness,\nmade her a frequent subject for press photographers. As first lady, Reagan visited veterans, the elderly, and the disabled, and worked with a number of charities. She became involved with the Foster Grandparents Program, helping to popularize it in the United States and Australia. She later expanded her work with the organization after arriving in Washington, and wrote about her experiences in her 1982 book \"To Love a Child\". The Reagans held dinners for former POWs and Vietnam War veterans while governor and first lady. Additionally, Reagan was a member of the Junior League of Los Angeles, CA.\nRole in 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns.\nGovernor Reagan's gubernatorial time in office ended in 1975, and he did not run for a third term; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a possible bid for the 1976 presidency, challenging incumbent president Gerald Ford. Ronald still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running, however. She feared for her husband's health and his career as a whole, though she felt that he was the right man for the job and approved eventually. Nancy took on a traditional role in the campaign, holding coffees, luncheons, and talks. She also oversaw personnel, monitored her husband's schedule, and occasionally provided press conferences. The 1976 campaign included the so-called \"battle of the queens\", contrasting Nancy with First Lady Betty Ford. They both spoke out over the course of the campaign on similar issues, but with different approaches. Nancy was upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had drawn of her husband.\nThough he lost the 1976 Republican nomination, Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency a second time in 1980. He succeeded in winning the nomination and defeated incumbent rival Jimmy Carter in a landslide. During this second campaign, Nancy played a prominent role, and her management of staff became more apparent. She organized a meeting among feuding campaign managers John Sears and Michael Deaver and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa Caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and decided it was time to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal. Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.\nFirst Lady of the United States (1981\u20131989).\nWhite House glamour.\nRenovation.\nReagan became the first lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as president in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated her desire to create a more suitable \"first home\" in the White House, as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect. White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third-floor family residence as having \"cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [and] beaten up floors\"; Rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations. In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the press briefing room. The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires. The closet in the master bedroom was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium.\nThe First Lady secured the assistance of renowned interior designer Ted Graber, popular with affluent West Coast social figures, to redecorate the family living quarters. A Chinese-pattern, handpainted wallpaper was added to the master bedroom. Family furniture was placed in the president's private study. The first lady and her designer retrieved several White House antiques, which had been in storage, and placed them throughout the mansion. In addition, many of Reagan's collectibles were put out for display, including around twenty-five Limoges Boxes, as well as some porcelain eggs and a collection of plates.\nThe extensive redecoration was paid for by private donations. Many significant and long-lasting changes occurred as a result of the renovation and refurbishment, of which Reagan said, \"This house belongs to all Americans, and I want it to be something of which they can be proud.\" The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax-deductible donations, meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax-paying public.\nFashion.\nReagan's interest in fashion was another one of her trademarks. While her husband was still president-elect, press reports speculated about Reagan's social life and interest in fashion. In many press accounts, Reagan's sense of style was favorably compared to that of a previous first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy. Friends and those close to her remarked that, while fashionable like Kennedy, she would be different from other first ladies; close friend Harriet Deutsch was quoted as saying, \"Nancy has her own imprint.\"\nWhite House photographer Mary Anne Fackelman-Miner, who was assigned to Reagan, said of her, \"She always photographed so easily and was at ease in front of the cameras.\"\nReagan's wardrobe consisted of dresses, gowns, and suits made by luxury designers, including James Galanos, Bill Blass, and Oscar de la Renta. Her white, hand-beaded, one shoulder Galanos 1981 inaugural gown was estimated to cost $10,000, while the overall price of her inaugural wardrobe was said to cost $25,000. She favored the color red, calling it \"a picker-upper\", and wore it accordingly. Her wardrobe included red so often that the fire-engine shade became known as \"Reagan red\". She employed two private hairdressers, who would style her hair on a regular basis in the White House.\nFashion designers were pleased with the emphasis Reagan placed on clothing. Adolfo said the first lady embodied an \"elegant, affluent, well-bred, chic American look\", while Bill Blass commented, \"I don't think there's been anyone in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who has her flair.\" William Fine, president of cosmetic company Frances Denney, noted that she \"stays in style, but she doesn't become trendy.\"\nThough her elegant fashions and wardrobe were hailed as a \"glamorous paragon of chic\", they were also controversial subjects. In 1982, she revealed that she had accepted thousands of dollars in clothing, jewelry, and other gifts, but defended her actions by stating that she had borrowed the clothes and that they would either be returned or donated to museums, and that she was promoting the American fashion industry. Facing criticism, she soon said she would no longer accept such loans. While often buying her clothes, she continued to borrow and sometimes keep designer clothes throughout her time as first lady, which came to light in 1988. None of this had been included on financial disclosure forms; the non-reporting of loans under $10,000 in liability was in violation of a voluntary agreement the White House had made in 1982, while not reporting more valuable loans or clothes not returned was a possible violation of the Ethics in Government Act. Reagan expressed through her press secretary \"regrets that she failed to heed counsel's advice\" on disclosing them.\nDespite the controversy, many designers who allowed her to borrow clothing, noted that the arrangement was good for their businesses, as well as for the American fashion industry overall. In 1989, Reagan was honored at the annual gala awards dinner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, during which she received the council's lifetime achievement award. Barbara Walters said of her, \"She has served every day for eight long years the word 'style.'\"\nExtravagance.\nApproximately a year into her husband's first term, Nancy explored the idea of ordering new state china service for the White House. A full china service had not been purchased since the Truman administration in the 1940s, as only a partial service was ordered in the Johnson administration. She was quoted as saying, \"The White House really badly, badly needs china.\" Working with Lenox, the primary porcelain manufacturer in America, the first lady chose a design scheme of a red with etched gold band, bordering the scarlet and cream colored ivory plates with a raised presidential seal etched in gold in the center. The full service comprised 4,370 pieces, with 19 pieces per individual set. The service totaled $209,508. Although it was paid for by private donations, some from the private J. P. Knapp Foundation, the purchase generated quite a controversy, for it was ordered at a time when the nation was undergoing an economic recession. Furthermore, news of the china purchase emerged at the same time that her husband's administration had proposed school lunch regulations that would allow ketchup to be counted as a vegetable.\nThe new china set, White House renovations, expensive clothing, and her attendance at the wedding of Charles and Diana, Prince and Princess of Wales, gave her an aura of being \"out of touch\" with the American people during the recession. This built upon the reputation she had coming to Washington, wherein many people concluded that Reagan was a vain and shallow woman, and her taste for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname \"Queen Nancy\". While Jacqueline Kennedy had also faced some press criticism for her spending habits, Reagan's treatment was much more consistent and negative. In an attempt to deflect the criticism, she self-deprecatingly donned a baglady costume at the 1982 Gridiron Dinner and sang \"Second-Hand Clothes\", mimicking the song \"Second-Hand Rose\". The skit helped to restore her reputation.\nReagan reflected on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, \"My Turn\". She described lunching with former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert S. Strauss, wherein Strauss said to her, \"When you first came to town, Nancy, I didn't like you at all. But after I got to know you, I changed my mind and said, 'She's some broad!'\" Reagan responded, \"Bob, based on the press reports I read then, I wouldn't have liked me either!\"\nAfter the presidency of Jimmy Carter (who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions), Reagan brought a Kennedy-esque glamour back into the White House. She hosted 56 state dinners over eight years. She remarked that hosting the dinners is \"the easiest thing in the world. You don't have to do anything. Just have a good time and do a little business. And that's the way Washington works.\" The White House residence staff found Reagan demanding to work for during the preparation for the state dinners, with the first lady overseeing every aspect of meal presentations, and sometimes requesting one dessert after another be prepared, before finally settling on one she approved of.\nIn general, the First Lady's desire for everything to appear just right in the White House led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for, with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes. One staffer later recalled, \"I remember hearing her call for her personal maid one day and it scared the dickens out of me\u2014just her tone. I never wanted to be on the wrong side of her.\" She did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff. In particular, she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to Paraguay, providing an affidavit to the maid's good character (even though it was politically inopportune to do so at the time of the Iran\u2013Contra affair); charges were subsequently dropped, and the maid returned to work at the White House.\nIn 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev became the first Soviet leader to visit Washington, D.C., since Nikita Khrushchev made the trip in 1959 at the height of the Cold War. Nancy was in charge of planning and hosting the important and highly anticipated state dinner, with the goal to impress both the Soviet leader and especially his wife Raisa Gorbacheva. After the meal, she recruited pianist Van Cliburn to play a rendition of \"Moscow Nights\" for the Soviet delegation, to which Mikhail and Raisa broke out into song. Secretary of State George P. Shultz later commented on the evening, saying \"We felt the ice of the Cold War crumbling.\" Reagan concluded, \"It was a perfect ending for one of the great evenings of my husband's presidency.\"\nJust Say No.\nWith the help of her Chief of Staff James Rosebush, the first lady launched the \"Just Say No\" drug awareness campaign in 1982, which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady. Reagan first became aware of the need to educate young people about drugs during a 1980 campaign stop in Daytop village, New York. She remarked in 1981 that \"Understanding what drugs can do to your children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is ... the first step in solving the problem.\" Her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse.\nIn 1982, Reagan was asked by a schoolgirl what to do when offered drugs; Reagan responded: \"Just say no.\" The phrase proliferated in the popular culture of the 1980s, and was eventually adopted as the name of club organizations and school anti-drug programs. Reagan became actively involved by traveling more than throughout the United States and several nations, visiting drug abuse prevention programs and drug rehabilitation centers. She also appeared on television talk shows, recorded public service announcements, and wrote guest articles. She appeared in an episode of the sitcom \"Diff'rent Strokes\" to underscore support for the \"Just Say No\" campaign, and in a rock music video, \"Stop the Madness\" (1985).\nIn 1985, Reagan expanded the campaign to an international level by inviting the First Ladies of various nations to the White House for a conference on drug abuse. On October 27, 1986, President Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill into law, which granted $1.7\u00a0billion in funding to fight the perceived crisis and ensured a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses. Although the bill was criticized, Reagan considered it a personal victory. In 1988, she became the first active first lady invited to address the United Nations General Assembly, where she spoke on international drug interdiction and trafficking laws.\nCritics of Reagan's efforts questioned their purpose, labelled Reagan's approach to promoting drug awareness as simplistic, and argued that the program did not give adequate attention to various social issues associated with increased rates of drug use, including unemployment, poverty, and family dissolution.\nHer husband's protector.\nReagan assumed the role of unofficial \"protector\" for her husband after the attempted assassination of him in 1981. On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by the attempted assassin 25-year old John Hinckley Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen \"emergency rooms before, but I had never seen one like this \u2013 with my husband in it.\" She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, \"Honey, I forgot to duck\", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.\nAn early example of the first lady's protective nature occurred when Senator Strom Thurmond entered the president's hospital room that day in March, passing the Secret Service detail by claiming he was the President's \"close friend\", presumably to acquire media attention. Nancy was outraged and demanded that he leave. While the President recuperated in the hospital, the first lady slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by the scent. When Ronald Reagan was released from the hospital on April 12, she escorted him back to the White House.\nPress accounts framed Reagan as her husband's \"chief protector\", an extension of their general initial framing of her as a helpmate and a Cold War domestic ideal. As it happened, the day after her husband was shot, she fell off a chair while trying to take down a picture to bring to him in the hospital; she suffered several broken ribs, but was determined to not reveal it publicly.\nAstrological consultations.\nDuring the Reagan administration, Nancy Reagan consulted a San Francisco astrologer, Joan Quigley, who provided advice on which days and times would be optimal for the president's safety and success. Quigley began her work at the White House after the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Nancy Reagan was told by Merv Griffin that Quigley had predicted that day would be dangerous for President Reagan, causing her to become a regular astrological consultant for the administration. Quigley previously worked on the Reagan campaign prior to serving as their astrological consultant. She volunteered for their campaign in 1980, as she was impressed by his astrological chart. Private lines were set up in the White House and Camp David to assist in phone calls between Nancy Reagan and Joan Quigley, which occurred multiple times a day, and she was paid $3,000 a month for her work.\nWhite House chief of staff Donald Regan grew frustrated with this regimen, which created friction between him and the first lady. This friction escalated with the revelation of the Iran\u2013Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the first lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though the first lady refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. She became so angry with Regan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded\u2014and eventually received\u2014Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to her to have Regan fired.\nIn his 1988 memoir, \"For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington\", Regan wrote the following about Nancy Reagan's consultations with an astrologer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans made during my time as White House Chief of Staff was cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco [Quigley] who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise.\nDonald Regan's memoir went on to cause political discourse, as well as scrutiny of the astrological community, as he exposed the \"most closely guarded secret\" of the Reagan administration. Although he did not know Quigley's name at the time, he wrote extensively on her role in the White House. Regan further claimed that Quigley selected the date of the 1985 Geneva Summit. For her part, Quigley stated in 1998 that she had \"'absolutely nothing'\" to do with arranging the summit and added that others were \"'overemphasizing'\" her role; however, in 1990, she released a book in which she asserted that she was \"in charge\" of the President's scheduling during the Reagan administration.\nReagan acknowledged in her memoirs that she altered the President's schedule without his knowledge based on astrological advice, but argues that \"no political decision was ever based [on astrology]\". She added, \"Astrology was simply one of the ways I coped with the fear I felt after my husband almost died ... Was astrology one of the reasons [further attempts did not occur]? I don't \"really\" believe it was, but I don't \"really\" believe it wasn't.\"\nInfluence in the White House.\nNancy Reagan wielded a powerful influence over President Reagan.\nIn her memoirs, Reagan stated, \"I felt panicky every time [Ronald Reagan] left the White House\". Following the assassination attempt, she strictly controlled access to the president; occasionally, she even attempted to influence her husband's decision making.\nBeginning in 1985, she strongly encouraged her husband to hold \"summit\" conferences with Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, and suggested they form a personal relationship beforehand. Both Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev had developed a productive relationship through their summit negotiations. The relationship between Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbacheva was anything but the friendly, diplomatic one between their husbands; Reagan found Gorbacheva hard to converse with and their relationship was described as \"frosty\". The two women usually had tea and discussed differences between the USSR and the United States. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, Gorbacheva irked Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American president's wife to quip, \"Who does that dame think she is?\"\nPress framing of Reagan changed from that of just helpmate and protector to someone with hidden power. As the image of her as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying \"In no way do I apologize for it.\" She wrote in her memoirs, \"I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted,\" but went on, \"However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will.\" Her chief of staff James Rosebush's 1988 book \"First Lady, Public Wife\" explored the role of the First Lady as a demanding and rigorous job.\nBreast cancer.\nIn October 1987, a mammogram detected a lesion in Reagan's left breast and she was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer. She chose to undergo a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy, and the breast was removed on October 17, 1987. Ten days after the operation, her 99-year-old mother, Edith Luckett Davis, died in Phoenix, Arizona, leading Reagan to dub the period \"a terrible month\".\nAfter the surgery, more women across the country had mammograms, which exemplified the influence that the first lady possessed.\nLater life (1989\u20132016).\nThough Reagan was a controversial first lady, 56\u00a0percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her when her husband left office on January 20, 1989, with 18\u00a0percent having an unfavorable opinion, and the balance not giving an opinion. Compared to fellow first ladies when their husbands left office, Reagan's approval was higher than those of Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump, and Jill Biden. However, she was less popular than Barbara Bush, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama, and her disapproval rating was double that of Carter's.\nUpon leaving the White House, the couple returned to California, where wealthy friends purchased them a home at 668 St. Cloud Road in the wealthy East Gate Old Bel Air neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles, dividing their time between Bel Air and the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, California. Ronald and Nancy regularly attended the Bel Air Church as well. After leaving Washington, Reagan made numerous public appearances, many on behalf of her husband. She continued to reside at the Bel Air home, where she lived with her husband until he died on June 5, 2004.\nReagan's official White House portrait was painted by Aaron Shikler and unveiled at the White House in 1989. It depicts her in a red dress standing against the doors of the State Dining Room.\nEarly post\u2013White House activities.\nIn late 1989, the former first lady established the Nancy Reagan Foundation, which aimed to continue to educate people about the dangers of substance abuse. The Foundation teamed with the BEST Foundation For A Drug-Free Tomorrow in 1994, and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program. She continued to travel around the United States, speaking out against drug and alcohol abuse.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRonnie's long journey has finally taken him to a distant place where I can no longer reach him.\n\u2014 Nancy Reagan (May 2004)\nHer memoirs, \"My Turn: The Memoirs of Nancy Reagan\" (1989), are an account of her life in the White House, commenting openly about her influence within the Reagan administration, and discussing the myths and controversies that surrounded the couple. In 1991, the author Kitty Kelley wrote an unauthorized and largely uncited biography about Reagan, repeating accounts of a poor relationship with her children, and introducing rumors of alleged sexual relations with singer Frank Sinatra. A wide range of sources commented that Kelley's largely unsupported claims are most likely false.\nIn 1989, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) began investigating the Reagans over allegations they owed additional tax on the gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewellery to the first lady during their time in the White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income even if they are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3\u00a0million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.\nAfter President Reagan revealed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, she made herself his primary caregiver, and became actively involved with the National Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute in Chicago, Illinois.\nIn April 1997, Nancy Reagan joined President Bill Clinton and former Presidents Ford and Bush in signing the Summit Declaration of Commitment in advocating for participation by private citizens in solving domestic issues within the United States.\nNancy Reagan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002. President Reagan received his own Presidential Medal of Freedom in January 1993. Reagan and her husband were jointly awarded the Congressional Gold Medal on May 16, 2002, at the United States Capitol building, and were only the third president and first lady to receive it; she accepted the medal on behalf of both of them.\nFuneral for Ronald Reagan.\nRonald Reagan died in their Bel Air home on June 5, 2004. During the seven-day state funeral, Nancy, accompanied by her children and military escort, led the nation in mourning. She kept a strong composure, traveling from her home to the Reagan Library for a memorial service, then to Washington, D.C., where her husband's body lay in state for 34 hours prior to a national funeral service in the Washington National Cathedral. She returned to the library in Simi Valley for a sunset memorial service and interment, where, overcome with emotion, she lost her composure and cried in public for the first time during the week. After receiving the folded flag, she kissed the casket and mouthed \"I love you\" before leaving. During the week, CNN journalist Wolf Blitzer said, \"She's a very, very strong woman, even though she looks frail.\"\nShe had directed the detailed planning of the funeral, which included scheduling all the major events and asking former president George H. W. Bush, as well as former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney to speak during the National Cathedral Service. She paid very close attention to the details, something she had always done in her husband's life. Betsy Bloomingdale, one of Reagan's closest friends, stated, \"She looks a little frail. But she is very strong inside. She is. She has the strength. She is doing her last thing for Ronnie. And she is going to get it right.\" The funeral marked her first major public appearance since she delivered a speech to the 1996 Republican National Convention on her husband's behalf.\nThe funeral had a great impact on her public image. Following substantial criticism during her tenure as first lady, she was seen somewhat as a national heroine, praised by many for supporting and caring for her husband while he suffered from Alzheimer's disease. \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" opined, \"after a decade in the shadows, a different, softer Nancy Reagan emerged.\"\nWidowhood.\nFollowing her husband's death, Reagan remained active in politics, particularly relating to stem cell research. Beginning in 2004, she favored what many consider to be the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W. Bush to support federally funded embryonic stem cell research, in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his campaign for a second term.\nIn 2005, Reagan was honored at a gala dinner at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., where guests included Dick Cheney, Harry Reid, and Condoleezza Rice.\nIn 2007, she attended the national funeral service for Gerald Ford in the Washington National Cathedral. Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, the first in May 2007 and the second in January 2008. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.\nReagan attended the funeral of Lady Bird Johnson in Austin, Texas, on July 14, 2007, and three days later accepted the highest Polish distinction, the Order of the White Eagle, on behalf of Ronald Reagan at the Reagan Library. The Reagan Library opened the temporary exhibit \"Nancy Reagan: A First Lady's Style\", which displayed over eighty designer dresses belonging to her.\nReagan's health and well-being became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported that she did not break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain.\nIn October 2008, Reagan was admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after falling at home. Doctors determined that the 87-year-old had fractured her pelvis and sacrum, and could recuperate at home with a regimen of physical therapy. As a result of her mishap, medical articles were published containing information on how to prevent falls. In January 2009, Reagan was said to be \"improving every day and starting to get out more and more\".\nIn March 2009, she praised President Barack Obama for reversing the ban on federally funded embryonic stem cell research. She traveled to Washington, D.C., in June 2009 to unveil a statue of her late husband in the Capitol rotunda. She was also on hand as President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act, and lunched privately with Michelle Obama. Reagan revealed in an interview with \"Vanity Fair\" that Michelle Obama had telephoned her for advice on living and entertaining in the White House. Following the death of Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009, she said she was \"terribly saddened ... Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family ... I will miss him.\" She attended the funeral of Betty Ford in Rancho Mirage, California, on July 12, 2011.\nReagan hosted a 2012 Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Presidential Library on September 7, 2011. She suffered a fall in March 2012. Two months later, she endured several broken ribs, which prevented her from attending a speech given by Paul Ryan in the Reagan Presidential Library in May 2012. She endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on May 31, 2012, explaining that her husband would have liked Romney's business background and what she called \"strong principles\". Following the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in April 2013, she stated, \"The world has lost a true champion of freedom and democracy ... Ronnie and I knew her as a dear and trusted friend, and I will miss her.\"\nAfter her death, her son, Michael Reagan, said that he had no doubts that if his mother were alive, she would have voted for Hillary Clinton.\nDeath and funeral.\nOn March 6, 2016, Nancy Reagan died of congestive heart failure at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 94. On March 7, President Barack Obama issued a presidential proclamation ordering the US flag to be flown at half-staff until sunset on the day of Reagan's interment.\nHer funeral was held on March 11 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\nRepresentatives from ten first families attended, including former president George W. Bush, then-first lady Michelle Obama, former first ladies Laura Bush and Rosalynn Carter, and then-2016 presidential candidate former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton, herself a former first lady. Presidential children Steven Ford, Tricia Nixon Cox, Luci Baines Johnson, and Caroline Kennedy were also in attendance, as was presidential grandchild Anne Eisenhower Flottl.\nOther attendees included California governor Jerry Brown, former governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Pete Wilson, former House speakers Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich, and former members of the Reagan administration, including George P. Shultz and Edwin Meese. There were also many attendees from the Hollywood entertainment industry, including Mr. T, Maria Shriver (Schwarzenegger's then-wife), Wayne Newton, Johnny Mathis, Anjelica Huston, John Stamos, Tom Selleck, Bo Derek, and Melissa Rivers. In all there were some 1,000 guests.\nEulogies were given by former prime minister of Canada Brian Mulroney, former secretary of state James Baker, Diane Sawyer, Tom Brokaw, and Reagan's children Patti Davis and Ron Reagan. After the funeral, Reagan was interred next to her husband.\nHistorical assessments.\nSince 1982, Siena College Research Institute has conducted occasional surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In terms of cumulative assessment Reagan has been ranked:\nIn the 1993 Sienna Research Institute survey, the first conducted after Reagan left the White House, Reagan was assessed very poorly by historians, ranking the second-worst, with only Mary Todd Lincoln being given a worse assessment. Reagan was ranked the lowest in half of the criteria (background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, and integrity). Regard for Reagan improved in the following three iterations of the survey. In the three most recent iterations of the survey (conducted in 2008, 2014, and 2020), Reagan has been ranked as the 15th-best First Lady. In the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Reagan was ranked the 4th-highest in value to the president, but was ranked the lowest in integrity. In the 2003 survey, Reagan ranked the 5th-highest in value to the president. In the 2014 survey, Reagan and her husband were ranked the 16th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a \"power couple\". In the 2014 survey, historians ranked Reagan among 20th and 21st century American first ladies as being the 5th greatest in terms of being a \"political asset\" and 5th greatest in terms of being a strong public communicator.\nReagan and her husband have each posthumously experienced continued criticism for having, during their time in the White House, spent years publicly ignoring the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which began during her husband's presidency. The epidemic had initially predominantly impacted the male homosexual community. Reagan's great extended public silence on this matter has been contrasted with her coinciding vocalness against drug use. Reagan's extended failure to give significant public acknowledgement of this epidemic has been seen as one of the greatest detractions in her retrospective public regard. However, there has been reporting to suggest that, privately, Reagan did unsuccessfully urge her husband's administration to address the epidemic.\nAwards and honors.\nAs noted earlier, Nancy Reagan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002 and the Congressional Gold Medal, in the same year.\nIn 1989, she received the Council of Fashion Designers of America's lifetime achievement award.\nAs First Lady, Nancy Reagan received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree from Pepperdine University in 1983.\nLater, she received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Eureka College in Illinois, her husband's alma mater, in 2009.\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs Nancy Davis, she also made a number of television appearances from 1953 to 1962, as a guest star in dramatic shows or installments of anthology series. These included \"Ford Television Theatre\" (her first appearance with Ronald Reagan came during a 1953 episode titled \"First Born\"), \"Schlitz Playhouse of Stars\", \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre\" (appearing with Ronald Reagan in the 1961 episode \"The Long Shadow\"), \"Wagon Train\", \"The Tall Man\", and \"General Electric Theater\" (hosted by Ronald Reagan).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21182", "revid": "18130370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21182", "title": "New Brunswick", "text": "Province of Canada\nNew Brunswick is a province of Canada, bordering Quebec to the north, Nova Scotia to the east, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the northeast, the Bay of Fundy to the southeast, and the U.S. state of Maine to the west. It is part of Eastern Canada and is one of the three Maritime provinces and one of the four Atlantic provinces. The province is about 83% forested and its northern half is occupied by the Appalachians. The province's climate is continental with snowy winters and temperate summers. The province has a surface area of and 775,610 inhabitants (2021 census).\nApproximately half of the population lives in urban areas, predominantly in Moncton, Saint John and Fredericton. In 1969, New Brunswick passed the Official Languages Act which began recognizing French as an official language, along with English. New Brunswickers have the right to receive provincial government services in the official language of their choice. About two thirds of the population are English speaking and one third is French speaking. New Brunswick is home to most of the cultural region of Acadia and most Acadians. New Brunswick's variety of French is called Acadian French. There are seven regional accents.\nThe territory of New Brunswick overlaps the homelands of three First Nations: the Mi\u2019kmaq, Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet), and Passamaquoddy. The eastern coast is part of Mi'kma'ki, while Wolastoqiyik and Passamaquoddy territories cover the west. In 1604, Acadia, the first New France colony, was founded with the creation of Port-Royal in southwest Nova Scotia. For a century and half afterwards, Acadia changed hands multiple times due to numerous conflicts between France and the United Kingdom. From 1755 to 1764, the British deported Acadians en masse, an event known as the Great Upheaval. This, along with the Treaty of Paris, solidified Acadia as British property. In 1784, following the arrival of many loyalists fleeing the American Revolution, the colony of New Brunswick was officially created, separating it from what is now Nova Scotia. The following year came the incorporation Saint John, the first city in what would become Canada. In the early 1800s, New Brunswick prospered and the population grew rapidly. In 1867, New Brunswick decided to join with Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (now Quebec and Ontario) to form Canada. After Confederation, shipbuilding and lumbering declined, and protectionism disrupted trade with New England. From the mid-1900s onwards, New Brunswick was one of the poorest regions of Canada, a fact eventually mitigated by transfer payments. However, the province has seen the highest eastward migration in 45 years in both rural and urban areas, as people from Ontario and other parts of Canada migrate to the area.\nAs of 2002,[ [update]] the provincial GDP was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%. A powerful corporate concentration of large companies in New Brunswick is owned by the Irving Group of Companies. The province's 2019 output was CA$38.236 billion, which is 1.65% of Canada's GDP. Tourism accounts for 9% of the labour force either directly or indirectly. Popular destinations include the Hopewell Rocks, Fundy National Park, Magnetic Hill, Kouchibouguac National Park and Roosevelt Campobello International Park.\nEtymology.\nNew Brunswick was named in 1784 in honour of George III, King of Great Britain, King of Ireland, and prince-elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (until 1806) in what is now Germany. Upon its split from Nova Scotia, it was initially named New Ireland in April 1784; however the name of the province was changed to New Brunswick when it was officially brought into existence by an Order in Council in June 1784. The original Brunswick is known as Braunschweig, but also Brunswiek (in Low German), and also Bronswiek (in the local dialect).\nHistory.\nIndigenous societies.\nPaleo-Indians are believed to have been the first humans on the land of New Brunswick, settling there roughly 10,000 years ago. Because their descendants did not leave a written record, there is a lack of knowledge of the history of the area before the arrival of European explorers. New Brunswick's land base has historically formed integral parts of the homelands of three First Nations:the Mi\u2019kmaq, Wolastoqiyik, and Passamaquoddy of Wabanakia. Much of the eastern coast falls within the Mi'kmaw district of Siknikt (Signigtewa'gi) in their country of Mi'kma'ki; the western half of the province is covered by the Wolastoqiyik homeland: Wolastokuk, named for the Wolastoq or Saint John River; and Peskotomuhkatik, the Passamaquoddy country, surrounds the bay named for the nation. Many placenames in the province originate from their Eastern Algonquian languages, such as Aroostook, Bouctouche, Memramcook, Petitcodiac, Richibucto and Shediac.\nAcadia and Nova Scotia (1604\u20131784).\nThe first documented European exploration of New Brunswick was made by Jacques Cartier in 1534, when his party set foot in Miscou and explored the coasts of Chaleur Bay. They made contact with aboriginals, who from this point on began to trade with Europeans. This also exposed them to Old World diseases. Acadia, a colonial division of New France covering the Maritimes, was founded in 1604 by Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua de Mons with a settlement on Saint Croix Island. It was quickly abandoned due to difficult living conditions and moved to Acadia's capital, Port-Royal. There, the Mi'kmaq helped the French survive. In 1626, Port-Royal was destroyed by the British. The British conquered Acadia shortly after and held it until 1629. James VI and I, King of Scotland, renamed it \"Nova Scotia\" in English.\nThe Mi'kmaq helped all French survivors, including Charles de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour. Together, they established a fur trade network along the Saint John River. With the onset of the Anglo-French War (1627\u20131629), de la Tour was issued a charter to govern Acadia. In 1629, Acadia was officially returned to France. As such, a new wave of French settlers arrived in Port-Royal to revitalise the colony, including Isaac de Razilly, a new governor of Acadia, and Charles de Menou d'Aulnay, his cousin. de Razilly and de la Tour's charters conflicted with each others', but the two maintained an amicable relationship. In 1635, de Razilly died, triggering tensions between de la Tour, who governed from the Saint John valley, and d'Aulnay, who governed from Port-Royal. In the 1630s, this erupted into the Acadian Civil War. d'Aulnay managed to expel de la Tour in 1644. But, following d'Aulnay's death in 1650, de la Tour married his widow in 1653, essentially overturning his success.\nOver time, French settlement extended up the river to the site of present-day Fredericton. Other settlements in the southeast extended from Beaubassin, near the present-day border with Nova Scotia, to Baie Verte, and up the Petitcodiac, Memramcook, and Shepody Rivers. The descendants of Acadia's French colonists became the Acadians. Acadians developed a unique society characterised by dyking technology, which allowed them to cultivate marshes left by the Bay of Fundy's tides, and by tightly knit independent communities, because they were often neglected by French authorities.\nDuring the 1690s, in King William's War, attacks were launched from the Saint John valley by Acadian militias onto New England colonists. This would create a deep English hostility against the French presence in the region.\nFrom the 1600s to mid-1700s, Acadia was routinely a war zone between the French and the English and would often change hands. However, Acadia would definitively fall into British hands following Queen Anne's War, a conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula, formalized by the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. After the war, Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) and \u00cele-Royale (Cape Breton Island), with the ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) being disputed between France and Britain, with an informal border on the Isthmus of Chignecto. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built Fort Beaus\u00e9jour at the isthmus in 1751. \nFrom 1749 to 1755, Father Le Loutre's War took place, where British soldiers fought against Acadians and Mi'kmaq to consolidate their power over Acadia/Nova Scotia. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour, severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Continental Acadia thus came to be incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Following this, the British, unsatisfied with the Acadians' surrender because they refused to pledge allegiance, turned to capturing and exporting Acadians en masse, an ethnic cleansing event known as the Deportation of the Acadians which was ordered by Robert Monckton. From 1755 to 1763, 12,000 Acadians out of 18,000 were forcefully deported to various locations around the world, though 8000 died before arrival. The remaining 6000 Acadians escaped the British by fleeing North to the present \"Acadia\", or to Canada. From 1755 to 1757, most Acadians were deported to the Thirteen Colonies. From 1758 to 1762, most were sent to France. Between 1763 and 1785, many deported Acadians relocated to join their compatriots in Louisiana. Their descendants became Cajuns. In the 1780s and 1790s, some Acadians returned to Acadia, and discovered several thousand English immigrants, mostly from New England, on their former lands.\nIn the late 1700s, the British began to make efforts to colonise the region, mostly by importing colonists from New England. Before the American Revolution, these colonists were called planters. After the revolution, the colonists were called loyalists, because only those loyal to the British crown settled in Nova Scotia. In 1766, planters from Pennsylvania founded The Bend of the Petitcodiac, or simply The Bend, which later became Moncton in 1855, and English settlers from Yorkshire arrived in the Sackville area. In the 1770s, 10,000 loyalists settled along the north shore of the Bay of Fundy. In 1783, both Saint Andrews and Saint John were founded.\nBritish colony of New Brunswick (1784\u20131867).\n Loyalists who received land allocations around the St. John River valley, the Bay of Fundy or the Northumberland Strait became dissatisfied with being governed from Halifax because it was so far away. Therefore, on 18 June 1784, the British government created a new province for them: New Brunswick. New Brunswick was formed from the partition of Sunbury County from the remainder of Nova Scotia. In that same year, New Brunswick formed its first elected assembly. The first governor was Thomas Carleton, and, in 1785, he chose the hamlet of Sainte-Anne as the provincial capital. Sainte-Anne was later renamed Frederick's Town (and then later Fredericton) after the second son of George III.\nIn total, it is believed that around 14,000 loyalist refugees came to New Brunswick. However, 10% eventually returned to the United States. In 1785, Saint John became New Brunswick's first incorporated city.\nEconomically, New Brunswick was a poor environment for agriculture and mining. Its fishery was also far inferior to that of Nova Scotia's. New Brunswick's forests were rich in wood, but as wood is a bulky and low-value commodity, accessible markets were limited. Essentially, in the late 1700s, New Brunswick was a peripheral corner of the British Empire and North American world. Geopolitical events in Europe would change this situation. In 1806, Napoleon Bonaparte's continental blockade forced the United Kingdom, which usually relied on the Baltic Sea for supplies, to import timber from its North American colonies. This stimulated the lumber trade in New Brunswick, as well as in Lower Canada.\nBetween 1805 and 1812, New Brunswick annually exported 100,000 tons of squared timber. In 1819, the number exceeded 240,000 tons, and in 1825 exports reached their highest level at 417,000 tons. This also resulted in the emergence of a shipbuilding market. These industries were then bolstered by the Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, and demand from the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865. St. Martins became the third most productive shipbuilding town in the Maritimes and produced over 500 vessels.\nFrom 1800 to 1851, New Brunswick's population grew from 25,000 to 200,000, and it saw large-scale immigration from Ireland and Scotland. In 1848, responsible home government was granted. The 1850s saw the emergence of political parties largely organized along religious and ethnic lines.\nFrom the late 1700s to mid 1800s, Acadians became a minority, and they lived largely on the fringes of society, fearful of the English. They were mostly illiterate due to laws preventing them from opening schools. They were also not part of the economic boom, and had troubles asserting their land rights.\nDuring the 1860s, the notion of unifying the maritime colonies of British North America was being increasingly discussed. This was due to multiple factors. For example, some felt that the American Civil War was the result of a weak central government and wished to avoid the same fate. Some also wanted to increase trade between the colonies, and be less economically tied to the US. In 1864, the Charlottetown Conference was held to discuss a possible Maritime Union between Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. However, the Province of Canada, caught wind of the conference and decided to send representatives to attend. They asked that the agenda be expanded to discuss a union that would also include them.\nIn 1866, the United States cancelled the Reciprocity Treaty, leading to a loss of trade and a stronger desire to build up trade within British North America. A Fenian raid in 1866 also increased public support for a potential union.\nCanadian province (1867\u2013present).\nOn 1 July 1867, New Brunswick joined with Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec) to create the Dominion of Canada.\nThough Confederation brought into existence the Intercolonial Railway in 1872, new barriers undermined traditional trade relations. In 1879, John A. Macdonald's Conservatives enacted the National Policy, which called for high tariffs and opposed free trade, disrupting the trading relationship between the Maritimes and New England. The economic situation was worsened by the Great Fire of Saint John of 1877, the decline of the shipbuilding industry, and the US Panic of 1893. Many experienced workers lost their jobs and had to move west or to the United States.\nIn 1871, the government introduced free education, banning catechism, the cassock and French in public schools in the process. Though contested by the Acadians and the Irish, the law was deemed constitutional. Following a riot in Caraquet in 1875, and political pressure, the bans were lifted in 1877.\nThe Irving Group of Companies, founded by the Irving family, officially began in 1881 in Bouctouche when James Irving bought a sawmill. Afterwards, the family continued to acquire businesses and substantial wealth, eventually becoming the richest family in the province. Today, Irving is considered by many to exert a monopoly over New Brunswick.\nTowards the early 20th century, the economy began to improve somewhat. The railways and tariffs fostered the growth of new industries in the province such as textile manufacturing, iron mills, pulp and paper mills, and sugar refineries. However, many of these eventually failed to compete with their competition in Central Canada. Unemployement was high for a long time and increased during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nBy the end of the Great Depression, the New Brunswick standard of living was much lower than the Canadian average. In 1937, New Brunswick had the highest infant mortality and illiteracy rates in Canada. In 1940, the Rowell\u2013Sirois Commission reported grave flaws in the Canadian constitution. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had many expenditure responsibilities such as healthcare, education, and welfare, which were becoming increasingly expensive. The Commission recommended the creation of equalization payments, which were eventually implemented in 1957.\nAfter Canada joined World War II, 14 NB army units were organized, in addition to The Royal New Brunswick Regiment, and first deployed in the Italian campaign in 1943. After the Normandy landings they redeployed to northwestern Europe, along with The North Shore Regiment. The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, a training program for ally pilots, established bases in Moncton, Chatham, and Pennfield Ridge, as well as a military typing school in Saint John. While relatively unindustrialized before the war, New Brunswick became home to 34 plants on military contracts from which the province received over $78\u00a0million. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had promised no conscription, asked the provinces if they would release the government of said promise. New Brunswick voted 69.1% yes. The policy was not implemented until 1944, too late for many of the conscripts to be deployed. There were 1808 NB fatalities among the armed forces.\nThe Acadians in northern New Brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous English speakers to the south. The population of French origin grew dramatically after Confederation, from about 16 per cent in 1871 to 34 per cent in 1931. Government services were often not available in French, and the infrastructure in Francophone areas was less developed than elsewhere. In 1960 Premier Louis Robichaud embarked on the New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program, in which education, rural road maintenance, and healthcare fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province, rather than the former county-based system. In 1969 the Robichaud government adopted the Official Languages Act making the province officially bilingual and establishing the right of New Brunswickers to obtain provincial government services in the official language of their choice. In 1982 at the request of the government of Richard Hatfield, this right became part of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" and therefore part of the Constitution of Canada.\nThe flag of New Brunswick, based on the coat of arms, was adopted in 1965. The conventional heraldic representations of a lion and a ship represent colonial ties with Europe, and the importance of shipping at the time the coat of arms was assigned.\nIn 2005, the Court of Queen's Bench approved a ruling allowing for the legalization of same-sex marriage. At the beginning of 2023, the provincial government implemented a local governance reform, reducing the number of entities from 340 to 89.\nGeography.\nRoughly square, New Brunswick is bordered on the north by Quebec, on the east by the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the south by the Bay of Fundy, and on the west by the US state of Maine. The southeast corner of the province is connected to Nova Scotia at the isthmus of Chignecto.\nGlaciation has left much of New Brunswick's uplands with only shallow, acidic soils which have discouraged settlement but which are home to enormous forests.\nClimate.\nNew Brunswick's climate is more severe than that of the other Maritime provinces, which are lower and have more shoreline along the moderating sea. New Brunswick has a humid continental climate, with slightly milder winters on the Gulf of St. Lawrence coastline. Elevated parts of the far north of the province have a subarctic climate.\nEvidence of climate change in New Brunswick can be seen in its more intense precipitation events, more frequent winter thaws, and one quarter to half the amount of snowpack. Today, the sea level is about higher than it was 100 years ago, and it is expected to rise twice that much again by the year 2100.\nFlora and fauna.\nMost of New Brunswick is forested with secondary forest or tertiary forest. At the start of European settlement, the Maritimes were covered from coast to coast by a forest of mature trees, giants by today's standards. Today less than one per cent of old-growth Acadian forest remains, and the World Wide Fund for Nature lists the Acadian Forest as endangered. Following the frequent large scale disturbances caused by settlement and timber harvesting, the Acadian forest is not growing back as it was, but is subject to borealization. This means that exposure-resistant species that are well adapted to the frequent large-scale disturbances common in the boreal forest are increasingly abundant. These include jack pine, balsam fir, black spruce, white birch, and poplar. Forest ecosystems support large carnivores such as the bobcat, Canada lynx, and black bear, and the large herbivores moose and white-tailed deer.\nFiddlehead greens are harvested from the Ostrich fern which grows on riverbanks. Furbish's lousewort, a perennial herb endemic to the shores of the upper Saint John River, is an endangered species threatened by habitat destruction, riverside development, forestry, littering and recreational use of the riverbank. Many wetlands are being disrupted by the highly invasive Introduced species purple loosestrife.\nThe deer population in the province has dropped by 70% since 1985. The widespread use of glyphosate may have contributed to this.\nSince 2014, the New Brunswick government has allowed forestry companies to harvest 20 percent more wood there than before.\nGeology.\nBedrock types range from 1\u00a0billion to 200\u00a0million years old.\nMuch of the bedrock in the west and north derives from ocean deposits in the Ordovician that were subject to folding and igneous intrusion and that were eventually covered with lava during the Paleozoic, peaking during the Acadian orogeny.\nDuring the Carboniferous period, about 340\u00a0million years ago, New Brunswick was in the Maritimes Basin, a sedimentary basin near the equator. Sediments, brought by rivers from surrounding highlands, accumulated there; after being compressed, they produced the Albert oil shales of southern New Brunswick. Eventually, sea water from the Panthalassic Ocean invaded the basin, forming the Windsor Sea. Once this receded, conglomerates, sandstones, and shales accumulated. The rust colour of these was caused by the oxidation of iron in the beds between wet and dry periods. Such late Carboniferous rock formed the Hopewell Rocks, which have been shaped by the extreme tidal range of the Bay of Fundy.\nIn the early Triassic, as Pangea drifted north it was rent apart, forming the rift valley that is the Bay of Fundy. Magma pushed up through the cracks, forming basalt columns on Grand Manan.\nTopography.\nNew Brunswick lies entirely within the Appalachian Mountain range. The rivers of New Brunswick drain into either the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the east or the Bay of Fundy to the south. These watersheds include lands in Quebec and Maine. The highest point in New Brunswick is Mount Carleton, .\nNew Brunswick and the rest of the Maritime Peninsula was covered by thick layers of ice during the last glacial period (the Wisconsinian glaciation). It cut U-shaped valleys in the Saint John and Nepisiguit River valleys and pushed granite boulders from the Miramichi highlands south and east, leaving them as erratics when the ice receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation, along with deposits such as the eskers between Woodstock and St George, which are today sources of sand and gravel.\nDemographics.\nAt the 2021 Canadian census, New Brunswick had a population of 775,610, a 3.8% increase since the 2016 Canadian census. As one of the four Atlantic Provinces which are Canada's least populated provinces, New Brunswick is the third-least populous province. The census also recorded New Brunswick as being the fourth-most densely populated Canadian province, with 10.9 people per square kilometre, behind Ontario, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. As of September 2025, the population is estimated to be 869,682.\nThe Atlantic provinces also have higher rural populations. New Brunswick was largely rural until 1951; since then, the rural-urban split has been roughly even. Population density in the Maritimes is above average among Canadian provinces; this reflects their small size and the fact that they do not possess large, unpopulated hinterlands like the other seven provinces and three territories.\nNew Brunswick's 107 municipalities cover of the province's land mass but are home to of its population. The three major urban areas are in the south of the province and are Greater Moncton, population 157,717, Greater Saint John, population 130,613, and Greater Fredericton, population 108,610.\nEthnicity.\nIn the 2001 census, the most commonly reported ethnicities were British 40%, French Canadian and Acadian 31%, Irish 18%, other European 7%, First Nations 3%, Asian Canadian 2%. Each person could choose more than one ethnicity.\nLanguage.\nAs of the 2021 Canadian Census, the most spoken languages in the province included English (698,025 or 91.94%), French (317,825 or 41.86%), Spanish (7,580 or 1%), Arabic (6,090 or 0.8%), Tagalog (4,225 or 0.56%), and Hindi (3,745 or 0.49%). The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses.\nAccording to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Canadian Constitution, both English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick, making it the only officially bilingual province. Government and public services are available in both English and French.\nFor education, English-language and French-language systems serve the two linguistic communities at all levels. Anglophone New Brunswickers make up roughly two-thirds of the population, while about one-third are Francophone. Recently there has been growth in the numbers of people reporting themselves as bilingual, with 34% reporting that they speak both English and French. This reflects a trend across Canada.\nReligion.\nAccording to the 2021 census, religious groups in New Brunswick included:\nIn the 2011 census, 84% of provincial residents reported themselves as Christian: 52% were Roman Catholic, 8% Baptist, 8% United Church of Canada, 7% Anglican and 9% other Christian. 15% percent of residents reported no religion.\nEconomy.\nAs of October 2017, seasonally adjusted employment is 73,400 for the goods-producing sector and 280,900 for the services-producing sector. Those in the goods-producing industries are mostly employed in manufacturing or construction, while those in services work in social assistance, trades, and health care. A large portion of the economy is controlled by the Irving Group of Companies, which consists of the holdings of the family of K. C. Irving. The companies have significant holdings in agriculture, forestry, food processing, freight transport (including railways and trucking), media, oil, and shipbuilding.\nThe influence of the Irving family on New Brunswick is such that the province is sometimes described as being subject to a form of economic feudalism. In 2016, the 200 or so companies it controls gave it about $10 billion in capital. The group's activities are supported by the authorities through numerous tax exemptions and the payment of subsidies, notably through the Renewable Energy Purchase Program for Large Industry. The province has also progressively handed over the management of the public sector forestry assets to the Irving Group, regularly lowering standards. In 2014, the latter reduced the size of buffer zones between forests and human settlements, allowed more clear-cutting, increased the planned production volume and reduced the proportion of protected areas from 31% to 22%.\nThrough Acadia Broadcasting the family owns several local radio stations. The family owned all the province's English-language newspapers through Brunswick News until its sale to Postmedia in 2022. For academic Alain Deneault, \"the conflicts of interest that arise from this situation seem caricatural: the group's media essentially echo the positions of the Irving family in all the fields of social and industrial life in which it is involved.\" The information transmitted by the group and disseminated by the press is sometimes questioned (notably in the fall of 2018, during an explosion at the Saint John refinery), but few public officials, professors and members of parliament carry denunciations, as the family's financial contributions to universities and political parties provide it with leverage.\nThe United States is the province's largest export market, accounting for 92% of foreign trade valued in 2014 at almost $13\u00a0billion, with refined petroleum making up 63% of that, followed by seafood products, pulp, paper and sawmill products and non-metallic minerals (chiefly potash). The value of exports, mostly to the United States, was $1.6\u00a0billion in 2016. About half of that came from lobster. Other products include salmon, crab, and herring. In 2015, spending on non-resident tourism in New Brunswick was $441\u00a0million, which provided $87\u00a0million in tax revenue.\nBiologists, academics and Eilish Cleary, the province's former head of public health, have reported being subjected to intense pressure (including dismissal in Cleary's case) while analyzing the impact of the company's pesticides and its opaque forest management. Since the 1970s, every premier in the province has been elected with the support of Irving. Blaine Higgs, premier from 2018 to 2024, is a former executive of the group. According to journalist Michel Cormier: \"We might be able to win an election without Irving's tacit support, but we could hardly aspire to power if he decided to openly oppose it.\"\nPrimary sector.\nA large number of residents from New Brunswick are employed in the primary sector of industry. More than 13,000 New Brunswickers work in agriculture, shipping products worth over $1\u00a0billion, half of which is from crops, and half of that from potatoes, mostly in the Saint John River valley. McCain Foods is one of the world's largest manufacturers of frozen potato products. Other products include apples, cranberries, and maple syrup. New Brunswick was in 2015 the biggest producer of wild blueberries in Canada. The value of the livestock sector is about a quarter of a billion dollars, nearly half of which is dairy. Other sectors include poultry, fur, and goats, sheep, and pigs.\nAbout 85 to 90% of New Brunswick is forested. Historically important, it accounted for more than 80% of exports in the mid-1800s. By the end of the 1800s the industry, and shipbuilding, were declining due to external economic factors. The 1920s saw the development of a pulp and paper industry. In the mid-1960s, forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests. The industry employs nearly 12,000, generating revenues around $437\u00a0million.\nMining was historically unimportant in the province, but has grown since the 1950s. The province's GDP from the Mining and Quarrying industry in 2015 was $299.5\u00a0million. Mines in New Brunswick produce lead, zinc, copper, and potash.\nForest management in the province is particularly opaque. Donald Bowser, an international expert on political corruption, says he is \"shocked to discover that there is less transparency in New Brunswick than in Kurdistan, Guatemala or Sierra Leone, despite the huge public funds committed to natural resource development.\"\nEducation.\nPublic education elementary and secondary education in the province is administered by the provincial Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. New Brunswick has a parallel system of Anglophone and Francophone public schools. In the anglophone system, approximately 27 per cent of the students are enrolled in a French immersion programs.\nThe province also operates five public post-secondary institutions, including four public universities and one college. Four public universities operate campuses in New Brunswick, including the oldest English-language university in the country, the University of New Brunswick. Other English-language public universities include Mount Allison University and St. Thomas University. Universit\u00e9 de Moncton is the province's only French-language university. All four universities offer undergraduate, and postgraduate education. Additionally, the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton and the University of New Brunswick also provide professional programs.\nPublic colleges in the province are managed as a part of the New Brunswick Community College (NBCC) system, except for the New Brunswick College of Craft &amp; Design, which has operated through the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour since 1938. In addition to public institutions, the province is also home to several private vocational schools, such as the Moncton Flight College; and universities, the largest being Crandall University.\nGovernment and politics.\nGovernment.\nUnder Canadian federalism, power is divided between federal and provincial governments. Among areas under federal jurisdiction are citizenship, foreign affairs, national defence, fisheries, criminal law, Indigenous policies, and many others. Provincial jurisdiction covers public lands, health, education, and local government, among other things. Jurisdiction is shared for immigration, pensions, agriculture, and welfare.\nThe parliamentary system of government is modelled on the British Westminster system. Forty-nine representatives, nearly always members of political parties, are elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. The head of government is the Premier of New Brunswick, normally the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the legislative assembly. Governance is handled by the executive council (cabinet), with about 32 ministries. Ceremonial duties of the Monarchy in New Brunswick are mostly carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick.\nUnder amendments to the province's Legislative Assembly Act in 2007, a provincial election is held every four years. The two largest political parties are the New Brunswick Liberal Association and the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick. Since the 2018 election, minor parties are the Green Party of New Brunswick and the People's Alliance of New Brunswick.\nJudiciary.\nThe Court of Appeal of New Brunswick is the highest provincial court. It hears appeals from:\nThe system consists of eight Judicial Districts, loosely based on the counties. The Chief Justice of New Brunswick serves at the apex of this court structure.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe province has fifteen counties, which served as upper-tier municipalities until the municipal reforms of 1966. While county governments have been abolished in New Brunswick, counties continue to be used as census divisions by Statistics Canada, and as an organizational unit, along with parishes, for registration of real-estate and its taxation. Counties continue to figure into the sense of identity of many New Brunwickers. Counties are further subdivided into 152 parishes, which also lost their political significance in 1966 but are still used as census subdivisions by Statistics Canada.\nNinety-two per cent of the land in the province, inhabited by about 35% of the population, is under provincial administration and has no local, elected representation. The 51% of the province that is Crown land is administered by the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development.\nMost of the province is administrated as a local service district (LSD), an unincorporated unit of local governance. As of 2017, there are 237 LSDs. Services, paid for by property taxes, include a variety of services such as fire protection, solid waste management, street lighting, and dog regulation. LSDs may elect advisory committees and work with the Department of Local Government to recommend how to spend locally collected taxes.\nIn 2006 there were three rural communities. This is a relatively new type of entity; to be created, it requires a population of 3,000 and a tax base of $200\u00a0million. In 2006 there were 101 municipalities.\nRegional Service Commissions, which number 12, were introduced in 2013 to regulate regional planning and solid waste disposal, and provide a forum for discussion on a regional level of police and emergency services, climate change adaptation planning, and regional sport, recreational and cultural facilities. The commissions' administrative councils are populated by the mayors of each municipality or rural community within a region.\nProvincial finances.\nIn 2015, New Brunswick had the most poorly-performing economy of any Canadian province, with a per capita income of $28,000. The government has historically run at a large deficit. With about half of the population being rural, it is expensive for the government to provide education and health services, which account for 60 per cent of government expenditure. Thirty-six per cent of the provincial budget is covered by federal cash transfers.\nThe government has frequently attempted to create employment through subsidies, which has often failed to generate long-term economic prosperity and has resulted in bad debt, examples of which include Bricklin, Atcon, and the Marriott call centre in Fredericton.\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, the large public debt is a very serious problem. Government revenues are shrinking because of a decline in federal transfer payments. Though expenditures are down (through government pension reform and a reduction in the number of public employees), they have increased relative to GDP, necessitating further measures to reduce debt in the future.\nIn the 2014\u201315 fiscal year, provincial debt reached $12.2\u00a0billion or 37.7 per cent of nominal GDP, an increase over the $10.1\u00a0billion recorded in 2011\u201312. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to 36.7% in 2019\u201320.\nPolitics.\nSince the mid-20th century, New Brunswick has seen itself sway between being governed under either the Progressive Conservative Party or the Liberal Association, with both having seen several terms in power. Since this time period, New Brunswick had also generally elected Premiers who were generally younger, with most Premiers being elected in their thirties; this trend changed significantly following the 2018 provincial election, which saw Blaine Higgs take provincial office at age 64, the oldest in the province's history.\nInfrastructure.\nEnergy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPublicly owned NB Power operates 13 of New Brunswick's generating stations, deriving power from fuel oil and diesel (1497 MW), hydro (889 MW), nuclear (660 MW), and coal (467 MW). There were 30 active natural gas production sites in 2012.\nHealth care.\nNew Brunswickers are entitled to the universal and government-funded healthcare operated by the Department of Health. They can use their Medicare card to get this care or receive care in another province. New Brunswick is divided into 2 health care regions: Vitalit\u00e9 Health Network and Horizon Health Network. There also exists 2 confidential health information lines: 911 (for emergencies) and 811 (for non-urgent health questions).\nFinding a family doctor is important for all New Brunswickers, but it has become difficult over the last decade. Patient Connect NB is a provincially managed, bilingual patient registry that matches New Brunswickers with a family doctor or nurse practitioner on a first-come, first-serve basis. As of 2022, this registry lists at 74,000 people waiting to be matched.\nHealth care services not covered by the government include: dentists, optometrists, retirement homes, mental health services, private clinics, and health insurance.\nTransportation.\nThe Department of Transportation and Infrastructure maintains government facilities and the province's highway network and ferries. The Trans-Canada Highway is not under federal jurisdiction, and traverses the province from Edmundston following the Saint John River Valley, through Fredericton, Moncton, and on to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.\nRegional public transportation.\nThe provincial government operates public transportation by ferry. Four cities in New Brunswick operate urban public transportation services: Fredericton Transit (Fredericton), Codiac Transpo (Moncton), Saint John Transit (Saint John), and Miramichi Transit (Miramichi). Parts of the province are also served by Maritime Bus, a coach operator.\nFerry.\nMultiple areas along the Saint John River contain ferries operated by the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, with routes connecting Greater Saint John to the Kingston Peninsula, as well as some routes connecting mainland New Brunswick to various islands. The province is also serviced by Coastal Transport Limited, a ferry service which operates three ferries in the province, including a route between Blacks Harbour and Grand Manan Island. Bay Ferries operates the MV \"Fundy Rose\", connecting Saint John to Digby, Nova Scotia.\nRail.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVia Rail's Ocean service, which connects Montreal to Halifax, is currently the oldest continuously operated passenger route in North America, with stops from west to east at Campbellton, Charlo, Jacquet River, Petit Rocher, Bathurst, Miramichi, Rogersville, Moncton, and Sackville.\nCanadian National Railway operates freight services along the same route, as well as a subdivision from Moncton to Saint John. The New Brunswick Southern Railway, a division of J. D. Irving Limited, together with its sister company Eastern Maine Railway form a continuous main line connecting Saint John and Brownville Junction, Maine.\nCities, towns, villages, counties and parishes.\nThere are 8 cities, 30 towns, and 21 villages in New Brunswick, grouped into 15 counties and 152 parishes. The fifteen counties, alphabetically, are Albert, Carleton, Charlotte, Gloucester, Kent, Kings, Madawaska, Northumberland, Queens, Restigouche, Saint John, Sunbury, Victoria, Westmorland, and York.\nNew Brunswick's provincial capital is Fredericton. The population of the city is 63,116 as of 2021. The largest city by population is Moncton with 79,400 residents, and the largest in land area is Saint John at . New Brunswick's other cities are Dieppe, Miramichi, Edmundston, Bathurst, and Campbellton.\nCulture.\nHistoric places and museums.\nThere are about 61 historic places in New Brunswick, including Fort Beaus\u00e9jour, Kings Landing Historical Settlement and the Village Historique Acadien. Established in 1842, the New Brunswick Museum in Saint John was designated as the provincial museum of New Brunswick. The province is also home to a number of other museums in addition to the provincial museum.\nMusic and theatre.\nThe music of New Brunswick includes artists such as Henry Burr, Roch Voisine, Lenny Breau, and \u00c9dith Butler. Symphony New Brunswick, based in Saint John, tours extensively in the province. Symphony New Brunswick and the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada tours nationally and internationally.\nTheatre New Brunswick tours plays around the province. Canadian playwright Norm Foster saw his early works premiere with Theatre New Brunswick. Other theatres of the province include the Th\u00e9atre populaire d'Acadie in Caraquet, the Live Bait Theatre in Sackville, the Imperial in Saint John, the Capitol theatre in Moncton, and the Playhouse theatre in Fredericton.\nVisual arts.\nNew Brunswick is home to many galleries across the province, including the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, which was designated as New Brunswick's provincial art gallery in 1994, and the Galerie d\u2019art Louise-et-Reuben-Cohen at the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton. New Brunswick also has four artist-run-centres: Connexion ARC located in Fredericton, Galerie Sans Nom in Moncton, Struts Gallery in Sackville, and Third Space Gallery in Saint John, as well as one artist-run printshop, Atelier d'estampe Imago Inc., located in Moncton.\nMount Allison University is known for its art program, which was created in 1854. The program came into its own under John A. Hammond, from 1893 to 1916. Notable graduates include Alex Colville, Christopher Pratt, Mary Pratt, and Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gilde Chiasson. The university also opened an art gallery in 1895 and is named for its patron, John Owens of Saint John. The Owens Art Gallery at Mount Allison University is presently the oldest university-operated art gallery in Canada.\nModern New Brunswick artists include landscape painter Jack Humphrey, sculptor Claude Roussel, and Miller Brittain.\nLiterature.\nJulia Catherine Beckwith, born in Fredericton, was Canada's first published novelist. Poet Bliss Carman and his cousin Charles G. D. Roberts were some of the first Canadians to achieve international fame for letters. Antonine Maillet was the first non-European winner of France's Prix Goncourt. Other modern writers include Alfred Bailey, Alden Nowlan, John Thompson, Douglas Lochhead, K. V. Johansen, David Adams Richards, and France Daigle. A recent New Brunswick Lieutenant-Governor, Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gilde Chiasson, is a poet and playwright. \"The Fiddlehead\", established in 1945 at University of New Brunswick, is Canada's oldest literary magazine.\nMedia.\nNew Brunswick has four daily newspapers, three English and one French: the \"Telegraph-Journal\" in Saint John and distributed province-wide, the \"Times &amp; Transcript\" in Moncton, \"The Daily Gleaner\" in Fredericton and \"L'Acadie Nouvelle\" in Caraquet. The three English-language dailies and multiple other weeklies are operated by Brunswick News, which was previously privately owned by J.D. Irving until being sold to Postmedia Network in 2022.\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has anglophone television and radio operations in Fredericton. T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada is based in Moncton. CTV and Global also operate stations in New Brunswick, which operate largely as sub-feeds of their stations in Halifax as part of regional networks.\nThere are 34 radio stations licensed in New Brunswick, broadcasting in English or French.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21184", "revid": "40727880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21184", "title": "Nova Scotia", "text": "Province of Canada\nNova Scotia is a province in The Maritimes region of Canada, located on the nation's east coast. With an estimated population of over 1 million as of 2025, Nova Scotia is the most populous province in Atlantic Canada. Nova Scotia is also the second-most densely populated province in Canada, and the second smallest province by area. The province comprises the Nova Scotia peninsula and Cape Breton Island, as well as 3,800 other coastal islands. The province is connected to the rest of Canada by the Isthmus of Chignecto, on which the province's sole land border, with New Brunswick, is located.\nNova Scotia's capital and largest city is Halifax, which is home to over 45% of the province's population as of the 2021 census. Halifax is the twelfth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada, the largest municipality in Atlantic Canada, and Canada's second-largest coastal municipality after Vancouver.\nThe land that makes up what is now Nova Scotia was inhabited by the Mi\ua78ckmaq people at the time of European colonization. In 1605, Acadia\u2014France's first New France colony\u2014was founded with the creation of Acadia's capital, Port Royal. The Scots, English, then British, fought France for the territory on numerous occasions for over a century afterwards, having gained it from them in the 1713 Peace of Utrecht, which ended the War of the Spanish Succession. Port Royal was renamed Annapolis Royal and the settlement served as the capital of Nova Scotia until the founding of Halifax in 1749. \nIn subsequent years, the British began settling \"foreign Protestants\" in the region and deported the French-speaking Acadians en masse. During the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), thousands of Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia.\nIn 1848, Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve responsible government. In July 1867, Nova Scotia joined in Confederation with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec), forming the Dominion of Canada (now just called \"Canada\").\nEtymology.\n is Latin for 'New Scotland' and is the recognized Canadian English name for the province. Just prior to receiving this name, it was referred to as Nova Francia. Nova Scotia also appears on some older maps as New Caledonia. In both Canadian French and Canadian Gaelic, the province is directly translated as 'New Scotland' (; Gaelic: ). In general, Romance and Slavic languages use translations of 'New Scotland' to their language, while most other languages use transliterations of the Latin (which is the same as English) name, including the native language Mi'kmaq ().\nThe province was first named in the 1621 Royal Charter granting to Sir William Alexander the right to settle lands as a Scottish colony, including modern Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula.\nHistory.\nNova Scotia includes regions of the Mi'kmaq nation of Mi'kma'ki (\"\"), the territory of which extends across the Maritimes, parts of Maine, Newfoundland and the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula. The Mi'kmaq people are part of the large Algonquian-language family and inhabited Nova Scotia at the time the first European colonists arrived. Research published in 1871 as well as Silas Tertius Rand's work from 1894 showed that some Mi'kmaq believed they had emigrated from the west, and then lived alongside the Kw\u0113d\u0115chk, the original inhabitants. According to these accounts, the two tribes engaged in a war that lasted \"many years\", and involved the \"slaughter of men, women, and children, and torture of captives\", and the eventual displacement of the Kw\u0113d\u0115chk by the victorious Mi\u2019kmaq.\nEuropean settlement.\nThe first Europeans to settle the area were the French, who sailed into the Annapolis Basin in 1604, but chose to settle at Saint Croix Island in Maine instead. They abandoned the Maine settlement the following year and, in 1605, established a settlement at Port Royal, which grew into modern-day Annapolis Royal. This would be the first permanent European settlement in what would later become Canada. The settlement was in the Mi'kmaw district of Kespukwitk and was the founding settlement of what would become Acadia.\nIn 1621, King James VI of Scotland granted a charter to allow a Scottish colony to be founded in North America. The charter which was granted by the King covered the area of the Maritime Provinces and the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula, whilst the French had claimed territory in Acadia. The charter granted Sir William Alexander, a Scottish noble, powers to establish a system of government, full rights over fishing and minerals and the power to execute law in the new colony. A Scottish colony was eventually established in 1629 following the arrival of around seventy Scots to settle in the area known as \"New Scotland\". \n\"New Scotland\" was captured by the French in 1632, with the Scots who had colonised the area forced to return to Scotland after the French occupation. Following a prolonged period of change between the French and British, Nova Scotia eventually returned to the British (which by now included Scotland as one of the countries of the United Kingdom following the Treaty of Union). As a result, many Scots grasped the opportunity to once again settle in Nova Scotia.\nWarfare was common in Nova Scotia during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the first 80 years the French and Acadians lived in Nova Scotia, nine significant military clashes took place as the English, Dutch, French and Mi'kmaq fought for possession of the area. These encounters happened at Port Royal, Saint John, Cap de Sable (present-day Pubnico to Port La Tour, Nova Scotia), Jemseg (1674 and 1758) and Baleine (1629). The Acadian Civil War took place from 1640 to 1645. Beginning with King William's War in 1688, a series of six wars took place between the English and the French, with Nova Scotia being a consistent theatre of conflict between the two powers.\n18th century.\nHostilities between England and France in North America resumed from 1702 to 1713, known as Queen Anne's War. The siege of Port Royal took place in 1710, ending French rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 formally recognized British rule in the region, while returning Cape Breton Island () and Prince Edward Island () to the French. Despite the British conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, Francis Nicholson announced it would be renamed Annapolis Royal in honour of Queen Anne.\nAs a result of Father Rale's War (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with the British in 1725. The Mi'kmaq signed a treaty of submission to the British crown. However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French and the British persisted in the following decades with King George's War (1744\u20131748).\nFather Le Loutre's War (1749\u20131755) began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on 21 June 1749. A General Court, made up of the governor and the council, was the highest court in the colony at the time. Jonathan Belcher was sworn in as chief justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on 21 October 1754. The first legislative assembly in Halifax, under the Governorship of Charles Lawrence, met on 2 October 1758.\nDuring the French and Indian War of 1754\u20131763 (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War), the British deported the Acadians and recruited New England Planters to resettle the colony. The 75-year period of war ended with the Halifax Treaties between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return.\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of Sunbury was created. This included the territory of present-day New Brunswick and eastern Maine as far as the Penobscot River. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\nThe American Revolution (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia, with the colony initially displaying ambivalence over whether the colony should join the revolution; Rebellion flared at the Battle of Fort Cumberland (1776) and at the Siege of Saint John (1777). Throughout the war, American privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war, Nova Scotia had outfitted numerous privateers to attack American shipping.\nBritish military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing an American occupation of Nova Scotia, though the Royal Navy failed to establish naval supremacy in the region. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the Naval battle off Halifax (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending British convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the Naval battle off Cape Breton (1781).\nAfter the Americans and their French allies won at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, approximately 33,000 Loyalists, the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"United Empire Loyalist\" after their names, settled in Nova Scotia, 14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick, on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and New Brunswick in 1784. The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including Shelburne, which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills.\nThe migration caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing New England Planters settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 Black Loyalists arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at Birchtown, near Shelburne. There are several Black Loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the Old Burying Ground in Halifax. Many Nova Scotian communities were settled by British regiments that fought in the war.\nIn 1786, during the tenure of Lt. Gen. John Parr as governor, the Colony of Nova Scotia transitioned to being the Province of Nova Scotia, with the populace gaining a higher degree of autonomy and self-governance.\n19th century.\nDuring the War of 1812, Nova Scotia's contribution to the British war effort involved communities either purchasing or building various privateer ships to attack U.S. vessels. Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the war for Nova Scotia occurred when escorted the captured American frigate into Halifax Harbour in 1813. Many of the U.S. prisoners were kept at Deadman's Island.\nNova Scotia became the first colony in British North America and in the British Empire to achieve responsible government in January\u2013February 1848 and become self-governing through the efforts of Joseph Howe. Nova Scotia had established representative government in 1758, an achievement later commemorated by the erection of Dingle Tower in 1908.\nNova Scotians fought in the Crimean War of 1853\u20131856. The 1860 Welsford-Parker Monument in Halifax is the second-oldest war monument in Canada and the only Crimean War monument in North America. It commemorates the 1854\u201355 Siege of Sevastopol.\nThousands of Nova Scotians fought in the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), primarily on behalf of the North. The British Empire (including Nova Scotia) in the conflict. As a result, Britain (and Nova Scotia) continued to trade with both the South and the North. Nova Scotia's economy boomed during the Civil War.\nPost-Confederation history.\nSoon after the American Civil War, Pro-Canadian Confederation premier Charles Tupper led Nova Scotia into Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867, along with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada. The Anti-Confederation Party was led by Joseph Howe. Almost three months later, in the election of 18 September 1867, the Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal seats, and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature.\nThroughout the 19th century, numerous businesses developed in Nova Scotia became of pan-Canadian and international importance: the Starr Manufacturing Company (first ice skate manufacturer in Canada), the Bank of Nova Scotia, Cunard Line, Alexander Keith's Brewery, Morse's Tea Company (first tea company in Canada), among others.\nNova Scotia became a world leader in both building and owning wooden sailing ships in the second half of the 19th century. Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders Donald McKay and William Dawson Lawrence. The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured in 1895 when Joshua Slocum became the first man to sail single-handedly around the world. International attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the \"Bluenose\" schooner. Nova Scotia was also the birthplace and home of Samuel Cunard, a British shipping magnate (born at Halifax, Nova Scotia) who founded the Cunard Line.\nIn December 1917, at least 1,782 people were killed in the Halifax Explosion, which was the largest human-made explosion at the time.\nIn April 2004, the Nova Scotia legislature adopted a resolution explicitly inviting the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands to explore the possibility of joining Canada as part of that Province.\nIn April 2020, a man committed a killing spree across the province that became the deadliest rampage in Canada's history.\nGeography.\nNova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province in area, after Prince Edward Island. It is surrounded by four major bodies of water: the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the north, the Bay of Fundy to the west, the Gulf of Maine to the southwest, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The province's mainland is the Nova Scotia peninsula and includes numerous bays and estuaries. Nowhere in Nova Scotia is more than from the ocean. Cape Breton Island, a large island to the northeast of the Nova Scotia mainland, is also part of the province, as is Sable Island, a small island notorious for being the site of offshore shipwrecks, approximately from the province's southern coast.\nNova Scotia has many ancient fossil-bearing rock formations. These formations are particularly rich on the Bay of Fundy's shores. Blue Beach near Hantsport, Joggins Fossil Cliffs, on the Bay of Fundy's shores, has yielded an abundance of Carboniferous-age fossils. Wasson's Bluff, near the town of Parrsboro, has yielded both Triassic- and Jurassic-age fossils. The highest point is White Hill at 533\u00a0m (1,749\u00a0ft) above sea level, situated amongst the Cape Breton Highlands in the far north of the province.\nNova Scotia is located along the 45th parallel north, so it is midway between the Equator and the North Pole. The province contains 5,400 lakes.\nClimate.\nNova Scotia lies in the mid-temperate zone and, although the province is almost surrounded by water, the climate is closer to continental climate rather than maritime. The winter and summer temperature extremes of the continental climate are moderated by the ocean. Winters are cold enough to be classified as continental\u2014still being nearer the freezing point than inland areas to the west.\nThe Nova Scotian climate is in many ways similar to the central Baltic Sea coast in Northern Europe, only wetter and snowier. This is true although Nova Scotia is some fifteen parallels further south. Areas not on the Atlantic coast experience warmer summers more typical of inland areas, and winter lows are a little colder. On 12 August 2020, the community of Grand \u00c9tang recorded an overnight low of .\nDemography.\nEthnicity.\nAccording to the 2016 Canadian census the largest ethnic group in Nova Scotia is Scottish (30.0%), followed by English (28.9%), Irish (21.6%), French (16.5%), German (10.7%), First Nations (5.4%), Dutch (3.5%), M\u00e9tis (2.9%), and Acadian (2.6%). 42.6% of respondents identified their ethnicity as \"Canadian\".\nLanguage.\nAs of the 2021 Canadian Census, the ten most spoken languages in the province included English (951,945 or 99.59%), French (99,300 or 10.39%), Arabic (11,745 or 1.23%), Hindi (10,115 or 1.06%), Spanish (8,675 or 0.91%), Mandarin (8,525 or 0.89%), Punjabi (6,730 or 0.7%), German (6,665 or 0.7%), Mi\ua78ckmaq (5,650 or 0.59%), and Tagalog (5,595 or 0.59%). The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses.\nNova Scotia is home to the largest Scottish Gaelic-speaking community outside of Scotland, with a small number of native speakers in Pictou County and Antigonish County, and on Cape Breton Island, and the language is taught in a number of secondary schools throughout the province. In 2018 the government launched a new Gaelic vehicle licence plate to raise awareness of the language and help fund Gaelic language and culture initiatives. They estimated that there were 2,000 Gaelic speakers in the province.\nIn 2022, the Government of Nova Scotia introduced legislation recognizing Mi'kmaq as the province's first language, and committed to protecting and promoting the language.\nReligion.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the largest denominations by number of adherents were Christians with 78.2%. About 21.18% were non-religious and 1% were Muslims. Jews, Hindus, and Sikhs constitute around 0.20%.\nIn 1871, the largest religious denominations were Presbyterian with 103,500 (27%); Roman Catholic with 102,000 (26%); Baptist with 73,295 (19%); Anglican with 55,124 (14%); Methodist with 40,748 (10%), Lutheran with 4,958 (1.3%); and Congregationalist with 2,538 (0.65%).\nEconomy.\nNova Scotia's per capita GDP in 2016 was CA$, significantly lower than the national average per capita GDP of CA$. GDP growth has lagged behind the rest of the country for at least the past decade. In 2017, the median family income in Nova Scotia was $85,970, below the national average of $92,990; in Halifax the figure rises to $98,870.\nThe province is the world's largest exporter of Christmas trees, lobster, gypsum, and wild berries. Its export value of fish exceeds $1\u00a0billion, and fish products are received by 90 countries around the world. Nevertheless, the province's imports far exceed its exports. While these numbers were roughly equal from 1992 until 2004, since that time the trade deficit has ballooned. In 2012, exports from Nova Scotia were 12.1% of provincial GDP, while imports were 22.6%.\nNova Scotia's traditionally resource-based economy has diversified in recent decades. The rise of Nova Scotia as a viable jurisdiction in North America, historically, was driven by the ready availability of natural resources, especially the fish stocks off the Scotian Shelf. The fishery was a pillar of the economy since its development as part of New France in the 17th century; however, the fishery suffered a sharp decline due to overfishing in the late 20th century. The collapse of the cod stocks and the closure of this sector resulted in a loss of approximately 20,000 jobs in 1992.\nOther sectors in the province were also hit hard, particularly during the last two decades: coal mining in Cape Breton and northern mainland Nova Scotia has virtually ceased, and Sydney Steel Corporation, a large steel mill in Sydney, closed during the 1990s. More recently, the high value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar has hurt the forestry industry, leading to the shutdown of a long-running pulp and paper mill near Liverpool. Mining, especially of gypsum and salt and to a lesser extent silica, peat and barite, is also a significant sector. Since 1991, offshore oil and gas has become an important part of the economy, although production and revenue are nowdeclining. Agriculture remains an important sector in the province, particularly in the Annapolis Valley.\nNova Scotia's defence and aerospace sector generates approximately $500\u00a0million in revenues and contributes about $1.5\u00a0billion to the provincial economy each year. To date, 40% of Canada's military assets reside in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia has the fourth-largest film industry in Canada hosting over 100 productions yearly, more than half of which are the products of international film and television producers. In 2015, the government of Nova Scotia eliminated tax credits to film production in the province, jeopardizing the industry given most other jurisdictions continue to offer such credits. The province also has a rapidly developing Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) sector which consists of over 500 companies, and employs roughly 15,000 people.\nIn 2006, the manufacturing sector brought in over $2.6\u00a0billion in chained GDP, the largest output of any industrial sector in Nova Scotia. Michelin remains by far the largest single employer in this sector, operating three production plants in the province. Michelin is also the province's largest private-sector employer.\nIn July 2024, the provincial government committed CAD$18.6 million to build 27 new telecommunication towers to upgrade cellular service province-wide.\nTourism.\nIn 2024, over 2 million non-residents visited Nova Scotia. The majority of visitors are from other parts of Canada, with the largest foreign market being Americans, with over 172,000 visits. This industry contributes approximately $3.5 billion annually to the economy. Commercial tourism began with the arrival of approximately 300 New England visitors at Annapolis Royal in July 1871.Nova Scotia's tourism industry showcases Nova Scotia's culture, scenery and coastline. Nova Scotia has many museums reflecting its history and culture, including the Glooscap Heritage Centre, Grand-Pr\u00e9 National Historic Site, Hector Heritage Quay and the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia. Other museums tell the story of its working history, such as the Cape Breton Miners Museum and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.\nThe province has 87 National Historic Sites of Canada, including the Habitation at Port-Royal, the Fortress of Louisbourg, Grand-Pr\u00e9 and Citadel Hill (Fort George) in Halifax. Fort Anne located in the historic town of Annapolis Royal, dates from 1629 and is Canada's first National Historic Site. One of the top destinations, as measured by visitor numbers, is Peggys Cove, receiving more than 600,000 tourists every year. Lunenburg, another popular cultural destination, is a port town on the South Shore that was declared a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) World Heritage Site. \nEcotourism plays an important role in Nova Scotia's tourism industry, with the province being home to two national parks of Canada, Kejimkujik National Park and Cape Breton Highlands National Park, as well as one national park reserve: Sable Island National Park Reserve. Nova Scotia also hosts many other protected areas at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels that are popular destinations for visitors.\nGovernment and politics.\nNova Scotia has a parliamentary system within the construct of a constitutional monarchy; the monarchy in Nova Scotia is the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The sovereign King Charles III since 8 September 2022, is King in Right of Nova Scotia who also serves as head of state of 14 other Commonwealth countries, each of Canada's nine other provinces, and the Canadian federal realm, but resides in the United Kingdom. As such, the King's representative, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, carries out most of the royal duties in Nova Scotia.\nThe direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures in any of these areas of governance is limited, though; in practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Executive Council, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the unicameral, elected House of Assembly and chosen and headed by the Premier of Nova Scotia (Tim Houston since 2021), the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the Lieutenant Governor will usually appoint as premier the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Assembly. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition (Zach Churchill from 2022\u201324) and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.\nEach of the 51 Members of the Legislative Assembly in the House of Assembly is elected by single member plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the lieutenant governor on the advice of the premier, or may be triggered by the government losing a confidence vote in the House. There are three dominant political parties in Nova Scotia: the Liberal Party, the New Democratic Party, and the Progressive Conservative Party. The other two registered parties are the Green Party of Nova Scotia and the Atlantica Party, neither of which has a seat in the House of Assembly.\nOn 21 July 2022, Nova Scotia became the second province in Canada to regulate online gambling by launching its own online casino through the Atlantic Lottery Corporation (ALC). The site will bring benefits to the economy and provide residents with a safe and secure place to gamble online.\nAdministrative divisions.\nMunicipal-level governance is provided by 50 municipalities, of which there are three types: regional municipalities, towns, and county or district municipalities. Villages can exist within county or district municipalities, with a limited authority and an elected council.\nNova Scotia is divided into 18 counties. 9 of the original 18 counties retain a county-level government while the rest are either governed by regional or district municipalities. Regional municipalities are coextensive with the borders with a historic county, while historic counties governed by district municipalities are split into two district municipalities each. Despite this, Statistics Canada uses all counties of Nova Scotia for the purposes of administering the census and presenting its data, and they remain used in common parlance as geographic identifiers by Nova Scotians.\nThere are three regional municipalities. They may incorporate under the \"Municipal Government Act\" (\"MGA\") of 1998, which came into force on 1 April 1999, while towns, county municipalities and district municipalities are continued as municipalities under the \"MGA\". The \"MGA\" gives municipal councils the power to make bylaws for \"health, well being, safety and protection of persons\" and \"safety and protection of property\" in addition to a few expressed powers. \nThe regional municipality of Halifax is the capital and largest municipality of Nova Scotia by population with 403,131 residents representing of the total population of the province and land area at . Pictou was the first municipality to incorporate on , and the newest municipalities are Halifax and Region of Queens Municipality both amalgamating into their present regional municipality form of government on .\nThere are 26 towns, nine county municipalities and 12 district municipalities.\nTransportation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRail.\nVia Rail's \"Ocean\" service, which connects Montreal to Halifax, is currently the oldest continuously operated passenger route in North America, with stops from west to east at Amherst, Springhill Junction, Truro, and Halifax.\nCulture.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of Nova Scotia is typically Canadian with an emphasis on local seafood typical of the northwestern Atlantic. Nova Scotia is renowned for its scallops, particularly from the Digby area. As a major lobster producer (Nova Scotia supplied nearly 46% of total Canadian lobster landings in 2021), the shellfish is a common feature at Nova Scotian restaurants and in Nova Scotian variants of seafood dishes. One endemic dish (in the sense of \"peculiar to\" and \"originating from\") is the Halifax donair, a distant variant of the doner kebab prepared using thinly sliced beef shavings and a sweet condensed milk sauce. An endemic variant of the Scottish hodge-podge, is a popular summer dish in Nova Scotia. Unlike the Scottish dish, the Nova Scotian variant typically does not feature meat but instead includes seasonal vegetables like carrots, new potatoes, and beans in a rich, cream-based broth.\nThe province is known for its wine, and produces its own signature wine appellation, Tidal Bay, which must be solely produced from 100% Nova Scotia grapes to legally receive the designation. The Annapolis Valley, in particular, is known for its numerous vineyards and wineries. Nova Scotia also hosts a vibrant craft brewery industry, with more than 50 craft breweries located throughout the province. Many renowned distilleries are based in Nova Scotia, including Glenora Distillery; which produces North America's first single malt whiskey. Apple cultivation is a major industry in the province, which is home to a centuries old tradition of cider making. Many craft cideries are located across the province, particularly in the Annapolis Valley region. In 2025, Canada's first cider appellation, known as Red Sky, was designated for a cider produced in Nova Scotia.\nAs a major blueberry producing province (the fruit is Nova Scotia's largest agricultural export annually, with harvest exceeding each year), the fruit features prominently in many traditional desserts from the province. Notably, blueberry grunt (a dessert dish), originates from Nova Scotia. The ice cream flavour known as moon mist is also endemic to Nova Scotia, and is a popular feature at ice cream shops in the province.\nFine arts.\nHalifax hosts institutions such as Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Neptune Theatre, and the Dalhousie Arts Centre. The province is home to avant-garde visual art and traditional crafting, writing and publishing and a film industry.\nMuch of the historic public art sculptures in the province were made by New York sculptor J. Massey Rhind as well as Canadian sculptors Hamilton MacCarthy, George Hill, Emanuel Hahn and Louis-Philippe H\u00e9bert. Some of this public art was also created by Nova Scotian John Wilson. Nova Scotian George Lang was a stone sculptor who also built many landmark buildings in the province, including the Welsford-Parker Monument. Two valuable sculptures/monuments in the province are in St. Paul's Church (Halifax): one by John Gibson (for Richard John Uniacke, Jr.) and another monument by Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey (for Amelia Ann Smyth). Both Gibson and Chantry were famous British sculptors during the Victorian era and have numerous sculptures in the Tate, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and Westminster Abbey.\nMedia.\nNews.\nThe first newspaper to be printed in Nova Scotia was the Halifax Gazette on 23 March 1752. It was also the first newspaper printed anywhere in Canada. A single copy of the first issue of the Gazette exists today, which was acquired by Library and Archives Canada on 20 June 2002 from the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston. Newsprint made from wood pulp was invented in 1844 by Nova Scotian Charles Fenerty and was presented to the Acadian Recorder as an alternative printing medium to the paper made from other plant fibers at the time, such as cotton, which was typically made from discarded articles of clothing. \nFounded in 1874, the province's current primary daily broadsheet newspaper is The Chronicle Herald, which is circulated to 91,152 weekday customers, with the number increasing to 93,178 on Saturdays (2015). It is the most widely circulated newspaper in Atlantic Canada. The paper does not publish on Sundays. It is owned by the SaltWire Network, the largest media company in Atlantic Canada. The Nova Scotia Government also provides a digital archive of past newspapers via the Nova Scotia Archives website.\nRadio.\nThe province's first radio station was CHNS-FM which first aired on 12 May 1926 from the Carleton Hotel in Halifax by World War I Signal Corps soldier William C. Borrett. Today the station is owned by Maritime Broadcasting System and goes by the on-air brand name \"89.9 The Wave\" and attracts a weekly average of 64,236 listeners between the ages of 25 and 54 as of 2021.\nMusic.\nNova Scotia hosts a lively and rich music scene, influenced by the traditions of the various cultures that live there. Many of the songs that are today considered traditional to Nova Scotia were born as working songs, specifically sea shanties were a prominent form of music in the province's coastal communities throughout the 19th century. While no longer practical as working songs, sea shanties are still closely associated with the province's musical culture. Traditional music in Nova Scotia bears a heavy Celtic influence owing to the large numbers of settlers from Ireland and the Scottish Highlands coming to the province in the 19th century. Every year, Cape Breton Island hosts the Celtic Colours International Festival, which celebrates and showcases the region's Celtic music.\nNova Scotia has produced many significant songwriters, such as Grammy Award winning Gordie Sampson, who has written songs for Carrie Underwood (\"Jesus, Take the Wheel\", \"Just a Dream\", \"Get Out of This Town\"), Martina McBride (\"If I Had Your Name\", \"You're Not Leavin Me\"), LeAnn Rimes (\"Long Night\", \"Save Myself\"), and George Canyon (\"My Name\"). Many of Hank Snow's songs went on to be recorded by the likes of The Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, and Johnny Cash. Cape Bretoners Allister MacGillivray and Leon Dubinsky have both written songs which, by being covered by so many popular artists, and by entering the repertoire of so many choirs around the world, have become iconic representations of Nova Scotian style, values and ethos. Dubinsky's pop ballad \"We Rise Again\" might be called the unofficial anthem of Cape Breton.\nSports.\nSport is an important part of Nova Scotia culture. There are numerous semi pro, university and amateur sports teams, for example, The Halifax Mooseheads, 2013 Canadian Hockey League Memorial Cup Champions, and the Cape Breton Eagles, both of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The Halifax Hurricanes of the National Basketball League of Canada were another team that called Nova Scotia home, and were 2016 league champions. Professional soccer came to the province in 2019 in the form of Canadian Premier League club HFX Wanderers FC.\nThe achievements of Nova Scotian athletes are presented at the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame.\nEducation.\nThe Minister of Education is responsible for the administration and delivery of education, as defined by the Education Act and other acts relating to colleges, universities and private schools. The powers of the Minister and the Department of Education are defined by the Ministerial regulations and constrained by the Governor-In-Council regulations.\nAll children under the age of 16 are legally required to attend school unless the parents perform home schooling. Nova Scotia's education system is split up into eight different regions including; Tri-County (22 schools), Annapolis Valley (42 schools), South Shore (25 schools), Chignecto-Central (67 schools), Halifax (135 schools), Strait (20 schools), and Cape Breton-Victoria Regional Centre for Education (39 schools).\nNova Scotia has more than 450 public schools for children. The public system offers primary to Grade 12. There are also private schools in the province. Public education is administered by seven regional school boards, responsible primarily for English instruction and French immersion, and province-wide by the Conseil Scolaire Acadien Provincial, which administers French instruction to students whose primary language is French.\nPost-secondary education.\nThe Nova Scotia Community College system has 13 campuses around the province. With a focus on training and education, the college was established in 1988 by amalgamating the province's former vocational schools. In addition to the provincial community college system, there are more than 90 registered private colleges in Nova Scotia.\nNova Scotia, and Halifax in particular, is a major destination in Canada for post-secondary students. Ten universities are situated in the province: Dalhousie University (including Dalhousie University Faculty of Agriculture), University of King's College, Saint Mary's University, Mount Saint Vincent University, NSCAD University, Acadia University, Universit\u00e9 Sainte-Anne, Saint Francis Xavier University, Cape Breton University and the Atlantic School of Theology. In total, nearly 58,000 students were enrolled in a Nova Scotian post-secondary institution during the 2021/2022 academic year.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
