It has since evolved into several competitive forms where participants race against the clock while navigating through checkpoints. Variants include automobile, underwater, mountain bike, ski, and trail orienteering. The most common form is foot orienteering, also known as \"FootO\".\nIn formal foot-orienteering competitions, participants are given a specially prepared orienteering map, usually topographical, which they use to locate control points.\nOrienteering is part of the World Games and the World Police and Fire Games.\nHistory.\nOrienteering originated in Sweden in the late 19th century. The term \"orientering\" (Swedish for \u201corientation\u201d) was first used in 1886 at the Military Academy Karlberg, describing navigation across unfamiliar terrain using a map and compass. The activity developed from military land navigation exercises into a civilian sport. \nThe first civilian competition open to the public was held in Norway in 1897, when the country was part of the Union between Sweden and Norway. In 1901, the first Swedish public event included control points at historic sites such as Sp\u00e5nga Church and Bromma Church, a round church.\nAffordable compasses helped the sport expand during the 1930s. By 1934, about 250,000 Swedes participated, and orienteering had spread to Finland, Switzerland, the Soviet Union, and Hungary. After World War II, it spread across Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania. In 1959, Sweden hosted an international conference with delegates from 12 countries, leading to the formation of the International Orienteering Federation (IOF) in 1961. By 2010, the IOF included 71 member federations worldwide. World Championships were held biennially until 2003 and annually thereafter.\nOrienteering remains most popular in Scandinavia, home to long-running events such as the Jukola relay and Tiomila, both established in the 1940s. The O-Ringen, held annually since 1965, attracts around 15,000 competitors.\nThe sport was originally practiced in forest terrain but later expanded to fell, heathland, and moorland areas. Urban and park orienteering became established in the 1990s and 2000s through events such as the Park World Tour, supported by dedicated urban map standards (ISSOM) and electronic timing systems. These formats are now included in national and international ranking systems.\nVariations.\nOrienteering sports combine significant navigation with a specific method of travel. Because the method of travel determines the needed equipment and tactics, each sport requires specific rules for competition and guidelines for orienteering event logistics and course design.\nInternational Orienteering Federation, the governing body of the sport, currently sanctions the following four disciplines as official disciplines in the sport of orienteering:\nMoreover, International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) sanctions the following orienteering sport:\nOther orienteering disciplines include, but are not limited to:\nAdventure racing is a combination of two or more disciplines, and usually includes orienteering as part of the race.\nGoverning bodies.\nInternational.\nAt international level, the International Orienteering Federation (IOF) defines rules and guidelines which govern four orienteering sports: foot orienteering, mountain bike orienteering, ski orienteering, and trail orienteering. It is based in Sweden and it claims on its website to aim to \"spread the sport of orienteering, to promote its development and to create and maintain an attractive world event programme.\" Since 1977 the IOF has been recognised by the IOC.\nNational.\nThere are governing bodies for most of the individual nations that are represented in the sport of orienteering. These national bodies are the rule-making body for that nation. For example, the British Orienteering Federation is the national governing body for the United Kingdom. The federation was founded in 1967 and it is made up of 13 constituent associations. For the United States, the national governing body is Orienteering USA.\nRegional.\nMost nations have some form of regional governing bodies. These are not rule-making bodies but are there to assist in coordinating clubs within that region, e.g., they may allocate dates so that clubs do not clash with their events.\nLocal.\nClubs are usually formed at a local level and affiliated to their national governing body. It is clubs who put on events usually open to all-comers. Clubs may also put on practice, training, and social events.\nOpen clubs are open to anyone and there is usually no restriction on joining them.\nClosed clubs restrict their membership to specific groups. For example, BAOC (British Army Orienteering Club) has restrictions on who may join, principally British Army personnel.\nCompetition and results.\nBasics.\nThe competition, or race, is intended to test the navigational skill, concentration, and running ability of the competitors. High levels of fitness and running speed are required to compete successfully at an international or elite level. To ensure fairness between competitors the map is not usually provided until the start, and starts are normally staggered with competitors starting at not less than one-minute intervals.\nThe objective on each leg is to follow the fastest route between controls. The fastest is not always the shortest route, and can depend heavily on route choice.\nMap.\nOrienteering competitions use specially prepared orienteering maps. They are topographic maps although much more detailed than general-purpose maps. The ISOM map scales are 1:15,000, 1:10,000, or 1:7,500, with grids aligned to magnetic north. Map symbols are standardized by the IOF, and designed to be readable by any competitor regardless of background or native tongue.\nCourses.\nOrienteering events offer a range of courses, of varying physical and technical difficulty, to meet the needs of competitors. The orienteering course is marked in purple or red on a map. A triangle is used to indicate the start and a double circle indicates the finish. Circles are used to show the control points.\nAge-related classes.\nAt international, national, and the larger events, courses are classified by age, e.g., M35 for men 35 years of age and older. Classes requiring similar distances and difficulties are usually combined into a smaller number of courses, e.g., M60 will normally share a course with W50, and often with M65 and W55. The results are normally arranged by class.\nAbility-based courses.\nIn the smaller events courses are provided by ability. The United States and the United Kingdom use colour coding to define the difficulty of the courses. Short, easy courses are provided for beginners and younger competitors, with technically and physically demanding courses being provided for experienced orienteers. Ranging from easy and short to long and technical, there are; White, Yellow, Orange, Light Green, Green, Blue and Brown.\nPermanent courses and other events.\nSome orienteering clubs have set up permanent courses, which can be used for personal, or club, training. Non-standard permanent markers are used as control kites, and maps of the courses are usually available publicly for a fee. The courses are usually set up in public areas and there may be some restrictions on access, e.g., daylight hours only. Clubs also organise informal events for practice and training.\nControls and control description sheet.\nControl points are placed on features on the map that can be clearly identified on the ground. Control points are marked in the terrain by white and orange \"flags\".\nCompetitors receive a \"control description sheet\" or \"clue sheet\" which gives a precise description of the feature and the location of the kite, e.g., boulder, 5m, north side. For experienced orienteers the descriptions use symbols (pictorial), in accordance with the \"IOF Control descriptions\".\nControl card and punching.\nEach competitor is required to carry an electronic or paper control card, and to present it at the Start and hand it in at the Finish. The control card is marked by some means at each control point to show that the competitor has completed the course correctly. Most events now use electronic punching, although cards and needle punches are still widely used.\nResults.\nThe winner is normally the competitor with the fastest time, but other scoring systems can be used, e.g., score events and Trail-O. Most events produce provisional results 'on the day', with draft results on the Internet that night; the final results being confirmed a few days later. With electronic punching the results can include \"split times\" for competitors. These show the times between controls and aggregate times to each control. With suitable computer software these times can be displayed in a graphical form (Progressograph).\nSafety.\nEach competitor is responsible for his or her own safety. There are no rules, but there are guidelines, which should be followed. The basic safety check was the \"stub check\". The competitor hands in his stub at the start and his control card at the finish. Event officials match the two and any unmatched stubs represent a missing competitor. This has been superseded with electronic punching in that event officials can now request a 'still to finish' report listing all those competitors who punched at the start but have not yet downloaded their electronic card. All competitors must report to the finish whether they have completed the course or not.\nPersonal clothing.\nIOF rule 21.1 is that the specification for clothing is delegated to the national organising body, and no specific clothing is required. Unique among English speaking countries, Ireland and the UK require legs to be covered. Rule 7.1.1 requires \"full body cover\": the torso and legs must be covered, while organizer may allow shorts (e.g., in park or street orienteering). In the United States, rule A.34.1 states that competitors are free to choose clothing that they are most comfortable in (full leg cover is \"not\" required), unless specifically stated in the meet announcement. In Australia, under the 2021 rules, 2.1.21, the choice of clothing is also left up to the competitor, and full leg cover is not required. In Canada, no specific clothing is required, but participants are encouraged to wear clothing suitable for the weather, and hiking or running shoes. Similarly in New Zealand, there are no rules in force limiting orienteers to running only in full leg cover. \nThe early competitors used standard athletic clothing, i.e., shorts and an athletic vest, which provided little protection for racing through undergrowth. Purpose-made lightweight nylon full-body suits were later adopted. The early \"O-suits\" were made in muted colours but modern suits are generally multi-coloured. Clubs often organise the bulk purchase of clothing, which are then made in the club colours with the club's name prominently displayed. Some competitors prefer lycra tights or leggings. Gaiters are also often worn. Lightweight studded (and often cleated) orienteering shoes are commonly used.\nPersonal equipment.\nThe basic equipment required for orienteering is usually listed as a compass and appropriate outdoor clothing. Most national bodies recommend that a whistle be carried for safety reasons.\nCompetitive orienteers usually use specialized equipment:\nCompetition types.\nOrienteering events can be classified in many different aspects:\nLong.\nClassic orienteering involves a race between controls in a preset order. The winner is the person who completes the course in the shortest time. This is called a \"cross-country\" course as distinct from a score course (see below). Courses are normally designed so that the fastest route is not straightforward to find on the map, or to follow on the ground. The classic race has a typical winning time of 75\u201390 minutes. As of 2007, the IOF have dictated that the \"classic\" course should be redesignated the \"long\".\nMiddle.\nThe middle distance is a shorter cross-country race than the classic (or long), with a winning time in the region of 30 minutes and with an emphasis more on fine navigation than route-choice. When races of this distance were run in the mid-late 1990s, they were called \"short\" races, or \"sprint-O\". The short distance was introduced as a world championship discipline in 1991. More recently, though the IOF have renamed this distance as \"middle\".\nRelay.\nA relay race is run by a team of competitors each running a course, and the result is based on the team's total time. Relays usually employ a mass start instead of a staggered start. Relays are part of World Orienteering Championships both as sprint relays and as cross-country relays. Additionally, there are popular mass club races out of which Jukola relay has the highest number of participating clubs 1,787 (in 2015), while 25-manna has the highest number of legs 25. To reduce competitors following each other, various spreading methods might be used. This is called \"gaffling\", which is a Swedish word meaning \"forking\". The key principle is that every team must run every leg (between each pair of two controls), but not necessarily in the same order. The IOF have introduced the nomenclature to try to clarify the usage of the word \"leg\". In orienteering usage, leg normally refers to the part of a race between two control points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers to the part of a race run by a single team member. The IOF prefer \"lap\" for this latter term, but despite this, in common parlance, \"leg\" is used for both terms.\nScore.\nCompetitors visit as many controls as possible within a time limit. There is usually a mass start (rather than staggered), with a time limit. Controls may have different point values depending on difficulty, and there is a point penalty for each minute late. The competitor with the most points is the winner.\nThe large-scale, endurance-style version of a Score-O is known as a rogaine, competed by teams in events lasting (often) 24 hours. A very large area is used for competition, and the map scale is smaller. The format originated in Australia. The term ROGAINE is often said to stand for Rugged Outdoor Group Activity Involving Navigation and Endurance; this is essentially a backronym, as the name actually originates from the names of Rod, Gail and Neil Phillips, who were among Australian Rogaining's first participants.\nSprint.\nVery short races, with winning times in the region of 12\u201315 minutes, often held in city parks and other more urban settings. Map scales are usually 1:5,000 or 1:4,000. Control sites can include benches, litterbins, sculptures, and other objects common to urban parks. The sprint distance may also be held in the forest, when it would be called a \"forest sprint\" as opposed to an \"urban sprint\". This distance was pioneered in the late 1990s as an elite event by the Park World Tour organisation who organised an independent \"world cup\" in park sprint orienteering. In 2001 in Tampere, the IOF included a sprint distance in the orienteering world championships.\nUltrasprint.\nUltrasprint events are held in a specially constructed labyrinth. Due to the limited area of the labyrinth, ultrasprint is a more spectator-friendly form of orienteering. Also, as the course is artificial, identical courses can be set in different geographical locations for simultaneous local competitions as parts of a larger tournament.\nNight.\nCompetitors use a headlamp to navigate in the dark. Reflective markers often are used on control point flags, which shifts the tactics from precision navigation to searching. Competitors can travel at high speed to the vicinity of the control point, then sweep the area with the light to catch a reflection off the control flag. If a night event starts before dark, a mass start must be used so all competitors have equal time in the light and dark. The two classic club relays, Tiomila and Jukola, both include night legs. Full length (24-hour) rogaines and many adventure races run through the night, without a light period, and competitors may choose not to rest.\nString.\nCompetitors follow a string around a short course, noting down things that they find on the way. This is generally used by young children and people new to the sport who want to find out what it is like.\nPrecision.\nPrecision orienteering generally is not a speed event, but rather a test of the competitors' ability to precisely match map and terrain. Examples include trail-O (untimed), TREC style mounted orienteering, and Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area (ROCA). Both trail-O and ROCA use decoys in the vicinity of the control point.\nThe Olympics.\nEfforts begun in 1996 to promote the inclusion of orienteering in the Olympic Games have so far been unsuccessful, although orienteering became a sport in the World Games in 2001, and is a sport in the Summer Deaflympics. Supporters recognize that the sport is neither television- nor spectator-friendly, the venue of competition is often necessarily remote from major cities, and the duration of the event is longer than most other individual competitions. Efforts to develop a format suitable for Olympic competitions have focused on park orienteering, micro-orienteering, and short-distance relays. Sprint Orienteering on foot as a format of the sport is most likely to be included in Olympic Games, as this discipline is becoming more and more popular worldwide and can have a significant spectator interest. According to the website of a Chicago Orienteering club, \"the International Orienteering Federation is committed to entering the Olympic World.\"\nAlthough not an official demonstration sport, an international ski-orienteering event was held in Sugadaira K\u014dgen, Japan, as part of the International Cultural Festival held in conjunction with the XVIII Winter Olympic Games in Nagano in 1998. The International Orienteering Federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee in 2002 to include ski orienteering in the 2006 Winter Olympic Games, noting that it could share the venue with the biathlon competitions. In its formal recommendation that ski orienteering not be included in those games, the Olympic Programme Commission focused on a lack of participation in the sport outside Nordic countries, \"the challenges for broadcasters and spectators to easily follow the competition\", and the costs associated with new technology and a new results system. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee confirmed that ski orienteering was under consideration for inclusion in the review process of the Olympic sport program for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. On 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include any new sports in this review process.\nEvents.\nWorld Orienteering Championships.\nThe World Orienteering Championships (WOC) is an annual event organised by the International Orienteering Federation. The first World Championships was held in Fiskars, Finland in 1966. They were held biennially up to 2003 (with the exception of 1978 and 1979). Since 2003, competitions have been held annually.\nThe format of the World Orienteering Championships alternates every 2 years, with even years hosting sprint format events and odd years hosting forest format events. As of 2019[ [update]], when applying the Olympic-style gold first rankings method to medals won at the World Orienteering Championships, Europe has been dominant, with Sweden's 171 medals won marking them as the most successful world championships nation.\nWorld Games.\nOrienteering has been a part of the World Games program since 2001.\nEuropean Championships.\nAs Orienteering is a sport practiced primarily in Europe, the European Orienteering Championships is also an important event in the orienteering calendar. As of 2021, the European Championships is held in tandem with the World Championships, with the European Championships hosting the Sprint events when the World Championships hosts the Forest events and vice versa.\nWorld Cup.\nThe annual Orienteering World Cup is hosted over a number of events throughout the year, with winners of the overall world cup being awarded following the final event.\nWorld University Orienteering Championships.\nThe World University Orienteering Championships are hosted biannually.\nJunior World Championships.\nThe Junior World Championships has been held every year since 1990.\nEuropean Youth Orienteering Championships.\nThe European Youth Championships are the main international event for Junior orienteers below the age of 18.\nO-Ringen.\nA multi-day event with open entry held in different locations in Sweden, O-Ringen is the largest multi-day orienteering event in the world.\nJukola relay.\nA night relay with open entry held in different locations in Finland, Jukola is the largest relay orienteering event in the world. Jukola is considered equal to Tiomila as the most prestigious event in club orienteering.\nTiomila.\nA night relay with open entry held in different locations in Sweden, Tiomila is considered equal to Jukola as the most prestigious event in club orienteering.\nSemiotic Research.\nFinding the way around the outdoors is still very important. When people visit National Parks or other wild lands, they need to know where they are going on trails and paths. Over the years nature changes. Trees grow and fall over, wildfires occur, and floods take place. Therefore, signage and environmental markers need to change too. In one study, National Park staff asked 36 participants to think out loud while going through the park, reading the park map, and interpreting signage throughout the park. The researchers analyzed and reviewed the participants' comments to evaluate signage design and placement. This helped the staff understand how to improve signage so that hikers felt more at ease and oriented. Novice hikers, especially, may not understand non-textual hiking signs such as blazes, cairns, and ducks.\nOther studies have focused on novice orienteers solving orienteering tasks. One involved eight hiking volunteers. Half did a recording and audio during the hike while half verbalized after the hike what they saw and experienced. Hikers described their orienteering activity and made suggestions on how to improve the teaching of orienteering and orienteering practices.\nA central problem is map reading skills and understanding the imprecision of maps as a scaled down abstraction of an area at a single point in time. Hikers unused to orienteering often lack these skills and this understanding. Also, there are many kinds of maps, people need to be aware of the differences, what type of maps will work best for them, and particular issues such as scale and magnetic declination.\nSemiotics is an important tool to improve one's understanding of maps and way-finding in the outdoors. Topography and symbols for water, trees, private vs. public land etc. are all important semiotic markers for reading maps, orienteering, and finding one's way around the wilderness. Map symbols need to be simple, understandable, and meet professional cartography standards. Carto semiotics helps make sense of symbols used in different types of maps such as globes, relief models, and animations. Carto semiotics also includes the study of map keys, legends, and units of measurement between destinations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22522", "revid": "50541048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22522", "title": "Oscillation", "text": "Repetitive variation of some measure about a central value\nOscillation is the repetitive or periodic variation, typically in time, of some measure about a central value (often a point of equilibrium) or between two or more different states. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum and alternating current. Oscillations can be used in physics to approximate complex interactions, such as those between atoms.\nOscillations occur not only in mechanical systems but also in dynamic systems in virtually every area of science: for example the beating of the human heart (for circulation), business cycles in economics, predator\u2013prey population cycles in ecology, geothermal geysers in geology, vibration of strings in guitar and other string instruments, periodic firing of nerve cells in the brain, and the periodic swelling of Cepheid variable stars in astronomy. The term \"vibration\" is precisely used to describe a mechanical oscillation.\nOscillation, especially rapid oscillation, may be an undesirable phenomenon in process control and control theory (e.g. in sliding mode control), where the aim is convergence to stable state. In these cases it is called chattering or flapping, as in valve chatter, and route flapping.\nSimple harmonic oscillation.\nThe simplest mechanical oscillating system is a weight attached to a linear spring subject to only weight and tension. Such a system may be approximated on an air table or ice surface. The system is in an equilibrium state when the spring is static. If the system is displaced from the equilibrium, there is a net \"restoring force\" on the mass, tending to bring it back to equilibrium. However, in moving the mass back to the equilibrium position, it has acquired momentum which keeps it moving beyond that position, establishing a new restoring force in the opposite sense. If a constant force such as gravity is added to the system, the point of equilibrium is shifted. The time taken for an oscillation to occur is often referred to as the oscillatory \"period\".\nThe systems where the restoring force on a body is directly proportional to its displacement, such as the dynamics of the spring-mass system, are described mathematically by the simple harmonic oscillator and the regular periodic motion is known as simple harmonic motion. In the spring-mass system, oscillations occur because, at the static equilibrium displacement, the mass has kinetic energy which is converted into potential energy stored in the spring at the extremes of its path. The spring-mass system illustrates some common features of oscillation, namely the existence of an equilibrium and the presence of a restoring force which grows stronger the further the system deviates from equilibrium.\nIn the case of the spring-mass system, Hooke's law states that the restoring force of a spring is:\nformula_1\nBy using Newton's second law, the differential equation can be derived:\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3\nThe solution to this differential equation produces a sinusoidal position function:\nformula_4\nwhere \u03c9 is the frequency of the oscillation, A is the amplitude, and \u03b4 is the phase shift of the function. These are determined by the initial conditions of the system. Because cosine oscillates between 1 and \u22121 infinitely, our spring-mass system would oscillate between the positive and negative amplitude forever without friction.\nTwo-dimensional oscillators.\nIn two or three dimensions, harmonic oscillators behave similarly to one dimension. The simplest example of this is an isotropic oscillator, where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium with the same restorative constant in all directions.\nformula_5\nThis produces a similar solution, but now there is a different equation for every direction.\nformula_6\nAnisotropic oscillators.\nWith anisotropic oscillators, different directions have different constants of restoring forces. The solution is similar to isotropic oscillators, but there is a different frequency in each direction. Varying the frequencies relative to each other can produce interesting results. For example, if the frequency in one direction is twice that of another, a figure eight pattern is produced. If the ratio of frequencies is irrational, the motion is quasiperiodic. This motion is periodic on each axis, but is not periodic with respect to r, and will never repeat.\nDamped oscillations.\nAll real-world oscillator systems are thermodynamically irreversible. This means there are dissipative processes such as friction or electrical resistance which continually convert some of the energy stored in the oscillator into heat in the environment. This is called damping. Thus, oscillations tend to decay with time unless there is some net source of energy into the system. The simplest description of this decay process can be illustrated by oscillation decay of the harmonic oscillator.\nDamped oscillators are created when a resistive force is introduced, which is dependent on the first derivative of the position, or in this case velocity. The differential equation created by Newton's second law adds in this resistive force with an arbitrary constant b. This example assumes a linear dependence on velocity.\nformula_7\nThis equation can be rewritten as before:\nformula_8 \nwhere formula_9.\nThis produces the general solution:\nformula_10\nwhere formula_11.\nThe exponential term outside of the parenthesis is the decay function and \u03b2 is the damping coefficient. There are 3 categories of damped oscillators: under-damped, where \"\u03b2\" &lt; \"\u03c9\"0; over-damped, where \"\u03b2\" &gt; \"\u03c9\"0; and critically damped, where \"\u03b2\" = \"\u03c9\"0.\nDriven oscillations.\nIn addition, an oscillating system may be subject to some external force, as when an AC circuit is connected to an outside power source. In this case the oscillation is said to be \"driven\". \nThe simplest example of this is a spring-mass system with a sinusoidal driving force.\nformula_12where formula_13\nThis gives the solution: formula_14\nwhere formula_15 and formula_16\nThe second term of \"x\"(\"t\") is the transient solution to the differential equation. The transient solution can be found by using the initial conditions of the system.\nSome systems can be excited by energy transfer from the environment. This transfer typically occurs where systems are embedded in some fluid flow. For example, the phenomenon of flutter in aerodynamics occurs when an arbitrarily small displacement of an aircraft wing (from its equilibrium) results in an increase in the angle of attack of the wing on the air flow and a consequential increase in lift coefficient, leading to a still greater displacement. At sufficiently large displacements, the stiffness of the wing dominates to provide the restoring force that enables an oscillation.\nResonance.\nResonance occurs in a damped driven oscillator when \u03c9 = \u03c90, that is, when the driving frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the system. When this occurs, the denominator of the amplitude is minimized, which maximizes the amplitude of the oscillations.\nCoupled oscillations.\nThe harmonic oscillator and the systems it models have a single degree of freedom. More complicated systems have more degrees of freedom, for example, two masses and three springs (each mass being attached to fixed points and to each other). In such cases, the behavior of each variable influences that of the others. This leads to a \"coupling\" of the oscillations of the individual degrees of freedom. For example, two pendulum clocks (of identical frequency) mounted on a common wall will tend to synchronise. This phenomenon was first observed by Christiaan Huygens in 1665. The apparent motions of the compound oscillations typically appears very complicated but a more economic, computationally simpler and conceptually deeper description is given by resolving the motion into normal modes.\nThe simplest form of coupled oscillators is a 3 spring, 2 mass system, where masses and spring constants are the same. This problem begins with deriving Newton's second law for both masses.\nformula_17\nThe equations are then generalized into matrix form.\nformula_18\nwhere formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21\nThe values of k and m can be substituted into the matrices.\nformula_22\nThese matrices can now be plugged into the general solution.\nformula_23\nThe determinant of this matrix yields a quadratic equation.\nformula_24\nDepending on the starting point of the masses, this system has 2 possible frequencies (or a combination of the two). If the masses are started with their displacements in the same direction, the frequency is that of a single mass system, because the middle spring is never extended. If the two masses are started in opposite directions, the second, faster frequency is the frequency of the system.\nMore special cases are the coupled oscillators where energy alternates between two forms of oscillation. Well-known is the Wilberforce pendulum, where the oscillation alternates between the elongation of a vertical spring and the rotation of an object at the end of that spring.\nCoupled oscillators are a common description of two related, but different phenomena. One case is where both oscillations affect each other mutually, which usually leads to the occurrence of a single, entrained oscillation state, where both oscillate with a \"compromise frequency\". Another case is where one external oscillation affects an internal oscillation, but is not affected by this. In this case the regions of synchronization, known as Arnold Tongues, can lead to highly complex phenomena as for instance chaotic dynamics.\nSmall oscillation approximation.\nIn physics, a system with a set of conservative forces and an equilibrium point can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator near equilibrium. An example of this is the Lennard-Jones potential, where the potential is given by:\nformula_25\nThe equilibrium points of the function are then found:\nformula_26\nThe second derivative is then found, and used to be the effective potential constant:\nformula_27\nThe system will undergo oscillations near the equilibrium point. The force that creates these oscillations is derived from the effective potential constant above:\nformula_28\nThis differential equation can be re-written in the form of a simple harmonic oscillator:\nformula_29\nThus, the frequency of small oscillations is:\nformula_30\nOr, in general form\nformula_31\nThis approximation can be better understood by looking at the potential curve of the system. By thinking of the potential curve as a hill, in which, if one placed a ball anywhere on the curve, the ball would roll down with the slope of the potential curve. This is true due to the relationship between potential energy and force.\nformula_32\nBy thinking of the potential in this way, one will see that at any local minimum there is a \"well\" in which the ball would roll back and forth (oscillate) between formula_33 and formula_34. This approximation is also useful for thinking of Kepler orbits.\nContinuous system \u2013 waves.\nAs the number of degrees of freedom becomes arbitrarily large, a system approaches continuity; examples include a string or the surface of a body of water. Such systems have (in the classical limit) an infinite number of normal modes and their oscillations occur in the form of waves that can characteristically propagate.\nMathematics.\nThe mathematics of oscillation deals with the quantification of the amount that a sequence or function tends to move between extremes. There are several related notions: oscillation of a sequence of real numbers, oscillation of a real-valued function at a point, and oscillation of a function on an interval (or open set).\nExamples.\nMechanical.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nElectrical.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOptical.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBiological.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHuman.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomic and social.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate and geophysics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22523", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22523", "title": "Athletics (baseball)", "text": "Major League Baseball franchise in West Sacramento, California\nThe Athletics (often referred to as the A's) are an American professional baseball team based in West Sacramento, California. The Athletics compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West Division. The team plays its home games at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento, and is planning to relocate to the Las Vegas metropolitan area in time for the 2028 season. The franchise's nine World Series championships, fifteen pennants, and seventeen division titles are the second most in the AL after the New York Yankees. \nOne of the AL's eight charter franchises, the team was founded in Philadelphia in 1901 as the Philadelphia Athletics. They won three World Series championships in 1910, 1911, and 1913, and back-to-back titles in 1929 and 1930. The team's owner and manager for its first 50 years was Connie Mack, and Hall of Fame players included Chief Bender, Frank \"Home Run\" Baker, Jimmie Foxx, and Lefty Grove. The team left Philadelphia for Kansas City, Missouri in 1955 and became the Kansas City Athletics before moving to Oakland, California in 1968 and becoming the Oakland Athletics. The Athletics played their home games at the Oakland Coliseum from 1968 until 2024. Nicknamed the \"Swingin' A's\", under owner Charlie O. Finley they won three consecutive World Series in 1972, 1973, and 1974, led by players including Vida Blue, Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, and Rollie Fingers. After being sold by Finley to Walter A. Haas Jr., the team won three consecutive pennants and the 1989 World Series behind the \"Bash Brothers\", Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, as well as Hall of Famers Dennis Eckersley and Rickey Henderson and manager Tony La Russa. In 2002, the Athletics set an American League record for most consecutive wins in a season with twenty, marking the pioneering application of sabermetrics in baseball. The streak record was later broken in 2017 by the Cleveland Indians.\nFrom 1901 through the end of 2025, the franchise's overall win\u2013loss record is 9,405\u20139,945\u201387 (), and a 76\u201386 () record since moving to West Sacramento in 2025.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Athletics Major League Baseball franchise spans from 1901 to the present day, having begun in Philadelphia before moving to Kansas City in 1955 and then to its home in Oakland, California, in 1968. The A's made their Bay Area debut on Wednesday, April 17, 1968, with a 4\u20131 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at the Coliseum, in front of an opening-night crowd of 50,164. With four locations, the A's have had the most home cities of any MLB team.\nTeam name and \"A\" logo.\nThe Athletics' name originated in the term \"Athletic Club\" for local gentlemen's clubs\u2014dates to 1860 when an amateur baseball team, the Athletic (Club) of Philadelphia, was formed. The team later turned professional in 1875, becoming a charter member of the National League in 1876, but were expelled from the N.L. after one season. A later version of the Athletics played in the American Association from 1882 to 1891.\nElephant mascot.\nAfter New York Giants manager John McGraw told reporters that Philadelphia manufacturer Benjamin Shibe, who owned the controlling interest in the new team, had a \"white elephant on his hands\", team manager Connie Mack defiantly adopted the white elephant as the team mascot, and presented McGraw with a stuffed toy elephant at the start of the 1905 World Series. McGraw and Mack had known each other for years, and McGraw accepted it graciously. By , the A's were wearing an elephant logo on their sweaters, and in 1918 it turned up on the regular uniform jersey for the first time.\nIn 1963, when the A's were located in Kansas City, then-owner Charlie Finley changed the team mascot from an elephant to a mule, the state animal of Missouri. This is rumored to have been done by Finley in order to appeal to fans from the region who were predominantly Democrats at the time. (Traditionally, the symbol for the Republican Party is an elephant, while the Democratic Party's symbol is a donkey.) From , the Athletics' 21st season in Oakland, through their final season in Oakland in 2024, an illustration of an elephant adorned the left sleeve of the A's home and road uniforms. Ahead of the team's first season in Sacramento, the elephant patch was removed and replaced with one depicting Sacramento's Tower Bridge.\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, the on-field costumed incarnation of the A's elephant mascot went by the name Harry Elephante, a play on the name of singer Harry Belafonte. In 1997, he became Stomper, debuting Opening Night on April 2.\nUniforms.\nOver the seasons, the Athletics' uniforms have paid homage to their amateur forebears. Until 1954, when the uniforms had \"Athletics\" spelled out in script across the front, the team's name never appeared on either home or road uniforms. Furthermore, neither \"Philadelphia\" nor the letter \"P\" appeared on the uniform or cap. The Philadelphia uniform had only a script \"A\" on the left front, and likewise the cap usually had the same \"A\" on it. In the early days of the American League, the standings listed the club as \"Athletic\" rather than \"Philadelphia\", in keeping with the old tradition. Eventually, the city name came to be used for the team, as with the other major league clubs.\nAfter buying the team in 1960, owner Charles O. Finley introduced road uniforms with \"Kansas City\" printed on them, with an interlocking \"KC\" on the cap. Upon moving to Oakland, the \"A\" cap emblem was restored, and in 1970 an \"apostrophe-s\" was added to the cap and uniform emblem to reflect that Finley was officially changing the team's name to the \"A's\".\nWhile in Kansas City, Finley changed the team's colors from their traditional red, white and blue to kelly green and gold. It was here that he began experimenting with dramatic uniforms to match these bright colors, such as gold sleeveless tops with green undershirts and gold pants. The uniform innovations increased after the team's move to Oakland, which came with the introduction of polyester pullover uniforms. \nDuring their dynasty years in the 1970s, the A's had dozens of uniform combinations with jerseys and pants in all three team colors, and never wore the traditional gray on the road, instead wearing green or gold, which helped to contribute to their nickname of \"The Swingin' A's\". After the team's sale to the Haas family, the team changed its primary color to a more subdued forest green in 1982 and began a move back to more traditional uniforms.\nThe 2023 team wore home uniforms with \"Athletics\" spelled out in script writing and road uniforms with \"Oakland\" spelled out in script writing, with the cap logo consisting of the traditional \"A\" with \"apostrophe-s\". The home cap, which was also the team's road cap until 1992, is forest green with a gold bill and white lettering. This design was also the basis of their batting helmet, which is used both at home and on the road. The road cap, which initially debuted in 1993, is all-forest green. The first version had the white \"A's\" wordmark before it was changed to gold the following season. An all-forest green batting helmet was paired with this cap until 2008. In 2014, the \"A's\" wordmark returned to white but added gold trim.\nFrom 1994 until 2013, the A's wore green alternate jerseys with the word \"Athletics\" in gold, for both road and home games.\nDuring the 2000s, the Athletics introduced black as one of their colors. They began wearing a black alternate jersey with \"Athletics\" written in green. After a brief discontinuance, the A's brought back the black jersey, this time with \"Athletics\" written in white with gold highlights. The cap paired with this jersey is all-black, initially with the green and white-trimmed \"A's\" wordmark, before switching to a white and gold-trimmed \"A's\" wordmark. Commercially popular but rarely chosen as the alternate by players, the black uniform was retired in 2011 in favor of a gold alternate jersey.\nThe gold alternate has \"A's\" in green trimmed in white on the left chest. With the exception of several road games during the 2011 season, the Athletics' gold uniforms were used as the designated home alternates. A green version of their gold alternates was introduced for the 2014 season, serving as a replacement to the previous green alternates. The new green alternates featured the piping, \"A's\" and lettering in white with gold trim.\nIn 2018, as part of the franchise's 50th anniversary since the move to Oakland, the A's wore a kelly green alternate uniform with \"Oakland\" in white with gold trim, and was paired with an all-kelly green cap. This set was later worn with an alternate kelly green helmet with gold visor. This uniform eventually supplanted the gold alternates by 2019, and in 2022, after the forest green alternate was retired, it became the team's only active alternate uniform.\nThe nickname \"A's\" has long been used interchangeably with \"Athletics\", dating to the team's early days when headline writers used it to shorten the name. From 1972 through 1980, the team name was officially \"Oakland A's\", although the Commissioner's Trophy, given out annually to the winner of baseball's World Series, still listed the team's name as the \"Oakland Athletics\" on the gold-plated pennant representing the Oakland franchise. According to Bill Libby's Book, \"Charlie O and the Angry A's\", owner Charlie O. Finley banned the word \"Athletics\" from the club's name because he felt that name was too closely associated with former Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack, and he wanted the name \"Oakland A's\" to become just as closely associated with him. The name also vaguely suggested the name of the old minor league Oakland Oaks, which were alternatively called the \"Acorns\". New owner Walter Haas restored the official name to \"Athletics\" in 1981, but retained the nickname \"A's\" for marketing. At first, the word \"Athletics\" was restored only to the club's logo, underneath the much larger stylized-\"A\" that had come to represent the team since the early days. By 1987, however, the word returned, in script lettering, to the front of the team's jerseys.\nAfter the team's departure from Oakland, the existing uniform set was mostly retained aside from the wordmark on the road uniform being changed from \"Oakland\" to \"Athletics\". The gold alternate uniform also returned after it was last worn in 2018. From 2025 to 2027, while the team temporarily plays its home games in West Sacramento, all of its uniforms feature the \"Athletics\" wordmark, with no mention of a home city. However, all uniforms feature a green logo patch on one sleeve depicting one of the towers of the Sacramento Tower Bridge and \"Sacramento\" written under it in yellow text to commemorate the team's temporary home. On the other sleeve, an ad patch sponsoring the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (\"LAS Vegas\" tourism logo) was added; both patches are worn interchangeably depending on a player's handedness, with the ad patch typically the more visible mark when a player bats.\nThe Athletics updated their gold alternate uniform with a script \"Sacramento\" on the chest, which they would wear starting in 2026. They plan to wear the uniform every Friday home game, with the option to wear them on other days as well. \nPrior to the mid-2010s, the A's had a long-standing tradition of wearing white cleats team-wide (in line with the standard MLB practice that required all uniformed team members to wear a base cleat color), which dated to the Finley ownership. Since the mid-2010s, however, MLB has gradually relaxed its shoe color rules, and several A's players began wearing cleats in non-white colors, such as Jed Lowrie's green cleats.\nPlanned relocation to Las Vegas.\nFollowing the California Golden Seals' relocation to Cleveland in 1976, the Golden State Warriors' move across the bay to San Francisco in 2019, and the Oakland Raiders' move to the Las Vegas metropolitan area in 2020, the Athletics were left as the sole remaining major professional sports team in Oakland. However, on April 20, 2023, the Athletics announced they had entered a land purchase agreement with Red Rock Resort located near Las Vegas to build a new ballpark on the Las Vegas Strip, finalizing their plans to relocate to the Las Vegas area.&lt;ref name=\"SF Gate/AP New Stadium\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2023, the Athletics switched their planned location in the Las Vegas area to the site of the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel and casino, which was subsequently demolished in October 2024, to construct a 33,000-seat partially retractable ballpark and a 1,500-room hotel and casino. By June 15, 2023, Nevada governor Joe Lombardo signed an MLB stadium funding bill known as SB1 into law after the bill was approved by the Nevada Legislature, and the Athletics officially announced they would begin the relocation process.\nOn November 16, 2023, the Athletics' move to Las Vegas was unanimously approved by MLB team owners. According to the team, the new Las Vegas ballpark will not be completed until 2028. The lease to the Oakland Coliseum expired after the 2024 season. Before the scheduled move to Las Vegas in 2028, the team is playing in West Sacramento, California, at Sutter Health Park (home of the San Francisco Giants' Triple-A affiliate, the Sacramento River Cats) for the 2025\u20132027 seasons (with an option for the 2028 season if necessary). While in West Sacramento the team is referred to as simply the \"A's\" and \"Athletics,\" with no city name attached. The relocation marks the first move by an MLB team since the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, D.C., becoming the Washington Nationals in 2005.\nThe Athletics are scheduled to play in Las Vegas for the first time in 2026, with six games scheduled in June at Las Vegas Ballpark.\nRivalries.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nThe Bay Bridge Series was the name of a series of games played between the A's and San Francisco Giants of the National League. The series took its name from the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge which links the cities of Oakland and San Francisco. Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants was considered by some a friendly one with mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to White Sox\u2013Cubs, or Yankees\u2013Mets games where animosity runs high. Hats displaying both teams on the cap were sold from vendors at the games, and once in a while the teams would both dress in original team uniforms from the early era of baseball.\nThe series was also sometimes referred to as the \"BART Series\" for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland and San Francisco. However, the name was never popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and had fallen out of favor. Bay Area locals almost exclusively referred to the rivalry as the \"Battle of the Bay\".\nOriginally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of spring training and immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the 1989 World Series in which the Athletics won their most recent championship and the first time the teams had met since they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area (and the first time they had met since the A's also defeated the Giants in the 1913 World Series). Later it referred to games played between the teams during the regular season from the commencement of interleague play in 1997 through the 2024 regular season. At the conclusion of the rivalry, due to the Athletics relocating out of the Bay Area, the Athletics had won 76 games and the Giants had won 72 contests.\nThe A's also had the edge on the Giants in terms of overall postseason appearances (21\u201313), division titles (17\u201310) and World Series titles (4\u20133) since both teams had moved to the Bay Area, even though the Giants franchise moved there a decade earlier than the A's did.\nOn March 24, 2018, the Oakland A's announced that for the Sunday, March 25, 2018, exhibition game against the San Francisco Giants, A's fans would be charged $30 for parking and Giants fans would be charged $50. However, the A's stated that Giants fans could receive $20 off if they shout \"Go A's\" at the parking gates.\nIn 2018, the Athletics and Giants started battling for a \"Bay Bridge\" Trophy made from steel taken from the old east span of the Bay Bridge, which was taken down after the new span was opened in 2013. The A's won the inaugural season with the trophy, allowing them to place their logo atop its Bay Bridge stand. When the A's left Oakland, the Giants had won the trophy 4 times, to the A's 3.\nFollowing the Athletics' temporary relocation to West Sacramento in 2025, the series began to be referred to as the \"Interstate 80 Series\", after the highway connecting San Francisco with Sacramento.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nThe A's have held a rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels since their relocation to California in 1968, and the charter membership of both teams in the AL West in 1969. The A's and Angels have often competed for the division title. The peak of the rivalry was during the early part of the millennium as both teams were perennial contenders. During the season, the A's famous \"Moneyball\" tactics led them to a league record 20-game winning streak, knocking the Angels out of the first seed in the division. The A's finished 4 games ahead while the Angels secured the Wild Card berth. Despite the 103-win season for Oakland, they lost to the underdog Minnesota Twins in the ALDS. The Angels beat the heavily favored New York Yankees, then beat the Twins, and then won the 2002 World Series. During the season, the teams were tied for wins headed into the final week of September with the last three games being played in Oakland against the Angels. Both teams were battling to secure the division championship. Oakland lost two of the three games to the Angels, and they were eliminated from the playoff hunt. The Angels were swept in the playoffs by the eventual champion Boston Red Sox. The Athletics lead the series 541\u2013491, and the two teams have yet to meet in the postseason.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (historic).\nThe City Series was the name of baseball games played between the Philadelphia Athletics and the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League, that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas City in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. Since the introduction of interleague play in 1997, the teams have since faced each other during the regular season (with the first games taking place in 2003) but the rivalry had effectively died in the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies in inter-league play at the Oakland Coliseum, the Athletics did not bother to mark the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.\nThe first City Series was held in 1883 between the Phillies and the American Association Philadelphia Athletics. When the Athletics first joined the American League, the two teams played each other in a spring and fall series. No City Series was held in 1901 and 1902 because of legal warring between the National League and American League.\nAchievements.\nHall of Famers.\nAthletics Hall of Famers\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\nPhiladelphia Athletics\nKansas City Athletics\nOakland Athletics\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFord C. Frick Award recipients.\nOakland Athletics Ford C. Frick Award recipients\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRetired numbers.\nThe Athletics have retired six numbers; additionally, Walter A. Haas, Jr., owner of the team from 1980 until his death in 1995, was honored by the retirement of the letter \"A\". Of the six players with retired numbers, five were retired for their play with the Athletics and one, 42, was universally retired by Major League Baseball when they honored the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color barrier. No A's player from the Philadelphia era has his number retired by the organization. Though Jackson and Hunter played small portions of their careers in Kansas City, no player that played the majority of his years in the Kansas City era has his number retired either. The A's have retired only the numbers of Hall-of-Famers who played large portions of their careers in Oakland. The Athletics have all of the numbers of the Hall-of-Fame players from the Philadelphia Athletics displayed at their stadium, as well as all of the years that the Philadelphia Athletics won World Championships (1910, 1911, 1913, 1929, and 1930). Dave Stewart was about to have his #34 jersey retired by the Athletics in 2020, but the ceremony was postponed until further notice, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions were raised if there would be a formal ceremony after no news about a reschedule happened in 2021 before it was announced in April 2022 that Stewart would have his jersey retired on September 11, 2022. Stewart broke the A's tradition in that his number was a re-retirement, as well as his not being in the Hall of Fame.\nAthletics Hall of Fame.\nOn August 14, 2018, the team publicly announced the creation of a team Hall of Fame, complete with the first seven names to be inducted. On September 5, the Athletics held a ceremony to induct seven members into the inaugural class. Each member was honored with an unveiling of a painting in their likeness and a bright green jacket. Hunter, who died in 1999, was represented by his widow, while Finley, who died in 1996, was represented by his son. If the team ever gets a new stadium, a physical site will be designated for the Hall of Fame, as the Coliseum does not have enough space for a full-fledged exhibit. In August 2021, it was announced that players Sal Bando, Eric Chavez, Joe Rudi, director of player development Keith Lieppman, and clubhouse manager Steve \"Vuc\" Vucinich would be part of the class of 2022; in November 2021, Ray Fosse, who had died the previous month, was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame. The 2023 &amp; 2024 classes were inducted in August of each respective year.\nBay Area Sports Hall of Fame.\n17 members of the Athletics organization have been honored with induction into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame.\nPhiladelphia Baseball Wall of Fame.\nThe Athletics have all of the numbers of the Hall-of-Fame players from the Philadelphia Athletics displayed at their stadium, as well as all of the years that the Philadelphia Athletics won World Championships (1910, 1911, 1913, 1929, and 1930).\nAlso, from 1978 to 2003 (except 1983), the Philadelphia Phillies inducted one former Athletic (and one former Phillie) each year into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame at the then-existing Veterans Stadium. 25 Athletics have been honored. In March 2004, after Veterans Stadium was replaced by the new Citizens Bank Park, the Athletics' plaques were relocated to the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, and a single plaque listing all of the A's inductees was attached to a statue of Connie Mack that is located across the street from Citizens Bank Park.\nSeason-by-season records.\nThe records of the Athletics' last ten seasons in Major League Baseball are listed below.\nMinor league affiliations.\nThe Athletics farm system consists of six minor league affiliates.\nRadio and television.\nAs of the 2020 season, the Athletics have had 14 radio homes. The Athletics' flagship radio station is KSTE and the team has a free live 24/7 exclusive A's station branded as \"A's Cast\" to stream the radio broadcast within the Athletics market and other A's programming via iHeartRadio. Going into the 2020 season, the Athletics had a deal with TuneIn for A's Cast and no flagship radio station in the Bay Area; due to the COVID-19 pandemic keeping fans from attending games, the team changed their plans and named KNEW as flagship. The announcing team features Ken Korach and Johnny Doskow.\nTelevision coverage is exclusively on NBC Sports California. Some A's games air on an alternate feed of NBCS, called NBCS Plus, if the main channel shows a Sacramento Kings or San Jose Sharks game at the same time. On TV, Jenny Cavnar covers play-by-play, and Dallas Braden provides color commentary. Some games would feature Chris Caray on play-by-play; Caray is a fourth-generation baseball announcer that included great-grandfather Harry Caray, grandfather Skip Caray, and father Chip Caray.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22526", "revid": "712163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22526", "title": "Organometallic chemistry", "text": "Study of organic compounds containing metal(s)\nOrganometallic chemistry is the study of organometallic compounds, chemical compounds containing at least one chemical bond between a carbon atom of an organic molecule and a metal, including alkali, alkaline earth, and transition metals, and sometimes broadened to include metalloids like boron, silicon, and selenium, as well. Aside from bonds to organyl fragments or molecules, bonds to 'inorganic' carbon, like carbon monoxide (metal carbonyls), cyanide, or carbide, are generally considered to be organometallic as well. Some related compounds such as transition metal hydrides and metal phosphine complexes are often included in discussions of organometallic compounds, though strictly speaking, they are not necessarily organometallic. The related but distinct term \"metalorganic compound\" refers to metal-containing compounds lacking direct metal-carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands. Metal \u03b2-diketonates, alkoxides, dialkylamides, and metal phosphine complexes are representative members of this class. The field of organometallic chemistry combines aspects of traditional inorganic and organic chemistry.\nOrganometallic compounds are widely used both stoichiometrically in research and industrial chemical reactions, as well as in the role of catalysts to increase the rates of such reactions (e.g., as in uses of homogeneous catalysis), where target molecules include polymers, pharmaceuticals, and many other types of practical products.\nOrganometallic compounds.\nOrganometallic compounds are distinguished by the prefix \"organo-\" (e.g., organopalladium compounds), and include all compounds which contain a bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom of an organyl group. In addition to the traditional metals (alkali metals, alkali earth metals, transition metals, and post transition metals), lanthanides, actinides, semimetals, and the elements boron, silicon, arsenic, and selenium are considered to form organometallic compounds. Examples of organometallic compounds include Gilman reagents, which contain lithium and copper, and Grignard reagents, which contain magnesium. Boron-containing organometallic compounds are often the result of hydroboration and carboboration reactions. Tetracarbonyl nickel and ferrocene are examples of organometallic compounds containing transition metals. Other examples of organometallic compounds include organolithium compounds such as \"n\"-butyllithium (n-BuLi), organozinc compounds such as diethylzinc (Et2Zn), organotin compounds such as tributyltin hydride (Bu3SnH), organoborane compounds such as triethylborane (Et3B), and organoaluminium compounds such as trimethylaluminium (Me3Al).\nA naturally occurring organometallic complex is methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12), which contains a cobalt-methyl bond. This complex, along with other biologically relevant complexes are often discussed within the subfield of bioorganometallic chemistry.\nDistinction from coordination compounds with organic ligands.\nMany complexes feature coordination bonds between a metal and organic ligands. Complexes where the organic ligands bind the metal through a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen are considered coordination compounds (e.g., heme A and Fe(acac)3). However, if any of the ligands form a direct metal-carbon (M-C) bond, then the complex is considered to be organometallic. Although the IUPAC has not formally defined the term, some chemists use the term \"metalorganic\" to describe any coordination compound containing an organic ligand regardless of the presence of a direct M-C bond.\nThe status of compounds in which the canonical anion has a negative charge that is shared between (delocalized) a carbon atom and an atom more electronegative than carbon (e.g. enolates) may vary with the nature of the anionic moiety, the metal ion, and possibly the medium. In the absence of direct structural evidence for a carbon\u2013metal bond, such compounds are not considered to be organometallic. For instance, lithium enolates often contain only Li-O bonds and are not organometallic, while zinc enolates (Reformatsky reagents) contain both Zn-O and Zn-C bonds, and are organometallic in nature.\nStructure and properties.\nThe metal-carbon bond in organometallic compounds is generally highly covalent. For highly electropositive elements, such as lithium and sodium, the carbon ligand exhibits carbanionic character, but free carbon-based anions are extremely rare, an example being cyanide.\nMost organometallic compounds are solids at room temperature, however some are liquids such as methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, or even volatile liquids such as nickel tetracarbonyl. Many organometallic compounds are air sensitive. Some organometallic compounds such as triethylaluminium are pyrophoric and will ignite on contact with air.\nConcepts and techniques.\nAs in other areas of chemistry, electron counting is useful for organizing organometallic chemistry. The 18-electron rule is helpful in predicting the stabilities of organometallic complexes, for example metal carbonyls and metal hydrides. The 18e rule has two representative electron counting models, ionic and neutral (also known as covalent) ligand models, respectively. The hapticity of a metal-ligand complex, can influence the electron count. Hapticity (\u03b7, lowercase Greek eta), describes the number of contiguous ligands coordinated to a metal. For example, ferrocene, [(\u03b75-C5H5)2Fe], has two cyclopentadienyl ligands giving a hapticity of 5, where all five carbon atoms of the C5H5 ligand bond equally and contribute one electron to the iron center. Ligands that bind non-contiguous atoms are denoted the Greek letter kappa, \u03ba. Chelating \u03ba2-acetate is an example. The covalent bond classification method identifies three classes of ligands, X,L, and Z; which are based on the electron donating interactions of the ligand. Many organometallic compounds do not follow the 18e rule. The metal atoms in organometallic compounds are frequently described by their d electron count and oxidation state. These concepts can be used to help predict their reactivity and preferred geometry. Chemical bonding and reactivity in organometallic compounds is often discussed from the perspective of the isolobal principle.\nA wide variety of physical techniques are used to determine the structure, composition, and properties of organometallic compounds. X-ray diffraction is a particularly important technique that can locate the positions of atoms within a solid compound, providing a detailed description of its structure. Other techniques like infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are also frequently used to obtain information on the structure and bonding of organometallic compounds. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy is a common technique used to obtain information on the electronic structure of organometallic compounds. It is also used monitor the progress of organometallic reactions, as well as determine their kinetics. The dynamics of organometallic compounds can be studied using dynamic NMR spectroscopy. Other notable techniques include X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.\nDue to their high reactivity towards oxygen and moisture, organometallic compounds often must be handled using air-free techniques. Air-free handling of organometallic compounds typically requires the use of laboratory apparatuses such as a glovebox or Schlenk line.\nHistory.\nEarly developments in organometallic chemistry include Louis Claude Cadet's synthesis of methyl arsenic compounds related to cacodyl, William Christopher Zeise's platinum-ethylene complex, Edward Frankland's discovery of diethyl- and dimethylzinc, Ludwig Mond's discovery of Ni(CO)4, and Victor Grignard's organomagnesium compounds. (Although not always acknowledged as an organometallic compound, Prussian blue, a mixed-valence iron-cyanide complex, was first prepared in 1706 by paint maker Johann Jacob Diesbach as the first coordination polymer and synthetic material containing a metal-carbon bond.) The abundant and diverse products from coal and petroleum led to Ziegler\u2013Natta, Fischer\u2013Tropsch, hydroformylation catalysis which employ CO, H2, and alkenes as feedstocks and ligands.\nRecognition of organometallic chemistry as a distinct subfield culminated in the Nobel Prizes to Ernst Fischer and Geoffrey Wilkinson for work on metallocenes. In 2005, Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock shared the Nobel Prize for metal-catalyzed olefin metathesis.\nScope.\nSubspecialty areas of organometallic chemistry include:\nIndustrial applications.\nOrganometallic compounds find wide use in commercial reactions, both as homogenous catalysts and as stoichiometric reagents. For instance, organolithium, organomagnesium, and organoaluminium compounds, examples of which are highly basic and highly reducing, are useful stoichiometrically but also catalyze many polymerization reactions.\nAlmost all processes involving carbon monoxide rely on catalysts, notable examples being described as carbonylations. The production of acetic acid from methanol and carbon monoxide is catalyzed via metal carbonyl complexes in the Monsanto process and Cativa process. Most synthetic aldehydes are produced via hydroformylation. The bulk of the synthetic alcohols, at least those larger than ethanol, are produced by hydrogenation of hydroformylation-derived aldehydes. Similarly, the Wacker process is used in the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde.\nAlmost all industrial processes involving alkene-derived polymers rely on organometallic catalysts. The world's polyethylene and polypropylene are produced via both heterogeneously via Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysis and homogeneously, e.g., via constrained geometry catalysts.\nMost processes involving hydrogen rely on metal-based catalysts. Whereas bulk hydrogenations (e.g., margarine production) rely on heterogeneous catalysts, for the production of fine chemicals such hydrogenations rely on soluble (homogenous) organometallic complexes or involve organometallic intermediates. Organometallic complexes allow these hydrogenations to be effected asymmetrically.\nMany semiconductors are produced from trimethylgallium, trimethylindium, trimethylaluminium, and trimethylantimony. These volatile compounds are decomposed along with ammonia, arsine, phosphine and related hydrides on a heated substrate via metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) process in the production of light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\nOrganometallic reactions.\nOrganometallic compounds undergo several important reactions:\nThe synthesis of many organic molecules are facilitated by organometallic complexes. Sigma-bond metathesis is a synthetic method for forming new carbon-carbon sigma bonds. Sigma-bond metathesis is typically used with early transition-metal complexes that are in their highest oxidation state. Using transition-metals that are in their highest oxidation state prevents other reactions from occurring, such as oxidative addition. In addition to sigma-bond metathesis, olefin metathesis is used to synthesize various carbon-carbon pi bonds. Neither sigma-bond metathesis or olefin metathesis change the oxidation state of the metal. Many other methods are used to form new carbon-carbon bonds, including beta-hydride elimination and insertion reactions.\nCatalysis.\nOrganometallic complexes are commonly used in catalysis. Major industrial processes include hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hydrocyanation, olefin metathesis, alkene polymerization, alkene oligomerization, hydrocarboxylation, methanol carbonylation, and hydroformylation. The catalytically active organometallic species are often generated in situ starting from commercially available metal salts. Organometallic intermediates are also invoked in many heterogeneous catalysis processes, analogous to those listed above. Additionally, organometallic intermediates are assumed for Fischer\u2013Tropsch process.\nOrganometallic complexes are commonly used in fine chemical synthesis as well, especially in cross-coupling reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds, e.g. Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, Buchwald-Hartwig amination for producing aryl amines from aryl halides, and Sonogashira coupling, etc.\nOrganometallic species are also involved in photoredox catalysis, although not on a commercial scale.\nEnvironmental concerns.\nNatural and contaminant organometallic compounds are found in the environment. Some that are remnants of human use, such as organolead and organomercury compounds, are toxicity hazards. Tetraethyllead was prepared for use as a gasoline additive but has fallen into disuse because of lead's toxicity. Its replacements are other organometallic compounds, such as ferrocene and methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT). The organoarsenic compound roxarsone is a controversial animal feed additive. In 2006, approximately one million kilograms of it were produced in the U.S alone. Organotin compounds were once widely used in anti-fouling paints but have since been banned due to environmental concerns.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Common onomatopoeias in English include animal noises such as \"oink\", \"meow\", \"roar\", and \"chirp\", among other sounds such as \"beep\" or \"hiccup\".\nOnomatopoeia can differ by language: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system. Hence, the sound of a clock may be expressed variously across languages: as \"\" in English, in Spanish and Italian (see photo), in Mandarin, in Japanese, or in Hindi, Urdu, and Bengali.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe word \"onomatopoeia\", with rarer spelling variants like \"onomatopeia\" and \"onomatop\u0153ia\", is an English word from the Ancient Greek compound \u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1, \"onomatopoi\u00eda\", meaning 'name-making', composed of \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1, \"\u00f3noma\", meaning \"name\"; and \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ad\u03c9, \"poi\u00e9\u014d\", meaning \"making\". It is pronounced . Words that imitate sounds can thus be said to be onomatopoeic, onomatopoetic, imitative, or echoic.\nUses.\nIn the case of a frog croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: Ancient Greek (only in Aristophanes' comic play \"The Frogs\") probably for marsh frogs; English \"ribbit\" for species of frog found in North America; English verb \"croak\" for the common frog.\nSome other very common English-language examples are \"hiccup\", \"zoom\", \"bang\", \"beep\", \"moo\", and \"splash\". Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: \"honk\" or \"beep-beep\" for the horn of an automobile, and \"vroom\" or \"brum\" for the internal combustion engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity, the word \"zap\" is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects of interference).\nHuman sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia, as when \"mwah\" is used to represent a kiss.\nFor animal sounds, words like \"quack\" (duck), \"moo\" (cow), \"bark\" or \"woof\" (dog), \"roar\" (lion), \"meow\"/\"miaow\" or \"purr\" (cat), \"cluck\" (chicken) and \"baa\" (sheep) are typically used in English (both as nouns and as verbs).\nSome languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure. This may evolve into a new word, up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia. One example is the English word \"bleat\" for sheep noise: in medieval times it was pronounced approximately as \"blairt\" (but without an R-component), or \"blet\" with the vowel drawled, which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation.\nAn example of the opposite case is \"cuckoo\", which, due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries, has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in Anglo-Saxon times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word \"furrow\".\n\"Verba dicendi\" ('words of saying') are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and ideophones into grammar.\nSometimes, things are named from the sounds they make. In English, for example, there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes: the zip (in the UK) or zipper (in the U.S.) Many birds are named after their calls, such as the bobwhite quail, the weero, the morepork, the killdeer, chickadees and jays, the cuckoo, the chiffchaff, the whooping crane, the whip-poor-will, and the kookaburra. In Tamil and Malayalam, the word for crow is . This practice is especially common in certain languages such as M\u0101ori, and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages.\nCross-cultural differences.\nAlthough a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures, it is often expressed through the use of different phonetic strings in different languages. For example, the \"snip\"of a pair of scissors is ' in Italian, ' in Spanish, ' or ' in Portuguese, ' in modern Greek, ' in Albanian, and ' in Hindi. Similarly, the \"honk\" of a car's horn is ' (Han: ) in Mandarin, ' in French, ' in Japanese, ' in Korean, ' in Norwegian, ' in Portuguese and ' in Vietnamese.\nOnomatopoeic effect without onomatopoeic words.\nAn onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of alliteration and consonance alone, without using any onomatopoeic words. The most famous example is the phrase \"furrow followed free\" in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The words \"followed\" and \"free\" are not onomatopoeic in themselves, but in conjunction with \"furrow\" they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship. Similarly, alliteration has been used in the line \"\"as the surf surged up the sun swept shore...\"\" to recreate the sound of breaking waves in the poem \"I, She and the Sea\".\nComics and advertising.\nComic strips and comic books make extensive use of onomatopoeia, often being visually integrated into the images, so that the drawing style emphasizes the sound. Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer-artist Roy Crane (1901\u20131977), the creator of \"Captain Easy\" and \"Buz Sawyer\":\nIt was Crane who pioneered the use of onomatopoeic sound effects in comics, adding \"bam,\" \"pow\" and \"wham\" to what had previously been an almost entirely visual vocabulary. Crane had fun with this, tossing in an occasional \"ker-splash\" or \"lickety-wop\" along with what would become the more standard effects. Words as well as images became vehicles for carrying along his increasingly fast-paced storylines.\nIn 2002, DC Comics introduced a villain named Onomatopoeia, an athlete, martial artist, and weapons expert, who is known to verbally speak sounds (i.e., to voice onomatopoeic words such as \"crash\" and \"snap\" out loud to accompany the applicable event).\nAdvertising uses onomatopoeia for mnemonic purposes, so that consumers will remember their products, as in Alka-Seltzer's \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is!\" jingle, recorded in two different versions (big band and rock) by Sammy Davis Jr.\nRice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia) make a \"snap, crackle, pop\" when one pours on milk. During the 1930s, the illustrator Vernon Grant developed Snap, Crackle and Pop as gnome-like mascots for the Kellogg Company.\nSounds appear in road safety advertisements: \"clunk click, every trip\" (click the seatbelt on after clunking the car door closed; UK campaign) or \"click, clack, front and back\" (click, clack of connecting the seat belts; AU campaign) or \"make it click\" (click of the seatbelt; McDonalds campaign) or \"click it or ticket\" (click of the connecting seat belt, with the implied penalty of a traffic ticket for not using a seat belt; US DOT (Department of Transportation) campaign).\nThe sound of the container opening and closing gives Tic Tac its name.\nManner imitation.\nIn many of the world's languages, onomatopoeic-like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely auditive. Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts. For instance, Japanese is used to reflect an object's state of disarray or separation, and is the onomatopoetic form of absolute silence (used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of crickets chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room, or someone coughing). In Albanian, is used to describe someone who is hasty. It is used in English as well with terms like \"bling\", which describes the glinting of light on things like gold, chrome or precious stones. In Japanese, is used for glittery things.\nIn linguistics.\nA key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent, as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound. It is not possible to determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words, these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds does not necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning. An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with \"sn-\". Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (\"sneeze\", \"snot\", \"snore\"). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.\nIn linguistics, onomatopoeia is described as the connection, or symbolism, of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language, usually out of mimicry of a sound. It is a figure of speech, in a sense. Considered a vague term on its own, there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia. In one manner, it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non-vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language, like the hum of a bee being imitated with a \"buzz\" sound. In another sense, it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely.\nOnomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context, not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process. The symbolic properties of a sound in a word, or a phoneme, is related to a sound in an environment, and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory, hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound. Depending on a language's connection to a sound's meaning, that language's onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally. For example, a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds, which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry than a language like Japanese, which overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language.\nEvolution of language.\nIn ancient Greek philosophy, onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was: it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us. Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this. Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language.\nRole in early language acquisition.\nWhen first exposed to sound and communication, humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear, whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds. Early on in development, an infant will vary his/her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language(s) most heavily spoken in their environment, which may be called \"tame\" onomatopoeia, and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce, or \"wild\" onomatopoeia. As one begins to acquire one's first language, the proportion of \"wild\" onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring.\nDuring the native language acquisition period, it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild-speech features to which they are exposed, compared to more tame and familiar speech features. But the results of such tests are inconclusive.\nIn the context of language acquisition, sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role. The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects, such as the association of the words takete and baluma with either a round or angular shape, has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds.\nIn other languages.\nJapanese.\nThe Japanese language has a large inventory of ideophone words that are symbolic sounds. These are used in contexts ranging from day-to-day conversation to serious news. These words fall into four categories:\nThe two former correspond directly to the concept of onomatopoeia, while the two latter are similar to onomatopoeia in that they are intended to represent a concept mimetically and performatively rather than referentially, but different from onomatopoeia in that they aren't just imitative of sounds. For example, represents something being silent, just as how an anglophone might say \"clatter, crash, bang!\" to represent something being noisy. That \"representative\" or \"performative\" aspect is the similarity to onomatopoeia.\nSometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces reduplicated words.\nHebrew.\nAs in Japanese, onomatopoeia in Hebrew sometimes produces reduplicated verbs:\nMalay.\nThere is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu- and the implication of something that is rounded, as well as with the sound of -lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like , and ('locomotive', 'cove', and 'curve' respectively).\nArabic.\nThe Qur'an, written in Arabic, documents instances of onomatopoeia. Of about 77,701 words, there are nine words that are onomatopoeic: three are animal sounds (e.g., \"mooing\"), two are sounds of nature (e.g., \"thunder\"), and four that are human sounds (e.g., \"whisper\" or \"groan\").\nAlbanian.\nThere is wide array of objects and animals in the Albanian language that have been named after the sound they produce. Such onomatopoeic words are (matches), named after the distinct sound of friction and ignition of the match head; (ashtray) mimicking the sound it makes when placed on a table; (rain) resembling the continuous sound of pouring rain; (Little owl) after its \"cuckoo\" hoot; (brush) for its rustling sound; (slippers and flip-flops); (loud flatulence) and (silent flatulence).\nHindi-Urdu.\nIn Hindi and Urdu, onomatopoeic words like are used to indicate silly talk. Other examples of onomatopoeic words being used to represent actions are (to do something fast), (to represent fear with the sound of fast beating heart), (to signify a leaky tap) etc. Movement of animals or objects is also sometimes represented with onomatopoeic words like (for a housefly) and (the sound of a cloth being dragged on or off a piece of furniture). refers to whispering. means bark.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22537", "revid": "47587808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22537", "title": "Odysseus", "text": "Legendary Greek king of Ithaca\nIn Greek and Roman mythology, Odysseus ( ; , ), also known by the Latin variant Ulysses ( , ; ), is a legendary Greek king of Ithaca and the hero of Homer's epic poem, the \"Odyssey\". Odysseus also plays a key role in Homer's \"Iliad\" and other works in that same epic cycle.\nAs the son of La\u00ebrtes and Anticlea, husband of Penelope, and father of Telemachus, Acusilaus, and Telegonus, Odysseus is renowned for his intellectual brilliance, guile, and versatility (\"polytropos\"), and he is thus known by the epithet Odysseus the Cunning (). He is most famous for his \"nostos\", or \"homecoming\", which took him ten eventful years after the decade-long Trojan War.\nName, etymology, and epithets.\nThe form \"Odys(s)eus\" is used starting in the epic period and through the classical period, but various other forms are also found. In vase inscriptions, there are the variants \"Oliseus\" (), \"Olyseus\" (), \"Olysseus\" (), \"Olyteus\" (), \"Olytteus\" () and \"\u014clysseus\" (). The form \"Oulix\u0113s\" () is attested in an early source in Magna Graecia (Ibycus, according to Diomedes Grammaticus), while the Greek grammarian Aelius Herodianus has \"Oulixeus\" (). In Latin, he was known as ' or (considered less correct) '. Some have supposed that \"there may originally have been two separate figures, one called something like Odysseus, the other something like Ulixes, who were combined into one complex personality.\" However, the change between \"d\" and \"l\" is common also in some Indo-European and Greek names, and the Latin form is supposed to be derived from the Etruscan \"\" (see below), which perhaps accounts for some of the phonetic innovations.\nThe etymology of the name is unknown. Ancient authors linked the name to the Greek verbs ' () \"to be wroth against, to hate\", to ' () \"to lament, bewail\", or even to \"\" () \"to perish, to be lost\". Homer relates it to various forms of this verb in references and puns. In Book 19 of the \"Odyssey\", where Odysseus's early childhood is recounted, Euryclea asks the boy's grandfather Autolycus to name him. Euryclea seems to suggest a name like \"Polyaretos\", \"for he has \"much\" been \"prayed for\"\" () but Autolycus \"apparently in a sardonic mood\" decided to give the child another name commemorative of \"his own experience in life\": \"Since I have been angered ( \"odyssamenos\") with many, both men and women, let the name of the child be Odysseus\". Odysseus often receives the patronymic epithet \"Laertiades\" (), \"son of La\u00ebrtes\".\nIt has also been suggested that the name is of non-Greek origin, possibly not even Indo-European, with an unknown etymology. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin. In Etruscan religion, the name (and stories) of Odysseus were adopted under the name \"\" (\"U\u03b8uze\"), which has been interpreted as a parallel borrowing from a preceding Minoan form of the name (possibly \"*Oduze\", ); this theory is also supposed to explain the insecurity of the phonologies (\"d\" or \"l\"), since the affricate , unknown to the Greek of that time, gave rise to different counterparts (i.\u00a0e. \"\u03b4\" or \"\u03bb\" in Greek, \"\u03b8\" in Etruscan).\nIn the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey,\" Homer uses several epithets to describe Odysseus, starting with the opening, where he is described as \"the man of many devices\" (in the 1919 Murray translation). The Greek word used is \"polytropos\", literally the man of many turns, and other translators have suggested alternate English translations, including \"man of twists and turns\" (Fagles 1996) and \"a complicated man\" (Wilson 2018).\nDescription.\nIn the account of Dares the Phrygian, Odysseus was illustrated as \"tough, crafty, cheerful, of medium height, eloquent, and wise.\" In Book III of Homer's Iliad Priam describes him as \"shorter in truth by a head than Atreus' son Agamemnon, / but broader, it would seem, in the chest and across the shoulders /... / Truly, to some deep-fleeced ram would I liken him / who makes his way through the great mass of the shining sheep-flocks.\" and in the same book Antenor recalls that \"Menelaus with his broad shoulders was the taller, but Odysseus was the more imposing of the two when they were both seated.\" In Book VI of Homer's Odyssey, he is described as having \"bushy locks\" that \"hang from his head thick as the petals of a hyacinth in bloom\". In Book XVI of Homer's Odyssey he is said to have a \"bronze tan\" and in Book XVIII of Homer's Odyssey, it is said that Odysseus \"bared his fine massive thighs. His broad shoulders, his chest and brawny arms were now revealed\".\nGenealogy.\nRelatively little is given of Odysseus's fictional background other than that according to Pseudo-Apollodorus, his paternal grandfather or step-grandfather is Arcesius, son of Cephalus and grandson of Aeolus, while his maternal grandfather is the thief Autolycus, son of Hermes and Chione; this genealogy places Odysseus as the great-grandson of the Olympian god Hermes. In the \"Odyssey\", however, while Hermes passes on his skill of thievery to Autolycus, there is no indication of a genealogical connection between the two.\nAccording to the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", his father is Laertes and his mother Anticlea, although there was a non-Homeric tradition that Sisyphus was his true father. The rumour went that La\u00ebrtes bought Odysseus from the conniving king. Odysseus is said to have a younger sister, Ctimene, who went to Same to be married to Eurylochus and is mentioned by the swineherd Eumaeus, whom she grew up alongside, in book 15 of the \"Odyssey\".\nOdysseus himself, under the guise of an old beggar, gives the swineherd in Ithaca a fictitious genealogy: \"From broad Crete I declare that I am come by lineage, the son of a wealthy man. And many other sons too were born and bred in his halls, true sons of a lawful wife; but the mother that bore me was bought, a concubine. Yet Castor, son of Hylax, of whom I declare that I am sprung, honored me even as his true-born sons.\"\nMythology.\nBefore the Trojan War.\nThe majority of sources for Odysseus's supposed pre-war exploits\u2014principally the mythographers Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus\u2014postdate Homer by many centuries. Two stories in particular are well known:\nWhen Helen of Troy is abducted, Menelaus calls upon the other suitors to honour their oaths and help him to retrieve her, an attempt that leads to the Trojan War. Odysseus tries to avoid it by feigning lunacy, as an oracle had prophesied a long-delayed return home for him if he went. He hooks a donkey and an ox to his plow (as they have different stride lengths, hindering the efficiency of the plow) and (some modern sources add) starts sowing his fields with salt. Palamedes, at the behest of Menelaus's brother Agamemnon, seeks to disprove Odysseus's madness and places Telemachus, Odysseus's infant son, in front of the plow. Odysseus veers the plow away from his son, thus exposing his stratagem. Odysseus holds a grudge against Palamedes during the war for dragging him away from his home.\nOdysseus and other envoys of Agamemnon travel to Scyros to recruit Achilles because of a prophecy that Troy could not be taken without him. By most accounts, Thetis, Achilles's mother, disguises him as a woman to hide him from the recruiters because an oracle had predicted that Achilles would either live a long uneventful life or achieve everlasting glory while dying young. Odysseus cleverly discovers which among the women before him is Achilles, when Achilles is the only one of them to show interest in examining the weapons hidden among an array of adornment gifts for the daughters of their host. Odysseus arranges further for the sounding of a battle horn, which prompts Achilles to clutch a weapon and show his trained disposition. With his disguise foiled, he is exposed and joins Agamemnon's call to arms among the Hellenes.\nDuring the Trojan War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe \"Iliad\".\nOdysseus is represented as one of the most influential Greek champions during the Trojan War in Homer's account. Along with Nestor and Idomeneus he is one of the most trusted counsellors and advisors. He always champions the Achaean cause, especially when others question Agamemnon's command, as in one instance when Thersites speaks against him. When Agamemnon, to test the morale of the Achaeans, announces his intentions to depart Troy, Odysseus restores order to the Greek camp. Later on, after many of the heroes leave the battlefield due to injuries (including Odysseus and Agamemnon), Odysseus once again persuades Agamemnon not to withdraw. Along with two other envoys, he is chosen in the failed embassy to try to persuade Achilles to return to combat.\nWhen Hector proposes a single combat duel, Odysseus is one of the Danaans who reluctantly volunteered to battle him. Telamonian Ajax (\"The Greater\"), however, is the volunteer who eventually fights Hector. Odysseus aids Diomedes during the night operations to kill Rhesus, because it had been foretold that if his horses drank from the Scamander River, Troy could not be taken.\nAfter Patroclus is slain, it is Odysseus who counsels Achilles to let the Achaean men eat and rest rather than follow his rage-driven desire to go back on the offensive\u2014and kill Trojans\u2014immediately. Eventually (and reluctantly), he consents. During the funeral games for Patroclus, Odysseus becomes involved in a wrestling match with Ajax \"The Greater\" and foot race with Ajax \"The Lesser\", son of Oileus and Nestor's son Antilochus. He draws the wrestling match, and with the help of the goddess Athena, he wins the race.\nOdysseus has traditionally been viewed as Achilles's antithesis in the \"Iliad\": while Achilles's anger is all-consuming and of a self-destructive nature, Odysseus is frequently viewed as a man of the mean, a voice of reason, renowned for his self-restraint and diplomatic skills. He is also in some respects antithetical to Telamonian Ajax (Shakespeare's \"beef-witted\" Ajax): while the latter has only brawn to recommend him, Odysseus is not only ingenious (as evidenced by his idea for the Trojan Horse), but an eloquent speaker, a skill perhaps best demonstrated in the embassy to Achilles in book 9 of the \"Iliad\". The two are not only foils in the abstract but often opposed in practice since they have many duels and run-ins.\nOther stories from the Trojan War.\nSince a prophecy suggested that the Trojan War would not be won without Achilles, Odysseus and several other Achaean leaders are described in the \"Achilleid\" as having gone to Skyros to find him. Odysseus discovered Achilles by offering gifts, adornments and musical instruments as well as weapons, to the king's daughters, and then having his companions imitate the noises of an enemy's attack on the island (most notably, making a blast of a trumpet heard), which prompted Achilles to reveal himself by picking a weapon to fight back, and together they departed for the Trojan War.\nThe story of the death of Palamedes has many versions. According to some, Odysseus never forgives Palamedes for unmasking his feigned madness and plays a part in his downfall. One tradition says Odysseus convinces a Trojan captive to write a letter pretending to be from Palamedes. A sum of gold is mentioned to have been sent as a reward for Palamedes's treachery. Odysseus then kills the prisoner and hides the gold in Palamedes's tent. He ensures that the letter is found and acquired by Agamemnon, and also gives hints directing the Argives to the gold. This is evidence enough for the Greeks, and they have Palamedes stoned to death. Other sources say that Odysseus and Diomedes goad Palamedes into descending a well with the prospect of treasure being at the bottom. When Palamedes reaches the bottom, the two proceed to bury him with stones, killing him.\nWhen Achilles is slain in battle by Paris, it is Odysseus and Ajax who retrieve the fallen warrior's body and armour in the thick of heavy fighting. During the funeral games for Achilles, Odysseus competes once again with Ajax. Thetis says that the arms of Achilles will go to the bravest of the Greeks, but only these two warriors dare lay claim to that title. The two Argives became embroiled in a heavy dispute about one another's merits to receive the reward. The Greeks dither out of fear in deciding a winner, because they did not want to insult one and have him abandon the war effort. Nestor suggests that they allow the captive Trojans to decide the winner. The accounts of the \"Odyssey\" disagree, suggesting that the Greeks themselves hold a secret vote. In any case, Odysseus is the winner. Enraged and humiliated, Ajax is driven mad by Athena. When he returns to his senses, in shame at how he has slaughtered livestock in his madness, Ajax kills himself by the sword that Hector had given him after their duel.\nTogether with Diomedes, Odysseus fetches Achilles's son, Pyrrhus, to come to the aid of the Achaeans, because an oracle had stated that Troy could not be taken without him. A great warrior, Pyrrhus is also called Neoptolemus (Greek for \"new warrior\"). Upon the success of the mission, Odysseus gives Achilles's armour to him.\nIt is learned that the war can not be won without the poisonous arrows of Heracles, which are owned by the abandoned Philoctetes. Odysseus and Diomedes (or, according to some accounts, Odysseus and Neoptolemus) leave to retrieve them. Upon their arrival, Philoctetes (still suffering from the wound) is seen still to be enraged at the Danaans, especially at Odysseus, for abandoning him. Although his first instinct is to shoot Odysseus, his anger is eventually defused by Odysseus's persuasive powers and the influence of the gods. Odysseus returns to the Argive camp with Philoctetes and his arrows.\nPerhaps Odysseus's most famous contribution to the Greek war effort is devising the strategy of the Trojan Horse, which allows the Greek army to sneak into Troy under cover of darkness. It is built by Epeius and filled with Greek warriors, led by Odysseus. Odysseus and Diomedes steal the Palladium that lay within Troy's walls, for the Greeks were told they could not sack the city without it. Some late Roman sources indicate that Odysseus schemed to kill his partner on the way back, but Diomedes thwarts this attempt.\n\"Cruel, deceitful Ulixes\" of the Romans.\nHomer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" portray Odysseus as a culture hero, but the Romans, who believed themselves the heirs of Prince Aeneas of Troy, considered him a villainous falsifier. In Virgil's \"Aeneid\", written between 29 and 19 BC, he is constantly referred to as \"cruel Odysseus\" (Latin \"dirus Ulixes\") or \"deceitful Odysseus\" (\"pellacis\", \"fandi fictor\"). Turnus, in \"Aeneid\", book 9, reproaches the Trojan Ascanius with images of rugged, forthright Latin virtues, declaring (in John Dryden's translation), \"You shall not find the sons of Atreus here, nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.\" While the Greeks admired his cunning and deceit, these qualities did not recommend themselves to the Romans, who possessed a rigid sense of honour. In Euripides's tragedy \"Iphigenia at Aulis\", having convinced Agamemnon to consent to the sacrifice of his daughter, Iphigenia, to appease the goddess Artemis, Odysseus facilitates the immolation by telling Iphigenia's mother, Clytemnestra, that the girl is to be wed to Achilles. Odysseus's attempts to avoid his sacred oath to defend Menelaus and Helen offended Roman notions of duty, and the many stratagems and tricks that he employed to get his way offended Roman notions of honour.\nJourney home to Ithaca.\nOdysseus is probably best known as the eponymous hero of the \"Odyssey\". This epic describes his travels, which lasted for 10 years, as he tries to return home after the Trojan War and reassert his place as rightful king of Ithaca.\nHomebound from Troy, after a raid on Ismarus in the land of the Cicones, he and his twelve ships are driven off course by storms. They visit the lethargic Lotus-Eaters and are captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus while visiting his island. After Polyphemus eats several of his men, he and Odysseus have a discussion and Odysseus tells Polyphemus his name is Outis (\"Nobody\"). Odysseus takes a barrel of wine and the Cyclops drinks it, falling asleep. Odysseus and his men take a wooden stake, ignite it with the remaining wine, and blind him. While they escape, Polyphemus cries in pain, and the other Cyclopes ask him what is wrong. Polyphemus cries, \"Nobody has blinded me!\" and the other Cyclopes think he has gone mad. Odysseus and his crew escape, but Odysseus rashly reveals his real name, and Polyphemus prays to Poseidon, his father, to take revenge. They stay with Aeolus, the master of the winds, who gives Odysseus a leather bag containing all the winds, except the west wind, a gift that should have ensured a safe return home. However, the sailors foolishly open the bag while Odysseus sleeps, thinking that it contains gold. All of the winds fly out, and the resulting storm drives the ships back the way they had come, just as Ithaca comes into sight.\nAfter pleading in vain with Aeolus to help them again, they re-embark and encounter the cannibalistic Laestrygonians. Odysseus's ship is the only one to escape. He sails on and visits the witch-goddess Circe. She turns half of his men into swine after feeding them cheese and wine. Hermes warns Odysseus about Circe and gives him a drug called moly, which resists Circe's magic. Circe, being attracted to Odysseus's resistance, falls in love with him and releases his men. Odysseus and his crew remain with her on the island for one year, while they feast and drink. Finally, Odysseus's men convince him to leave for Ithaca.\nGuided by Circe's instructions, Odysseus and his crew cross the ocean and reach a harbor at the western edge of the world, where Odysseus sacrifices to the dead and summons the spirit of the old prophet Tiresias for advice. Next Odysseus meets the spirit of his own mother, who had died of grief during his long absence. From her, he learns for the first time news of his own household, threatened by the greed of Penelope's suitors. Odysseus also talks to his fallen war comrades and the mortal shade of Heracles.\nOdysseus and his men return to Circe's island, and she advises them on the remaining stages of the journey. They skirt the land of the Sirens, pass between the six-headed monster Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis, where they row directly between the two. However, Scylla drags the boat towards her by grabbing the oars and eats six men.\nThey land on the island of Thrinacia. There, Odysseus's men ignore the warnings of Tiresias and Circe and hunt down the sacred cattle of the sun god Helios. Helios tells Zeus what happened and demands Odysseus's men be punished or else he will take the sun and shine it in the Underworld. Zeus fulfills Helios's demands by causing a shipwreck during a thunderstorm in which all but Odysseus drown. He washes ashore on the island of Ogygia, where Calypso compels him to remain as her lover for seven years. He finally escapes when Hermes tells Calypso to release Odysseus.\nOdysseus is shipwrecked and befriended by the Phaeacians. After he tells them his story, the Phaeacians, led by King Alcinous, agree to help Odysseus get home. They deliver him at night, while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbor on Ithaca. He finds his way to the hut of one of his own former slaves, the swineherd Eumaeus, and also meets up with his son Telemachus returning from Sparta. Athena disguises Odysseus as a wandering beggar to learn how things stand in his household.\nWhen the disguised Odysseus returns after 20 years, he is recognized only by his faithful dog, Argos. Penelope announces in her long interview with the disguised hero that whoever can string Odysseus's rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe shafts may have her hand. According to Bernard Knox, \"For the plot of the \"Odyssey\", of course, her decision is the turning point, the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero\". Odysseus's identity is discovered by the housekeeper, Eurycleia, as she is washing his feet and discovers an old scar Odysseus received during a boar hunt. Odysseus swears her to secrecy, threatening to kill her if she tells anyone.\nWhen the contest of the bow begins, none of the suitors are able to string the bow. After all the suitors have given up, the disguised Odysseus asks to participate. Though the suitors refuse at first, Penelope intervenes and allows the \"stranger\" (the disguised Odysseus) to participate. Odysseus easily strings his bow and wins the contest. Having done so, he proceeds to slaughter the suitors (beginning with Antinous whom he finds drinking from Odysseus's cup) with help from Telemachus and two of Odysseus's servants, Eumaeus the swineherd and Philoetius the cowherd. Odysseus tells the serving women who slept with the suitors to clean up the mess of corpses and then has those women hanged in terror. He tells Telemachus that he will replenish his stocks by raiding nearby islands. Odysseus has now revealed himself in all his glory (with a little makeover by Athena); yet Penelope cannot believe that her husband has really returned\u2014she fears that it is perhaps some god in disguise, as in the story of Alcmene (mother of Heracles)\u2014and tests him by ordering her servant Euryclea to move the bed in their wedding-chamber. Odysseus protests that this cannot be done since he made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a living olive tree. Penelope finally accepts that he truly is her husband, a moment that highlights their \"homophros\u00fdn\u0113\" (\"like-mindedness\").\nThe next day Odysseus and Telemachus visit the country farm of his old father La\u00ebrtes. The citizens of Ithaca follow Odysseus on the road, planning to avenge the killing of the Suitors, their sons. The goddess Athena and the god Zeus intervene and persuade both sides to make peace.\nOther tales.\nAccording to some late sources, most of them purely genealogical, Odysseus had many other children besides Telemachus. Most such genealogies aimed to link Odysseus with the foundation of many Italic cities. This would seem to contradict \"The Odyssey\", which says that Odysseus's family line can only produce a single child per generation by the order of Zeus, with Telemachus already existing as that sole heir. However, the \"Odyssey\" also notes the existence of Odysseus's sister, Ctimene.\nThe most famous of the other children are:\nHe figures in the end of the story of King Telephus of Mysia.\nThe last poem in the Epic Cycle is called the \"Telegony\", and is now lost. According to remaining fragments, it told the story of Odysseus's last voyage to the land of the Thesprotians. There he married the queen Callidice. Then he led the Thesprotians in a war with their neighbors the Brygoi (Brygi, Brygians) and defeated in battle the neighboring peoples who attacked him. When Callidice died, Odysseus returned home to Ithaca, leaving their son, Polypoetes, to rule Thesprotia. Contradicting the reading of Tiresias's prophecy in \"The Odyssey\" that Odysseus will have a gentle death in old age after making it home, the \"Telogony\" claims that he met his death at the hands of Telegonus, his son with Circe, after a misunderstanding. Telegonus attacked his father with a poisoned spear, given to him by Circe. Before dying, Odysseus recognized his son. Telegonus then brought back his father's corpse to Aeaea, together with Penelope and Odysseus's son by her, Telemachus. After burying Odysseus, Circe made the other three immortal. Circe married Telemachus, and Telegonus married Penelope by the advice of Athena.\nAccording to what seems to be later tradition, Odysseus was resurrected by Circe after his death at the hands of Telegonus. Afterward, he married Telemachus to Cassiphone, the daughter he had with Circe. Telemachus however killed Circe after a quarrel, causing Cassiphone to kill him in revenge. Odysseus witnessing those unfortunate events died again, of grief this time.\nIn 5th century BC Athens, tales of the Trojan War were popular subjects for tragedies. Odysseus figures centrally or indirectly in a number of the extant plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles (\"Ajax\", \"Philoctetes\") and Euripides (\"Hecuba\", \"Rhesus\", \"Cyclops\") and figured in still more that have not survived. In his \"Ajax\", Sophocles portrays Odysseus as a modern voice of reasoning compared to the title character's rigid antiquity.\nPlato in his dialogue \"Hippias Minor\" examines a literary question about whom Homer intended to portray as the better man, Achilles or Odysseus.\nPausanias at the \"Description of Greece\" writes that at Pheneus there was a bronze statue of Poseidon, surnamed Hippios (), meaning \"of horse\", which according to the legends was dedicated by Odysseus and also a sanctuary of Artemis which was called Heurippa (), meaning \"horse finder\", and was founded by Odysseus. According to the legends Odysseus lost his mares and traversed Greece in search of them. He found them on that site in Pheneus. Pausanias adds that according to the people of Pheneus, when Odysseus found his mares he decided to keep horses in the land of Pheneus, just as he reared his cows. The people of Pheneus also pointed out to him writing, purporting to be instructions of Odysseus to those tending his mares.\nAs Ulysses, he is mentioned regularly in Virgil's \"Aeneid\" written between 29 and 19 BC, and the poem's hero, Aeneas, rescues one of Ulysses's crew members who was left behind on the island of the Cyclopes. He in turn offers a first-person account of some of the same events Homer relates, in which Ulysses appears directly. Virgil's Ulysses typifies his view of the Greeks: he is cunning but impious, and ultimately malicious and hedonistic.\nOvid retells parts of Ulysses's journeys, focusing on his romantic involvements with Circe and Calypso, and recasts him as, in Harold Bloom's phrase, \"one of the great wandering womanizers\". Ovid also gives a detailed account of the contest between Ulysses and Ajax for the armour of Achilles.\nGreek legend tells of Ulysses as the founder of Lisbon, Portugal, calling it \"Ulisipo\" or \"Ulisseya\", during his twenty-year errand on the Mediterranean and Atlantic seas. Olisipo was Lisbon's name in the Roman Empire. This folk etymology is recounted by Strabo based on Asclepiades of Myrlea's words, by Pomponius Mela, by Gaius Julius Solinus (3rd century AD), and would later be reiterated by Cam\u00f5es in his epic poem \"Os Lus\u00edadas\" (first printed in 1572).\nIn one version of Odysseus's end, he is eventually turned into a horse by Athena.\nIn post-classical tradition.\nOdysseus is one of the most recurrent characters in Western culture.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nDante Alighieri, in the Canto XXVI of the \"Inferno\" segment of his \"Divine Comedy\" (1308\u20131320), encounters Odysseus (\"Ulisse\" in Italian) near the very bottom of Hell: with Diomedes, he walks wrapped in flame in the eighth ring (\"Counselors of Fraud\") of the Eighth Circle (\"Sins of Malice\"), as punishment for his schemes and conspiracies that won the Trojan War. In a famous passage, Dante has Odysseus relate a different version of his voyage and death from the one told by Homer. He tells how he set out with his men from Circe's island for a journey of exploration to sail beyond the Pillars of Hercules and into the Western sea to find what adventures awaited them. Men, says Ulisse, are not made to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge.\nAfter travelling west and south for five months, they see in the distance a great mountain rising from the sea (this is Purgatory, in Dante's cosmology) before a storm sinks them. Dante did not have access to the original Greek texts of the Homeric epics, so his knowledge of their subject-matter was based only on information from later sources, chiefly Virgil's \"Aeneid\" but also Ovid; hence the discrepancy between Dante and Homer.\nHe appears in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\" (1602), set during the Trojan War.\nModern literature.\nPoetry.\nIn her poem . (published in 1836), Letitia Elizabeth Landon gives her version of \"The Song of the Sirens\" with an explanation of its purpose, structure and meaning. This illustrates a painting by Charles Bentley engraved by R. Sands, and showing The Black Mountains of Cephalonia in the background. A further poetical illustration, also in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837, is to an engraving of a painting by Charles Bentley, . and harks back to the island 'where Ulysses was king'.\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson's poem \"Ulysses\" (published in 1842) presents an aging king who has seen too much of the world to be happy sitting on a throne idling his days away. Leaving the task of civilizing his people to his son, he gathers together a band of old comrades \"to sail beyond the sunset\".\nNikos Kazantzakis's \"\" (1938), a 33,333-line epic poem, begins with Odysseus cleansing his body of the blood of Penelope's suitors. Odysseus soon leaves Ithaca in search of new adventures. Before his death he abducts Helen, incites revolutions in Crete and Egypt, communes with God, and meets representatives of such famous historical and literary figures as Vladimir Lenin, Don Quixote and Jesus.\nIn 1986, Irish poet Eilean Ni Chuilleanain published \"The Second Voyage\", a poem in which she makes use of the story of Odysseus.\nNovels.\nFrederick Rolfe's \"The Weird of the Wanderer\" (1912) has the hero Nicholas Crabbe (based on the author) travelling back in time, discovering that he is the reincarnation of Odysseus, marrying Helen, being deified and ending up as one of the three Magi.\nJames Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\" (first published 1918\u20131920) uses modern literary devices to narrate a single day in the life of a Dublin businessman named Leopold Bloom. Bloom's day bears many elaborate parallels to Odysseus's ten years of wandering.\n\"Return to Ithaca\" (1946) by Eyvind Johnson is a more realistic retelling of the events that adds a deeper psychological study of the characters of Odysseus, Penelope, and Telemachus. Thematically, it uses Odysseus's backstory and struggle as a metaphor for dealing with the aftermath of war (the novel being written immediately after the end of the Second World War).\nIn the eleventh chapter of Primo Levi's 1947 memoir \"If This Is a Man\", \"The Canto of Ulysses\", the author describes the last voyage of Ulysses as told by Dante in \"The Inferno\" to a fellow-prisoner during forced labour in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz.\nOdysseus is the hero of \"The Luck of Troy\" (1961) by Roger Lancelyn Green, whose title refers to the theft of the Palladium.\nIn S. M. Stirling's \"Island in the Sea of Time\" (1998), first part to his Nantucket series of alternate history novels, Odikweos (\"Odysseus\" in Mycenaean Greek) is a \"historical\" figure who is every bit as cunning as his legendary self and is one of the few Bronze Age inhabitants who discerns the time-travellers' real background. Odikweos first aids William Walker's rise to power in Achaea and later helps bring Walker down after seeing his homeland turn into a police state.\n\"The Penelopiad\" (2005) by Margaret Atwood retells his story from the point of view of his wife Penelope.\nRick Riordan's novel series \"Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians\", which centres on the presence of Greek mythology in the 21st century, incorporates several elements from Odysseus's story. The second novel in particular, \"The Sea of Monsters\" (2006), is a loose adaptation of \"The Odyssey\", with protagonists Percy and Annabeth seeking to save their satyr friend Grover from Polyphemus, and facing many of the same obstacles Odysseus faced over the course of the journey.\nVolodymyr Yermolenko, Ukrainian philosopher and essayist, wrote \"Ocean Catcher: The Story of Odysseus\", Stary Lev, 2017, which is loose adaptation of The Odyssey, where after coming back home to Ithaca, where he cannot find either Penelope or Telemachus, he decides to have a reverse trip to Troy.\nLiterary criticism.\nThe literary theorist N\u00faria Perpiny\u00e0 conceived twenty different interpretations of the \"Odyssey\" in a 2008 study.\nTelevision and film.\nThe actors who have portrayed Odysseus in feature films include Kirk Douglas in the Italian \"Ulysses\" (1955), John Drew Barrymore in \"The Trojan Horse\" (1961), Piero Lulli in \"The Fury of Achilles\" (1962), George Clooney in \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000), Sean Bean in \"Troy\" (2004), and Ralph Fiennes in \"The Return\" (2024). He is set to be played by Matt Damon in the upcoming 2026 film.\nIn TV miniseries he has been played by Bekim Fehmiu in \"L'Odissea\" (1968), Armand Assante in \"The Odyssey\" (1997), and by Joseph Mawle in \"\" (2018).\n\"Ulysses 31\" is a French-Japanese animated television series (1981) that updates the Greek mythology of Odysseus to the 31st century.\nMusic.\nThe opera \"Ulysse ou le beau p\u00e9riple\" (1961) by Henri Tomasi.\nThe British group Cream recorded the song \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" in 1967.\nSuzanne Vega's song \"Calypso\" from 1987 album \"Solitude Standing\" shows Odysseus from Calypso's point of view, and tells the tale of him coming to the island and his leaving.\nThe American progressive metal band Symphony X released a 24-minute adaptation of the tale on their 2002 album \"The Odyssey\".\nOdysseus is featured in a verse of the song \"Journey of the Magi\" on Frank Turner's 2009 album \"Poetry of the Deed\".\nRolf Riehm composed an opera based on the myth, \"Sirenen \u2013 Bilder des Begehrens und des Vernichtens\" (\"Sirens \u2013 Images of Desire and Destruction\") which premiered at the Oper Frankfurt in 2014.\nOdysseus appears as the main character of \"\", a sung-through adaptation of \"The Odyssey\" created by musician Jorge Rivera-Herrans. Rivera-Herrans provides the voice of Odysseus.\nComparative mythology and folkloristics.\nOver time, comparisons between Odysseus and other heroes of different mythologies and religions have been made. A similar story exists in Hindu mythology with Nala and Damayanti where Nala separates from Damayanti and is reunited with her. The story of stringing a bow is similar to the description in the \"Ramayana\" of Rama stringing the bow to win Sita's hand in marriage.\nVirgil's \"Aeneid\" has evident similarities to the Odyssey. Virgil tells the story of Aeneas and his travels to what would become Rome. On his journey he endures strife comparable to that of Odysseus. However, the motives for both of their journeys differ as Aeneas was driven by this sense of duty granted to him by the gods that he must abide by. He keeps in mind the future of his people, fitting for the future \"Father of Rome\".\nIn folkloristics, the story of Odysseus's journey back to his native Ithaca and wife Penelope corresponds to the tale type ATU 974, \"The Homecoming Husband\", of the international Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther Index for folktale classification.\nCult\u2013 islands \u2013 cities.\nEvidence suggests the existence of a cult dedicated to Odysseus on Ithaca. This evidence includes public games called the Odysseia (\u03c4\u03ac \u1f48\u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) and a designated public gathering place or a sanctuary, known as the Odysseion (\u03c4\u03cc \u1f48\u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd).\nIn 2025, researchers identified what is believed to be the sanctuary of Odysseus at the site Agios Athanasios\u2013School of Homer in northern Ithaca (known since the 19th century as the \"School of Homer\". Two late Hellenistic inscriptions were discovered bearing \"\u039f\u0394\u03a5CCEOC\" (genitive) and \"\u039f\u0394\u03a5CCEI\" (dative). These align with a 1930s inscription from the Polis Bay cave reading \"\u0395\u03a5\u03a7\u0397\u039d \u039f\u0394\u03a5CC\u0395\u0399\" (\"Thanks Odysseus\"). Additional finds, such as a miniature bronze bust of Odysseus, 34 clay votive fragments, loom weights, jewelry, and over 100 coins, highlight the site's religious and social role during the Hellenistic and early Roman periods (3rd century BCE \u2013 2nd century CE). The lower terrace, featuring architectural remains, carved dedication niches, and roof tiles inscribed with references to Apollo Agyieus and the symbol \"\u0394\u0397\" (which may indicate \"public\"), confirms the site's function in formal religious rituals. This indicates that the sanctuary catered to both local devotees and visiting pilgrims.\nStrabo writes that on Meninx () island, modern Djerba at Tunisia, there was an altar to Odysseus.\nPliny the Elder writes that in Italy there were some small islands (modern Torricella, Praca, Brace and other rocks) which were called Ithacesiae because of a watchtower that Odysseus built there.\nAccording to ancient Greek tradition, Odysseus founded a city in Iberia which was called Odysseia (\u1f48\u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) or Odysseis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2) which had a sanctuary of goddess Athena. Ancient authors identified it with Olisipo (modern Lisbon), but modern researchers believe that even its existence is uncertain.\nHellanicus of Lesbos wrote that Rome was founded by Aeneas and Odysseus who came together there. Other ancient historians, including Damastes of Sigeum, agreed with him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally intended to serve as a family residence, it was at times vacated to host important guests, such as Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany in 1898 and Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia in 1936.\nHistory.\n1948 War and Jordanian rule.\nDuring the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Orient House remained east of the ceasefire line, in the area controlled by Jordan. Between 1948\u20131950, the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) was located there and two years later, its owner turned it into a luxury hotel called \"The New Orient House\".\nIsraeli occupation.\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War and the capture of East Jerusalem by Israel, the hotel was closed and the building was mostly neglected. Many of the first residents of the northern Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Itri, who arrived from the United States in 1968 before their flats were ready, were temporarily lodged in the Orient House.\nIn 1983, the Arab Scientific Association, a PLO-affiliated organization led by Faisal Husseini, rented a part of the house. In 1988, Israel closed the House and banned PLO activity in it. It was renewed four years later in 1992. It was then rented and renovated by Husseini. In an exchange of letters preceding the 1993 Oslo Accords, Israel promised that it would not violate the right of the House to continue to operate freely.\nDuring his first tenure as Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu \"tried and failed to have Orient House shut down, amid warning from the international community that such a step would be regarded very negatively.\"\nWhen Ehud Olmert was serving in his post as Mayor of Jerusalem, he led efforts to protest against the way Orient House was functioning, refusing to meet with Husseini and demanding that Orient House pay US$300,000 in municipal taxes. Husseini refused the request, stating that Orient House, as a diplomatic institution, was exempt. Husseini died a few years later in May 2001.\nDuring the Second Intifada in August 2001, the then Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon determined that with the expectation of a massive Israeli response, the conditions were as favorable as they would ever be for Israel to undertake the forcible closure of Orient House. Two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing, the Israeli cabinet voted to close the Orient House, and the building was raided by Israeli security forces. Items confiscated by Israeli authorities included personal belongings, confidential information relating to the Jerusalem issue, documents referring to the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the Arab Studies Society photography collection. The personal books and documents of Faisal Husseini were summarily impounded. Other Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem, such as the Governor's House and the headquarters of Force 17 were shut down and raided in the same operation.\nIn January 2010, at a meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, representatives from the European Union and Russia suggested reopening Orient House and other Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem as a way of bringing the Palestinian Authority back to the negotiating table. The suggestion was made after George Mitchell told those at the meeting that Palestinian representatives had insisted that they would not return to negotiations until Israel halted all settlement activity in the eastern half of the city.\nCultural references.\nThe jazz musician Gilad Atzmon has named his band The Orient House Ensemble after this building.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22544", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22544", "title": "Common ostrich", "text": "Species of flightless bird\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe common ostrich (Struthio camelus), or simply ostrich, is a species of flightless bird native to certain areas of Africa. It is one of two extant species of ostriches, the only living members of the genus \"Struthio\" in the ratite group of birds. The other is the Somali ostrich (\"Struthio molybdophanes\"), which has been recognized as a distinct species by BirdLife International since 2014, having been previously considered a distinctive subspecies of ostrich.\nThe common ostrich belongs to the order Struthioniformes. Struthioniformes previously contained all the ratites, such as the kiwis, emus, rheas, and cassowaries. However, recent genetic analysis has found that the group is not monophyletic, as it is paraphyletic with respect to the tinamous, so the ostriches are now classified as the only members of the order. Phylogenetic studies have shown that it is the sister group to all other members of Palaeognathae, and thus the flighted tinamous are the sister group to the extinct moa. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs, and can run for a long time at a speed of with short bursts up to about , the fastest land speed of any bipedal animal. The common ostrich is the largest living species of bird and thus the largest living dinosaur. It lays the largest eggs of any living bird (the extinct giant elephant bird (\"Aepyornis maximus\") of Madagascar and the south island giant moa (\"Dinornis robustus\") of New Zealand laid larger eggs). \nThe common ostrich's diet consists mainly of plant matter, though it also eats invertebrates and small reptiles. It lives in nomadic groups of 5 to 50 birds. When threatened, the ostrich will either hide itself by lying flat against the ground or run away. If cornered, it can attack with a kick of its powerful legs. Mating patterns differ by geographical region, but territorial males fight for a harem of two to seven females.\nThe common ostrich is farmed around the world, particularly for its feathers, which are decorative and are also used as feather dusters. Its skin is used for leather products and its meat is sold commercially, with its leanness a common marketing point.\nDescription.\nThe common ostrich is the tallest and heaviest living bird. Males stand tall and weigh , whereas females are about tall and weigh . While exceptional male ostriches (in the nominate subspecies) can weigh up to , some specimens in South Africa can only weigh between . New chicks are fawn in color, with dark brown spots. After three months they start to gain their juvenile plumage, which is steadily replaced by adult-like plumage during their second year. At four or five months old, they are already about half the size of an adult bird, and after a year they reach adult height, but not till they are 18 months old will they be fully as heavy as their parents.\nThe feathers of adult males are mostly black, with white primaries and a white tail. However, the tail of one subspecies is buff. Females and young males are grayish-brown and white. The head and neck of both male and female ostriches are nearly bare, with a thin layer of down. The skin of the female's neck and thighs is pinkish gray, while the male's is gray or pink dependent on subspecies.\nThe long neck and legs keep their head up to above the ground, and their eyes are said to be the largest of any land vertebrate \u2013 in diameter \u2013 helping them to see predators at a great distance. The eyes are shaded from sunlight from above. However, the head and bill are relatively small for the birds' huge size, with the bill measuring .\nTheir skin varies in color depending on the subspecies, with some having light or dark gray skin and others having pinkish or even reddish skin. The strong legs of the common ostrich are unfeathered and show bare skin, with the tarsus (the lowest upright part of the leg) being covered in scales: red in the male, black in the female. The tarsus of the common ostrich is the largest of any living bird, measuring in length. The bird is didactyl, having just two toes on each foot (most birds have four), with the nail on the larger, inner toe resembling a hoof. The outer toe has no nail. The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running, useful for getting away from predators. Common ostriches can run at a speed over and can cover in a single stride. The wings reach a span of about , and the wing chord measurement of is around the same size as for the largest flying birds.\nThe feathers lack the tiny hooks that lock together the smooth external feathers of flying birds, and so are soft and fluffy and serve as insulation. Common ostriches can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. In much of their habitat, temperatures vary as much as between night and day. Their temperature control relies in part on behavioral thermoregulation. For example, they use their wings to cover the naked skin of the upper legs and flanks to conserve heat, or leave these areas bare to release heat. The wings also function as stabilizers to give better maneuverability when running. Tests have shown that the wings are actively involved in rapid braking, turning, and zigzag maneuvers. They have 50\u201360 tail feathers, and their wings have 16 primary, four alular, and 20\u201323 secondary feathers.\nThe common ostrich's sternum is flat, lacking the keel to which wing muscles attach in flying birds. The beak is flat and broad, with a rounded tip. Like all ratites, the ostrich has no crop, and it also lacks a gallbladder and the caecum is . Unlike all other living birds, the common ostrich secretes urine separately from feces. All other birds store the urine and feces combined in the coprodeum, but the ostrich stores the feces in the terminal rectum. They also have unique pubic bones that are fused to hold their gut. Unlike most birds, the males have a copulatory organ, which is retractable and long. Their palate differs from other ratites in that the sphenoid and palatal bones are unconnected.\nTaxonomy.\nThe common ostrich was originally described by Carl Linnaeus from Sweden in his 18th-century work, \"Systema Naturae\" under its current binomial name. Its genus is derived from the Late Latin \"struthio\" meaning \"ostrich\". The specific name is an allusion to \"strouthokamelos\" the Ancient Greek name for the ostrich, meaning camel-sparrow, the \"camel\" term referring to its dry habitat. \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is still the modern Greek name for the ostrich.\nThe common ostrich belongs to the Infraclass \"Palaeognathae,\" commonly known as \nratites. Other members include rheas, emus, cassowaries, moa, kiwi, elephant birds, and tinamous.\nSubspecies.\nFour subspecies are recognized:\nSome analyses indicate that the Somali ostrich is now considered a full species; the Tree of Life Project, \"The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World\", BirdLife International, and the recognize it as a different species. A few authorities, including the \"Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World\", do not recognize it as separate. Mitochondrial DNA haplotype comparisons suggest that it diverged from the other ostriches around 4 mya due to the formation of the East African Rift. Hybridization with the subspecies that evolved southwestwards of its range, \"S. c. massaicus\", has apparently been prevented from occurring on a significant scale by ecological separation; the Somali ostrich prefers bushland where it browses middle-height vegetation for food while the Masai ostrich is, like the other subspecies, a grazing bird of the open savanna and \"miombo\" habitat.\nThe population from R\u00edo de Oro was once separated as \"Struthio camelus spatzi\" because its eggshell pores were shaped like a teardrop and not round. As there is considerable variation of this character and there were no other differences between these birds and adjacent populations of \"S. c. camelus\", the separation is no longer considered valid. However, a study analysing the postcranial skeleton of all living and recently extinct species and subspecies of ostriches appeared to validate \"S. c. spatzi\" based on its unique skeletal proportions. This population disappeared in the latter half of the 20th century. There were 19th-century reports of the existence of small ostriches in North Africa; these are referred to as Levaillant's ostrich (\"Struthio bidactylus\") but remain a hypothetical form not supported by material evidence.\nDistribution and habitat.\nCommon ostriches formerly occupied Africa north and south of the Sahara, East Africa, Africa south of the rainforest belt, and much of Asia Minor. Today common ostriches prefer open land and are native to the savannas and Sahel of Africa, both north and south of the equatorial forest zone. In southwest Africa they inhabit the semi-desert or true desert. Farmed common ostriches in Australia have established feral populations. The Arabian ostriches in the Near and Middle East were hunted to extinction by the middle of the 20th century. Attempts to reintroduce the common ostrich into Israel have failed. Common ostriches have occasionally been seen inhabiting islands on the Dahlak Archipelago, in the Red Sea near Eritrea.\nResearch conducted by the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany in India found molecular evidence that ostriches lived in India 25,000 years ago. DNA tests on fossilized eggshells recovered from eight archaeological sites in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh found 92% genetic similarity between the eggshells and the North African ostrich, so these could have been fairly distant relatives.\nOstriches were introduced to Australia for farming, and a large feral population now exists in the Australian outback.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nCommon ostriches normally spend the winter months in pairs or alone. Only 16 percent of common ostrich sightings were of more than two birds. During breeding season and sometimes during extreme rainless periods ostriches live in nomadic groups of five to 100 birds (led by a top hen) that often travel together with other grazing animals, such as zebras or antelopes. Ostriches are diurnal, but may be active on moonlit nights. They are most active early and late in the day. The male common ostrich territory is between .\nWith their acute eyesight and hearing, common ostriches can sense predators such as lions from far away. When being pursued by a predator, they have been known to reach speeds in excess of , or possibly and can maintain a steady speed of , which makes the common ostrich the fastest bipedal animal. When lying down and hiding from predators, the birds lay their heads and necks flat on the ground, making them appear like a mound of earth from a distance, aided by the heat haze in their hot, dry habitat.\nWhen threatened, common ostriches run away, but they can cause serious injury and death with kicks from their powerful legs. Their legs can only kick forward. The kick from an ostrich can yield .\nFeeding.\nThey mainly feed on seeds, shrubs, grass, fruit, and flowers; occasionally they also eat insects such as locusts, rodents such as mice, small reptiles such as lizards, and animal remains left by carnivorous predators. Lacking teeth, they swallow pebbles that act as gastroliths to grind food in the gizzard. When eating, they will fill their gullet with food, which is in turn passed down their esophagus in the form of a ball called a bolus. The bolus may be as much as . After passing through the neck (there is no crop) the food enters the gizzard and is worked on by the aforementioned pebbles. The gizzard can hold as much as , of which up to 45% may be sand and pebbles. Common ostriches can go without drinking for several days, using metabolic water and moisture in ingested plants, but they enjoy liquid water and frequently take baths where it is available. They can survive losing up to 25% of their body weight through dehydration.\nMating.\nCommon ostriches become sexually mature when they are 2 to 4 years old; females mature about six months earlier than males. As with other birds, an individual may reproduce several times over its lifetime. The mating season begins in March or April and ends sometime before September. The mating process differs in different geographical regions. Territorial males typically boom (by inflating their neck) in defense of their territory and harem of two to seven hens; the successful male may then mate with several females in the area, but will only form a pair bond with a 'major' female.\nThe cock performs with his wings, alternating wing beats, until he attracts a mate. They will go to the mating area and he will maintain privacy by driving away all intruders. They graze until their behavior is synchronized, then the feeding becomes secondary and the process takes on a ritualistic appearance. The cock will then excitedly flap alternate wings again and start poking on the ground with his bill. He will then violently flap his wings to symbolically clear out a nest in the soil. Then, while the hen runs a circle around him with lowered wings, he will wind his head in a spiral motion. She will drop to the ground and he will mount for copulation. Common ostriches raised entirely by humans may direct their courtship behavior not at other ostriches, but toward their human keepers.\nThe female common ostrich lays her fertilized eggs in a single communal nest, a simple pit, deep and wide, scraped in the ground by the male. The dominant female lays her eggs first; when it is time to cover them for incubation, she discards extra eggs from the weaker females, leaving about 20 in most cases. A female common ostrich can distinguish her own eggs from the others in a communal nest. Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs, though they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the adult bird \u2013 on average they are long, wide, and weigh , over 20 times the weight of a chicken's egg and only 1 to 4% the size of the female. They are glossy cream-colored, with thick shells marked by small pits.\nThe eggs are incubated by the females by day and by the males by night. This uses the coloration of the two sexes to escape detection of the nest. The drab female blends in with the sand, while the black male is nearly undetectable in the night. The incubation period is 35 to 45 days, which is rather short compared to other ratites. This is believed to be the case due to the high rate of predation. Typically, the male defends the hatchlings and teaches them to feed, although males and females cooperate in rearing chicks. Fewer than 10% of nests survive the 9-week period of laying and incubation, and of the surviving chicks, only 15% of those survive to 1 year of age. However, among those common ostriches who survive to adulthood, the species is one of the longest-living bird species. Common ostriches in captivity have lived to 62 years and 7 months.\nPredators.\nAs a flightless species in the rich biozone of the African savanna, the common ostrich faces a variety of formidable predators throughout its life cycle. Animals that prey on ostriches of all ages may include cheetahs, lions, leopards, African hunting dogs, and spotted hyenas. Predators of nests and young common ostriches include jackals, various birds of prey, warthogs, mongoose, and Egyptian vultures. Egyptian vultures have been known to hurl stones at ostrich eggs to crack them open so they can eat their contents.\nDue to predation pressure, common ostriches have many antipredator tactics. Though they can deliver formidable kicks, they use their great eyesight and speed to run from most of their predators. Since ostriches that have detected predators are almost impossible to catch, most predators will try to ambush an unsuspecting bird using obstructing vegetation or other objects. Some ostriches forage with other ostriches or mammals such as wildebeests and zebras to detect predators more efficiently. If the nest or young are threatened, either or both of the parents may create a distraction, feigning injury. However, they may sometimes fiercely fight predators, especially when chicks are being defended, and are capable of killing humans, hyenas, and even lions in such confrontations. In non-native areas, especially on ostrich farms in North America, adult ostriches have no known enemies due to their large size, intimidating presence and behaviour similar to that of overgrown guard dogs, with instances of them attacking and decapitating coyotes on one occasion. \nUsually, ostrich hunting is done by male cheetah coalitions in the Kalahari region during the night, when ostrich's vigilance is less effective. Cheetahs in other regions rarely hunt ostriches, but an exceptional coalition composed of three East African cheetahs has been reported in Kenya. Similarly, lions hunt ostriches mainly in the Kalahari region and not in other regions, or take ostriches as only a small percentage of their prey. Overall, due to their speed, vigilance, and possibly dangerous kick, ostriches are usually avoided by most predators, including lions, leopards, wild dogs, and cheetahs. Despite parental care, 90% is typical for chick mortality, most of it caused by predation.\nPhysiology.\nRespiration.\nAnatomy.\nMorphology of the common ostrich lung indicates that the structure conforms to that of the other avian species, but still retains parts of its primitive ratite structure. The opening to the respiratory pathway begins with the laryngeal cavity lying posterior to the choanae within the buccal cavity. The tip of the tongue then lies anterior to the choanae, excluding the nasal respiratory pathway from the buccal cavity. The trachea lies ventrally to the cervical vertebrae extending from the larynx to the syrinx, where the trachea enters the thorax, dividing into two primary bronchi, one to each lung, in which they continue directly through to become mesobronchi. Ten different air sacs attach to the lungs to form areas for respiration. The most posterior air sacs (abdominal and post-thoracic) differ in that the right abdominal air sac is relatively small, lying to the right of the mesentery, and dorsally to the liver. While the left abdominal air sac is large and lies to the left of the mesentery. The connection from the main mesobronchi to the more anterior air sacs including the interclavicular, lateral clavicular, and pre-thoracic sacs known as the ventrobronchi region. While the caudal end of the mesobronchus branches into several dorsobronchi. Together, the ventrobronchi and dorsobronchi are connected by intra-pulmonary airways, the parabronchi, which form an arcade structure within the lung called the paleopulmo. It is the only structure found in primitive birds such as ratites.\nThe largest air sacs found within the respiratory system are those of the post-thoracic region, while the others decrease in size respectively, the interclavicular (unpaired), abdominal, pre-thoracic, and lateral clavicular sacs. The adult common ostrich lung lacks connective tissue known as interparabronchial septa, which render strength to the non-compliant avian lung in other bird species. Due to this the lack of connective tissue surrounding the parabronchi and adjacent parabronchial lumen, they exchange blood capillaries or avascular epithelial plates. Like mammals, ostrich lungs contain an abundance of type II cells at gas exchange sites; an adaptation for preventing lung collapse during slight volume changes.\nFunction.\nThe common ostrich is an endotherm and maintains a body temperature of in its extreme living temperature conditions, such as the heat of the savanna and desert regions of Africa. The ostrich utilizes its respiratory system via a costal pump for ventilation rather than a diaphragmatic pump as seen in most mammals. Thus, they are able to use a series of air sacs connected to the lungs. The use of air sacs forms the basis for the three main avian respiratory characteristics:\nInhalation begins at the mouth and the nostrils located at the front of the beak. The air then flows through the anatomical dead space of a highly vascular trachea (c. ) and expansive bronchial system, where it is further conducted to the posterior air sacs. Air flow through the parabronchi of the paleopulmo is in the same direction to the dorsobronchi during inspiration and expiration. Inspired air moves into the respiratory system as a result of the expansion of thoraco abdominal cavity; controlled by inspiratory muscles. During expiration, oxygen poor air flows to the anterior air sacs and is expelled by the action of the expiratory muscles. The common ostrich air sacs play a key role in respiration, since they are capacious, and increase surface area (as described by the Fick Principle). The oxygen rich air flows unidirectionally across the respiratory surface of the lungs; providing the blood that has a crosscurrent flow with a high concentration of oxygen.\nTo compensate for the large \"dead\" space, the common ostrich trachea lacks valves to allow faster inspiratory air flow. In addition, the total lung capacity of the respiratory system, (including the lungs and ten air sacs) of a ostrich is about , with a tidal volume ranging from . The tidal volume is seen to double resulting in a 16-fold increase in ventilation. Overall, ostrich respiration can be thought of as a high velocity-low pressure system. At rest, there is a small pressure difference between the ostrich air sacs and the atmosphere, suggesting simultaneous filling and emptying of the air sacs.\nThe increase in respiration rate from the low range to the high range is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in respiration rate however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike most other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through panting without experiencing respiratory alkalosis by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During hyperpnea ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40\u201360\u00a0cycles per minute, versus their resting rate of 6\u201312\u00a0cycles per minute. Hot, dry, and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affect oxygen's diffusion rate (Henry's Law).\nCommon ostriches develop via Intussusceptive angiogenesis, a mechanism of blood vessel formation, characterizing many organs. It is not only involved in vasculature expansion, but also in angioadaptation of vessels to meet physiological requirements. The use of such mechanisms demonstrates an increase in the later stages of lung development, along with elaborate parabronchial vasculature, and reorientation of the gas exchange blood capillaries to establish the crosscurrent system at the blood-gas barrier. The blood\u2013gas barrier (BGB) of their lung tissue is thick. The advantage of this thick barrier may be protection from damage by large volumes of blood flow in times of activity, such as running, since air is pumped by the air sacs rather than the lung itself. As a result, the capillaries in the parabronchi have thinner walls, permitting more efficient gaseous exchange. In combination with separate pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems, it helps to reduce stress on the BGB.\nCirculation.\nHeart anatomy.\nThe common ostrich heart is a closed system, contractile chamber. It is composed of myogenic muscular tissue associated with heart contraction features. There is a double circulatory plan in place possessing both a pulmonary circuit and systemic circuit.\nThe common ostrich's heart has similar features to other avian species, like having a conically shaped heart and being enclosed by a pericardium layer. Moreover, similarities also include a larger right atrium volume and a thicker left ventricle to fulfil the systemic circuit. The ostrich heart has three features that are absent in related birds: \nThe atrioventricular node position differs from other fowl. It is located in the endocardium of the atrial surface of the right atrioventricular valve. It is not covered by connective tissue, which is characteristic of vertebrate heart anatomy. It also contains fewer myofibrils than usual myocardial cells. The AV node connects the atrial and ventricular chambers. It functions to carry the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricle. Upon view, the myocardial cells are observed to have large densely packed chromosomes within the nucleus.\nThe coronary arteries start in the right and left aortic sinus and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other domestic birds capable of flight have three or more coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the coronary arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the coronary groove and continues on into the tissue as interventricular branches toward the apex of the heart. The atria, ventricles, and septum are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the coronary arteries found within the heart tissue are small and supply the interventricular and right atrioventricular valve with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes. The interatrial artery of the ostrich is small in size and exclusively supplies blood to only part of the left auricle and interatrial septum.\nThese Purkinje fibers (p-fibers) found in the hearts moderator bands are a specialized cardiac muscle fiber that causes the heart to contract. The Purkinje cells are mostly found within both the endocardium and the sub-endocardium. The sinoatrial node shows a small concentration of Purkinje fibers, however, continuing through the conducting pathway of the heart the bundle of his shows the highest amount of these Purkinje fibers.\nBlood composition.\nThe red blood cell count per unit volume in the ostrich is about 40% of that of a human; however, the red blood cells of the ostrich are about three times larger than the red blood cells of a human. The blood oxygen affinity, known as P50, is higher than that of both humans and similar avian species. The reason for this decreased oxygen affinity is due to the hemoglobin configuration found in common ostrich blood. The common ostrich's tetramer is composed of hemoglobin type A and D, compared to typical mammalian tetramers composed of hemoglobin type A and B; hemoglobin D configuration causes a decreased oxygen affinity at the site of the respiratory surface.\nDuring the embryonic stage, Hemoglobin E is present. This subtype increases oxygen affinity in order to transport oxygen across the allantoic membrane of the embryo. This can be attributed to the high metabolic need of the developing embryo, thus high oxygen affinity serves to satisfy this demand. When the chick hatches hemoglobin E diminishes while hemoglobin A and D increase in concentration. This shift in hemoglobin concentration results in both decreased oxygen affinity and increased P50 value.\nFurthermore, the P50 value is influenced by differing organic modulators. In the typical mammalian RBC 2,3 \u2013 DPG causes a lower affinity for oxygen. 2,3- DPG constitutes approximately 42\u201347%, of the cells phosphate of the embryonic ostrich. However, the adult ostrich have no traceable 2,3- DPG.In place of 2,3-DPG the ostrich uses inositol polyphosphates (IPP), which vary from 1\u20136 phosphates per molecule. In relation to the IPP, the ostrich also uses ATP to lower oxygen affinity. ATP has a consistent concentration of phosphate in the cell \u2013 around 31% at incubation periods and dropping to 16\u201320% in 36-day-old chicks. However, IPP has low concentrations, around 4%, of total phosphate concentration in embryonic stages, but the IPP concentration jumps to 60% of total phosphate of the cell. The majority of phosphate concentration switches from 2,3- DPG to IPP, suggesting the result of the overall low oxygen affinity is due to these varying polyphosphates.\nConcerning immunological adaptation, it was discovered that wild common ostriches have a pronounced non-specific immunity defense, with blood content reflecting high values of lysosome and phagocyte cells in medium. This is in contrast to domesticated ostriches, who in captivity develop high concentration of immunoglobulin antibodies in their circulation, indicating an acquired immunological response. It is suggested that this immunological adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.\nOsmoregulation.\nPhysiological challenges.\nThe common ostrich is a xeric animal, due to the fact that it lives in habitats that are both dry and hot. Water is scarce in dry and hot environments, and this poses a challenge to the ostrich's water consumption. Also the ostrich is a ground bird and cannot fly to find water sources, which poses a further challenge. Because of their size, common ostriches cannot easily escape the heat of their environment; however, they dehydrate less than their small bird counterparts because of their small surface area to volume ratio. Hot, arid habitats pose osmotic stress, such as dehydration, which triggers the common ostrich's homeostatic response to osmoregulate.\nSystem overview.\nThe common ostrich is well-adapted to hot, arid environments through specialization of excretory organs. The common ostrich has an extremely long and developed colon \u2013 a length of approximately \u2013 between the http:// and the paired caeca, which are around long. A well-developed caeca is also found and, in combination with the rectum, forms the microbial fermentation chambers used for carbohydrate breakdown. The catabolism of carbohydrates produces around of water that can be used internally. The majority of their urine is stored in the coprodeum, and the feces are separately stored in the terminal colon. The coprodeum is located ventral to the terminal rectum and urodeum (where the ureters open). Found between the terminal rectum and coprodeum is a strong sphincter. The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in fecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma aldosterone, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of hyperosmotic urine; cloacal urine has been found to be 800 mOsm. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the common ostrich is therefore greater than one. Diffusion of water to the coprodeum (where urine is stored) from plasma across the epithelium is voided. This void is believed to be caused by the thick mucosal layering of the coprodeum.\nCommon ostriches have two kidneys, which are chocolate brown in color, are granular in texture, and lie in a depression in the pelvic cavity of the dorsal wall. They are covered by peritoneum and a layer of fat. Each kidney is about long, wide, and divided into a cranial, middle, and caudal sections by large veins. The caudal section is the largest, extending into the middle of the pelvis. The ureters leave the ventral caudomedial surface and continue caudally, near the midline into the opening of the urodeum of the cloaca. Although there is no bladder, a dilated pouch of ureter stores the urine until it is secreted continuously down from the ureters to the urodeum until discharged.\nKidney function.\nCommon ostrich kidneys are fairly large and so are able to hold significant amounts of solutes. Hence, common ostriches drink relatively large volumes of water daily and excrete generous quantities of highly concentrated urine. It is when drinking water is unavailable or withdrawn that the urine becomes highly concentrated with uric acid and urates. It seems that common ostriches who normally drink relatively large amounts of water tend to rely on renal conservation of water within the kidney system when drinking water is scarce. Though there have been no official detailed renal studies conducted on the flow rate (Poiseuille's Law) and composition of the ureteral urine in the ostrich, knowledge of renal function has been based on samples of cloacal urine, and samples or quantitative collections of voided urine. Studies have shown that the amount of water intake and dehydration impacts the plasma osmolality and urine osmolality within various sized ostriches. During a normal hydration state of the kidneys, young ostriches tend to have a measured plasma osmolality of 284 mOsm and urine osmolality of 62 mOsm. Adults have higher rates with a plasma osmolality of 330 mOsm and urine osmolality of 163 mOsm. The osmolality of both plasma and urine can alter in regards to whether there is an excess or depleted amount of water present within the kidneys. An interesting fact of common ostriches is that when water is freely available, the urine osmolality can reduce to 60\u201370 mOsm, not losing any necessary solutes from the kidneys when excess water is excreted. Dehydrated or salt-loaded ostriches can reach a maximal urine osmolality of approximately 800 mOsm. When the plasma osmolality has been measured simultaneously with the maximal osmotic urine, it is seen that the urine:plasma ratio is 2.6:1, the highest encountered among avian species. Along with dehydration, there is also a reduction in flow rate from 20 L\u00b7d\u22121 to only 0.3\u20130.5 L\u00b7d\u22121.\nIn mammals and common ostriches, the increase of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine flow rate (UFR) is due to a high protein diets. As seen in various studies, scientists have measured clearance of creatinine, a fairly reliable marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It has been seen that during normal hydration within the kidneys, the glomerular filtration rate is approximately 92\u00a0ml/min. However, when an ostrich experiences dehydration for at least 48 hours (2 days), this value diminishes to only 25% of the hydrated GFR rate. Thus in response to the dehydration, ostrich kidneys secrete small amounts of very viscous glomerular filtrates that have not been broken down and return them to the circulatory system through blood vessels. The reduction of GFR during dehydration is extremely high and so the fractional excretion of water (urine flow rate as a percentage of GFR) drops down from 15% at normal hydration to 1% during dehydration.\nWater intake and turnover.\nCommon ostriches employ adaptive features to manage the dry heat and solar radiation in their habitat. Ostriches will drink available water; however, they are limited in accessing water by being flightless. They are also able to harvest water through dietary means, consuming plants such as the \"Euphorbia heterochroma\" that hold up to 87% water.\nWater mass accounts for 68% of body mass in adult common ostriches; this is down from 84% water mass in 35-day-old chicks. The differing degrees of water retention are thought to be a result of varying body fat mass. In comparison to smaller birds ostriches have a lower evaporative water loss resulting from their small body surface area per unit weight.\nWhen heat stress is at its maximum, common ostriches are able to recover evaporative loss by using a metabolic water mechanism to counter the loss by urine, feces, and respiratory evaporation. An experiment to determine the primary source of water intake in the ostrich indicated that while the ostrich does employ a metabolic water production mechanism as a source of hydration, the most important source of water is food. When ostriches were restricted to the no food or water condition, the metabolic water production was only 0.5\u00a0L\u00b7d\u22121, while total water lost to urine, feces, and evaporation was 2.3\u00a0L\u00b7d\u22121. When the birds were given both water and food, total water gain was 8.5\u00a0L\u00b7d\u22121. In the food only condition total water gain was 10.1\u00a0L\u00b7d\u22121. These results show that the metabolic water mechanism is not able to sustain water loss independently and that food intake, specifically of plants with a high water content such as \"Euphorbia heterochroma\", is necessary to overcome water loss challenges in the common ostrich's arid habitat.\nIn times of water deprivation, urine electrolyte and osmotic concentration increases while urination rate decreases. Under these conditions urine solute:plasma ratio is approximately 2.5, or hyperosmotic; that is to say that the ratio of solutes to water in the plasma is shifted down whereby reducing osmotic pressure in the plasma. Water is then able to be held back from excretion, keeping the ostrich hydrated, while the passed urine contains higher concentrations of solute. This mechanism exemplifies how renal function facilitates water retention during periods of dehydration stress.\nNasal glands.\nA number of avian species use nasal salt glands, alongside their kidneys, to control hypertonicity in their blood plasma. However, the common ostrich shows no nasal glandular function in regard to this homeostatic process. Even in a state of dehydration, which increases the osmolality of the blood, nasal salt glands show no sizeable contribution of salt elimination. Also, the overall mass of the glands was less than that of the duck's nasal gland. The common ostrich, having a heavier body weight, should have larger, heavier nasal glands to more effectively excrete salt from a larger volume of blood, but this is not the case. These unequal proportions contribute to the assumption that the common ostrich's nasal glands do not play any role in salt excretion.\nBiochemistry.\nThe majority of the common ostrich's internal solutes are made up of sodium ions (), potassium ions (), chloride ions (), total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and acetate. The caecum contains a high water concentration with reduced levels nearing the terminal colon and exhibits a rapid fall in concentrations and small changes in and . \nThe colon is divided into three sections and takes part in solute absorption. The upper colon largely absorbs and SCFA and partially absorbs KCl. The middle colon absorbs and SCFA, with little net transfer of K+ and Cl\u2212. The lower colon then slightly absorbs and water and secretes . There is no net movements of and SCFA found in the lower colon.\nWhen the common ostrich is in a dehydrated state, plasma osmolality, , , and ions all increase; however, ions return to controlled concentration. The common ostrich also experiences an increase in haematocrit, resulting in a hypovolemic state. Two antidiuretic hormones, Arginine vasotocin (AVT) and angiotensin (AII), are increased in blood plasma as a response to hyperosmolality and hypovolemia. AVT triggers antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which targets the nephrons of the kidney. ADH causes a reabsorption of water from the lumen of the nephron to the extracellular fluid osmotically. These extracellular fluids then drain into blood vessels, causing a rehydrating effect. This drainage prevents loss of water by both lowering volume and increasing concentration of the urine. Angiotensin, on the other hand, causes vasoconstriction on the systemic arterioles and acts as a dipsogen for ostriches. Both of these antidiuretic hormones work together to maintain water levels in the body that would normally be lost due to the osmotic stress of the arid environment.\nOstriches are uricotelic, excreting nitrogen in the form of uric acid and related derivatives. Uric acid's low solubility in water gives a semi-solid paste consistency to the ostrich's nitrogenous waste.\nThermoregulation.\nCommon ostriches are homeothermic endotherms; they regulate a constant body temperature via regulating their metabolic heat rate. They closely regulate their core body temperature, but their appendages may be cooler in comparison as found with regulating species. The temperature of their beak, neck surfaces, lower legs, feet, and toes are regulated through heat exchange with the environment. Up to 40% of their produced metabolic heat is dissipated across these structures, which account for about 12% of their total surface area. Total evaporative water loss (TEWL) is statistically lower in the common ostrich than in membering ratites.\nAs ambient temperature increases, dry heat loss decreases, but evaporative heat loss increases because of increased respiration. As ostriches experience high ambient temperatures, circa , they become slightly hyperthermic; however, they can maintain a stable body temperature, around , for up to 8 hours in these conditions. When dehydrated, the common ostrich minimizes water loss, causing the body temperature to increase further. When the body heat is allowed to increase the temperature gradient between the common ostrich and ambient heat is equilibrated.\nPhysical adaptations.\nCommon ostriches have developed a comprehensive set of behavioral adaptations for thermoregulation, such as altering their feathers. Common ostriches display a feather fluffing behavior that aids them in thermoregulation by regulating convective heat loss at high ambient temperatures. They may also physically seek out shade in times of high ambient temperatures. When feather fluffing, they contract their muscles to raise their feathers to increase the air space next to their skin. This air space provides an insulating thickness of . The ostrich will also expose the thermal windows of their unfeathered skin to enhance convective and radiative loss in times of heat stress. At higher ambient temperatures lower appendage temperature increases to difference from ambient temperature. Neck surfaces are around difference at most ambient temperatures, except when temperatures are around it was only above ambient.\nAt low ambient temperatures the common ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low conductance coefficient of air allows less heat to be lost to the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for common ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather-heavy areas such as the body, thighs, and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs to reduce heat loss to the environment, along with undergoing piloerection and shivering when faced with low ambient temperatures.\nInternal adaptations.\nThe use of countercurrent heat exchange with blood flow allows for regulated conservation/ elimination of heat of appendages. When ambient temperatures are low, heterotherms will constrict their arterioles to reduce heat loss along skin surfaces. The reverse occurs at high ambient temperatures, arterioles dilate to increase heat loss.\nAt ambient temperatures below their body temperatures (thermal neutral zone (TNZ)), common ostriches decrease body surface temperatures so that heat loss occurs only across about 10% of total surface area. This 10% include critical areas that require blood flow to remain high to prevent freezing, such as their eyes. Their eyes and ears tend to be the warmest regions. It has been found that temperatures of lower appendages were no more than above ambient temperature, which minimizes heat exchange between feet, toes, wings, and legs.\nBoth the Gular and air sacs, being close to body temperature, are the main contributors to heat and water loss. Surface temperature can be affected by the rate of blood flow to a certain area and also by the surface area of the surrounding tissue. The ostrich reduces blood flow to the trachea to cool itself and vasodilates to its blood vessels around the gular region to raise the temperature of the tissue. The air sacs are poorly vascularized but show an increased temperature, which aids in heat loss.\nCommon ostriches have evolved a 'selective brain cooling' mechanism as a means of thermoregulation. This modality allows the common ostrich to manage the temperature of the blood going to the brain in response to the extreme ambient temperature of the surroundings. The morphology for heat exchange occurs via cerebral arteries and the ophthalmic rete, a network of arteries originating from the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic rete is analogous to the carotid rete found in mammals, as it also facilitates transfer of heat from arterial blood coming from the core to venous blood returning from the evaporative surfaces at the head.\nResearchers suggest that common ostriches also employ a 'selective brain warming' mechanism in response to cooler surrounding temperatures in the evenings. The brain was found to maintain a warmer temperature when compared to carotid arterial blood supply. Researchers hypothesize three mechanisms that could explain this finding:\nFurther research will need to be done to find how this occurs.\nBreathing adaptations.\nThe common ostrich has no sweat glands, and under heat stress they rely on panting to reduce their body temperature. Panting increases evaporative heat (and water) loss from its respiratory surfaces, therefore forcing air and heat removal without the loss of metabolic salts. Panting allows the common ostrich to have a very effective respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL). Heat dissipated by respiratory evaporation increases linearly with ambient temperature, matching the rate of heat production. As a result of panting the common ostrich should eventually experience alkalosis. However, The CO2 concentration in the blood does not change when hot ambient temperatures are experienced. This effect is caused by a lung surface shunt. The lung is not completely shunted, allowing enough oxygen to fulfill the bird's metabolic needs. The common ostrich utilizes gular fluttering, rapid rhythmic contraction and relaxation of throat muscles, in a similar way to panting. Both these behaviors allow the ostrich to actively increase the rate of evaporative cooling.\nIn hot temperatures water is lost via respiration. Moreover, varying surface temperatures within the respiratory tract contribute differently to overall heat and water loss through panting. The surface temperature of the gular area is , that of the tracheal area is between , and that of both anterior and posterior air sacs is . The long trachea, being cooler than body temperature, is a site of water evaporation.\nAs ambient air becomes hotter, additional evaporation can take place lower in the trachea making its way to the posterior sacs, shunting the lung surface. The trachea acts as a buffer for evaporation because of the length and the controlled vascularization. The Gular is also heavily vascularized; its purpose is for cooling blood, but also evaporation, as previously stated. Air flowing through the trachea can be either laminar or turbulent depending on the state of the bird. When the common ostrich is breathing normally, under no heat stress, air flow is laminar. When the common ostrich is experiencing heat stress from the environment the air flow is considered turbulent. This suggests that laminar air flow causes little to no heat transfer, while under heat stress turbulent airflow can cause maximum heat transfer within the trachea.\nMetabolism.\nCommon ostriches are able to attain their necessary energetic requirements via the oxidation of absorbed nutrients. Much of the metabolic rate in animals is dependent upon their allometry, the relationship between body size to shape, anatomy, physiology, and behavior of an animal. Hence, it is plausible to state that metabolic rate in animals with larger masses is greater than animals with a smaller mass.\nWhen a bird is inactive and unfed, and the ambient temperature (i.e. in the thermo-neutral zone) is high, the energy expended is at its minimum. This level of expenditure is better known as the basal metabolic rate (BMR), and can be calculated by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed during various activities. Therefore, in common ostriches we see use of more energy when compared to smaller birds in absolute terms, but less per unit mass.\nA key point when looking at the common ostrich metabolism is to note that it is a non-passerine bird. Thus, BMR in ostriches is particularly low with a value of only 0.113 mL O2 g\u22121 h\u22121. This value can further be described using Kleiber's law, which relates the BMR to the body mass of an animal.\nMetabolic rate = 70\"M\"0.75\nwhere \"M\" is body mass, and metabolic rate is measured in kcal per day.\nIn common ostriches, a BMR (mL O2 g\u22121 h\u22121) = 389\u00a0kg0.73, describing a line parallel to the intercept with only about 60% in relation to other non-passerine birds.\nAlong with BMR, energy is also needed for a range of other activities. If the ambient temperature is lower than the thermo-neutral zone, heat is produced to maintain body temperature. So, the metabolic rate in a resting, unfed bird, that is producing heat is known as the standard metabolic rate (SMR) or resting metabolic rate (RMR). The common ostrich SMR has been seen to be approximately 0.26 mL O2 g\u22121 h\u22121, almost 2.3 times the BMR. On another note, animals that engage in extensive physical activity employ substantial amounts of energy for power. This is known as the maximum metabolic scope. In an ostrich, it is seen to be at least 28 times greater than the BMR. Likewise, the daily energy turnover rate for an ostrich with access to free water is 12,700\u00a0kJ\u00a0d\u22121, equivalent to 0.26\u00a0mL\u00a0O2\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0h\u22121.\nStatus and conservation.\nThe wild common ostrich population has declined drastically in the last 200 years, with most surviving birds in reserves or on farms. However, its range remains very large (), leading the IUCN and BirdLife International to treat it as a species of least concern. Of its five subspecies, the Arabian ostrich (\"S. c. syriacus\") became extinct around 1966. North African ostrich populations are protected under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning commercial international trade is prohibited and non-commercial trade is strictly regulated.\nHumans.\nCommon ostriches have inspired cultures and civilizations for 5,000 years in Mesopotamia and African centres like Egypt and the Kingdom of Kush. A statue of Arsinoe II of Egypt riding a common ostrich was found in a tomb in Egypt. Hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari use ostrich eggshells as water containers, punching a hole in them. They also produce jewelry from it. The presence of such eggshells with engraved hatched symbols dating from the Howiesons Poort period of the Middle Stone Age at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa suggests common ostriches were an important part of human life as early as 60,000 BP.\nIn Eastern Christianity it is common to hang decorated common ostrich eggs on the chains holding the oil lamps. The initial reason was probably to prevent mice and rats from climbing down the chain to eat the oil. Another, symbolical explanation is based in the fictitious tradition that female common ostriches do not sit on their eggs, but stare at them incessantly until they hatch out, because if they stop staring even for a second the egg will addle. This is equated to the obligation of the Christian to direct his entire attention towards God during prayer, lest the prayer be fruitless.\n\"Head in the sand\" misconception.\nContrary to popular assumptions, ostriches do not bury their heads in sand to avoid danger. This misconception likely began with Pliny the Elder (23\u201379\u00a0CE), who wrote that ostriches \"imagine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that the whole of their body is concealed.\" This may have been a misunderstanding of their sticking their heads in the sand to swallow sand and pebbles to help digest their fibrous food, or, as National Geographic suggests, of the defensive behavior of lying low, so that they may appear from a distance to have their head buried. Another possible origin for the assumption lies with the fact that ostriches keep their eggs in holes in the sand instead of nests and must rotate them using their beaks during incubation; digging the hole, placing the eggs, and rotating them might each be mistaken for an attempt to bury their heads in the sand.\nEconomic use.\nIn Roman times, there was a demand for common ostriches to use in \"venatio\" games or cooking. They have been hunted and farmed for their feathers, which at various times have been popular for ornamentation in fashionable clothing (such as hats during the 19th century). Their skins are valued for their leather. In the 18th century they were almost hunted to extinction; farming for feathers began in the 19th century. At the start of the 20th century there were over 700,000 birds in captivity. The market for feathers collapsed after World War I, but commercial farming for feathers and later for skins and meat became widespread during the 1970s. \nCommon ostriches have been farmed in South Africa since the beginning of the 19th century. According to Frank G. Carpenter, the English are credited with first taming common ostriches outside Cape Town. Farmers captured baby common ostriches and raised them successfully on their property, and they were able to obtain a crop of feathers every seven to eight months instead of killing wild common ostriches for their feathers. Feathers are still commercially harvested. It is claimed that common ostriches produce the strongest commercial leather. Common ostrich meat tastes similar to lean beef and is low in fat and cholesterol, as well as high in calcium, protein, and iron. It is considered to be both poultry and red meat. Uncooked, it is dark red or cherry red, a little darker than beef. Ostrich stew is a dish prepared using common ostrich meat.\nSome common ostrich farms also cater to agri-tourism, which may produce a substantial portion of the farm's income. This may include tours of the farmlands, souvenirs, or even ostrich rides.\nAttacks.\nCommon ostriches typically avoid humans in the wild, since they correctly assess humans as potential predators. If approached, they often run away, but sometimes ostriches can be very aggressive when threatened, especially if cornered, and may also attack if they feel the need to defend their territories or offspring. Similar behaviors are noted in captive or domesticated common ostriches, which retain the same natural instincts and can occasionally respond aggressively to stress. When attacking a person, common ostriches deliver slashing kicks with their powerful feet, armed with long claws, with which they can disembowel or kill a person with a single blow. In one study of common ostrich attacks, it was estimated that two to three attacks that result in serious injury or death occur each year in the area of Oudtshoorn, South Africa, where a large number of common ostrich farms are set next to both feral and wild common ostrich populations, making them statistically, the world's most dangerous bird.\nRacing.\nIn some countries, people race each other on the backs of common ostriches. The practice is common in Africa and is relatively unusual elsewhere. The common ostriches are ridden in the same way as horses with special saddles, reins, and bits. However, they are harder to manage than horses. The practice is becoming less common due to ethical concerns, and nowadays ostrich farms set a limit weight for people to ride ostriches, making the activity mostly suited for children and smaller adults.\nThe racing is also a part of modern South African culture. Within the United States, a tourist attraction in Jacksonville, Florida, called 'The Ostrich Farm' opened up in 1892; it and its races became one of the most famous early attractions in the history of Florida. Likewise, the arts scene in Indio, California, consists of both ostrich and camel racing.\nChandler, Arizona, hosts the annual \"Ostrich Festival\", which features common ostrich races. Racing has also occurred at many other locations such as Virginia City in Nevada, Canterbury Park in Minnesota, Prairie Meadows in Iowa, Ellis Park in Kentucky, and the Fairgrounds in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22546", "revid": "140154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22546", "title": "Orgasm", "text": "Intense physical sensation of sexual release\nOrgasm (from Greek , ; \"excitement, swelling\"), sexual climax, or simply climax, is the sudden release of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, characterized by intense sexual pleasure resulting in rhythmic, involuntary muscular contractions in the pelvic region. Orgasms are controlled by the involuntary or autonomic nervous system and are experienced by both males and females; the body's response includes muscular spasms (in multiple areas), a general euphoric sensation, and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations. The period after orgasm (known as the resolution phase) is typically a relaxing experience due to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin, as well as endorphins (or \"endogenous morphine\").\nHuman orgasms usually result from physical sexual stimulation of the penis in males (typically accompanied by ejaculation) and of the clitoris (and vagina) in females. Sexual stimulation can be by masturbation or with a sexual partner (penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or other sexual activity). Physical stimulation is not a requisite, as it is possible to reach orgasm through psychological means. Getting to orgasm may be difficult without a suitable psychological state. During sleep, a sex dream can trigger an orgasm and the release of sexual fluids (nocturnal emission).\nThe health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state, as well as changes in the central nervous system, such as a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex, while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the limbic (i.e., \"bordering\") areas of the brain. There are sexual dysfunctions involving orgasm, such as \"anorgasmia\".\nThe importance of reaching orgasm for sex to be satisfying varies between individuals, and theories about the biological and evolutionary functions of orgasm differ. \nDefinitions.\nIn a clinical context, orgasm is usually defined strictly by the muscular contractions involved during sexual activity, along with the characteristic patterns of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and often respiration rate and depth. This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region. Definitions of orgasm vary, and at least 26 definitions of orgasm are listed in the 2001 journal \"Clinical Psychology Review\".\nThere is some debate about whether certain types of sexual sensations should be accurately classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by G-spot stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour. The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm. In these and similar cases, the sensations experienced are subjective and do not necessarily involve the involuntary contractions characteristic of orgasm. In both sexes, they are extremely pleasurable and often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with vasocongestion and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern findings support the distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm. For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.\nAchievement.\nOrgasms can be achieved during a variety of activities, including vaginal, anal, oral, manual, and non-penetrative sex, or masturbation. They may also be achieved by the use of a sex toy or an erotic electrostimulation. Achieving orgasm by stimulation of the nipples or other erogenous zones is rarer. Multiple orgasms (orgasms that occur within a short period of one another) are also possible, especially in women, but they are also uncommon. \nIn addition to physical stimulation, orgasm can be achieved from psychological arousal alone, such as during dreaming (nocturnal emission for males or females) or by forced orgasm. Orgasm by psychological stimulation alone was first reported among people who had spinal cord injuries. Although sexual function and sexuality after spinal cord injury are very often impacted, this injury does not deprive one of sexual feelings such as sexual arousal and erotic desires.\nScientific literature focuses on the psychology of female orgasm significantly more than it does on the psychology of male orgasm, which \"appears to reflect the assumption that female orgasm is psychologically more complex than male orgasm,\" but \"the limited empirical evidence available suggests that male and female orgasm may bear more similarities than differences. In one controlled study by Vance and Wagner (1976), independent raters could not differentiate written descriptions of male versus female orgasm experiences\".\nFemale.\nFactors and variability.\nIn women, the most common way to achieve orgasm is by direct sexual stimulation of the clitoris (meaning consistent digital, oral, or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris). General statistics indicate that 70\u201380 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, although indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient. The Mayo Clinic states, \"Orgasms vary in intensity, and women vary in the frequency of their orgasms and the amount of stimulation necessary to trigger an orgasm.\" Clitoral orgasms are easier to achieve because the glans of the clitoris, or clitoris as a whole, has more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings, which is as many (or more in some cases) nerve endings as are present in the human penis or glans penis. As the clitoris is homologous to the penis, it is equivalent in its capacity to receive sexual stimulation.\nOne misconception, particularly in older research publications, is that the vagina is completely insensitive. In reality, there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive. With regard to specific density of nerve endings, while the area commonly described as the G-spot may produce an orgasm, and the urethral sponge (the area in which the G-spot may be found) runs along the \"roof\" of the vagina and can create pleasurable sensations when stimulated, intense sexual pleasure (including orgasm) from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris. The greatest concentration of vaginal nerve endings are at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina.\nSex educator Rebecca Chalker states that only one part of the clitoris, the urethral sponge, is in contact with the penis, fingers, or a dildo in the vagina. Hite and Chalker state that the tip of the clitoris and the inner lips, which are also very sensitive, are not receiving direct stimulation during penetrative intercourse. Because of this, some couples may engage in the woman on top position or the coital alignment technique to maximize clitoral stimulation. For some women, the clitoris is very sensitive after climax, making additional stimulation initially painful.\nMasters and Johnson argue that all women are potentially multiply orgasmic, but that multiply orgasmic men are rare, and stated that \"the female is capable of rapid return to orgasm immediately following an orgasmic experience, if re-stimulated before tensions have dropped below plateau phase response levels\". Though it is generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first one, some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. After the initial orgasm, subsequent orgasms for women may be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates.\nClitoral and vaginal categories.\nDiscussions of female orgasm are complicated by orgasms in women typically being divided into two categories: clitoral orgasm and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasm. In 1973, Irving Singer theorized that there are three types of female orgasms; he categorized these as vulval, uterine, and blended, but because he was a philosopher, \"these categories were generated from descriptions of orgasm in literature rather than laboratory studies.\" In 1982, Ladas, Whipple and Perry also proposed three categories: the tenting type (derived from clitoral stimulation), the A-frame type (derived from G-spot stimulation), and the blended type (derived from clitoral and G-spot stimulation). In 1999, Whipple and Komisaruk proposed cervix stimulation as being able to cause a fourth type of female orgasm.\nFemale orgasms by means other than clitoral or vaginal/G-spot stimulation are less prevalent in scientific literature, and most scientists contend that no distinction should be made between \"types\" of female orgasm. This distinction began with Sigmund Freud, who postulated the concept of \"vaginal orgasm\" as separate from clitoral orgasm. In 1905, Freud stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. While Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, the consequences of this theory were considerable. Many women felt inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone, involving little or no clitoral stimulation, as Freud's theory made penile\u2013vaginal intercourse the central component to women's sexual satisfaction.\nThe first major national surveys of sexual behavior in the U.S. were the Kinsey Reports. Alfred Kinsey was the first researcher to harshly criticize Freud's ideas about female sexuality and orgasm when, through his interviews with thousands of women, Kinsey found that most of the women he surveyed could not have vaginal orgasms. He \"criticized Freud and other theorists for projecting male constructs of sexuality onto women\" and \"viewed the clitoris as the main center of sexual response\" and the vagina as \"relatively unimportant\" for sexual satisfaction, relaying that \"few women inserted fingers or objects into their vaginas when they masturbated.\" He \"concluded that satisfaction from penile penetration [is] mainly psychological or perhaps the result of referred sensation\".\nMasters and Johnson's research into the female sexual response cycle, as well as Shere Hite's, generally supported Kinsey's findings about female orgasm. Masters and Johnson's research on the topic came at the time of the second-wave feminist movement and inspired feminists such as Anne Koedt, author of \"The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm\", to speak about the \"false distinction\" made between clitoral and vaginal orgasms and women's biology not being properly analyzed.\nClitoral and vaginal relationships.\nAccounts that the vagina is capable of producing orgasms continue to be subject to debate because, in addition to the vagina's low concentration of nerve endings, reports of the G-spot's location are inconsistent\u2014it appears to be nonexistent in some women and may be an extension of another structure, such as the Skene's gland or the clitoris, which is a part of the Skene's gland. In a January 2012 \"The Journal of Sexual Medicine\" review examining years of research into the existence of the G-spot, scholars state that \"[r]eports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth\".\nPossible explanations for the G-spot were examined by Masters and Johnson, who were the first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. In addition to observing that the majority of their female subjects could only have clitoral orgasms, they found that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response. On this basis, they argue that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood; their notion that this provides the clitoris with sufficient sexual stimulation has been criticized by researchers such as Elisabeth Lloyd.\nAustralian urologist Helen O'Connell's 2005 research additionally indicates a connection between orgasms experienced vaginally and the clitoris, suggesting that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina and that therefore clitoral and vaginal orgasms are of the same origin. Some studies, using medical ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse, but O'Connell suggests that the clitoris's interconnected relationship with the vagina is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-spot. Having used MRI technology which enabled her to note a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the \"clitoral bulbs\" and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina, she stated that the vaginal wall is the clitoris; lifting the skin off the vagina on the side walls reveals the bulbs of the clitoris\u2014triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue. O'Connell et al., who performed dissections on the female genitals of cadavers and used photography to map the structure of nerves in the clitoris, were already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans and asserted in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with the clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks. They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissue and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones, and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others.\nFrench researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Fold\u00e8s report similar findings to those of O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D sonogram via medical ultrasound of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina, arguing that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible. In their 2009 published study, the \"coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall\". Buisson and Fold\u00e8s suggest \"the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction\".\nSupporting a distinct G-spot is a study by Rutgers University, published 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; brain scans showed that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall\u00a0\u2013 where the G-spot is reported to be\u00a0\u2013 when several women stimulated themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine. \"I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing,\" stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. \"It's not like saying, 'What is the thyroid gland?' The G-spot is more of a thing like New York City is a thing. It's a region, it's a convergence of many different structures.\" Commenting on Komisaruk's research and other findings, Emmanuele\u00a0A. Jannini, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Aquila in Italy, acknowledges a series of essays published in March 2012 in \"The Journal of Sexual Medicine\", which document evidence that vaginal and clitoral orgasms are separate phenomena that activate different areas of the brain and possibly suggest key psychological differences between women.\nOther factors and research.\nRegular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, known as anorgasmia, is significantly more common in women than in men (see below). In addition to sexual dysfunction being a cause for women's inability to reach orgasm, or the amount of time for sexual arousal needed to reach orgasm being variable and longer in women than in men, other factors include a lack of communication between sexual partners about what is needed for the woman to reach orgasm, feelings of sexual inadequacy in either partner, a focus on only penetration (vaginal or otherwise), and men generalizing the trigger for female orgasm based on their own sexual experiences with other women.\nScholars state \"many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse [vaginal sex]\" and that \"[e]ven the word \"foreplay\" suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event.'...Because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men, they are more likely than men to have faked an orgasm\". Sex counselor Ian Kerner states, \"It's a myth that using the penis is the main way to pleasure a woman.\" He cites research concluding that women reach orgasm about 25 percent of the time with intercourse, compared with 81 percent of the time during oral sex (cunnilingus).\nIn the first large-scale empirical study worldwide to link specific practices with orgasm, reported in the \"Journal of Sex Research\" in 2006, demographic and sexual history variables were comparatively weakly associated with orgasm. Data was analyzed from the Australian Study of Health and Relationships, a national telephone survey of sexual behavior and attitudes and sexual health knowledge carried out in 2001\u201302, with a representative sample of 19,307 Australians aged 16 to 59. Practices included \"vaginal intercourse alone (12%), vaginal + manual stimulation of the man's and/or woman's genitals (49%), and vaginal intercourse + manual + oral (32%)\" and the \"[e]ncounters may also have included other practices. Men had an orgasm in 95 percent of encounters and women in 69 percent. Generally, the more practices engaged in, the higher a woman's chance of having an orgasm. Women were more likely to reach orgasm in encounters including cunnilingus\". Other studies suggest that women exposed to lower levels of prenatal androgens are more likely to experience orgasm during vaginal intercourse than other women.\nExercise-induced.\nKinsey, in his 1953 book \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\", states that exercise could bring about sexual pleasure, including orgasm. A review in 1990 on the sexual response as exercise states that the field was poorly researched and that aerobic or isotonic exercise that resembles sexual activity or sexual positions can induce sexual pleasure, including orgasm. A 2007 review of the relationship between pelvic floor dysfunction and sexual problems in men and women finds that they are commonly linked and suggests that physical therapy strengthening the pelvic floor could help address the sexual problems but that it was not well studied enough to recommend. Starting in at least 2007, the term \"coregasm\" was used in popular media to refer to exercise-induced orgasm, or in academic parlance \"exercise-induced sexual pleasure\", and an extensive discussion of the \"yogasm\" occurred in a 2011 \"Daily Beast\" posting. A paper published in 2012 presents results of an online survey of women who had experienced an orgasm or other sexual pleasure during exercise. The paper was widely discussed in popular media when it was published. The authors of the paper said that research on the relationship between exercise and sexual response was still lacking. Using data from the nationally representative 2014 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, a 2021 study estimated that about 9% of U.S. adults had experienced an orgasm during exercise at least once. \nMale.\nVariability.\nIn men, the most common way of achieving orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation of the penis. This is usually accompanied by ejaculation, but it is possible, though rare, for men to orgasm without ejaculation (known as a \"dry orgasm\"). Prepubescent boys have dry orgasms. Dry orgasms can also occur as a result of retrograde ejaculation, or hypogonadism. Men may also ejaculate without reaching orgasm, which is known as anorgasmic ejaculation. They may also achieve orgasm by stimulation of the prostate (see below).\nTwo-stage model.\nThe traditional view of male orgasm is that there are two stages: emission accompanying orgasm, almost instantly followed by a refractory period. The refractory period is the recovery phase after orgasm during which it is physiologically impossible for a man to have additional orgasms. In 1966, Masters and Johnson published pivotal research about the phases of sexual stimulation. Their work included women and men and\u2014unlike Kinsey in 1948 and 1953\u2014tried to determine the physiological stages before and after orgasm.\nMasters and Johnson state that in the first stage, \"accessory organs contract and the male can feel the ejaculation coming; two to three seconds later the ejaculation occurs, which the man cannot constrain, delay, or in any way control\" and in the second stage, \"the male feels pleasurable contractions during ejaculation, reporting greater pleasure tied to a greater volume of ejaculate\". They report \"for the man the resolution phase includes a superimposed refractory period\" and \"many males below the age of 30, but relatively few thereafter, have the ability to ejaculate frequently and are subject to only very short refractory periods during the resolution phase\". Masters and Johnson equate male orgasm and ejaculation and maintain the necessity for a refractory period between orgasms.\nMultiplicity.\nThere has been little scientific study of multiple orgasms in men. Dunn and Trost define multiple male orgasms as \"two or more orgasms with or without ejaculation and without, or with only very limited, de-tumescence (loss of erection) during one and the same sexual encounter\". Although it is rare for men to achieve multiple orgasms, some men have reported having multiple consecutive orgasms, particularly without ejaculation. There may not be an obvious refractory period, and the final orgasm may cause a refractory period. Multiple orgasms are more commonly reported in very young men than in older men. In younger men, the refractory period may only last a few minutes, but in older men it may last more than an hour.\nAn increased production of oxytocin during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the refractory period, and the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. A scientific study to successfully document natural, fully ejaculatory, multiple orgasms in an adult man was conducted at Rutgers University in 1995. During the study, six fully ejaculatory orgasms were experienced in 36 minutes, with no apparent refractory period.\nAnal and prostate stimulation.\nIn both sexes, pleasure can be derived from the nerve endings around the anus and the anus itself, such as during anal sex. Men can achieve orgasms through prostate stimulation alone. The prostate is the male homologue (equivalent) to the Skene's glands (which are believed to be connected to the female G-spot), and can be sexually stimulated through anal sex, perineum massage or a vibrator. Much of the available information about prostate-induced orgasms comes from anecdotal reports by individuals, and the exact mechanisms by which such orgasms are produced are unclear; some sources suggest this occurs via stimulation of nerves in the prostatic plexus surrounding the organ, others suggest it is via nerves within the prostate itself, and others say changes in the brain (neuroplasticity) are required to derive pleasure from prostate stimulation. Regardless, prostate-induced orgasms are often reported to be intensely pleasurable. Prostate stimulation can produce a deeper orgasm, described by some men as more widespread and intense, longer-lasting, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only. The practice of pegging (consisting of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a strap-on dildo) stimulates the prostate. It is typical for a man to not reach orgasm as a receptive partner solely from anal sex.\nFor women, penile\u2013anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris by the shared sensory nerves, especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris. The G-spot area, which is considered to be interconnected with the clitoris, may also be indirectly stimulated during anal sex. Although the anus has many nerve endings, their purpose is not specifically for inducing orgasm, and so a woman achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation is rare. Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, while engaging in anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm during it.\nThe aforementioned orgasms are sometimes referred to as \"anal orgasms\", but sexologists and sex educators generally believe that orgasms derived from anal penetration are the result of the relationship between the nerves of the anus, rectum, clitoris or G-spot area in women, and the anus's proximity to the prostate and relationship between the anal and rectal nerves in men, rather than orgasms originating from the anus itself.\nNipple stimulation.\nFor women, stimulation of the breast area during sexual intercourse or foreplay, or solely having the breasts fondled, can create mild to intense orgasms, sometimes referred to as a \"breast orgasm\" or \"nipple orgasm\". Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation. Before Komisaruk et al.'s fMRI research on nipple stimulation in 2011, reports of women achieving orgasm from nipple stimulation relied solely on anecdotal evidence. Komisaruk's study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix, and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex (\"the genital area of the brain\").\nAn orgasm is believed to occur in part because of oxytocin, which is produced in the body during sexual excitement and arousal, and labor. It has also been shown that oxytocin is produced when a man or woman's nipples are stimulated and become erect. Komisaruk also relays that preliminary data suggests that nipple nerves may directly link up with the relevant parts of the brain without uterine mediation, acknowledging the men in his study who showed the same pattern of nipple stimulation activating genital brain regions.\nMedical aspects.\nPhysiological responses.\nMasters and Johnson were some of the first researchers to study the sexual response cycle in the early 1960s, based on the observation of 382 women and 312 men. They describe a cycle that begins with excitement as blood rushes into the genitals, then reaches a plateau during which they are fully aroused, which leads to orgasm, and finally resolution, in which the blood leaves the genitals.\nIn the 1970s, Kaplan added the category of desire to the cycle, which she argues precedes sexual excitation. She states that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness, and the failure of communication can interfere with desire and orgasm. In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as a linear progression. In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm and is in turn fueled by the rest of the orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, she suggests that it is just one point in the circle and that people could feel sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end goal of all sexual activity.\nFemales.\nA woman's orgasm may, in some cases, last a little longer than a man's. Women's orgasms have been estimated to last on average approximately 20 seconds and to consist of a series of muscular contractions in the pelvic area that includes the vagina, the uterus, and the anus. For some women, on some occasions, these contractions begin soon after the woman reports that the orgasm has started and continue at intervals of about one second with initially increasing and then reducing intensity. In some instances, the series of regular contractions is followed by a few additional contractions or shudders at irregular intervals. In other cases, the woman reports having an orgasm, but no pelvic contractions are measured at all.\nWomen's orgasms are preceded by the erection of the clitoris and moistening of the opening of the vagina. Some women exhibit a sex flush, a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman nears orgasm, the clitoral glans retracts under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (inner lips) become darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.\nElsewhere in the body, myofibroblasts of the nipple-areolar complex contract, causing erection of the nipples and contraction of the areolar diameter, reaching their maximum at the start of orgasm. A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina, anus, and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. Most women find these contractions very pleasurable.\nResearchers from the University Medical Center of Groningen in the Netherlands correlated the sensation of orgasm with muscular contractions occurring at a frequency of 8\u201313\u00a0Hz centered in the pelvis and measured in the anus. They argue that the presence of this particular frequency of contractions can distinguish between voluntary contraction of these muscles and spontaneous involuntary contractions, and appears to more accurately correlate with orgasm as opposed to other metrics like heart rate that only measure excitation. They assert that they have identified \"[t]he first objective and quantitative measure that has a strong correspondence with the subjective experience that orgasm ultimately is\" and state that the measure of contractions that occur at a frequency of 8\u201313\u00a0Hz is specific to orgasm. They found that using this metric they could distinguish between rest, voluntary muscular contractions, and even unsuccessful orgasm attempts.\nSince ancient times in Western Europe, women could be medically diagnosed with a disorder called female hysteria, the symptoms of which included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, muscle spasm, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and \"a tendency to cause trouble\". Women considered to have the condition would sometimes undergo \"pelvic massage\": stimulation of the genitals by the doctor until the woman experienced \"hysterical paroxysm\" (i.e., orgasm). Paroxysm was regarded as a medical treatment and not a sexual release. The disorder has ceased to be recognized as a medical condition since the 1920s.\nMales.\nAs a man nears orgasm during stimulation of the penis, he feels an intense and highly pleasurable pulsating sensation of neuromuscular euphoria. These pulsating sensations originate from the contractions of pelvic floor muscles that begin in the anal sphincter and travel to the tip of the penis, commonly described as a \"throbbing\" or \"tingling\" sensation. They eventually increase in speed and intensity as the orgasm approaches, until a final \"plateau\" (the orgasmic) pleasure is sustained for several seconds.\nDuring orgasm a male experiences rapid, rhythmic contractions of the anal sphincter, the prostate, and the bulbospongiosus muscles of the penis. The sperm are transmitted up the vasa deferentia from the testicles, into the prostate gland as well as through the seminal vesicles to produce what is known as semen. The prostate produces a secretion that forms one of the components of ejaculate. Except for in cases of a dry orgasm, contraction of the sphincter and prostate force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. The process takes from three to ten seconds and produces a pleasurable feeling. Ejaculation may continue for a few seconds after the euphoric sensation gradually tapers off. It is believed that the feeling of \"orgasm\" varies from one man to another. After ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs, during which a man cannot achieve another orgasm. This can last anywhere from less than a minute to several hours or days, depending on age and other individual factors.\nBrain.\nThere have been very few studies correlating orgasm and brain activity in real time. One study examined 12 healthy women using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner while they were being stimulated by their partners. Brain changes were observed and compared between states of rest, sexual stimulation, faked orgasm, and actual orgasm. Differences were reported in the brains of men and women during stimulation. Changes in brain activity were observed in both sexes, as regions associated with behavioral control, fear, and anxiety shut down. Regarding these, Gert Holstege said in an interview with \"The Times\", \"What this means is that deactivation, letting go of all fear and anxiety, might be the most important thing, even necessary, to have an orgasm.\"\nWhile stroking the clitoris, the parts of the female brain responsible for processing fear, anxiety, and behavioral control start to diminish in activity. This reaches a peak at orgasm when the female brain's emotion centers are effectively closed down to produce an almost trance-like state. Holstege is quoted as saying, at the 2005 meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Development, \"At the moment of orgasm, women do not have any emotional feelings.\" A subsequent report by Rudie Kortekaas, et al. states, \"Gender commonalities were most evident during orgasm... From these results, we conclude that during the sexual act, differential brain responses across genders are principally related to the stimulatory (plateau) phase and not to the orgasmic phase itself.\" Research has shown that as in women, the emotional centers of a man's brain also become deactivated during orgasm but to a lesser extent than in women. Brain scans of both sexes have shown that the pleasure centers of a man's brain show more intense activity than in women during orgasm. Male and female brains demonstrate similar changes during orgasm, with brain activity scans showing a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex with normal or increased metabolic activity in the limbic areas of the brain.\nEEG tracings from volunteers during orgasm were first obtained by Mosovich and Tallaferro in 1954, who recorded EEG changes resembling petit mal or the clonic phase of a grand mal seizure. Further studies in this direction were carried out by Sem-Jacobsen (1968), Heath (1972), Cohen et al. (1976), and others. Sarrel et al. reported a similar observation in 1977. These reports continue to be cited. Unlike them, Craber et al. (1985) failed to find any distinctive EEG changes in four men during masturbation and ejaculation; the authors concluded that the case for the existence of EEG changes specifically related to sexual arousal and orgasm remained unproven. Thus, experts disagree as to whether the experiment conducted by Mosovich and Tallaferro casts a new light on the nature of orgasm. In some recent studies, authors tend to adopt the opposite point of view that there are no remarkable EEG changes during ejaculation in humans.\nHealth.\nGeneral.\nOrgasm, and sexual activity as a whole, are physical activities that can require exertion of many major bodily systems. A 1997 study in the \"BMJ\" based upon 918 men aged 45\u201359 found that after a ten-year follow-up, men who had fewer orgasms were twice as likely to die of any cause as those having two or more orgasms per week. A follow-up in 2001 which focused more specifically on cardiovascular health found that having sex three or more times per week was associated with a 50 percent reduction in the risk of heart attack or stroke. There is some research suggesting that greater resting heart rate variability is associated with orgasms through penile-vaginal intercourse without additional simultaneous clitoral stimulation.\nA small percentage of men have a disease called postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS), which causes severe muscle pain throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following ejaculation. The symptoms last for up to a week. Some doctors speculate that the frequency of POIS \"in the population may be greater than has been reported in the academic literature\", and that many people with POIS are undiagnosed.\nDysfunction and satisfaction.\nThe inability to have an orgasm, or regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, is called anorgasmia or inorgasmia. If a male experiences erection and ejaculation but no orgasm, he is said to have sexual anhedonia (a condition in which an individual cannot feel pleasure from an orgasm) or ejaculatory anhedonia. Anorgasmia is significantly more common in women than in men, which has been attributed to the lack of sex education about women's bodies, especially in sex-negative cultures, such as clitoral stimulation usually being key for women to orgasm.\nApproximately 25 percent of women report difficulties with orgasm, 10% of women have never had an orgasm, and 40\u201350 percent have either complained about sexual dissatisfaction or experienced difficulty becoming sexually aroused at some point in their lives. A 1994 study by Laumann et al. found that 75 percent of men and 29 percent of women always had orgasms with their spouse, while 40 percent of men and 80 percent of women thought their spouse always orgasmed during sex. These rates were different in non-marital straight relationships (cohabitational, long-term and short-term heterosexual relationships), with rates increasing to 81 percent for men and 43 percent for women orgasming during sex with their short-term partners, and 69 percent for men and 83 percent for women thinking their short-term partners always orgasmed. Women are much more likely to be always or nearly always orgasmic when alone than with a partner. In a 1996 study by Davis etal., 62 percent of women in a partnered relationship said they were satisfied with the frequency/consistency of their orgasms. Additionally, some women express that their most satisfying sexual experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm.\nKinsey's 1953 \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\" shows that over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78 percent of women had orgasms in 60\u2013100 percent of sexual encounters with other women, compared with 55 percent for heterosexual sex. Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do. Like Kinsey, scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut, and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) found that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do, and that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking. In contrast, research by Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009), published in the \"Journal of Sex Research\", found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts.\nIf orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be attributed to an inability to relax. It may be associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction; often, women worry so much about the pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as impatience with the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic sexual satisfaction. Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, in his 1927 book \"Die Funktion des Orgasmus\" (published in English in 1980 as \"Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis\") was the first to make orgasm central to the concept of mental health, and he defined neurosis in terms of blocks to having orgastic potency. Although orgasm dysfunction can have psychological components, physiological factors often play a role. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications.\nSpecifically, with regard to simultaneous orgasm and similar practices, many sexologists claim that the idea of premature ejaculation as a problem derives from the early 20th century when mutual orgasm was overly emphasized as an objective and a sign of true sexual satisfaction in intimate relationships. Menopause may involve loss of hormones supporting sexuality and genital functionality. Vaginal and clitoral atrophy and dryness affect up to 50\u201360 percent of postmenopausal women. Testosterone levels in men fall as they age. Sexual dysfunction overall becomes more likely with poor physical and emotional health. \"Negative experiences in sexual relationships and overall well-being\" are associated with sexual dysfunction.\nTheoretical biological and evolutionary functions in females.\nShifts in research.\nThe function or functions of the human female orgasm have been debated among researchers. Researchers have several hypotheses about the role if any, of the female orgasm in the reproductive and therefore evolutionary process. The literature started with the argument that female orgasm is a byproduct of shared early male ontogeny, where male orgasm is an adaptation. Research has shifted to investigate and also support the sire-choice hypothesis, which proposes that female orgasm has been shaped by natural selection to function in the selection of high-quality sires (male parents) for offspring. Therefore, orgasm increases the chances of conceiving with males of high genetic quality. Research by Randy Thornhill et al. (1995) suggests that female orgasm is more frequent during intercourse with a male partner with low fluctuating asymmetry.\nSelective pressure and mating.\nWallen K and Lloyd EA state, \"In men, orgasms are under strong selective pressure as orgasms are coupled with ejaculation and thus contribute to male reproductive success. By contrast, women's orgasms in intercourse are highly variable and are under little selective pressure as they are not a reproductive necessity.\"\nDesmond Morris suggests in his 1967 popular science book \"The Naked Ape\" that the female orgasm evolved to encourage physical intimacy with a male partner and help reinforce the pair bond. Morris suggested that the relative difficulty in achieving female orgasm, in comparison to the male's, might be favorable in Darwinian evolution by leading the female to select mates who bear qualities like patience, care, imagination, and intelligence, as opposed to qualities like size and aggression, which pertain to mate selection in other primates. Such advantageous qualities thereby become accentuated within the species, driven by the differences between male and female orgasms. If males were motivated by and taken to the point of, orgasm in the same way as females, those advantageous qualities would not be needed, since self-interest would be enough.\nFertility.\nThere are theories that the female orgasm might increase fertility. For example, it has been suggested that the 30 percent reduction in the size of the vagina could help clench the penis (much like, or perhaps caused by, the pubococcygeus muscles), which would make it more stimulating for the male (thus ensuring faster or more voluminous ejaculation). The British biologists Baker and Bellis have suggested that the female orgasm may have a peristalsis or \"upsuck\" action (similar to the esophagus' ability to swallow when upside down), resulting in the retaining of favorable sperm and making conception more likely. They posited a role of female orgasm in sperm competition.\nThe observation that women tend to reach orgasm more easily when they are ovulating also has led to the suggestion that it is tied to increasing fertility. Evolutionary biologist Robin Baker argues in \"Sperm Wars\" that occurrence and timing of orgasms are all a part of the female body's unconscious strategy to collect and retain sperm from more evolutionary fit men. This theory suggests that an orgasm during intercourse functions as a bypass button to a woman's natural cervical filter against sperm and pathogens, and that an orgasm before functions to strengthen the filter.\nDesmond Morris proposed that orgasm might facilitate conception by exhausting the female and keeping her horizontal, thus preventing the sperm from leaking out. This possibility, sometimes called the \"Poleaxe Hypothesis\" or the \"Knockout Hypothesis\", is now considered unlikely. A 1994 Learning Channel documentary on sex had fiber optic cameras inside the vagina of a woman while she had sexual intercourse. During her orgasm, her pelvic muscles contracted and her cervix repeatedly dipped into a pool of semen in the vaginal fornix, which might ensure that sperm would proceed by the external orifice of the uterus, making conception more likely.\nEvolutionary psychologists Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth\u00e1, in their discussion of the female orgasm, address how long it takes for females to achieve orgasm compared to males, and females' ability to have multiple orgasms, hypothesizing how especially well suited to multiple partners and insemination this is. They quote primate sexuality specialist Alan Dixson in saying that the monogamy-maintenance explanation for female orgasm \"seems far-fetched\" because \"females of other primate species, and particularly those with multimale-multifemale [promiscuous] mating systems such as macaques and chimpanzees, exhibit orgasmic responses in the absence of such bonding or the formation of stable family units.\" On the other hand, Dixson states that \"Gibbons, which are primarily monogamous, do not exhibit obvious signs of female orgasm.\"\nThe female promiscuity explanation of female sexuality was echoed at least 12 years earlier by other evolutionary biologists, and there is increasing scientific awareness of the female proceptive phase. Though Dixson classifies humans as mildly polygynous in his survey of primate sexuality, he appears to have doubts, when he writes, \"One might argue that ... the female's orgasm is rewarding, increases her willingness to copulate with a variety of males rather than one partner, and thus promotes sperm competition.\" Ryan and Jeth\u00e1 use this as evidence for their theory that partible paternity and promiscuity was common for early modern humans.\nAdaptive or vestigial.\nThe clitoris is homologous to the penis; that is, they both develop from the same embryonic structure. While researchers such as Geoffrey Miller, Helen Fisher, Meredith Small and Sarah Blaffer Hrdy \"have viewed the clitoral orgasm as a legitimate adaptation in its own right, with major implications for female sexual behavior and sexual evolution,\" others, such as Donald Symons and Stephen Jay Gould, have asserted that the clitoris is vestigial or nonadaptive and that the female orgasm serves no particular evolutionary function. Gould acknowledged that \"most female orgasms emanate from a clitoral, rather than vaginal (or some other), site\" and stated that his nonadaptive belief \"has been widely misunderstood as a denial of either the adaptive value of female orgasm in general or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance in some broader sense\". He explained that although he accepts that \"clitoral orgasm plays a pleasurable and central role in female sexuality and its joys,\" \"[a]ll these favorable attributes, however, emerge just as clearly and just as easily, whether the clitoral site of orgasm arose as a spandrel or an adaptation\". He said that the \"male biologists who fretted over [the adaptionist questions] simply assumed that a deeply vaginal site, nearer the region of fertilization, would offer greater selective benefit\" due to their Darwinian, \"summum bonum\" beliefs about enhanced reproductive success.\nProponents of the nonadaptive hypothesis, such as Elisabeth Lloyd, refer to the relative difficulty of achieving female orgasm through vaginal sex, the limited evidence for increased fertility after orgasm, and the lack of statistical correlation between the capacity of a woman to orgasm and the likelihood that she will engage in intercourse. \"Lloyd is by no means against evolutionary psychology. Quite the opposite; in her methods and in her writing, she advocates and demonstrates a commitment to the careful application of evolutionary theory to the study of human behavior,\" stated Meredith L. Chivers. She added that Lloyd \"meticulously considers the theoretical and empirical bases for each account and ultimately concludes that there is little evidence to support an adaptionist account of female orgasm\" and that Lloyd instead \"views female orgasm as an ontogenetic leftover; women have orgasms because the urogenital neurophysiology for orgasm is so strongly selected for in males that this developmental blueprint gets expressed in females without affecting fitness, just as males have nipples that serve no fitness-related function\".\nA 2005 twin study found that one in three women reported never or seldom achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse, and only one in ten always orgasmed. This variation in the ability to orgasm, generally thought to be psychosocial, was found to be 34 percent to 45 percent genetic. The study, examining 4000 women, was published in \"Biology Letters\", a Royal Society journal. Elisabeth Lloyd has cited this as evidence for the notion that female orgasm is not adaptive.\nMiller, Hrdy, Helen O'Connell, and Natalie Angier have criticized the \"female orgasm is vestigial\" hypothesis as understating and devaluing the psychosocial value of the female orgasm. Hrdy stated that the hypothesis smacks of sexism. O'Connell said, \"It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive.\" O'Connell used MRI technology to define the true size and shape of the clitoris, suggesting that it extends into the anterior wall of the vagina (see above).\nO'Connell describes typical textbook descriptions of the clitoris as lacking detail and including inaccuracies, saying that the work of Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the early 19th century provides a most comprehensive and accurate description of clitoral anatomy. She argues that the bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the center of female sexual function and orgasm. By contrast, Nancy Tuana, at the 2002 conference for \"Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy\", argues that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction, but that this is why it has been \"historically ignored\", mainly because of \"a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear\". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.\nInduced ovulation.\nSome spontaneously ovulating species can occasionally undergo mating-induced preovulatory LH surges. These species require mating to stimulate the vagina and cervix, resulting in ovulation in the females. Research suggests that the female orgasm evolved from copulation-induced ovulation.\nFringe theories.\nBrody Costa et al. suggest that women's vaginal orgasm consistency is associated with being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina is the important zone for inducing female orgasms. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and their preference for above-average penis length. Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip. His research indicates that \"[a] prominent and sharply raised lip tubercle has been associated with greater odds (odds ratio = 12.3) of ever having a vaginal orgasm, and also with greater past month vaginal orgasm consistency (an effect driven by the women who never had a vaginal orgasm), than less prominent lip tubercle categories.\" Lip tubercle was not associated with social desirability responding, or with orgasm triggered by masturbation during penile-vaginal sex, solitary or partner clitoral or vaginal masturbation, vibrator use, or cunnilingus.\nAn empirical study carried out in 2008 provides evidence for Freud's implied link between the inability to have a vaginal orgasm and psychosexual immaturity. In the study, women reported their past month's frequency of different sexual behaviors and corresponding orgasm rates and completed the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), which is associated with various psychopathologies. The study concluded that a \"vaginal orgasm was associated with less somatization, dissociation, displacement, autistic fantasy, devaluation, and isolation of affect.\" Moreover, \"vaginally anorgasmic women had immature defenses scores comparable to those of established (depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder) outpatient psychiatric groups.\" In the study, a vaginal orgasm (as opposed to a clitoral orgasm) was defined as being triggered solely by penile\u2013vaginal intercourse. According to Wilhelm Reich, the lack of women's capacity to have a vaginal orgasm is due to a lack of orgastic potency, which he believed to be the result of culture's suppression of genital sexuality.\nInvoluntariness.\nMedical research shows that the genital reflex is also regulated by the spinal cord and not necessarily under conscious control. An involuntary orgasm may occur as the result of sexual assault or rape, which may result in feelings of shame caused by internalization of victim-blaming attitudes. The incidence of those who experience unsolicited sexual contact and experience orgasm is very low, though possibly under-reported due to shame or embarrassment of the victim. Such orgasms may happen to either sex.\nAn unwanted orgasm may arise from a persistent genital arousal disorder. In consensual BDSM play, forced orgasm may be practiced to exercise orgasm control.\nTantric sex.\nTantric sex, which is not the same as Buddhist tantra (Vajrayana), is the ancient Indian spiritual tradition of sexual practices. It attributes a different value to orgasm than traditional cultural approaches to sexuality. Some practitioners of tantric sex aim to eliminate orgasm from sexual intercourse by remaining for a long time in the pre-orgasmic and non-emission state. Advocates of this, such as Rajneesh, claim that it eventually causes orgasmic feelings to spread out to all of one's conscious experience.\nAdvocates of tantric and neo-tantric sex who claim that Western culture focuses too much on the goal of climactic orgasm, which reduces the ability to have intense pleasure during other moments of the sexual experience, suggest that eliminating this enables a richer, fuller, and more intense connection.\nLiterature.\nOrgasm has been widely described in literature over the centuries. In antiquity, Latin literature addressed the subject as much as Greek literature: Book III of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" retells a discussion between Jove and Juno, in which the former states: \"The sense of pleasure in the male is far / More dull and dead than what you females share.\" Juno rejects this thought; they agree to ask the opinion of Tiresias (\"who had known Venus/Love in both ways,\" having lived seven years as a female). Tiresias offends Juno by agreeing with Jove, and she strikes him blind on the spot (Jove lessens the blow by giving Tiresias the gift of foresight, and long life). Earlier, in the \"Ars Amatoria\", Ovid states that he abhors sexual intercourse that fails to complete both partners.\nThe theme of orgasm survived during Romanticism and is incorporated in many homoerotic works. In \"FRAGMENT: Supposed to be an Epithalamium of Francis Ravaillac and Charlotte Cord\u00e9\", Percy Bysshe Shelley, \"a translator of extraordinary range and versatility\", wrote the phrase \"No life can equal such a death.\" That phrase has been seen as a metaphor for orgasm, and it was preceded by the rhythmic urgency of the previous lines \"Suck on, suck on, I glow, I glow!\", which has been seen as alluding to fellatio. For Shelley, orgasm was \"the almost involuntary consequences of a state of abandonment in the society of a person of surpassing attractions\". Edward Ellerker Williams, the last love of Shelley's life, was remembered by the poet in \"The Boat on the Serchio\", which has been considered as possibly \"the grandest portrayal of orgasm in literature\": Shelley, in this poem, associates orgasm with death when he writes \"the death which lovers love\". In French literature, the term \"la petite mort\" (the little death) is a famous euphemism for orgasm; it is the representation of the man who forgets himself and the world during orgasm. Jorge Luis Borges, in the same vision, wrote in one of the several footnotes of \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\" that one of the churches of Tl\u00f6n claims Platonically that \"All men, in the vertiginous moment of coitus, are the same man. All men who repeat a line from Shakespeare \"are\" William Shakespeare.\" Shakespeare himself was knowledgeable of this idea, as lines \"I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes\" and \"I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom\", said respectively by Benedick in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and by King Lear in the play of that ilk, are interpreted as allusions to orgasm: \"to die in a woman's lap\" = \"to experience a sexual orgasm\". \nFreud, in his psychoanalytic projects, such as \"The Ego and the Id\" (1923), speculates that sexual satisfaction by orgasm makes Eros (\"life instinct\") exhausted and leaves the field open to Thanatos (\"death instinct\"). In other words, with orgasm Eros fulfills its mission and gives way to Thanatos. Other modern authors have chosen to represent the orgasm without metaphors. In the novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" (1928), by D. H. Lawrence, we can find an explicit narrative of a sexual act between a couple: \"As he began to move, in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her strange thrills rippling inside her...\" \nRobert Macfarlane, in a review of the Jilly Cooper novel \"Pandora\", discussed how it has an increased ratio of sex per page than her earlier novels, such as \"Riders,\" and that the sex is usually simple and happy, where \"mutuality of orgasm is a given\"\".\" He also pointed out that in \"Pandora\" there is a far greater range of sexual activities described than in other Cooper novels, that are not just vaginal penetration by a penis.\nOther animals.\nThe mechanics of male orgasm are similar in most male mammals. Females of all mammal and some non-mammal species, such as alligators, have clitorises. There has been ongoing research about the sexuality of dolphins, one of many species which engage in sexual intercourse for reasons other than reproduction. The duration of orgasm varies considerably among different mammal species.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One year later the Treaty of Verdun was signed, with major consequences for Western Europe's geopolitical landscape.\nLouis the German swore his oath in an early form of Old French so that the soldiers of Charles the Bald could understand him. Likewise, the latter recited his in Old High German so that Louis's soldiers would understand.\nThe section of the Oaths written in a language resembling French is of special importance to historical linguistics, as it is the oldest extant document in France that was written deliberately and consistently in a form of Romance language.\nContext.\nCenturies after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Charlemagne, who had conquered much of its former territory, announced its restoration. Upon his death, he passed this realm to his son Louis the Pious, who in turn passed it to his firstborn son Lothair I. However, the latter's brothers\u2014Charles and Louis\u2014refused to recognize him as their suzerain. When Lothair attempted to invade their lands, they allied against him and defeated him at the Battle of Fontenoy in June 841. Charles and Louis met in February 842 near modern Strasbourg to affirm their alliance by swearing a joint oath against Lothair. The following year the civil war ended with the Treaty of Verdun, in which the three claimants partitioned the Empire amongst themselves.\nThe Oaths were not preserved in their original form, but were copied by the historian Nithard, another grandson of Charlemagne, in a work titled \"De Dissensionibus Filiorum Ludovici Pii\" \"On the Quarrels of Louis the Pious' Sons\". This was a firsthand account, as Nithard had campaigned alongside his cousin Charles the Bald. It was however biased, reflecting the perspective of the allies and casting Lothair as an aggressor and villain.\nLouis and Charles swore their oaths not as kings\u2014a term which is never used\u2014but rather as lords, with their respective entourages acting as witnesses. Ostensibly they were acceding to Lothair I's demands as his future 'subjects'.\nAlthough the Oaths are of little political importance, given that they were superseded by the more comprehensive Treaty of Verdun, they are of significant importance to the field of linguistics. As the scholar Philippe Walter wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"This is the oldest extant French text. It is political in nature, not literary, and is important in that it marks the written debut of the 'vulgar' tongue.\"\nManuscript.\nNithard's text of the Oaths is in two manuscripts at the National Library of France.\nThe older manuscript was copied around the year 1000, probably for an abbey in Picardy (either that of Saint-M\u00e9dard or Saint Riquier). In the fifteenth century it was in the possession of the Abbey of Saint Magloire in Paris. Around 1650 it was bought by the Swedish Queen Christina and transferred to Rome; after her death it was acquired by the Vatican Library. After Napoleon's forces captured Rome, it was transferred back to Paris along with various other historical manuscripts. Napoleon later returned most of the others, but kept this one. It is currently in the National Library of France under the call number Latin 9768; the Oaths are found on folio #13.\nThe other manuscript, which is in the same library under the call number Latin 14663, is a copy of the former that was made in the fifteenth century.\nRomance portion.\nLouis the German's oath is recorded as follows:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the love of God and Christiandom and our joint salvation, from this day onward, to the best of my knowledge and abilities granted by God, I shall protect my brother Charles by any means possible, as one ought to protect one's brother, insofar as he does the same for me, and I shall never willingly enter into a pact with Lothair against the interests of my brother Charles.\nThe army of Charles the Bald swore that:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If Louis keeps the oath which he has sworn to his brother Charles, and my lord Charles on the other hand breaks it, if I cannot dissuade him from it\u2014neither I nor anyone else whom I could dissuade from it\u2014then I shall render him no aid against Louis.\nGermanic portion.\nThe language reflects an early form of Ripuarian Frankish. Charles the Bald is recorded as saying:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"\"This is a close translation of Louis's oath, except that an equivalent to \"et in aiudha et in cadhuna cosa\" appears to be missing. The soldiers of Louis the German replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"\"This, in turn, was equivalent to the oath sworn by Charles's soldiers.\nLinguistic features.\nSeveral scholars consider the Romance portion of the Oaths to have been translated from an unattested Latin original, while others maintain that the existing Romance text is the untranslated original.\nAccording to Hall, the text does not contain any particular features that would mark it as belonging to the future O\u00efl or Oc groups, with the possible exception of the form \"tanit\" 'keep' &lt; *t\u025b\u0301ni\u032fat, which is characteristic of Lorraine. Hall describes the language of the text as \"nearly undifferentiated conservative Pre-French\".\nThe difficulty of discerning a particular dialect in the text may be due to a deliberate effort by the author to write in a sort of regional koin\u00e9. Cerquiglini further observes that \"No Old French text, not even any of the oldest ones, shows dialectal features consistent with only one particular region.\"\nNevertheless, various other scholars have suggested that the Oaths were written in an early form of Picard, Lyonnais, Lorraine, or Poitevin.\nTranscriptions.\nThe following is a reconstructed pronunciation of Louis's oath and that of Charles's soldiers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHere are the Romance sections of folio 13r along with digital facsimiles:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22557", "revid": "4068090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22557", "title": "Old English literature", "text": "Literature of Anglo-Saxon England\nOld English literature refers to poetry (alliterative verse) and prose written in Old English in early medieval England, from the 7th century to the decades after the Norman Conquest of 1066, a period often termed Anglo-Saxon England. The 7th-century work \"C\u00e6dmon's Hymn\" is often considered as the oldest surviving poem in English, as it appears in an 8th-century copy of Bede's text, the \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\". Poetry written in the mid-12th century represents some of the latest post-Norman examples of Old English. Adherence to the grammatical rules of Old English is largely inconsistent in 12th-century work, and by the 13th century the grammar and syntax of Old English had almost completely deteriorated, giving way to the much larger Middle English corpus of literature.\nIn descending order of quantity, Old English literature consists of: sermons and saints' lives; biblical translations; translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers; chronicles and narrative history works; laws, wills and other legal works; practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography; and poetry. In all, there are over 400 surviving manuscripts from the period, of which about 189 are considered major. In addition, some Old English text survives on stone structures and ornate objects.\nThe poem \"Beowulf\", which often begins the traditional canon of English literature, is the most famous work of Old English literature. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" has also proven significant for historical study, preserving a chronology of early English history.\nIn addition to Old English literature, Anglo-Latin works comprise the largest volume of literature from the Early Middle Ages in England.\nExtant manuscripts.\nOver 400 manuscripts remain from the Anglo-Saxon period, with most written during the 9th to 11th centuries. There were considerable losses of manuscripts as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century.\nOld English manuscripts have been highly prized by collectors since the 16th century, both for their historic value and for their aesthetic beauty with their uniformly spaced letters and decorative elements.\nPaleography and codicology.\nManuscripts written in both Latin and the vernacular remain. Early Anglo-Saxon texts used styles of scripts borrowed from Irish missionaries, which include the Insular half-uncial (used for important Latin texts) and Insular minuscule (used for both Latin and the vernacular). In the 10th century, the Caroline minuscule was adopted for Latin; however, the Insular minuscule continued to be used for Old English texts. Thereafter, it was increasingly influenced by Caroline minuscule, while retaining certain distinctively Insular letter-forms.\nEarly English manuscripts often contain later annotations in the margins of the texts; it is a rarity to find a completely unannotated manuscript. These include corrections, alterations and expansions of the main text, as well as commentary upon it, and even unrelated texts. The majority of these annotations appear to date to the 13th century and later.\nScriptoria.\nSeven major scriptoria produced a good deal of Old English manuscripts: Winchester; Exeter; Worcester; Abingdon; Durham; and two Canterbury houses, Christ Church and St. Augustine's Abbey.\nDialects.\nRegional dialects include Northumbrian, Mercian, Kentish, and West Saxon, leading to the speculation that much of the poetry may have been translated into West Saxon at a later date. An example of the dominance of the West Saxon dialect is a pair of charters, from the Stowe and British Museum collections, which outline grants of land in Kent and Mercia, but are nonetheless written in the West Saxon dialect of the period.\nPoetic codices.\nThere are four major poetic manuscripts:\nPoetry.\nForm and style.\nThe most distinguishing feature of Old English poetry is its alliterative verse style.\nThe Anglo-Latin verse tradition in early medieval England was accompanied by discourses on Latin prosody, which were 'rules' or guidance for writers. The rules of Old English verse are understood only through modern analysis of the extant texts.\nThe first widely accepted theory was constructed by Eduard Sievers (1893), who distinguished five distinct alliterative patterns. His system of alliterative verse is based on accent, alliteration, the quantity of vowels, and patterns of syllabic accentuation. It consists of five permutations on a base verse scheme; any one of the five types can be used in any verse. The system was inherited from and exists in one form or another in all of the older Germanic languages.\nAlternative theories have been proposed, such as the theory of John C. Pope (1942), which uses musical notation to track the verse patterns. J. R. R. Tolkien describes and illustrates many of the features of Old English poetry in his 1940 essay \"On Translating \"Beowulf\"\".\nAlliteration and assonance.\nOld English poetry alliterates, meaning that a sound is repeated throughout a line, generally taken from the first syllable of the first stressed word in a line. Alliteration is based on sound rather than letter. For instance, in the first line of The Wanderer, \"Oft him anhaga are gebide\u00f0\", \"Often the loner finds grace for himself\", the 'o' of 'oft', and 'a' in 'anhaga' and 'are' all alliterate. Prefixes, such as 'ge-' are always unstressed and therefore are not part of alliterative patterns, while consonant clusters, for example 'st' or 'sp' may only alliterate with themselves, not any word beginning with 's'.\nCaesura.\nOld English poetry, like other Old Germanic alliterative verse, is also commonly marked by the caesura or pause. In addition to setting pace for the line, the caesura also grouped each line into two hemistichs.\nMetaphor.\nKennings are a key feature of Old English poetry. A kenning is an often formulaic metaphorical phrase that describes one thing in terms of another: for instance, in \"Beowulf\", the sea is called the \"whale road\". Another example of a kenning in \"The Wanderer\" is a reference to battle as a \"storm of spears\".\nOld English poetry is marked by the comparative rarity of similes. \"Beowulf\" contains at best five similes, and these are of the short variety.\nVariation.\nThe Old English poet was particularly fond of describing the same person or object with varied phrases (often appositives) that indicated different qualities of that person or object. For instance, the \"Beowulf\" poet refers in three and a half lines to a Danish king as \"lord of the Danes\" (referring to the people in general), \"king of the Scyldings\" (the name of the specific Danish tribe), \"giver of rings\" (one of the king's functions is to distribute treasure), and \"famous chief\". Such variation, which the modern reader (who likes verbal precision) is not used to, is frequently a difficulty in producing a readable translation.\nLitotes.\nLitotes is a form of dramatic understatement employed by the author for ironic effect.\nOral tradition.\nEven though all extant Old English poetry is written and literate, many scholars propose that Old English poetry was an oral craft that was performed by a \"scop\" and accompanied by a harp.\nThe hypotheses of Milman Parry and Albert Lord on the Homeric Question came to be applied (by Parry and Lord, but also by Francis Magoun) to verse written in Old English. That is, the theory proposes that certain features of at least some of the poetry may be explained by positing oral-formulaic composition. While Old English epic poetry may bear some resemblance to Ancient Greek epics such as the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", the question of if and how Anglo-Saxon poetry was passed down through an oral tradition remains a subject of debate, and the question for any particular poem unlikely to be answered with perfect certainty.\nParry and Lord had already demonstrated the density of metrical formulas in Ancient Greek, and observed the same feature in the Old English alliterative line:\n&lt;poem&gt;\"Hro\u00fegar ma\u00feelode helm Scildinga\" (\"Hrothgar spoke, protector of the Scildings\")\n\"Beo\u01bfulf ma\u00feelode bearn Ecg\u00feeo\u01bfes\" (\"Beowulf spoke, son of Ecgtheow\")&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn addition to verbal formulas, many themes have been shown to appear among the various works of Anglo-Saxon literature. The theory suggests a reason for this: the poetry was composed of formulae and themes from a stock common to the poetic profession, as well as literary passages composed by individual artists in a more modern sense. Larry Benson introduced the concept of \"written-formulaic\" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes. Frequent oral-formulaic themes in Old English poetry include \"Beasts of Battle\" and the \"Cliff of Death\". The former, for example, is characterised by the mention of ravens, eagles, and wolves preceding particularly violent depictions of battle. Among the most thoroughly documented themes is \"The Hero on the Beach\". D. K. Crowne first proposed this theme, defined by four characteristics:\nOne example Crowne cites in his article is that which concludes Beowulf's fight with the monsters during his swimming match with Breca:\nCrowne drew on examples of the theme's appearance in twelve Old English texts, including one occurrence in Beowulf. It was also observed in other works of Germanic origin, Middle English poetry, and even an Icelandic prose saga. John Richardson held that the schema was so general as to apply to virtually any character at some point in the narrative, and thought it an instance of the \"threshold\" feature of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey monomyth. J.A. Dane, in an article (characterised by Foley as \"polemics without rigour\") claimed that the appearance of the theme in Ancient Greek poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of \"an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet.\" Foley's response was that Dane misunderstood the nature of oral tradition, and that in fact the appearance of the theme in other cultures showed that it was a traditional form.\nPoets.\nMost Old English poems are recorded without authors, and very few names are known with any certainty; the primary three are C\u00e6dmon, Aldhelm, and Cynewulf.\nBede.\nBede is often thought to be the poet of a five-line poem entitled \"Bede's Death Song\", on account of its appearance in a letter on his death by Cuthbert. This poem exists in a Northumbrian and later version.\nC\u00e6dmon.\nC\u00e6dmon is considered the first Old English poet whose work still survives. He is a legendary figure, as described in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. According to Bede, C\u00e6dmon was first an illiterate herdsman. Following a vision of a messenger from God, C\u00e6dmon received the gift of poetry, and then lived as a monk under Abbess Hild at the abbey of Whitby in Northumbria in the 7th century. Bede's \"History\" claims to reproduce C\u00e6dmon's first poem, comprising nine lines. Referred to as \"C\u00e6dmon's Hymn\", the poem is extant in Northumbrian, West-Saxon and Latin versions that appear in 19 surviving manuscripts:\nCynewulf.\nCynewulf has proven to be a difficult figure to identify, but recent research suggests he was an Anglian poet from the early part of the 9th century. Four poems are attributed to him, signed with a runic acrostic at the end of each poem; these are \"The Fates of the Apostles\" and \"Elene\" (both found in the Vercelli Book), and \"Christ II\" and \"Juliana\" (both found in the Exeter Book).\nAlthough William of Malmesbury claims that Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborne (d. 709), performed secular songs while accompanied by a harp, none of these Old English poems survives. Paul G. Remely has recently proposed that the Old English \"Exodus\" may have been the work of Aldhelm, or someone closely associated with him.\nAlfred.\nAlfred is said to be the author of some of the metrical prefaces to the Old English translations of Gregory's \"Pastoral Care\" and Boethius's \"Consolation of Philosophy\". Alfred is also thought to be the author of 50 metrical psalms, but whether the poems were written by him, under his direction or patronage, or as a general part in his reform efforts is unknown.\nPoetic genres and themes.\nHeroic poetry.\nThe Old English poetry which has received the most attention deals with what has been termed the Germanic heroic past. Scholars suggest that Old English heroic poetry was handed down orally from generation to generation. As Christianity began to appear, re-tellers often recast the tales of Christianity into the older heroic stories.\nThe longest at 3,182 lines, and the most important, is \"Beowulf\", which appears in the damaged Nowell Codex. Beowulf relates the exploits of the hero Beowulf, King of the Weder-Geats or Angles, around the middle of the 5th century. The author is unknown, and no mention of Britain occurs. Scholars are divided over the date of the present text, with hypotheses ranging from the 8th to the 11th centuries. It has achieved much acclaim as well as sustained academic and artistic interest.\nOther heroic poems besides \"Beowulf\" exist. Two have survived in fragments: \"The Fight at Finnsburh\", controversially interpreted by many to be a retelling of one of the battle scenes in \"Beowulf\", and \"Waldere\", a version of the events of the life of Walter of Aquitaine. Two other poems mention heroic figures: \"Widsith\" is believed to be very old in parts, dating back to events in the 4th century concerning Eormanric and the Goths, and contains a catalogue of names and places associated with valiant deeds. \"Deor\" is a lyric, in the style of \"Consolation of Philosophy\", applying examples of famous heroes, including Weland and Eormanric, to the narrator's own case.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" contains various heroic poems inserted throughout. The earliest from 937 is called \"The Battle of Brunanburh\", which celebrates the victory of King Athelstan over the Scots and Norse. There are five shorter poems: capture of the Five Boroughs (942); coronation of King Edgar (973); death of King Edgar (975); death of Alfred the son of King \u00c6thelred (1036); and death of King Edward the Confessor (1065).\nThe 325 line poem \"The Battle of Maldon\" celebrates Earl Byrhtnoth and his men who fell in battle against the Vikings in 991. It is considered one of the finest, but both the beginning and end are missing and the only manuscript was destroyed in a fire in 1731. A well-known speech is near the end of the poem:\nElegiac poetry.\nRelated to the heroic tales are a number of short poems from the Exeter Book which have come to be described as \"elegies\" or \"wisdom poetry\". They are lyrical and Boethian in their description of the up and down fortunes of life. Gloomy in mood is \"The Ruin\", which tells of the decay of a once glorious city of Roman Britain (cities in Britain fell into decline after the Romans departed in the early 5th century, as the early Celtic Britons continued to live their rural life), and \"The Wanderer\", in which an older man talks about an attack that happened in his youth, when his close friends and kin were all killed; memories of the slaughter have remained with him all his life. He questions the wisdom of the impetuous decision to engage a possibly superior fighting force: the wise man engages in warfare to \"preserve\" civil society, and must not rush into battle but should seek out allies when the odds may be against him. This poet finds little glory in bravery for bravery's sake. \"The Seafarer\" is the story of a sombre exile from home on the sea, from which the only hope of redemption is the joy of heaven. Other wisdom poems include \"Wulf and Eadwacer\", \"The Wife's Lament\", and \"The Husband's Message\". Alfred the Great wrote a wisdom poem over the course of his reign based loosely on the neoplatonic philosophy of Boethius called the \"Lays of Boethius\".\nTranslations of classical and Latin poetry.\nSeveral Old English poems are adaptations of late classical philosophical texts. The longest is a 10th-century translation of Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\" contained in the Cotton manuscript Otho A.vi. Another is \"The Phoenix\" in the Exeter Book, an allegorisation of the \"De ave phoenice\" by Lactantius.\nOther short poems derive from the Latin bestiary tradition. These include \"The Panther\", \"The Whale\" and \"The Partridge\".\nRiddles.\nThe most famous Old English riddles are found in the Exeter Book. They are part of a wider Anglo-Saxon literary tradition of riddling, which includes riddles written in Latin. Riddles are both comical and obscene.\nThe riddles of the Exeter Book are unnumbered and without titles in the manuscript. For this reason, scholars propose different interpretations of how many riddles there are, with some agreeing 94 riddles, and others proposing closer to 100 riddles in the book. Most scholars believe that the Exeter Book was compiled by a single scribe; however, the works were almost certainly originally composed by poets.\nA riddle in Old English, written using runic script, features on the Franks Casket. One possible solution for the riddle is 'whale', evoking the whale-bone from which the casket made.\nSaints' lives in verse.\nThe Vercelli Book and Exeter Book contain four long narrative poems of saints' lives, or hagiographies. In Vercelli are \"Andreas\" and \"Elene\" and in Exeter are \"Guthlac\" and \"Juliana\".\n\"Andreas\" is 1,722 lines long and is the closest of the surviving Old English poems to \"Beowulf\" in style and tone. It is the story of Saint Andrew and his journey to rescue Saint Matthew from the Mermedonians. \"Elene\" is the story of Saint Helena (mother of Constantine) and her discovery of the True Cross. The cult of the True Cross was popular in Anglo-Saxon England and this poem was instrumental in promoting it.\n\"Guthlac\" consists of two poems about the English 7th century Saint Guthlac. \"Juliana\" describes the life of Saint Juliana, including a discussion with the devil during her imprisonment.\nPoetic Biblical paraphrases.\nThere are a number of partial Old English Bible translations and paraphrases surviving. The Junius manuscript contains three paraphrases of Old Testament texts. These were re-wordings of Biblical passages in Old English, not exact translations, but paraphrasing, sometimes into beautiful poetry in its own right. The first and longest is of \"Genesis\" (originally presented as one work in the Junius manuscript but now thought to consist of two separate poems, A and B), the second is of \"Exodus\" and the third is \"Daniel\". Contained in Daniel are two lyrics, \"Song of the Three Children\" and \"Song of Azarias\", the latter also appearing in the Exeter Book after \"Guthlac\". The fourth and last poem, \"Christ and Satan\", which is contained in the second part of the Junius manuscript, does not paraphrase any particular biblical book, but retells a number of episodes from both the Old and New Testament.\nThe Nowell Codex contains a Biblical poetic paraphrase, which appears right after \"Beowulf\", called \"Judith\", a retelling of the story of Judith. This is not to be confused with \u00c6lfric's homily \"Judith\", which retells the same Biblical story in alliterative prose.\nOld English translations of Psalms 51\u2013150 have been preserved, following a prose version of the first 50 Psalms. There are verse translations of the Gloria in Excelsis, the Lord's Prayer, and the Apostles' Creed, as well as some hymns and proverbs.\nOriginal Christian poems.\nIn addition to Biblical paraphrases are a number of original religious poems, mostly lyrical (non-narrative).\nThe Exeter Book contains a series of poems entitled \"Christ\", sectioned into \"Christ I\", \"Christ II\" and \"Christ III\".\nConsidered one of the most beautiful of all Old English poems is \"Dream of the Rood\", contained in the Vercelli Book. The presence of a portion of the poem (in Northumbrian dialect) carved in runes on an 8th century stone cross found in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, verifies the age of at least this portion of the poem. The Dream of the Rood is a dream vision in which the personified cross tells the story of the crucifixion. Christ appears as a young hero-king, confident of victory, while the cross itself feels all the physical pain of the crucifixion, as well as the pain of being forced to kill the young lord.\nThe dreamer resolves to trust in the cross, and the dream ends with a vision of heaven.\nThere are a number of religious debate poems. The longest is \"Christ and Satan\" in the Junius manuscript, which deals with the conflict between Christ and Satan during the forty days in the desert. Another debate poem is \"Solomon and Saturn\", surviving in a number of textual fragments, Saturn is portrayed as a magician debating with the wise king Solomon.\nOther poems.\nOther poetic forms exist in Old English including short verses, gnomes, and mnemonic poems for remembering long lists of names.\nThere are short verses found in the margins of manuscripts which offer practical advice, such as remedies against the loss of cattle or how to deal with a delayed birth, often grouped as charms. The longest is called \"Nine Herbs Charm\" and is probably of pagan origin. Other similar short verses, or charms, include \"For a Swarm of Bees\", \"Against a Dwarf\", \"Against a Stabbing Pain\", and \"Against a Wen\".\nThere are a group of mnemonic poems designed to help memorise lists and sequences of names and to keep objects in order. These poems are named \"Menologium\", \"The Fates of the Apostles\", \"The Rune Poem\", \"The Seasons for Fasting\", and the \"Instructions for Christians\".\nProse.\nThe amount of surviving Old English prose is much greater than the amount of poetry. Of the surviving prose, the majority consists of the homilies, saints' lives and biblical translations from Latin. The division of early medieval written prose works into categories of \"Christian\" and \"secular\", as below, is for convenience's sake only, for literacy in Anglo-Saxon England was largely the province of monks, nuns, and ecclesiastics (or of those laypeople to whom they had taught the skills of reading and writing Latin and/or Old English). Old English prose first appears in the 9th century, and continues to be recorded through the 12th century as the last generation of scribes, trained as boys in the standardised West Saxon before the Conquest, died as old men.\nChristian prose.\nThe most widely known secular author of Old English was King Alfred the Great (849\u2013899), who translated several books, many of them religious, from Latin into Old English. Alfred, wanting to restore English culture, lamented the poor state of Latin education:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So general was [educational] decay in England there were very few on this side of the Humber who could...translate a letter from Latin into English; and I believe that there were not many beyond the Humber\u2014\u200a\nAlfred proposed that students be educated in Old English, and those who excelled should go on to learn Latin. Alfred's cultural program aimed to translate \"certain books [...] necessary for all men to know\" from Latin to Old English. These included: Gregory the Great's \"Cura Pastoralis\", a manual for priests on how to conduct their duties, which became the \"Hierdeboc\" ('Shepherd-book') in Old English; Boethius' (the \"Froforboc\" or 'book of consolation'); and the \"Soliloquia\" of Saint Augustine (known in Old English as the \"Blostman\" or 'blooms'). In the process, some original content was interweaved through the translations.\nOther important Old English translations include: Orosius' , a companion piece for St. Augustine's \"The City of God\"; the \"Dialogues\" of Gregory the Great; and Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\".\n\u00c6lfric of Eynsham, who wrote in the late 10th and early 11th centuries, is believed to have been a pupil of \u00c6thelwold. He was the greatest and most prolific writer of sermons, which were copied and adapted for use well into the 13th century. In the translation of the first six books of the Bible (\"Old English Hexateuch\"), portions have been assigned to \u00c6lfric on stylistic grounds. He included some lives of the saints in the \"Catholic Homilies\", as well as a cycle of saints' lives to be used in sermons. \u00c6lfric also wrote an Old English work on time-reckoning, and pastoral letters.\nIn the same category as \u00c6lfric, and a contemporary, was Wulfstan II, archbishop of York. His sermons were highly stylistic. His best known work is \"Sermo Lupi ad Anglos\" in which he blames the sins of the English for the Viking invasions. He wrote a number of clerical legal texts: \"Institutes of Polity\" and \"Canons of Edgar\".\nOne of the earliest Old English texts in prose is the \"Martyrology\", information about saints and martyrs according to their anniversaries and feasts in the church calendar. It has survived in six fragments. It is believed to have been written in the 9th century by an anonymous Mercian author.\nThe oldest collections of church sermons is the \"Blickling homilies\", found in a 10th-century manuscript.\nThere are a number of saint's lives prose works: beyond those written by \u00c6lfric are the prose life of Saint Guthlac (Vercelli Book), the life of Saint Margaret and the life of Saint Chad. There are four additional lives in the earliest manuscript of the \"Lives of Saints\", the Julius manuscript: Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, Saint Mary of Egypt, Saint Eustace and Saint Euphrosyne.\nThere are six major manuscripts of the Wessex Gospels, dating from the 11th and 12th centuries. The most popular, \"Old English Gospel of Nicodemus\", is treated in one manuscript as though it were a 5th gospel; other apocryphal gospels in translation include the \"Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew\", \"Vindicta salvatoris\", \"Vision of Saint Paul\" and the \"Apocalypse of Thomas\".\nSecular prose.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" was probably started in the time of King Alfred the Great and continued for over 300\u00a0years as a historical record of Anglo-Saxon history.\nA single example of a Classical romance has survived: a fragment of the story of \"Apollonius of Tyre\" was translated in the 11th century from the \"Gesta Romanorum\".\nA monk who was writing in Old English at the same time as \u00c6lfric and Wulfstan was Byrhtferth of Ramsey, whose book \"Handboc\" was a study of mathematics and rhetoric. He also produced a work entitled \"Computus\", which outlined the practical application of arithmetic to the calculation of calendar days and movable feasts, as well as tide tables.\n\u00c6lfric wrote two proto-scientific works, \"Hexameron\" and \"Interrogationes Sigewulfi\", dealing with the stories of Creation. He also wrote a grammar and glossary of Latin in Old English, later used by students interested in learning Old French, as inferred from glosses in that language.\nIn the Nowell Codex is the text of \"The Wonders of the East\" which includes a remarkable map of the world, and other illustrations. Also contained in Nowell is \"Alexander's Letter to Aristotle\". Because this is the same manuscript that contains \"Beowulf\", some scholars speculate it may have been a collection of materials on exotic places and creatures.\nThere are a number of interesting medical works. There is a translation of \"Apuleius's Herbarium\" with striking illustrations, found together with \"Medicina de Quadrupedibus\". A second collection of texts is \"Bald's Leechbook\", a 10th-century book containing herbal and even some surgical cures. A third collection, known as the \"Lacnunga\", includes many charms and incantations.\nLegal texts are a large and important part of the overall Old English corpus. The Laws of Aethelberht I of Kent, written at the turn of the 7th century, are the earliest surviving English prose work. Other laws wills and charters were written over the following centuries. Towards the end of the 9th, Alfred had compiled the law codes of Aethelberht, Ine, and Offa in a text setting out his own laws, the \"Domboc\". By the 12th century they had been arranged into two large collections (see \"Textus Roffensis\"). They include laws of the kings, beginning with those of Aethelbert of Kent and ending with those of Cnut, and texts dealing with specific cases and places in the country. An interesting example is \"Gerefa\", which outlines the duties of a reeve on a large manor estate. There is also a large volume of legal documents related to religious houses. These include many kinds of texts: records of donations by nobles; wills; documents of emancipation; lists of books and relics; court cases; guild rules. All of these texts provide valuable insights into the social history of Anglo-Saxon times, but are also of literary value. For example, some of the court case narratives are interesting for their use of rhetoric.\nWriting on objects.\nJames Paz proposes reading objects which feature Old English poems or phrases as part of the literary output of the time, and as \"speaking objects\". These objects include the Ruthwell monument (which includes a poem similar to the Dream of the Rood preserved in the Vercelli Book), the Frank's Casket, the Alfred Jewel.\nSemi-Saxon and post-conquest Old English.\n\"The Soul's Address to the Body\" (c. 1150\u20131175) found in Worcester Cathedral Library MS F. 174 contains only one word of possible Latinate origin, while also maintaining a corrupt alliterative meter and Old English grammar and syntax, albeit in a degenerative state (hence, early scholars of Old English termed this late form as \"Semi-Saxon\").\n'The Grave' is a poem preserved in a 12th century manuscript, MS Bodleian 343, at fol. 170r: over time, scholars have called it \"Anglo-Saxon\", \"Norman-Saxon\", late Old English, and Middle English.\nThe \"Peterborough Chronicle\" can also be considered a late-period text, continuing into the 12th century.\nReception and scholarship.\nLater medieval glossing and translation.\nOld English literature did not disappear in 1066 with the Norman Conquest. Many sermons and works continued to be read and used in part or whole up through the 14th century, and were further catalogued and organised. What might be termed the earliest scholarship on Old English literature was done by a 12th or early 13th-century scribe from Worcester known only as The Tremulous Hand \u2013 a sobriquet earned for a hand tremor causing characteristically messy handwriting. The Tremulous Hand is known for many Latin glosses of Old English texts, which represent the earliest attempt to translate the language in the post-Norman period. Perhaps his most well known scribal work is that of the Worcester Cathedral Library MS F. 174, which contains part of \u00c6lfric's \"Grammar\" and \"Glossary\" and a short fragmentary poem often called \"Bede's Death Song\" in addition to the Body and Soul poem.\nAntiquarianism and early scholarship.\nDuring the Reformation, when monastic libraries were dispersed, the manuscripts began to be collected by antiquarians and scholars. Some of the earliest collectors and scholars included Laurence Nowell, Matthew Parker, Robert Bruce Cotton and Humfrey Wanley.\nOld English dictionaries and references were created from the 17th century. The first was William Somner's \"Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum\" (1659). Lexicographer Joseph Bosworth began a dictionary in the 19th century called \"An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary\", which was completed by Thomas Northcote Toller in 1898 and updated by Alistair Campbell in 1972.\n19th, 20th, and 21st century scholarship.\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries the focus was on the Germanic and pagan roots that scholars thought they could detect in Old English literature. Because Old English was one of the first vernacular languages to be written down, 19th-century scholars searching for the roots of European \"national culture\" (see Romantic Nationalism) took special interest in studying what was then commonly referred to as 'Anglo-Saxon literature', and Old English became a regular part of university curriculum.\nAfter World War II there was increasing interest in the manuscripts themselves, developing new palaeographic approaches from antiquarian approaches. Neil Ker, a paleographer, published the groundbreaking \"Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon\" in 1957, and by 1980 nearly all Anglo-Saxon manuscript texts were available as facsimiles or editions.\nOn account of the work of Bernard F. Hupp\u00e9, attention to the influence of Augustinian exegesis increased in scholarship.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien is often credited with creating a movement to look at Old English as a subject of literary theory in his seminal lecture \"\" (1936).\nSince the 1970s, along with a focus upon paleography and the physical manuscripts themselves more generally, scholars continue to debate such issues as dating, place of origin, authorship, connections between Old English literary culture and global medieval literatures, and the valences of Old English poetry that may be revealed by contemporary theory: for instance, feminist, queer, critical race, and eco-critical theories.\nInfluence on modern English literature.\nProse.\nTolkien adapted the subject matter and terminology of heroic poetry for works like \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", and John Gardner wrote \"Grendel\", which tells the story of Beowulf's opponent from his own perspective.\nPoetry.\nOld English literature has had some influence on modern literature, and notable poets have translated and incorporated Old English poetry. Well-known early translations include Alfred, Lord Tennyson's translation of \"The Battle of Brunanburh\", William Morris's translation of \"Beowulf\", and Ezra Pound's translation of \"The Seafarer\". The influence of the poetry can be seen in modern poets Ezra Pound and W. H. Auden.\nMore recently other notable poets such as Paul Muldoon, Edwin Morgan, Seamus Heaney, Denise Levertov and U. A. Fanthorpe have all shown an interest in Old English poetry. In 1987 Denise Levertov published \"C\u00e6dmon\", an original composition based on Bede's account for the poet C\u00e6dmon of C\u00e6dmon's Hymn in the collection \"Breathing the Water\". This was followed by Seamus Heaney's version of the poem \"Whitby-sur-Moyola\" in his \"The Spirit Level\" (1996), Paul Muldoon's \"Caedmona's Hymn\" in his \"Moy Sand and Gravel\" (2002) and U.A. Fanthorpe's \"Caedmon's Song\" in her \"Queuing for the Sun\" (2003).\nIn 2000, Seamus Heaney published his translation of \"Beowulf\". Heaney uses Irish diction across \"Beowulf\" to bring what he calls a \"special body and force\" to the poem, putting forward his own Ulster heritage, \"in order to render [the poem] ever more 'willable forward/again and again and again.'\"\nEditions.\nThe entire corpus of Old English poetry is being edited and annotated to available digital images of manuscript pages and objects, with Modern English translations, in the \"Old English Poetry in Facsimile Project\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was sold in Europe as the Philips Videopac G7000, in Brazil and Peru as the Philips Odyssey and in Japan as Odyssey2 (\u30aa\u30c7\u30c3\u30bb\u30a42 \"odessei2\"). The Odyssey 2 was one of the five major home consoles prior to the 1983 video game market crash, along with Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Intellivision and ColecoVision.\nIn the early 1970s, Magnavox pioneered the home video game industry by successfully bringing the first home console to market, the Odyssey, which was quickly followed by a number of later models, each with a few technological improvements (\"see Magnavox Odyssey series\"). In 1978, Magnavox, now a subsidiary of North American Philips, decided to release an all-new successor, Odyssey 2.\nIn 2009, the video game website IGN named the Odyssey 2 the 21st greatest video game console, out of its list of 25.\nDesign.\nThe original Odyssey had a number of removable circuit cards that switched between the built-in games. With the Odyssey 2, each game could be a unique experience, with its own foreground graphics, gameplay, scoring, and music (some Odyssey 2 games were later re-released for the G7400 with added background and updated foreground graphics that the Odyssey 2 was not capable of displaying). The potential was enormous, as an unlimited number of games could be individually purchased; a game player could purchase a library of video games tailored to their own interest. Unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey 2 included a full alphanumeric membrane keyboard, which was to be used for educational games, selecting options, or programming (Magnavox released a cartridge called \"Computer Intro!\" with the intent of teaching simple computer programming).\nThe Odyssey 2 used the standard joystick design of the 1970s and early 1980s: the original console had a moderately sized silver controller, held in one hand, with a square housing for its eight-direction stick that was manipulated with the other hand. Later releases had a similar black controller, with an 8-pointed star-shaped housing for its eight-direction joystick. In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers. The games, graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner.\nDuring the time of Odyssey 2's manufacturing, some came with controllers that could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit via their DB9 connector, while others had their controllers hardwired into the rear of the base unit itself.\nOne of the strongest points of the system was its speech synthesis unit, which was released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement. The area that the Odyssey 2 may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games: \"The Master Strategy Series\". The first game released was \"Quest for the Rings!\", with gameplay somewhat similar to \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Later, two other games were released in this series, \"Conquest of the World\" and \"The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt\", each with its own gameboard.\nIts graphics and few color choices, compared to its biggest competitors at the time\u2014the Atari 2600, Mattel's Intellivision and the Bally Astrocade\u2014were its \"weakest point\". Of these systems, the Odyssey 2 was listed by Jeff Rovin as being the third in total of sales, and one of the seven major video game suppliers.\nMarket life.\nUnited States.\nThe console sold moderately well in the U.S. Prior to the nationwide release of the Mattel Intellivision in 1980, the console video game market was dominated by the competition between the Odyssey 2 and Atari 2600. It remained one of the three primary consoles from 1980 to mid-1982, though a distant third behind the Atari 2600 and Mattel Intellivision.\nTo sell would-be customers on its resemblance to a home computer, the Odyssey 2 was marketed with phrases such as \"The Ultimate Computer Video Game System\", \"Sync-Sound Action\", \"True-Reality Synthesization\", \"On-Screen Digital Readouts\" and \"a serious educational tool\" on the packaging for the console and its game cartridges. All games, aside from Showdown in 2100 AD, produced by Magnavox/Philips ended with an exclamation point, such as \"K.C. Munchkin!\" and \"Killer Bees!\".\nNo third-party game appeared for the Odyssey 2 in the United States until Imagic's \"Demon Attack\" in 1983. The lack of third-party support kept the number of new games very limited, but the success of the Philips Videopac G7000 overseas led to two other companies producing games for it: Parker Brothers released \"Popeye\", \"Frogger\", \"Q*bert\" and \"Super Cobra\", while Imagic also released \"Atlantis\".\nEurope.\nIn Europe, the Odyssey 2 did very well on the market. The console was most widely known as the Philips Videopac G7000, or just the Videopac, although branded variants were released in some areas of Europe under the names Philips Videopac C52, Radiola Jet 25, Schneider 7000, and Siera G7000. Philips used their own name rather than Magnavox's for European marketing. A rare model, the Philips Videopac G7200, was only released in Europe; it had a built-in black-and-white monitor. Videopac game cartridges are mostly compatible with American Odyssey 2 units, although some games have color differences and a few are completely incompatible, such as Frogger on the European console, being unable to show the second half of the playing field, and Chess on the American model, as the extra hardware module could not work with the console. A number of additional games were released in Europe that never came out in the U.S.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, the console was released simply as Philips Odyssey (since the original Odyssey had had only a limited release by a local company, Planil Com\u00e9rcio, under license). The Odyssey 2 became much more popular in Brazil than it ever was in the U.S.; tournaments were even held for popular games like \"K.C.'s Krazy Chase!\" (\"Come-Come!\" in Brazil). Titles of games were translated into Portuguese, sometimes creating a new story, like \"Pick-axe Pete!\", that became \"Didi na Mina Encantada!\" (Didi in the Enchanted Mine) referring to Renato Arag\u00e3o's comedy character, and was one of the most famous Odyssey games in Brazil.\nJapan.\nThe Odyssey 2 was released in Japan in December 1982 by K\u014dton Trading Toitarii Enterprise (\u30b3\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30c8\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba, a division of DINGU company) under the name \u30aa\u30c7\u30c3\u30bb\u30a42 (\"odessei2\"). \"Japanese\" versions of the Odyssey 2 and its games consisted of the American boxes with katakana stickers on them and cheaply printed black-and-white Japanese manuals. The initial price for the console was \u00a5, which is approximately US$. It was apparently not very successful; Japanese Odyssey 2 items are now very difficult to find.\nEmulation.\nAn open source Odyssey 2 console emulator called \"O2EM\" is available for Windows, Linux, and as part of OpenEmu, Mac OS X.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The authorship of the Book of Obadiah is traditionally attributed to the prophet Obadiah.\nMost scholars date the Book of Obadiah to shortly after the fall of Jerusalem in 587 BC. Other scholars hold that the book was shaped by the conflicts between Yehud and the Edomites in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE and evolved through a process of redaction.\nBiblical account.\nDating.\nThe composition date is disputed and difficult to determine due to the lack of information regarding the prophet Obadiah. However, because Obadiah wrote about Edom, there are two generally accepted dates. The first is 853\u2013841 BC, when Jerusalem was invaded by Philistines and Arabs during the reign of Jehoram of Judah (recorded in 2 Kings 8:20\u201322 and 2 Chronicles 21:8-17). This earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet Elijah. Jewish traditions favor the earlier date because the Jewish Talmud identifies Obadiah as an Edomite himself, and a descendant of Eliphaz the Temanite, the first of the friends of Job to speak with him about his tribulations.\nThe other is 607\u2013586 BCE, when Jerusalem was attacked by Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which led to the Babylonian captivity (recorded in Psalm 137). The later date would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet Jeremiah. The Interpreters' Bible states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The political situation implied in the prophecy points to a time after the Exile, probably in the mid-fifth century B.C. No value can be attributed to traditions identifying this prophet with King Ahab's steward (... so Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 39\"b\") or with King Ahaziah's captain (... so Pseudo-Epiphanius...).\n \u2014 The Interpreters' Bible.\nRabbinic tradition.\nAccording to the Talmud, Obadiah is said to have been a convert to Judaism from Edom, a descendant of Eliphaz, the friend of Job. He is identified with the Obadiah who was the servant of Ahab, and was chosen to prophesy against Edom because he was himself an Edomite.\nObadiah is supposed to have received the gift of prophecy for having hidden the \"hundred prophets\" from the persecution of Jezebel. He hid the prophets in two caves, so that if those in one cave should be discovered those in the other might yet escape.\nObadiah was very rich, but all his wealth was expended in feeding the poor prophets, until, in order to be able to continue to support them, finally he had to borrow money at interest from Ahab's son Jehoram. Obadiah's fear of God was one degree higher than that of Abraham; and if the house of Ahab had been capable of being blessed, it would have been blessed for Obadiah's sake.\nChristian tradition.\nIn some Christian traditions he is said to have been born in \"Sychem\" (Shechem), and to have been the third captain sent out by Ahaziah against Elijah. The date of his ministry is unclear due to certain historical ambiguities in the book bearing his name, but is believed to be around 586 B.C.\nHe is regarded as a saint by several Eastern churches. His feast day is celebrated on the 15th day of the Coptic Month Tobi (23/24 January) in the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite celebrate his memory on 19 November. (For those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 19 November currently falls on 2 December of the modern Gregorian Calendar.)\nHe is celebrated on 28 February in the Syriac and Malankara Churches, and with the other Minor prophets in the Calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on 31 July.\nAccording to an old tradition, Obadiah is buried in Sebastia, at the same site as Elisha and where later the body of John the Baptist was believed to have been buried by his followers.\nIslamic tradition.\nIn Islam, Adbiyya ibn Sh\u0101miyya (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0629) is considered to be an Isra\u02bciliyyat prophet sent to guide the Bani-Israel possibly in the era of the Prophet Ily\u0101s (Elijah) or shortly after. Some Islamic scholars identify the prophet Dhu al-Kifl with Obadiah.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Doctors who specialize in this area are called otorhinolaryngologists, otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons, or ENT surgeons or physicians.\nPatients seek treatment from an otorhinolaryngologist for diseases of the ear, nose, throat, base of the skull, head, and neck. These commonly include functional diseases that affect the senses and activities of eating, drinking, speaking, breathing, swallowing, and hearing. In addition, ENT surgery encompasses the surgical management of cancers and benign tumors and reconstruction of the head and neck as well as plastic surgery of the face, scalp, and neck.\nEtymology.\nThe term is a combination of Neo-Latin combining forms (\"oto-\" + \"rhino-\" + \"laryngo-\" + \"-logy\") derived from four Ancient Greek words: (cf. Greek 'otorhinolaryngologist').\nTraining.\nOtorhinolaryngologists are physicians (MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB, etc.) who complete both medical school and an average of five\u2013seven years of post-graduate surgical training in ORL-H&amp;N. In the United States, trainees complete at least five years of surgical residency training. This comprises three to six months of general surgical training and four and a half years in ORL-H&amp;N specialist surgery. In Canada and the United States, practitioners complete a five-year residency training after medical school.\nFollowing residency training, some otolaryngologist-head &amp; neck surgeons complete an advanced sub-specialty fellowship, where training can be one to two years in duration. Fellowships include head and neck surgical oncology, facial plastic surgery, rhinology and sinus surgery, neuro-otology, pediatric otolaryngology, and laryngology. In the United States and Canada, otorhinolaryngology is one of the most competitive specialties in medicine in which to obtain a residency position following medical school.\nIn the United Kingdom, entrance to higher surgical training is competitive and involves a rigorous national selection process. The training programme consists of 6 years of higher surgical training after which trainees frequently undertake fellowships in a sub-speciality prior to becoming a consultant.\nThe typical total length of education, training and post-secondary school is 12\u201314 years. Otolaryngology is among the more highly compensated surgical specialties in the United States. In 2022, the average annual income was $469,000.\nTopics by subspecialty.\nOtology and neurotology.\nStudy of diseases of the outer ear, middle ear and mastoid, and inner ear, and surrounding structures (such as the facial nerve and lateral skull base)\nRhinology.\nRhinology includes nasal dysfunction and sinus diseases.\nFacial plastic and reconstructive surgery.\nFacial plastic and reconstructive surgery is a one-year fellowship open to otorhinolaryngologists who wish to begin learning the aesthetic and reconstructive surgical principles of the head, face, and neck pioneered by the specialty of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.\nSleep surgery.\nSleep surgery encompasses any surgery that helps alleviate obstructive sleep apnea and can anatomically include any part of the upper airway.\nMicrovascular reconstruction repair.\nMicrovascular reconstruction repair is a common operation that is done on patients who see an otorhinolaryngologist. It is a surgical procedure that involves moving a composite piece of tissue from the patient's body and to the head and/or neck. Microvascular head-and-neck reconstruction is used to treat head-and-neck cancers, including those of the larynx and pharynx, oral cavity, salivary glands, jaws, calvarium, sinuses, tongue and skin. The tissue that is most commonly moved during this procedure is from the arms, legs, and back, and can come from the skin, bone, fat, and/or muscle.\nWhen performing this procedure, the decision on which is moved is determined on the reconstructive needs. Transfer of the tissue to the head and neck allows surgeons to rebuild the patient's jaw, optimize tongue function, and reconstruct the throat. When the pieces of tissue are moved, they require their own blood supply for a chance of survival in their new location. After the surgery is completed, the blood vessels that feed the tissue transplant are reconnected to new blood vessels in the neck. These blood vessels are typically no more than 1 to 3\u00a0millimeters in diameter, which means that these connections need to be made with a microscope, which is why the procedure is called \"microvascular surgery\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They feature summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games, open to both amateur and professional athletes, involves more than 200 teams, each team representing a sovereign state or territory. By default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships during the year in which they take place (however, each class usually maintains its own records). The Olympics are staged every four years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad.\nTheir creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de\u00a0Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority.\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC has adapted to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions.\nThe Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag, the Olympic flame and torch relay, and the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events. The first-, second-, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.\nThe Games have grown to the point that nearly every nation is now represented; colonies and overseas territories are often allowed to field their own teams. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, match fixing, bribery, and terrorism. Every two years, the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and international fame. The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.\nThe Olympic Games have become a significant global event, fostering international cooperation and cultural exchange. At the same time, hosting the Olympic Games can also bring significant economic benefits and challenges to the host city, affecting infrastructure, tourism and local communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient Olympics.\nThe \"Ancient Olympic Games\" (, \"ta Olympia\") were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. The date of the festival was determined according to a complicated formula whereby the midpoint of the festival would occur during the second full moon after the summer solstice\u2014usually late August or early September.2638 This \"came after the annual harvest but before the picking of the olives.\" Heralds were sent from Elis to announce the dates.2638 Competition at first was among only \"legitimate sons of free-born Greek parents.\"49 However, after Macedonia, and then Rome, conquered Greece, the ten Olympic judges loosened the earlier standard and permitted anyone who spoke Greek to participate.50 Tens of thousands of Greeks would make the difficult journey to attend the festival.55 Some sources say as many as 40,000 attended. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce only allowed those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.\nThe origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;12 one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games \"Olympic\" and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a \"stadion\" (, Latin: , \"stage\"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776\u00a0BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776\u00a0BC. For the first thirteen Olympics, the \"stadion\" footrace was the only event contested,145 and victory in that sprint was so valued that the next Olympiad was named after the winner, e.g. \"the third year of the eighteenth Olympiad when Ladas of Argos won the stadion.\"145 The Ancient Games varied over time, but they came to feature running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events. Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion, which indicates that the competition was not limited to the aristocracy.\nThe Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, and the sporting events, which were held alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops (divine hero and mythical king of Olympia), did not start until the festival's second day.15 (Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis.) The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues. Although a wreath made from the sacred olive tree in the precinct of Zeus was the only official prize at the Olympic Games, winners' fame brought them economic wealth, too, in the form of subsidies from their hometowns and wealthy sponsors. See, e.g., Finley and Pleket, and Perrottet The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.\nThe Olympic Games reached the height of their success in the 6th and 5th\u00a0centuries\u00a0BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393\u00a0AD, when the emperor Theodosius\u00a0I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated. Another date commonly cited is 426\u00a0AD, when his successor, Theodosius\u00a0II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.\nModern Games.\nForerunners.\nVarious uses of the term \"Olympic\" to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century. The first such event was the Cotswold Games or \"Cotswold Olimpick Games\", an annual meeting near Chipping Campden, England, involving various sports. It was first organised by the lawyer Robert Dover between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day. The British Olympic Association, in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, mentioned these games as \"the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings\".\n, a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in Revolutionary France also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games. The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the metric system into sport.\nIn 1834 and 1836, the Olympic Games were held in Raml\u00f6sa, Sweden, and in Stockholm in 1843, organised by Gustaf Johan Schartau and others. The Games were attended by 25,000 spectators at most.\nIn 1850, an Olympian Class was started by William Penny Brookes at Much Wenlock, in Shropshire, England. In 1859, Brookes changed the name to the Wenlock Olympian Games. This annual sports festival continues to this day.144 The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Brookes on 15\u00a0November 1860.28\nBetween 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' could compete. The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. In 1865 Hulley, Brookes and E.\u00a0G.\u00a0Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter.24 In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organised at London's Crystal Palace.\nRevival.\nGreek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem \"Dialogue of the Dead\", published in 1833.1 Evangelos Zappas, a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.14 Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859, which was held in an Athens city square. Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Games.14\nThe stadium hosted the Olympics in 1870 and 1875. Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.44 In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron Pierre de\u00a0Coubertin, who aimed to promote international peace and friendship through sports, was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years. He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23\u00a0June 1894, at the University of Paris. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896. The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president. \n1896 Games.\nThe first Games held under the auspices of the IOC were hosted in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events. Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games.117 George Averoff contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games.128 The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.128\nGreek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.\nChanges and adaptations.\nAfter the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation which threatened its survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St.\u00a0Louis in 1904 failed to attract much participation or notice. Of the 650 athletes in the 1904 Olympics, 580 were American; the winner of the marathon was later disqualified upon discovery of a photograph of him riding in a car during the race. The Games rebounded with the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Olympics to take place within the third Olympiad), which were held in Athens. These Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated a great deal of public interest, marking the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics. The 1906 Games were officially recognised by the IOC at the time (although not any longer), and no Intercalated Games have been held since.\nWinter Games.\nThe Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11\u00a0days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although, it was intended that the \"same\" country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years in the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.405\nParalympics.\nIn 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, determined to promote the rehabilitation of soldiers after World War\u00a0II, organised a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics. Originally known as the Stoke Mandeville Games, Guttmann's event became an annual sports festival. Over the next 12 years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing.\nIn 1960, Guttmann brought 400 athletes to Rome to compete in the \"Parallel Olympics\", which ran in parallel with the Summer Olympics and came to be known as the first Paralympics. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year and, starting with the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement in 2001 which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.\nTwo years before the 2012 Games, the LOCOG chairman Lord Coe made the following statement about the Paralympics and Olympics in London:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We want to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole.\nYouth Games.\nIn 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC. The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14 to 26\u00a0August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck, Austria, two years later. These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days. The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games. The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.\n21st-century Games.\nOver 14,000 athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events. The Summer Olympics have grown from 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, to more than 11,300 competitors representing 206 nations in 2020. The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller; for example, Beijing hosted 2,971 athletes from 91\u00a0nations in 2022. Most of the athletes and officials are housed in the Olympic Village for the duration of the Games. This accommodation centre is designed to be a self-contained home for all Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.\nThe IOC has allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to represent individual nations. These do not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organisations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games, examples being territories such as Puerto Rico, Bermuda, and Hong Kong, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country. The current version of the Olympic Charter allows for the establishment of new NOCs to represent nations that qualify as \"an independent State recognised by the international community\". Consequently, the IOC did not allow the formation of NOCs for Sint Maarten and Cura\u00e7ao when they gained the same constitutional status as Aruba in 2010, although the IOC had recognised the Aruban Olympic Committee in 1986. Since 2012, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles have had the option to represent either the Netherlands or Aruba.\nCost of the Games.\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 found that, since 1960, sports-related costs for the Summer Games were on average US$5.2\u00a0billion and for the Winter Games $3.1\u00a0billion. These figures do not include wider infrastructure costs like roads, urban rail, and airports, which often cost as much or more than the sports-related costs. The most expensive Summer Games were Beijing 2008 at US$40\u200d\u2013\u200d44\u00a0billion, and the most expensive Winter Games were Sochi 2014 at US$51\u00a0billion. As of 2016, costs per athlete were, on average, US$599,000 for the Summer Games and $1.3\u00a0million for the Winter Games; for London 2012, the cost per athlete was $1.4\u00a0million, and the figure was $7.9\u00a0million for Sochi 2014.\nWhere ambitious construction for the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow had burdened organisers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses for the 1984 Summer Games by using existing facilities and only two new that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The organising committee, led by Peter Ueberroth, used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered until that date, the most financially successful modern Olympics and a model for future Games.\nBudget overruns are common for the Games. Average overrun for Games since 1960 is 156% in real terms, which means that actual costs turned out to be on average 2.56 times the budget that was estimated at the time of winning the bid to host the Games. Montreal 1976 had the highest cost overrun for Summer Games, and for any Games, at 720%; Lake Placid 1980 had the highest cost overrun for Winter Games, at 324%. London 2012 had a cost overrun of 76%, Sochi 2014 of 289%.\nIt has been documented that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution, meaning that the Games are prone to large cost overruns, and it is only a matter of time before an overrun occurs that exceeds the largest to date. In short, hosting the Games carries extreme economical and financial risks.\nThe final cost for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was reported to be JPY 1,423.8\u00a0billion (US$13\u00a0billion). This was achieved by balancing revenues and expenditures through various efforts to increase revenue and continuously review expenditures. The primary sources of revenue included the International Olympic Committee (IOC) contribution of JPY 86.8\u00a0billion (US$0.8\u00a0billion), TOP sponsorship of JPY 56.9\u00a0billion (US$0.5\u00a0billion), local sponsorship of JPY 376.1\u00a0billion (US$3.4\u00a0billion), an insurance payout of JPY 50\u00a0billion (US$0.5\u00a0billion) for the postponement of the Games, and other sources including licensing. The expenditures included JPY 195.5\u00a0billion (US$1.8\u00a0billion) for venue-related costs and JPY 444.9\u00a0billion (US$4\u00a0billion) for service expenditures. The total cost also accounted for COVID-19 countermeasures amounting to JPY 35.3\u00a0billion (US$0.3\u00a0billion). Despite initial estimates, the total costs were reduced by JPY 220.2\u00a0billion (US$2\u00a0billion) from the budget announced in December 2020, and JPY 29.2\u00a0billion (US$0.3\u00a0billion) from the estimated budget in December 2021. This successful financial management resulted in a balanced budget for the Tokyo 2020 Games.\nEconomic and social impact on host cities and countries.\nSeeking a scholarly institution to independently research the Games, Bob Barney led efforts to establish the International Centre for Olympic Studies in 1989, endeavouring to write about sociocultural impacts of the Olympic Games. He felt that the Olympics \"is worthy of study because it is one of the biggest meetings in a global context and has many political, economic, and other problems associated with it\". He began \"Olympika\" in 1992, the first peer-reviewed academic journal focused on the Olympic Games. Founded in 1991, the International Society of Olympic Historians publishes the \"Journal of Olympic History\".\nSome economists are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such \"mega-events\" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, though it is not permanent.\nThe Games have had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50\u00a0billion. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released at the time of the Games, the cost would not boost Russia's national economy but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia as a result of improved services. By December 2014, eight months after the Games, \"The Guardian\" stated that Sochi \"now feels like a ghost town\", citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas and the still-unfinished infrastructure. At least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or lack of local support, resulting in only a two-city race between Almaty, Kazakhstan, and Beijing, China (which hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics). \"The Guardian\" stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is that few cities or countries want to host them. Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles. Both of the bids were praised for their high-tech plans and innovative ways of using a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities.\nInternational Olympic Committee.\nThe Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter. As the umbrella organisation of the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the Olympic sports programme, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.\nThe Olympic Movement is made of three main elements:\nFrench and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country. These languages were spoken in the traditional order: French is always spoken first, followed by English, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).\nIn March 2025, Kirsty Coventry made history by becoming the first woman and the first African to be elected as President of the IOC. Coventry embodies high aspirations, envisioning a future where the Olympics serve as a symbol of global unity, weaving together diverse cultures and nations through athletic excellence. Coventry's leadership is set to ensure that every nation has an equal chance to shine on the Olympic stage, separating sports from politics. Coventry's plans align with the IOC's broader efforts to strengthen global partnerships, particularly with BRICS nations, while reinforcing its role as a global unifier, promoting peace and development through sports. \nAllegations of bribery and corruption.\nThe IOC has often been accused of being an intractable organisation, with several life members on the committee. The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial. Brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against the commercialisation of the Olympic Games, even as these attitudes came to be seen as incongruous with the realities of modern sports. The advent of state-sponsored athletes from the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it placed self-financed amateurs of Western countries at a disadvantage. Brundage was accused of antisemitism and of racism in resisting the exclusion of South Africa. Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption. Samaranch's ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism.\nIn 1998, it was reported that several IOC members had taken gifts from members of the Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics. There were soon four independent investigations underway: by the IOC, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Although nothing strictly illegal had occurred, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. As a result of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were expelled and a further ten sanctioned. Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were introduced to define how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee. Nevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, the 2002 Olympics were one of the most successful Winter Games in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over two billion viewers watched more than 13\u00a0billion viewer-hours. The 2002 Games were also a financial success, raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, leaving SLOC with a surplus of $40\u00a0million. This excess revenue was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation (also known as the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation), which maintains and operates many of the surviving Olympic venues.\nIt was reported in 1999 that the Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately $14\u00a0million on entertaining the 62 IOC members and many of their associates. The precise figures are unknown since Nagano destroyed the financial records after the IOC requested that the entertainment expenditures should not be made public.\nIn July 2000, when the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported on the tangled nature of how the IOC redistributes profits from sponsorships and broadcasting rights, Olympic historian Bob Barney stated that he had \"yet to see matters of corruption in the IOC\" but noted that there were \"matters of unaccountability\". He later noted that when the spotlight is on the athletes, it has \"the power to eclipse impressions of scandal or corruption\", with respect to the Olympic bid process.\nIn August 2004, a BBC documentary, \"Panorama: Buying the Games\", reported the results of an investigation into bribes allegedly used in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The documentary claimed that it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Games, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb specifically accused the British prime minister Tony Blair and the London bid committee, headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe, of breaking the bid rules. He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews concerning his involvement but the allegation was never fully explored. Turin's bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics was also clouded by controversy; a prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, closely connected to the rival bid of Sion, Switzerland, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation, and also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid which potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.\nCommercialisation.\nUnder national organising committees.\nThe Olympic Games have been commercialised to various degrees since the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, when a number of companies paid for advertising, including Kodak. In 1908, Oxo, Odol mouthwash, and Indian Foot Powder became official sponsors of the London Olympic Games. Coca-Cola first sponsored the Summer Olympics in 1928, and has remained an Olympic sponsor ever since. Before the IOC took control of sponsorship, the NOCs had responsibility for negotiating their own contracts for sponsorship and use of the Olympic symbols.231\nUnder IOC control.\nThe IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors. It was not until the retirement of IOC President Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.231 Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.\nBudget.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the IOC ran on a small budget. As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.231 He believed that the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making. His resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.231 When Brundage retired, the IOC had US$2\u00a0million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45\u00a0million. This was primarily caused by a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.231 When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980, his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics became a watershed moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organising committee, led by Peter Ueberroth, was able to generate a surplus of US$225\u00a0million\u2014an unprecedented amount at that time.209 The organising committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies.209 The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Programme (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand. Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50\u00a0million for a four-year membership. Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic emblem\u2014the five interlocking rings\u2014in their publications and advertisements.194\nEffect of television.\nThe 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences. The 1956 Winter Olympics in Italy were the first internationally televised Olympic Games, and the broadcasting rights for the following Winter Games in California were sold for the first time to specialised television broadcasting networks\u2014CBS paid US$394,000 for the American rights.192 In the following decades, the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium.192 The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn enhanced the appeal of TV air time to the advertisers. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights.192 For example, CBS paid US$375\u00a0million for the American broadcast rights for the 1998 Nagano Games, while NBC spent US$3.5\u00a0billion for the American rights to air every Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.\nIn 2011, NBC agreed to a $4.38\u00a0billion contract with the IOC to broadcast the Olympics through to the 2020 Games, the most expensive television rights deal in Olympic history. NBC then agreed to a $7.75\u00a0billion contract extension on 7\u00a0May 2014, to air the Olympics up to and including the 2032 Games. NBC also acquired the American television rights to the Youth Olympic Games, beginning in 2014, and the Paralympic Games. More than half of the Olympic Committee's global sponsors are American companies, and NBC is one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC.\nOn 13 March 2025, it was announced that Comcast would pay the IOC $3\u00a0billion to air the Olympics through 2036, and that Comcast would transition its role in the Games from Rights Holder to Strategic Partner, furthering their partnership. The announcement comes after the 2024 Paris Olympics received strong ratings for NBC and a boost in subscribers for Peacock. This deal gives NBC the rights to air the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the 2030 French Alps Winter Olympics, the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, the 2034 Utah Winter Olympics and the 2036 Olympic Games, with the latter marking the 100th anniversary of the first televised Games held in Berlin.\nViewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the 20th century. This was due to the advent of satellites for broadcasting live television worldwide starting in 1964, and the introduction of colour television in 1968. The global audience for the 1968 Mexico City Games was estimated to be 600\u00a0million, whereas the audience numbers at the Los Angeles Games of 1984 had increased to 900\u00a0million; this number had swelled to 3.5\u00a0billion by the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings. The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic programme; at the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to attract greater interest;17 the events programmes were also expanded for swimming and diving, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers.17 Due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed the network to influence the event scheduling to maximise U.S. television ratings when possible.230 Notable examples of maximising U.S. television viewership include scheduling the finals of the swimming events only during the mornings of the host cities Beijing (during the 2008 Summer Olympics) and Tokyo (during the 2020 Summer Olympics), which coincide with the evening prime time broadcast slots of the United States.\nOlympic marketing.\nThe funds from licensing programs support everything that goes into the Games, alongside other revenue streams from ticket sales and broadcasting rights, which represent more than 60\u00a0percent.\nThe sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial. The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle.194 Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income.194 Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30\u00a0percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.\nSymbols.\nThe Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The main emblem of the Games is the Olympic rings\u2014five intertwined rings symbolising the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, the Americas (considered as one continent), Asia, Europe, and Oceania). The coloured version of the rings\u2014blue, yellow, black, green, and red\u2014over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games. The IOC maintains exclusive ownership and control of the use of Olympic symbols through the Nairobi Treaty on the Protection of the Olympic Symbol.\nThe Olympic motto, , a Latin expression meaning \"Faster, Higher, Stronger\" was proposed by Pierre de\u00a0Coubertin in 1894 and has been official since 1924. The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend, the Dominican priest Henri Didon OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.\nCoubertin's Olympic ideals are expressed in the Olympic creed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMonths before each Games, the Olympic flame is lit at the Temple of Hera in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess joined by ten female performers as Vestal Virgins, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer (who also is a Greek athlete), thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.\nThe Olympic mascot, an animal, a human or an anthropomorphic figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in 1968. It has played an important part of the identity and promotion of the Games since the 1980 Summer Olympics, when the Soviet bear cub Misha reached international stardom. The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an inspiration to Pierre de\u00a0Coubertin for the Olympic Games. The mascot for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games is an anthropomorphic Phrygian cap based on the one Marianne wore at the time of the French Revolution.\nCeremonies.\nOpening ceremony.\nAs mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place on a Friday and is held prior to the commencement of the sporting events (apart from some group-stage football matches, softball games, and rowing heats). Most of the rituals for the opening ceremony were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the entrance of the president of the International Olympic Committee and a representative of the host country followed by the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100\u00a0million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.\nAfter the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter and leads the parade in order to honour the origins of the Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Athens, the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Olympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (summer or winter) will enter immediately before the current host in descending order. Speeches are given by the President of the Organising Committee, the IOC president, and the head of state/representative of the host country, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place on a Sunday and after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host country; the flag of Greece, to honour the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. The president of the organising committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished. In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the current mayor of the city that organised the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the current mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture.\nAs is customary, the last medal presentation of the Games is held as part of the closing ceremony. Typically, the marathon medals are presented at the Summer Olympics, while the cross-country skiing mass start medals are awarded at the Winter Olympics.\nMedal presentation.\nA medal ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Olympic event. The winner, and the second- and third-place competitors or teams, stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals by a member of the IOC. After the medals have been received, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country is played. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, assisting the officials who present the medals and acting as flag-bearers. In the Summer Olympics, each medal ceremony is held at the venue where the event has taken place, but the ceremonies at the Winter Olympics are usually held in a special \"plaza\".\nThe practice of awarding Olympic medals at podium ceremonies was established at the 1932 Winter Olympics, based on pedestals used at the 1930 British Empire Games, as proposed by Melville Marks Robinson.\nSports.\nThe Olympic Games programme consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and 408 events. For example, wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class. The Summer Olympics programme includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics programme features 15 sports. Athletics, swimming, fencing, and artistic gymnastics are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic programme. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been featured at every Winter Olympics programme since its inception in 1924. Current Olympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and volleyball, first appeared on the programme as demonstration sports and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the programme.\nOlympic sports are governed by international sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC. There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included in the Olympic programme. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a programme revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games. During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC. There are recognised sports that have never been on an Olympic programme in any capacity, for example, orienteering.\nIn October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby sevens, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby sevens as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.\nThe 114th IOC Session, in 2002, limited the Summer Games programme to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major programme revision was performed, resulting in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official programme of the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports. The 2016 and 2020 Games returned to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.\nAmateurism and professionalism.\nThe ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de\u00a0Coubertin. The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying \"mens sana in corpore sano\", a healthy mind in a healthy body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 after a ruling found that the decision to strip him of his medals fell outside of the 30-day period. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but in reality they were all paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. The situation greatly disadvantaged American and Western European athletes, and this was a significant factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism, as envisioned by Pierre de\u00a0Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes, but only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its influence within the IOC.\nTeam Canada ice hockey dispute.\nNear the end of the 1960s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team's full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and IOC. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players at the 1970 World Championships in Montreal and Winnipeg, Canada. The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey's status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made. In response, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition and officials stated that they would not return until \"open competition\" was instituted. G\u00fcnther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow \"open competition\" between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics until 1988, because of the IOC's amateur-only policy.\nControversies.\nBoycotts.\nAustralia, France, Greece, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.\nThere were three boycotts of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics: the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland refused to attend because of the repression of the Hungarian uprising by the Soviet Union but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the Suez Crisis; and the People's Republic of China boycotted the Games due to the participation of the Republic of China, composed of athletes coming from Taiwan.\nIn 1972 and 1976 a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist rule. New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport. Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.\nThe Republic of China (Taiwan) was excluded from the 1976 Games by order of Pierre Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. Trudeau's action was widely condemned as having brought shame on Canada for having succumbed to political pressure to keep the Chinese delegation from competing under its name. The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the ROC flag and anthem as long as the name was changed. Athletes from Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when they returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.\nIn 1980 and 1984, the Cold War opponents boycotted each other's Games. The United States and sixty-five other countries boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980 because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 80, the lowest number since 1956. The Soviet Union and 15 other nations countered by boycotting the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time. The fact that Romania, a Warsaw Pact country, opted to compete despite Soviet demands led to a warm reception of the Romanian team by the United States. When the Romanian athletes entered during the opening ceremonies, they received a standing ovation from the spectators, who comprised mostly U.S. citizens. The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event, the Friendship Games, in July and August.\nThere had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's human rights record, and in response to Tibetan disturbances. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott. In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war. Continuing human rights violations in China have led to \"diplomatic boycotts\", where athletes still compete at the Games but diplomats do not attend, of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing by several countries, most notably the United States.\nPolitics.\nThe Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany wished to portray the National Socialist Party as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the 1936 Games, though they used the Games to display Aryan superiority.107 Germany was the most successful nation at the Games, adding support to their allegations of Aryan supremacy, but the message was somewhat blunted by the notable victories of African American Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals, and Hungarian Jew Ibolya Cs\u00e1k. The Soviet Union did not participate until the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organised an international sports event called Spartakiads. During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organisations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the \"bourgeois\" Olympics with the Workers Olympics. It was not until the 1956 Summer Games that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics. Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state's investment in sports to fulfill its political agenda on an international stage.\nIndividual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200\u00a0metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games. In another notable incident in the gymnastics competition, while standing on the medal podium after the balance beam event final, in which Natalia Kuchinskaya of the Soviet Union had controversially taken the gold, Czechoslovakian gymnast V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 quietly turned her head down and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem. The action was \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1's silent protest against the recent Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her protest was repeated when she accepted her medal for her floor exercise routine when the judges changed the preliminary scores of the Soviet Larisa Petrik to allow her to tie with \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 for the gold. While \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1's countrymen supported her actions and her outspoken opposition to Communism (she had publicly signed and supported Ludvik Vaculik's \"Two Thousand Words\" manifesto), the new regime responded by banning her from both sporting events and international travel for many years and made her an outcast from society until the fall of communism.\nCurrently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. Arash Miresmaeili, an Iranian judoka, did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.\nIn 2022, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the IOC Executive Board \"recommends no participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, urges International Sports Federations and organisers of sports events worldwide to do everything in their power to ensure that no athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus.\" In 2023, the IOC announced that Russian and Belarusian athletes could participate in the Olympics under certain conditions: they must not represent their country or any associated organisation, and those actively supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine are barred from competing. This decision aimed to allow athletes to compete and enhance their stature. While 32 athletes accepted the invitation, 28 qualified athletes declined. Competing under a neutral flag and uniform, these athletes had a neutral song played if they won any medals, instead of their national anthems. Additionally, the audience was prohibited from waving their flags.\nUse of performance-enhancing drugs.\nIn the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach (at the time, taking different substances was allowed, as there was no data regarding the effect of these substances on a body of an athlete). The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the IOC to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\". On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"\nIn 2016, documents obtained revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping programme prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nThe first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics, who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use. One of the most publicised doping-related disqualifications occurred after the 1988 Summer Olympics where Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson (who won the 100-metre dash) tested positive for stanozolol.\nIn 1999, the IOC formed the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in an effort to systematise the research and detection of performance-enhancing drugs. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics due to improved testing conditions. Several medallists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing from post-Soviet states were disqualified because of doping offences. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations attempt to emulate. During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances. In London over 6,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes were tested. Prior to the Games, 107 athletes tested positive for banned substances and were not allowed to compete.\nIn 2024, rumors about China's doping spread as many of the athletes, especially in swimming, were accused of doping before Tokyo 2020. 23 Chinese swimmers were tested positive for prohibited substances, with both the World Anti-Doping Agency and World Aquatics accepting Chinese claims that positive tests were caused by tainted food. After the FBI and Justice Department started investigating, the IOC threatened to revoke the 2034 Olympics in Salt Lake City, unless they dropped the investigation.\nRussian doping scandal.\nDoping in Russian sports has a systemic nature. Russia has had 44 Olympic medals stripped for doping violations\u2014the most of any country, and more than a quarter of the global total. From 2011 to 2015, more than a thousand Russian competitors in various sports, including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports, benefited from a cover-up. Russia was partially banned from the 2016 Summer Olympics and was banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics (while still being allowed to participate as the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\") due to the state-sponsored doping programme.\nIn December 2019, Russia was banned for four years from all major sporting events for systematic doping and lying to WADA. The ban was issued by WADA on 9\u00a0December 2019, and the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA had 21\u00a0days to make an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The ban meant that Russian athletes would only be allowed to compete under the Olympic flag after passing anti-doping tests. Russia appealed the decision to the CAS. On review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, CAS ruled on 17\u00a0December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colours within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.\nIn February 2022, during the Beijing Olympics, the international news media reported that the issue of doping was again raised over a positive test for trimetazidine by the ROC's Kamila Valieva, which was officially confirmed on 11\u00a0February. Valieva's sample in question was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25\u00a0December, but the sample was not analyzed at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) laboratory where it was sent for testing until 8\u00a0February, one day after the team event concluded. CAS was expected to hear the case on 13\u00a0February with a decision scheduled for announcement the next day, ahead of her scheduled appearance in the women's singles event beginning on 15\u00a0February. Due to Valieva being a minor at the time, as well as being classified as a \"protected person\" under WADA guidelines, RUSADA and the IOC announced on 12\u00a0February that they would broaden the scope of their respective investigations to include members of her entourage (e.g. coaches, team doctors, etc.). By the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total five athletes were reported for doping violations. A decision by RUSADA, issued in mid-October and endorsed by WADA, stated that the details of the Valieva hearing and its scheduled dates would be placed under international guidelines for the protection of minors (Valieva was 15 years old when the positive test results were disclosed) and would not be disclosed publicly. Although Russia as a country is currently banned from participating in international skating events due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Valieva has continued to compete within Russian borders without being hindered by RUSADA as recently as the Russian Grand Prix held in October 2022. On 28 September 2023, CAS \"ordered the production of further documentation\" and announced that her hearing had been adjourned until 9\u200d\u2013\u200d10\u00a0November. It appeared that one of the parties in the case requested a file that had not previously been a part of the proceedings. On 10 November, CAS announced that a final decision was expected by the end of January 2024. On 29\u00a0January 2024, the CAS disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation.\nSex discrimination.\nWomen were first allowed to compete at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but at the 1992 Summer Olympics 35 countries were still only fielding all-male delegations. This number dropped rapidly over the following years. In 2000, Bahrain sent two women competitors for the first time: Fatema Hameed Gerashi and Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al Hilli. In 2004, Robina Muqimyar and Fariba Rezayee became the first women to compete for Afghanistan. In 2008, the United Arab Emirates sent female athletes for the first time; Maitha Al Maktoum competed in taekwondo, and Latifa Al Maktoum in equestrian. Both athletes were from Dubai's ruling family.\nBy 2010, only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games: Brunei, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would \"press\" these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Anita DeFrantz, chair of the IOC's Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the Qatar Olympic Committee announced that it \"hoped to send up to four female athletes in shooting and fencing\" to the 2012 Summer Games.\nIn 2008, Ali al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: \"For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organisations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination.\u00a0 While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion.\" In July 2010, \"The Independent\" reported: \"Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012.\u00a0... Should Saudi Arabia\u00a0... send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games\".\nAt the 2012 Summer Olympics, every participating nation included female athletes for the first time in Olympic history. Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one (Maziah Mahusin, in the 400\u00a0m hurdles). Qatar made one of its first female Olympians, Bahiya al-Hamad (shooting), its flagbearer at the 2012 Games, and runner Maryam Yusuf Jamal of Bahrain became the first Persian Gulf female athlete to win a medal when she won a bronze for her showing in the 1500\u00a0m race.\nThe only sports on the Olympic programme that features men and women individually competing against one another are the equestrian disciplines, as there is no \"Women's Eventing\", or \"Men's Dressage\". As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the programme in the 2012 Summer Olympics, however, women athletes were able to compete in all the sports open to men. In the winter Olympics, women are still unable to compete in the Nordic combined. After men were included in artistic swimming at the Paris 2024 games, the only remaining Olympic event in which male athletes may not compete is rhythmic gymnastics. Despite being eligible to qualify for the 2024 Paris games, no men were included on any artistic swimming team.\nA recent addition to the Games has been the inclusion of mixed events, whereby men and women of the same nation compete together against other teams. Beginning in 2018, the sport of curling introduced a mixed event where teams of one man and one women competed in their own tournament for a medal. As of the 2024 Paris games, there are now 13 mixed medal events across 11 disciplines at the summer games.\nWar and terrorism.\nThe world wars caused three Olympiads to pass without a celebration of the Games: the 1916 Games were cancelled because of World War\u00a0I, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War\u00a0II. The Russo-Georgian War between Georgia and Russia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both American President George\u00a0W. Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by the Chinese president Hu Jintao.\nTerrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the Summer Games were held in Munich, Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September in what is now known as the Munich massacre. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after taking them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and five of the terrorists also died. Following the selection of Barcelona, Spain, to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, the separatist ETA terrorist organisation launched attacks in the region, including the 1991 bombing in the Catalonian city of Vic that killed ten people.\nTerrorism affected two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park, killing two people and injuring 111 others. The bomb was set by Eric Rudolph, an American domestic terrorist, who is serving a life sentence for the bombing. The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City took place just five months after the September\u00a011 attacks, which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols relating to 9/11, including the flag that flew at Ground Zero and honour guards of NYPD and FDNY members.\nCitizenship.\nIOC rules for citizenship.\nThe Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a legal national of the country for which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.\nIn October 2023, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee, and the suspension was upheld in February 2024 by CAS. Without any NOC from Russia to approve a change of citizenship in under three years from Russia to another country, the IOC Executive Board approved changes of nationality in November 2023\nand March 2024 for a total of five athletes from Russia to another country, including Georgi Tiblov and Aleksandr Komarov in wrestling (from Russia to Serbia), Mikhail Yakovlev in cycling (from Russia to Israel), Valeriia Liubimova in cycling, and Anastasiia Kirpichnikova in swimming (both from Russia to France).\nReasons for changing citizenship.\nOccasionally, an athlete will become a citizen of a different country to enable them to compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are attracted to sponsorship deals or training facilities in the other country, or the athlete might be unable to qualify from within their country of birth. In preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the Russian Olympic Committee naturalised a South Korean-born short-track speed-skater, Ahn Hyun-soo, and an American-born snowboarder, Vic Wild. The two athletes won five gold medals and one bronze medal between them at the 2014 Games.\nChampions and medallists.\nMedals are awarded to the athletes or teams who place first, second, and third in each event. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, later made of gilded silver, and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal must contain at least six grams of pure gold. The runners-up are awarded silver medals and the third-place athletes receive bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and the losers of both semi-finals each receive a bronze medal.\nAt the 1896 Olympics, only the winner and runner-up of each event received medals\u2014silver for first and bronze for second, with no gold medals awarded. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward, athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which came to be known officially as Olympic diplomas; from 1984, these have also been awarded to the seventh- and eighth-place finishers. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also presented with olive wreaths. The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won on a national level (except for team sports), but the NOCs and the media record medal statistics and use them as a measure of each nation's success.\nNations.\nParticipants.\nAs of the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo, all of the current 207 NOCs (and 19 obsolete NOCs) have participated in at least one edition of the Summer Olympics. Competitors from five nations\u2014Australia, France, Great Britain, Greece, and Switzerland\u2014have competed in all 28 Summer Olympics. Athletes competing under the Olympic flag, Mixed Teams and the Refugee Team have competed at six Summer Olympics Games.\nA total of 119 NOCs (110 of the current 207 NOCs, and nine obsolete NOCs) have participated in at least one edition of the Winter Olympics. Competitors from 12 nations\u2014Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States\u2014have participated in all 23 Winter Games to date.\nHost nations and cities.\nThe host city for an Olympic Games had historically been chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration. Beginning with the 2024 and 2028 Olympics selection process in 2017, the IOC has proceeded to announce the winning bid with a longer lead-in time in order to provide time for the winning cities/regions to prepare. The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.\nOnce the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, before submitting a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.\nBy 2032, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 47 cities in 23 countries. As of 2021, since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92\u00a0years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro were the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded, although Egypt (thrice) and South Africa (in 2004) have tried.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22577", "revid": "29997566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22577", "title": "Old Prussian language", "text": "Extinct Western Baltic language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nOld Prussian is an extinct West Baltic language belonging to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European languages, which was once spoken by the Old Prussians, the Baltic peoples of the Prussian region. The language is called Old Prussian to avoid confusion with the German dialects of Low Prussian and High Prussian and with the adjective \"Prussian\" as it relates to the later German state. Old Prussian began to be written down in the Latin alphabet in about the 13th century, and a small amount of literature in the language survives. In modern times, there has been a revival movement of Old Prussian, and there are families which use Old Prussian as their first language.\nClassification.\nOld Prussian is an Indo-European language belonging to the Baltic branch. It is considered to be a Western Baltic language.\nOld Prussian was closely related to the other extinct West Baltic languages, namely Sudovian, West Galindian and possibly Skalvian and Old Curonian.33 Other linguists consider Western Galindian and Skalvian to be Prussian dialects.\nIt is related to the East Baltic languages such as Lithuanian and Latvian, and more distantly related to Slavic. Compare the words for 'land': Old Prussian \"\" [zem\u0113], , , , () and .\nOld Prussian had loanwords from Slavic languages (e.g., Old Prussian ' [kurtis] 'hound', like Lithuanian ' and Latvian ', cognate with Slavic (compare , ; ; )), as well as a few borrowings from Germanic, including from Gothic (e.g., Old Prussian ' 'awl' as with Lithuanian ', Latvian ') and from Scandinavian languages.\nInfluence on other languages.\nGermanic.\nThe Low German language spoken in Prussia (or West Prussia and East Prussia), called Low Prussian (cf. High Prussian, High German), preserved a number of Baltic Prussian words, such as ', from the Old Prussian ', for \"shoe\" in contrast to common (Standard German \"\"), as did the High Prussian Oberland subdialect.\nUntil the 1938 changing of place names in East Prussia, Old Prussian river- and place-names, such as ' and ', could still be found.137\nPolish.\nOne of the hypotheses regarding the origin of \u2013 a phonological merger of dentialveolar and postalveolar sibilants in many Polish dialects \u2013 states that it originated as a feature of Polonized Old Prussians in Masuria (see Masurian dialects) and spread from there.\nHistory.\nOriginal territory.\nIn addition to Prussia proper, the original territory of the Old Prussians may have included eastern parts of Pomerelia (some parts of the region east of the Vistula River). The language may also have been spoken much further east and south in what became Polesia and part of Podlasie, before conquests by Rus and Poles starting in the 10th century and the German colonisation of the area starting in the 12th century.23324\nDecline.\nWith the conquest of the Old Prussian territory by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century, and the subsequent influx of Polish, Lithuanian and especially German speakers, Old Prussian experienced a 400-year-long decline as an \"oppressed language of an oppressed population\".VII Groups of people from Germany, Poland,115 Lithuania, Scotland, England, and Austria (see Salzburg Protestants) found refuge in Prussia during the Protestant Reformation and thereafter.1 Old Prussian ceased to be spoken probably around the beginning of the 18th century, because many of its remaining speakers died in the famines and the bubonic plague outbreak which harrowed the East Prussian countryside and towns from 1709 until 1711.\nRevitalization.\nIn the 1980s, the linguists Vladimir Toporov and Vytautas Ma\u017eiulis started reconstructing the Prussian language as a scientific project and a humanitarian gesture. Some enthusiasts thereafter began to revive the language based on their reconstruction.\nMost current speakers live in Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Kaliningrad (Russia). Additionally, a few children are native in Revived Prussian.\nToday, there are websites, online dictionaries, learning apps and games for Revived Prussian, and one children's book \u2013 Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's \"The Little Prince\" \u2013 was translated into Revived Prussian by Piotr Szatkowski (P\u012bteris \u0160\u0101tkis) and published by the Prusaspir\u0101 Society in 2015. Moreover, some bands use Revived Prussian, most notably in the Kaliningrad Oblast by the bands Romowe Rikoito, Kellan and \u0100ustras La\u012bwan, as well as in Lithuania by K\u016blgrinda on their 2005 album ('Prussian Hymns'), and Latvia by Rasa Ensemble in 1988 and Valdis Muktup\u0101vels in his 2005 oratorio \"P\u0101rc\u0113l\u0101t\u0101js Pontifex\" featuring several parts sung in Prussian.\nDialects.\nThe Elbing Vocabulary and the Catechisms display systematical differences in phonology, vocabulary and grammar. Some scholars postulate that this is due to them being recordings of different dialects:\nPomesanian and Sambian.\nPhonetical distinctions are: Pom. \"\u0113\" is Samb. \"\u012b\" (' 'world'); Pom. \"\u014d\", Samb. \"\u016b\" after a labial (' 'mother') or Pom. \"\u014d\", Samb. \"\u0101\" (' 'father'; ' 'brother'), which influences the nominative suffixes of feminine \u0101-stems (' 'blood'). The nominative suffixes of the masculine o-stems are weakened to \"-is\" in Pomesanian; in Sambian they are syncopated (' 'god').\nVocabulary differences encompass Pom. ' [zmoy] (cf. Lith. \"\u017emuo)\", Samb. ' 'man'; Pom. ', Samb. ' 'son' and Pom. ', Samb. ' [lauks] 'field'.\nThe neuter gender is more often found in Pomesianan than in Sambian.\nOthers argue that the Catechisms are written in a Yatvingized Prussian. The differences noted above could therefore be explained as being features of a different West Baltic language Yatvingian/Sudovian.\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nThe Prussian language is described to have the following consonants:62\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is said to have existed palatalization (i.e. , ) among nearly all of the consonant sounds except for , and possibly for and .26348 Whether or not the palatalization was phonemic remains unclear.62\nApart from the palatalizations Proto-Baltic consonants were almost completely preserved. The only changes postulated are turning Proto-Baltic into Prussian and subsequently changing Proto-Baltic into .\nVowels.\nThe following description is based on the phonological analysis by Schmalstieg:\nDiphthongs.\nSchmalstieg proposes three native diphthongs:\nGrammar.\nWith other remains being merely word lists, the grammar of Old Prussian is reconstructed chiefly on the basis of the three Catechisms.\nNouns.\nGender.\nOld Prussian preserved the Proto-Baltic neuter. Therefore, it had three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter).40\nNumber.\nMost scholars agree that there are two numbers, singular and plural, in Old Prussian,40353 while some consider remnants of dual number identifiable in the existent corpus.198\nCases.\nThere is no consensus on the number of cases that Old Prussian had, and at least four can be determined with certainty: nominative, genitive, accusative and dative, with different suffixes.35640 Most scholars agree, that there are traces of a vocative case, such as in the phrase \" 'O God the Lord', reflecting the inherited PIE vocative ending ,109 differing from nominative forms in o-stem nouns only.356\nSome scholars find instrumental forms,197 while the traditional view is that no instrumental case existed in Old Prussian.356 There could be some locative forms, e.g. ('in the evening').356\nNoun stems.\nDeclensional classes were \"a\"-stems (also called \"o\"-stems), \"(i)ja\"-stems (also called \"(i)jo\"-stems), \"\u0101\"-stems (feminine), \"\u0113\"-stems (feminine), \"i\"-stems, \"u\"-stems, and consonant-stems. Some also list \"\u012b\"/\"j\u0101\"-stems as a separate stem, while others include \"j\u0101\"-stems into \"\u0101\"-stems and do not mention \"\u012b\"-stems at all.37\nAdjectives.\nThere were three adjective stems (\"a\"-stems, \"i\"-stems, \"u\"-stems), of which only the first agreed with the noun in gender.360\nThere was a comparative and a superlative form.\nVerbal morphology.\nWhen it comes to verbal morphology present, future and past tense are attested, as well as optative forms (used with imperative or permissive forms of verbs), infinitive, and four participles (active/passive present/past).\nOrthography.\nThe orthography varies depending on the author.\nAs the authors of many sources were themselves not proficient in Old Prussian, they wrote the words as they heard them using the orthographical conventions of their mother tongue. \nFor example, the use of \u27e8s\u27e9 for both and is based on German orthography.\nAdditionally, the writers misunderstood some phonemes and, when copying manuscripts, they added further mistakes.63337\nCorpus of Old Prussian.\nOnomastics.\nThere was Prussian toponomy and hydronomy within the territory of (Baltic) Prussia. Georg Gerullis undertook the first basic study of these names in \" ('The Old Prussian Place-names'), written and published with the help of Walter de Gruyter, in 1922.\nAnother source are personal names.\nEvidence from other languages.\nFurther sources for Prussian words are Vernacularisms in the German dialects of East and West Prussia, as well as words of Old Curonian origin in Latvian and West-Baltic vernacularisms in Lithuanian and Belarusian.4\nVocabularies.\nTwo Prussian vocabularies are known. The older one by Simon Grunau (Simon Grunovius), a historian of the Teutonic Knights, encompasses 100 words (in strongly varying versions). He also recorded an expression: ('This (is) our lord, our lord'). The vocabulary is part of the \" written c.\u20091517\u20131526.\nThe second one is the so-called Elbing Vocabulary, which consists of 802 thematically sorted words and their German equivalents. Peter Holcwesscher from Marienburg copied the manuscript around 1400; the original dates from the beginning of the 14th or the end of the 13th century. It was found in 1825 by Fr Neumann among other manuscripts acquired by him from the heritage of the Elbing merchant A. Gr\u00fcbnau; it was thus dubbed the \"\".7-84\nFragmentary texts.\nThere are separate words found in various historical documents.4\nThe following fragments are commonly thought of as Prussian, but are probably actually Lithuanian (at least the adage, however, has been argued to be genuinely West Baltic, only an otherwise unattested dialect):\nFragmentary Lord's Prayer.\nAdditionally, there is one manuscript fragment of the first words of the in Prussian, from the beginning of the 15th century:437\nMaletius' Sudovian Book.\nVytautas Ma\u017eiulis lists another few fragmentary texts recorded in several versions by Hieronymus Maletius in the Sudovian Book in the middle of the 16th century. Palmaitis regards them as Sudovian proper.7; 437\nComplete texts.\nIn addition to the texts listed beneath, there are several colophons written by Prussian scriptors who worked in Prague and in the court of Lithuanian duke Butautas K\u0119stutaitis.\nBasel Epigram.\nThe so-called Basel Epigram is the oldest written Prussian sentence (1369). It reads: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nThis jocular inscription was most probably made by a Prussian student studying in Prague (Charles University); found by Stephen McCluskey (1974) in manuscript MS F.V.2 (book of physics \"\" by Nicholas Oresme), fol. 63r, stored in the Basel University library.\nCatechisms.\nThe longest texts preserved in Old Prussian are three Catechisms printed in . The first two, both from 1545, consist of only six pages of text in Old Prussian \u2013 the second one being a correction of the first. The third catechism, from 1561, or \"Enchiridion\", consists of 132 pages of text, and is a translation of Luther's Small Catechism by a German cleric called Abel Will, with his Prussian assistant Paul Megott. Will himself knew little or no Old Prussian, and his Prussian interpreter was probably illiterate, but according to Will spoke Old Prussian quite well. The text itself is mainly a word-for-word translation, and Will phonetically recorded Megott's oral translation. Because of this, the \"Enchiridion\" exhibits many irregularities, such as the lack of case agreement in phrases involving an article and a noun, which followed word-for-word German originals as opposed to native Old Prussian syntax.XXVII\nTrace of Crete.\nThe \"Trace of Crete\" is a short poem added by a Baltic writer in Chania to a manuscript of the \" Logica Parva\" by Paul of Venice.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nSample texts.\nLord's Prayer in Old Prussian (from the so-called \"1st Catechism\")4\nLord's Prayer after Simon Grunau (Curonian)XV\nLord's Prayer after Pr\u00e4torius (Curonian)703\nLord's Prayer in Lithuanian dialect of Insterburg (Prediger Hennig)707\nLord's Prayer in Lithuanian dialect of Nadruvia, corrupted (Simon Praetorius)708\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The foundation originally specified and maintained the OSGi standard. The alliance transferred its work to the Eclipse Foundation at the end of 2020.\nThe OSGi specification describes a modular system and a service platform for the Java programming language that implements a complete and dynamic component model, something that does not exist in standalone Java or VM environments. It has a service-oriented architecture based on micro services each implemented as an extended Java class file archive (JAR (file format)).\nDescription.\nOSGi is built around a service-oriented architecture. Applications or components, come in the form of bundles for deployment, can be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled without requiring a reboot. Management of Java packages/classes is specified in great detail. Application life cycle management is implemented via APIs that enable remote downloading of management policies. The service registry enables bundles to detect the addition of new services or the removal of services, and adapt accordingly.\nThe OSGi specifications have evolved beyond the original focus of service gateways, and are now used in applications ranging from mobile phones to the open-source Eclipse IDE. Other application areas include automobiles, industrial automation, building automation, PDAs, grid computing, entertainment, fleet management and application servers.\nIn October 2020, the OSGi Alliance announced the transition of the standardization effort to the Eclipse Foundation, subsequent to which it would shut down. All artifacts have been transferred to the Eclipse Foundation, where an \u201cOSGi Working Group\" continues to maintain and evolve the specification.\nSpecification process.\nThe OSGi specification is developed by the members in an open process and made available to the public free of charge under the OSGi Specification License. The OSGi Alliance has a compliance program that is open to members only. As of November 2010, there are seven certified OSGi framework implementations. A separate page lists both certified and non-certified OSGi Specification Implementations, which include OSGi frameworks and other OSGi specifications.\nArchitecture.\nOSGi is a Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries. Each bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any).\nThe framework is conceptually divided into the following areas:\n*CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0\n*CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1\n*OSGi/Minimum-1.0\n*OSGi/Minimum-1.1\n*JRE-1.1\n*From J2SE-1.2 up to J2SE-1.6\nBundles.\nA bundle is a group of Java classes and additional resources equipped with a detailed manifest codice_1 file on all its contents, as well as additional services needed to give the included group of Java classes more sophisticated behaviors, to the extent of deeming the entire aggregate a component.\nBelow is an example of a typical codice_1 file with OSGi Headers:\n Bundle-Name: Hello World\n Bundle-SymbolicName: org.wikipedia.helloworld\n Bundle-Description: A Hello World bundle\n Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2\n Bundle-Version: 1.0.0\n Bundle-Activator: org.wikipedia.Activator\n Export-Package: org.wikipedia.helloworld;version=\"1.0.0\"\n Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version=\"1.3.0\"\nThe meaning of the contents in the example is as follows:\nLife-cycle.\nA Life Cycle layer adds bundles that can be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated and uninstalled. Bundles rely on the module layer for class loading but add an API to manage the modules in run time. The life cycle layer introduces dynamics that are normally not part of an application. Extensive dependency mechanisms are used to assure the correct operation of the environment. Life cycle operations are fully protected with the security architecture.\nBelow is an example of a typical Java class implementing the codice_3 interface:\npackage org.wikipedia;\nimport org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator;\nimport org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;\npublic class Activator implements BundleActivator {\n private BundleContext context;\n @Override\n public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {\n System.out.println(\"Starting: Hello World\");\n this.context = context;\n @Override\n public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {\n System.out.println(\"Stopping: Goodbye Cruel World\");\n this.context = null;\nServices.\nStandard services.\nThe OSGi Alliance has specified many services. Services are specified by a Java interface. Bundles can implement this interface and register the service with the Service Registry. Clients of the service can find it in the registry, or react to it when it appears or disappears.\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi System Services:\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi Protocol Services:\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi Miscellaneous Services:\nOrganization.\nThe OSGi Alliance was founded by Ericsson, IBM, Motorola, Sun Microsystems and others in March 1999. Before incorporating as a nonprofit corporation, it was called the Connected Alliance.\nAmong its members are (as of February 2015[ [update]]) more than 35 companies from quite different business areas, for example Adobe Systems, Deutsche Telekom, Hitachi, IBM, Liferay, Makewave, NEC, NTT, Oracle, Orange SA, ProSyst, Salesforce, Siemens, Software AG and TIBCO Software.\nThe Alliance has a board of directors that provides the organization's overall governance. OSGi officers have various roles and responsibilities in supporting the alliance. Technical work is conducted within Expert Groups (EGs) chartered by the board of directors, and non-technical work is conducted in various working groups and committees. The technical work conducted within Expert Groups include developing specifications, reference implementations, and compliance tests. These Expert Groups have produced five major releases of the OSGi specifications (As of 2012[ [update]]).\nDedicated Expert Groups exist for the enterprise, mobile, vehicle and the core platform areas.\nThe Enterprise Expert Group (EEG) is the newest EG and is addressing Enterprise / Server-side applications.\nIn November 2007 the Residential Expert Group (REG) started to work on specifications to remotely manage residential/home-gateways.\nIn October 2003, Nokia, Motorola, IBM, ProSyst and other OSGi members formed a Mobile Expert Group (MEG) that will specify a MIDP-based service platform for the next generation of smart mobile phones, addressing some of the needs that CLDC cannot manage \u2013 other than CDC. MEG became part of OSGi as with R4.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22581", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22581", "title": "Estrogen", "text": "Primary female sex hormone\nEstrogen (also spelled oestrogen in British English; see spelling differences) is a category of sex hormone responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. There are three major endogenous estrogens that have estrogenic hormonal activity: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Estradiol, an estrane, is the most potent and prevalent. Another estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy.\nEstrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates and some insects. Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women. While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males than in females, estrogens nevertheless have important physiological roles in males.\nLike all steroid hormones, estrogens readily diffuse across the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs) which in turn modulate the expression of many genes. Additionally, estrogens bind to and activate rapid-signaling membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30).\nIn addition to their role as natural hormones, estrogens are used as medications, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy, hormonal birth control and feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women, intersex people, and nonbinary people.\nSynthetic and natural estrogens have been found in the environment and are referred to as xenoestrogens. Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds and can cause health issues and reproductive dysfunction in both wildlife and humans.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTypes and examples.\nThe four major naturally occurring estrogens in women are estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4). Estradiol (E2) is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During menopause, estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the menarche and menopause stages of life. However, during pregnancy this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from androgens, specifically testosterone and androstenedione, by the enzyme aromatase.\nMinor endogenous estrogens, the biosyntheses of which do not involve aromatase, include 27-hydroxycholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 7-oxo-DHEA, 7\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA, 16\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA, 7\u03b2-hydroxyepiandrosterone, androstenedione (A4), androstenediol (A5), 3\u03b1-androstanediol, and 3\u03b2-androstanediol. Some estrogen metabolites, such as the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone, as well as 16\u03b1-hydroxyestrone, are also estrogens with varying degrees of activity. The biological importance of these minor estrogens is not entirely clear.\nBiological function.\nThe actions of estrogen are mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER), a dimeric nuclear protein that binds to DNA and controls gene expression. Like other steroid hormones, estrogen enters passively into the cell where it binds to and activates the estrogen receptor. The estrogen:ER complex binds to specific DNA sequences called a hormone response element to activate the transcription of target genes (in a study using an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line as model, 89 such genes were identified). Since estrogen enters all cells, its actions are dependent on the presence of the ER in the cell. The ER is expressed in specific tissues including the ovary, uterus and breast. The metabolic effects of estrogen in postmenopausal women have been linked to the genetic polymorphism of the ER.\nWhile estrogens are present in both men and women, they are usually present at significantly higher levels in biological females of reproductive age. They promote the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, darkening and enlargement of nipples, and thickening of the endometrium and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle. In males, estrogen regulates certain functions of the reproductive system important to the maturation of sperm&lt;ref name=\"titleScience News Online (12/6/97): Estrogens Emerging Manly Alter Ego\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and may be necessary for a healthy libido.\nFemale pubertal development.\nEstrogens are responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics during puberty, including breast development, widening of the hips, and female fat distribution. Conversely, androgens are responsible for pubic and body hair growth, as well as acne and axillary odor.\nBreast development.\nEstrogen, in conjunction with growth hormone (GH) and its secretory product insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), is critical in mediating breast development during puberty, as well as breast maturation during pregnancy in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. Estrogen is primarily and directly responsible for inducing the ductal component of breast development, as well as for causing fat deposition and connective tissue growth. It is also indirectly involved in the lobuloalveolar component, by increasing progesterone receptor expression in the breasts and by inducing the secretion of prolactin. Allowed for by estrogen, progesterone and prolactin work together to complete lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy.\nAndrogens such as testosterone powerfully oppose estrogen action in the breasts, such as by reducing estrogen receptor expression in them.\nFemale reproductive system.\nEstrogens are responsible for maturation and maintenance of the vagina and uterus, and are also involved in ovarian function, such as maturation of ovarian follicles. In addition, estrogens play an important role in regulation of gonadotropin secretion. For these reasons, estrogens are required for female fertility.\nNeuroprotection and DNA repair.\nEstrogen regulated DNA repair mechanisms in the brain have neuroprotective effects. Estrogen regulates the transcription of DNA base excision repair genes as well as the translocation of the base excision repair enzymes between different subcellular compartments.\nBrain and behavior.\nSex drive.\nEstrogens are involved in libido (sex drive) in both women and men.\nCognition.\nVerbal memory scores are frequently used as one measure of higher level cognition. These scores vary in direct proportion to estrogen levels throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Furthermore, estrogens when administered shortly after natural or surgical menopause prevents decreases in verbal memory. In contrast, estrogens have little effect on verbal memory if first administered years after menopause. Estrogens also have positive influences on other measures of cognitive function. However the effect of estrogens on cognition is not uniformly favorable and is dependent on the timing of the dose and the type of cognitive skill being measured.\nThe protective effects of estrogens on cognition may be mediated by estrogen's anti-inflammatory effects in the brain. Studies have also shown that the Met allele gene and level of estrogen mediates the efficiency of prefrontal cortex dependent working memory tasks. Researchers have urged for further research to illuminate the role of estrogen and its potential for improvement on cognitive function.\nMental health.\nEstrogen is considered to play a significant role in women's mental health. Sudden estrogen withdrawal, fluctuating estrogen, and periods of sustained low estrogen levels correlate with a significant lowering of mood. Clinical recovery from postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause depression has been shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored. Menstrual exacerbation (including menstrual psychosis) is typically triggered by low estrogen levels, and is often mistaken for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.\nCompulsions in male lab mice, such as those in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme aromatase in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. Hypothalamic protein levels in the gene COMT are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which are believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to normal activity. Aromatase deficiency is ultimately suspected which is involved in the synthesis of estrogen in humans and has therapeutic implications in humans having obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nLocal application of estrogen in the rat hippocampus has been shown to inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin. Contrarily, local application of estrogen has been shown to block the ability of fluvoxamine to slow serotonin clearance, suggesting that the same pathways which are involved in SSRI efficacy may also be affected by components of local estrogen signaling pathways.\nParenthood.\nStudies have also found that fathers had lower levels of cortisol and testosterone but higher levels of estrogen (estradiol) than did non-fathers.\nBinge eating.\nEstrogen may play a role in suppressing binge eating. Hormone replacement therapy using estrogen may be a possible treatment for binge eating behaviors in females. Estrogen replacement has been shown to suppress binge eating behaviors in female mice. The mechanism by which estrogen replacement inhibits binge-like eating involves the replacement of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Women exhibiting binge eating behaviors are found to have increased brain uptake of neuron 5-HT, and therefore less of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the cerebrospinal fluid. Estrogen works to activate 5-HT neurons, leading to suppression of binge like eating behaviors.\nIt is also suggested that there is an interaction between hormone levels and eating at different points in the female menstrual cycle. Research has predicted increased emotional eating during hormonal flux, which is characterized by high progesterone and estradiol levels that occur during the mid-luteal phase. It is hypothesized that these changes occur due to brain changes across the menstrual cycle that are likely a genomic effect of hormones. These effects produce menstrual cycle changes, which result in hormone release leading to behavioral changes, notably binge and emotional eating. These occur especially prominently among women who are genetically vulnerable to binge eating phenotypes.\nBinge eating is associated with decreased estradiol and increased progesterone. Klump et al. Progesterone may moderate the effects of low estradiol (such as during dysregulated eating behavior), but that this may only be true in women who have had clinically diagnosed binge episodes (BEs). Dysregulated eating is more strongly associated with such ovarian hormones in women with BEs than in women without BEs.\nThe implantation of 17\u03b2-estradiol pellets in ovariectomized mice significantly reduced binge eating behaviors and injections of GLP-1 in ovariectomized mice decreased binge-eating behaviors.\nThe associations between binge eating, menstrual-cycle phase and ovarian hormones correlated.\nMasculinization in rodents.\nIn rodents, estrogens (which are locally aromatized from androgens in the brain) play an important role in psychosexual differentiation, for example, by masculinizing territorial behavior; the same is not true in humans. In humans, the masculinizing effects of prenatal androgens on behavior (and other tissues, with the possible exception of effects on bone) appear to act exclusively through the androgen receptor. Consequently, the utility of rodent models for studying human psychosexual differentiation has been questioned.\nSkeletal system.\nEstrogens are responsible for both the pubertal growth spurt, which causes an acceleration in linear growth, and epiphyseal closure, which limits height and limb length, in both females and males. In addition, estrogens are responsible for bone maturation and maintenance of bone mineral density throughout life. Due to hypoestrogenism, the risk of osteoporosis increases during menopause.\nCardiovascular system.\nWomen are less impacted by heart disease due to vasculo-protective action of estrogen which helps in preventing atherosclerosis. It also helps in maintaining the delicate balance between fighting infections and protecting arteries from damage thus lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. During pregnancy, high levels of estrogens increase coagulation and the risk of venous thromboembolism. Estrogen has been shown to upregulate the peptide hormone adropin.\nImmune system.\nThe effect of estrogen on the immune system is in general described as Th2 favoring, rather than suppressive, as is the case of the effect of male sex hormone \u2013 testosterone. Indeed, women respond better to vaccines, infections and are generally less likely to develop cancer, the tradeoff of this is that they are more likely to develop an autoimmune disease. The Th2 shift manifests itself in a decrease of cellular immunity and increase in humoral immunity (antibody production) shifts it from cellular to humoral by downregulating cell-mediated immunity and enhancing Th2 immune response by stimulating IL-4 production and Th2 differentiation. Type 1 and type 17 immune responses are downregulated, likely to be at least partially due to IL-4, which inhibits Th1. Effect of estrogen on different immune cells' cell types is in line with its Th2 bias. Activity of basophils, eosinophils, M2 macrophages and is enhanced, whereas activity of NK cells is downregulated. Conventional dendritic cells are biased towards Th2 under the influence of estrogen, whereas plasmacytoid dendritic cells, key players in antiviral defence, have increased IFN-g secretion. Estrogen also influences B cells by increasing their survival, proliferation, differentiation and function, which corresponds with higher antibody and B cell count generally detected in women.\nOn a molecular level estrogen induces the above-mentioned effects on cell via acting on intracellular receptors termed ER \u03b1 and ER \u03b2, which upon ligation form either homo or heterodimers. The genetic and nongenetic targets of the receptors differ between homo and heterodimers. Ligation of these receptors allows them to translocate to the nucleus and act as transcription factors either by binding estrogen response elements (ERE) on DNA or binding DNA together with other transcriptional factors e.g. Nf-kB or AP-1, both of which result in RNA polymerase recruitment and further chromatin remodelation. A non-transcriptional response to oestrogen stimulation was also documented (termed membrane-initiated steroid signalling, MISS). This pathway stimulates the ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are known to increase cellular proliferation and affect chromatin remodelation.\nAssociated conditions.\nResearchers have implicated estrogens in various estrogen-dependent conditions, such as ER-positive breast cancer, as well as a number of genetic conditions involving estrogen signaling or metabolism, such as estrogen insensitivity syndrome, aromatase deficiency, and aromatase excess syndrome.\nHigh estrogen can amplify stress-hormone responses in stressful situations.\nBiochemistry.\nBiosynthesis.\nEstrogens, in females, are produced primarily by the ovaries, and during pregnancy, the placenta. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the ovarian production of estrogens by the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles and corpora lutea. Some estrogens are also produced in smaller amounts by other tissues such as the liver, pancreas, bone, adrenal glands, skin, brain, adipose tissue, and the breasts. These secondary sources of estrogens are especially important in postmenopausal women.\nThe pathway of estrogen biosynthesis in extragonadal tissues is different. These tissues are not able to synthesize C19 steroids, and therefore depend on C19 supplies from other tissues and the level of aromatase.\nIn females, synthesis of estrogens starts in theca interna cells in the ovary, by the synthesis of androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17\u03b1-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17\u03b2-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential for the production of estrogen in the ovaries.\nEstrogen levels vary through the menstrual cycle, with levels highest near the end of the follicular phase just before ovulation.\nNote that in males, estrogen is also produced by the Sertoli cells when FSH binds to their FSH receptors.\nDistribution.\nEstrogens are plasma protein bound to albumin and/or sex hormone-binding globulin in the circulation.\nMetabolism.\nEstrogens are metabolized via hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and via conjugation by estrogen sulfotransferases (sulfation) and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (glucuronidation). In addition, estradiol is dehydrogenated by 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into the much less potent estrogen estrone. These reactions occur primarily in the liver, but also in other tissues.\nExcretion.\nEstrogens are inactivated primarily by the kidneys and liver and excreted via the gastrointestinal tract in the form of conjugates, found in feces, bile, and urine.\nMedical use.\nEstrogens are used as medications, mainly in hormonal contraception, hormone replacement therapy, and to treat gender dysphoria in transgender women and other transfeminine individuals as part of feminizing hormone therapy.\nChemistry.\nThe estrogen steroid hormones are estrane steroids.\nHistory.\nIn 1929, Adolf Butenandt and Edward Adelbert Doisy independently isolated and purified estrone, the first estrogen to be discovered. Then, estriol and estradiol were discovered in 1930 and 1933, respectively. Shortly following their discovery, estrogens, both natural and synthetic, were introduced for medical use. Examples include estriol glucuronide (Emmenin, Progynon), estradiol benzoate, conjugated estrogens (Premarin), diethylstilbestrol, and ethinylestradiol.\nThe word estrogen derives from Ancient Greek. It is derived from \"oestros\" (a periodic state of sexual activity in female mammals), and genos (generating). It was first published in the early 1920s and referenced as \"oestrin\". With the years, American English adapted the spelling of estrogen to fit with its phonetic pronunciation.\nSociety and culture.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"estrogen\" is derived from the Greek (), literally meaning \"verve\" or \"inspiration\" but figuratively sexual passion or desire, and the suffix \"-gen\", meaning \"producer of\".\nEnvironment.\nA range of synthetic and natural substances that possess estrogenic activity have been identified in the environment and are referred to xenoestrogens.\nEstrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds because they have high estrogenic potency. When an endocrine-disrupting compound makes its way into the environment, it may cause male reproductive dysfunction to wildlife and humans. The estrogen excreted from farm animals makes its way into fresh water systems. During the germination period of reproduction the fish are exposed to low levels of estrogen which may cause reproductive dysfunction to male fish.\nCosmetics.\nSome hair shampoos on the market include estrogens and placental extracts; others contain phytoestrogens. In 1998, there were case reports of four prepubescent African-American girls developing breasts after exposure to these shampoos. In 1993, the FDA determined that not all over-the-counter topically applied hormone-containing drug products for human use are generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded. An accompanying proposed rule deals with cosmetics, concluding that any use of natural estrogens in a cosmetic product makes the product an unapproved new drug and that any cosmetic using the term \"hormone\" in the text of its labeling or in its ingredient statement makes an implied drug claim, subjecting such a product to regulatory action.\nIn addition to being considered misbranded drugs, products claiming to contain placental extract may also be deemed to be misbranded cosmetics if the extract has been prepared from placentas from which the hormones and other biologically active substances have been removed and the extracted substance consists principally of protein. The FDA recommends that this substance be identified by a name other than \"placental extract\" and describing its composition more accurately because consumers associate the name \"placental extract\" with a therapeutic use of some biological activity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally to be called MPC-8 (MIDI Percussion Controller 8), but was renamed Pad-8 to avoid legal implications with MPC Electronics. It was an influential device at that time, allowing drummers and percussionists the opportunity to trigger virtually any MIDI sound source without the need of a full electronic drum set. \nFeatures.\nThe Pad 8 Consists of eight individual pads (divided in two rows of four pads) and six external pad trigger ports. The controlled had no internal sound source and limited memory for four user patches. A unique initialization procedure, when powered on, would load a \"patch preset\" and configure the Pad-8 to work with either the Roland's TR-909 or TR-707/TR-727. \nThe Pad 8 could only transmit on a single MIDI channel (channel 10 on power up), however each of the 14 pads is assigned a different MIDI-Note number. Both MIDI channel and note numbers could be edited to suite the device being controlled over MIDI.\nThere is one parameter adjustable for each pad: MIDI Note. The remaining five parameters adjustable are global: MIDI Channel; Pad Sensitivity; Volume Curve; Minimum Velocity; and the Gate Time.\nNotable Users/Endorsers.\nSources:\nRoland Pad-80.\nThe second model, introduced in 1989, was the Pad-80 Octapad II. Again the Pad-80 was an eight pad MIDI controller that allowed for various types of MIDI sound sources. Improvements in this second model included the ability to play up to three notes per pad, and velocity switching, which allowed the user to stack or alternate between the assigned notes depending on how hard the pads were struck. This feature became useful for creating more realistic sounding drum parts, and in addition allowed drummers to play melodic instruments with greater ease. These new features were groundbreaking at the time, and are still utilized in Roland's electronic percussion today.\nThe memory was increased, allowing up to 64 different patches internally and another 64 patches to be stored on a Roland M-256E memory card. Further improvements to the MIDI specification included the control of modulation, pitch bend and aftertouch using a foot pedal, along with full System Exclusive (SysEx) capability. The Pad-80 had a patch chain function that allowed a series of 32 patches to be arranged in any sequence, eight of these chains could be stored in memory.\nRoland SPD-8 (1990), SPD-11 (1993), and SPD-20 (1998).\nAfter the Pad-80, Roland continued to release SPD-8 with on-board sounds, as a standalone instrument in 1990, SPD-11 in 1993, which not only had more sounds but also built-in effects processing, and SPD-20 in 1998, which had more on-board sounds.

He is best known for his two-volume work \"The Decline of the West\" (\"Der Untergang des Abendlandes\"), published in 1918 and 1922, covering human history. Spengler's model of history postulates that human cultures and civilizations are akin to biological entities, each with a limited, predictable, and deterministic lifespan. He predicted that Western civilization would enter the period of pre\u2011death emergency about the year 2000, which would lead to 200 years of Caesarism (extra-constitutional omnipotence of the executive branch of government) before Western civilization's final collapse.\nSpengler is regarded as a German nationalist and a critic of republicanism, and he was a prominent member of the Weimar-era Conservative Revolution. While the Nazis had viewed his writings as a means to provide a \"respectable pedigree\" to their ideology, Spengler later criticized Nazism for what he considered to be excessive racialist and antisemitic elements. He saw Benito Mussolini and entrepreneurial types, such as the mining magnate Cecil Rhodes, as examples of the impending Caesars of Western culture\u2014later showcasing his disappointment in Mussolini's colonialist adventures.\nBiography.\nEarly life and family.\nOswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler was born on 29 May 1880 in Blankenburg, Duchy of Brunswick, German Empire, the oldest surviving child of Bernhard Spengler (1844\u20131901) and Pauline Spengler (1840\u20131910), n\u00e9e Grantzow, the descendant of an artistic family. His elder brother was born prematurely in 1879, when his mother tried to move a heavy laundry basket, and died at the age of three weeks. Spengler was born ten months after his brother's death. His younger sisters were Adele (1881\u20131917), Gertrud (1882\u20131957), and Hildegard (1885\u20131942). His paternal grandfather, Theodor Spengler\u00a0(1806\u20131876), was a metallurgical inspector (\"H\u00fctteninspektor\") in Altenbrak.\nSpengler's maternal great-grandfather, Friedrich Wilhelm Grantzow, a tailor's apprentice in Berlin, had three children out of wedlock with a Jewish woman named Br\u00e4unchen Moses (c. 1769\u20131849) whom he later married, on 26 May 1799. Shortly before the wedding, Moses was baptized as Johanna Elisabeth Anspachin; the surname was chosen after her birthplace\u2014Anspach. Her parents, Abraham and Reile Moses, were both deceased by then. The couple had another five children, one of whom was Spengler's maternal grandfather, Gustav Adolf Grantzow (1811\u20131883)\u2014a solo dancer and ballet master in Berlin, who in 1837 married Katharina Kirchner (1813\u20131873), a solo dancer from a Munich Catholic family; the second of their four daughters was Spengler's mother. Like the Grantzows in general, Spengler's mother was of a Bohemian disposition; before marrying Spengler's father, she accompanied her dancer sisters on tours. In appearance, she was plump. Her temperament, which Spengler inherited, was moody, irritable, and morose.\nEducation.\nWhen Spengler was ten years of age, his family moved to the university city of Halle. He received a classical education at the local Gymnasium (academically oriented secondary school), studying Greek, Latin, mathematics, and sciences. He developed his propensity for the arts\u2014especially poetry, drama, and music\u2014and came under the influence of the ideas of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Nietzsche. At 17, he wrote a drama titled \"Montezuma\".\nAfter his father's death in 1901, Spengler attended several universities (Munich, Berlin, and Halle) as a private scholar, taking courses in a wide range of subjects. His studies were undirected. In 1903, he failed his doctoral thesis on Heraclitus\u2014titled \"Der metaphysische Grundgedanke der heraklitischen Philosophie\" (\"The Fundamental Metaphysical Thought of the Heraclitean Philosophy\") and conducted under the direction of Alois Riehl\u2014because of insufficient references. He took the doctoral oral exam again and received his PhD from Halle on 6 April 1904. In December 1904, he began to write the secondary dissertation (\"Staatsexamensarbeit\") necessary to qualify as a high school teacher. This became \"The Development of the Organ of Sight in the Higher Realms of the Animal Kingdom\" (\"Die Entwicklung des Sehorgans bei den Hauptstufen des Tierreiches\"), a text now lost. It was approved and he received his teaching certificate. In 1905, Spengler suffered a nervous breakdown.\nCareer.\nSpengler briefly served as a teacher in Saarbr\u00fccken then in D\u00fcsseldorf. From 1908 to 1911, he worked at a grammar school (\"Realgymnasium\") in Hamburg, where he taught science, German history, and mathematics. Biographers report that his life as a teacher was uneventful.\nIn 1911, following his mother's death, Spengler moved to Munich, where he lived for the rest of his life. While there, he was a cloistered scholar, supported by his modest inheritance. Spengler survived on very limited means and was marked by loneliness. He owned no books, and took work as a tutor and wrote for magazines to earn additional income. Due to a severe heart problem, Spengler was exempted from military service. During the war, his inheritance was useless because it was invested overseas; thus, he lived in genuine poverty for this period.\nSpengler began work on the first volume of \"The Decline of the West\" intending to focus on Germany within Europe; however, the Agadir Crisis of 1911 affected him deeply, so he widened the scope of his study. According to Spengler the book was completed in 1914, but the first edition was published in the summer of 1918, shortly before the end of World War I. Spengler wrote about the years immediately prior to World War I in \"Decline\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At that time the World-War appeared to me both as imminent and also as the inevitable outward manifestation of the historical crisis, and my endeavor was to comprehend it from an examination of the spirit of the preceding centuries\u2014not years. ... Thereafter I saw the present\u2014the approaching World-War\u2014in a quite other light. It was no longer a momentary constellation of casual facts due to national sentiments, personal influences, or economic tendencies endowed with an appearance of unity and necessity by some historian's scheme of political or social cause-and-effect, but the type of \"historical change of phase\" occurring within a great historical organism of definable compass at the point preordained for it hundreds of years ago.\nWhen the first volume of \"The Decline of the West\" was published, it was a wild success. Spengler became an instant celebrity. The national humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), followed by economic depression in 1923 and hyperinflation, seemed to prove Spengler right. \"Decline\" comforted Germans because it could be used as a rationale for their diminished pre-eminence, i.e. due to larger world-historical processes. The book met with wide success outside of Germany as well, and by 1919 had been translated into several other languages.\nThe second volume of \"Decline\" was published in 1922. In it, Spengler argued that German socialism differed from Marxism; instead, he said it was more compatible with traditional German conservatism. Spengler declined an appointment as Professor of Philosophy at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, saying he needed time to focus on writing.\nThe book was widely discussed, even by those who had not read it. Historians took umbrage at his unapologetically non-scientific approach. Novelist Thomas Mann compared reading Spengler's book to reading Arthur Schopenhauer's works for the first time. Academics gave it a mixed reception. Sociologist Max Weber described Spengler as a \"very ingenious and learned dilettante\", while philosopher Karl Popper called the thesis \"pointless\". The first volume of \"Decline\" was published in English by Alfred A. Knopf in 1926, the second in 1928.\nAftermath.\nIn 1924, following the social-economic upheaval and hyperinflation, Spengler entered politics in an effort to bring Reichswehr General Hans von Seeckt to power as the country's leader. The attempt failed and Spengler proved ineffective in practical politics. A 1928 \"Time\" review of the second volume of \"Decline\" described the immense influence and controversy Spengler's ideas enjoyed during the 1920s: \"When the first volume of \"The Decline of the West\" appeared in Germany a few years ago, thousands of copies were sold. Cultivated European discourse quickly became Spengler-saturated. Spenglerism spurted from the pens of countless disciples. It was imperative to read Spengler, to sympathize or revolt. It still remains so\".\nIn 1931, Spengler published \"Man and Technics\", which warned against the dangers of technology and industrialism to culture. He especially pointed to the tendency of Western technology to spread to hostile \"Colored races\" which would then use the weapons against the West. It was poorly received because of its anti-industrialism. This book contains the well-known Spengler quote \"Optimism is cowardice\".\nDespite voting for Adolf Hitler over Hindenburg in 1932, Spengler found the F\u00fchrer vulgar. He met Hitler in 1933 and after a lengthy discussion remained unimpressed, saying that Germany did not need \"a heroic tenor but a real hero\". He quarreled publicly with Alfred Rosenberg, and his pessimism and remarks about the F\u00fchrer resulted in isolation and public silence. He further rejected offers from Joseph Goebbels to give public speeches; however, Spengler became a member of the German Academy that year.\n\"The Hour of Decision\", published in 1933, was a bestseller, but was later banned for its critique of Nazism. While the Nazis welcomed Spengler's criticisms of liberalism, he disagreed with their biological ideology and antisemitism. Although racial mysticism played a key role in his own worldview, Spengler had always been an outspoken critic of the racial theories professed by the Nazis and many others in his time, and was not inclined to change his views during and after Hitler's rise to power. Spengler was a German nationalist who viewed the Nazis as too narrowly German, and not Western enough to lead the fight against other peoples. The book also warned of a coming world war in which Western civilization risked being destroyed, and was widely distributed abroad before eventually being banned by the Nazi Party. A \"Time\" review of \"The Hour of Decision\" noted Spengler's international popularity as a polemicist, observing, \"When Oswald Spengler speaks, many a Western Worldling stops to listen\", and recommended the book for \"readers who enjoy vigorous writing\", who \"will be glad to be rubbed the wrong way by Spengler's harsh aphorisms\" and his pessimistic predictions.\nLater life and death.\nOn 13 October 1933, Spengler became one of the hundred senators of the German Academy. Spengler spent his final years in Munich, listening to Beethoven, reading Moli\u00e8re and Shakespeare, buying several thousand books, and collecting ancient Turkish, Persian and Indian weapons. He made occasional trips to the Harz mountains and to Italy. Spengler died of a heart attack on 8 May 1936, in Munich, at age 55. He was buried in the Nordfriedhof in Munich.\nViews.\nInfluences.\nIn the introduction to \"The Decline of the West\", Spengler cites Johann W. von Goethe and Friedrich Nietzsche as his major influences. Goethe's vitalism and Nietzsche's cultural criticism in particular are highlighted in his works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I feel urged to name once more those to whom I owe practically everything: Goethe and Nietzsche. Goethe gave me method, Nietzsche the questioning faculty\u2026 Spengler was also influenced by the universal and cyclical vision of world history proposed by the German historian Eduard Meyer. The belief in the progression of civilizations through an evolutionary process comparable with living beings can be traced back to classical antiquity, although it is difficult to assess the extent of the influence those thinkers had on Spengler: Cato the Elder, Cicero, Seneca the Younger, Florus, Ammianus Marcellinus, and later Francis Bacon, who compared different empires with each other with the help of biological analogies.\n\"The Decline of the West\" (1918).\nThe concept of historical philosophy developed by Spengler is founded upon two assumptions: \nSpengler enumerates nine Cultures: Ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Greco-Roman or \"Apollonian\", \"Magian\" (including Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and early Byzantine Christianity and Islam), Mexican, Western or \"Faustian\", and Russian. They interacted with each other in time and space but were distinctive due to 'internal' attributes. According to Spengler, \"Cultures are organisms, and world-history is their collective biography.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;'Mankind'\u2026 has no aim, no idea, no plan, any more than the family of butterflies or orchids. 'Mankind' is a zoological expression, or an empty word. \u2026 I see, in place of that empty figment of one linear history which can only be kept up by shutting one\u2019s eyes to the overwhelming multitude of the facts, the drama of a number of mighty Cultures, each springing with primitive strength from the soil of a mother region to which it remains firmly bound throughout its whole life-cycle; each stamping its material, its mankind, in its own image; each having its own idea, its own passions, its own life, will and feeling, its own death.\nSpengler compares the evolution of cultures to the different ages of human life by stating, \"Every Culture passes through the age-phases of the individual man. Each has its childhood, youth, manhood and old age\", and argues that when a Culture enters its late stage,it becomes a civilization (\"Zivilisation\"), a petrified body characterized in the modern age by technology, imperialism, and mass society, which he expected to fossilize and decline from the 2000s onward. The first-millennium Near East was in his view not a transition between Classical Antiquity, Western Christianity, and Islam, but rather an emerging new Culture he named \"Magian (Zoroastrian priest)\", explaining messianic Judaism, early Christianity, Gnosticism, Mandaeism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam as different expressions of a single Culture sharing a unique worldview.\nThe great historian of antiquity Eduard Meyer thought highly of Spengler, although he also had some criticisms of him. Spengler's obscurity, intuitiveness, and mysticism were easy targets, especially for the positivists and neo-Kantians who rejected the possibility that there was meaning in world history. The critic and aesthete Count Harry Kessler thought him unoriginal and rather inane, especially in regard to his opinion on Friedrich Nietzsche. Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, shared Spengler's cultural pessimism. Spengler's work became an important foundation for social cycle theory.\n\"Prussianism and Socialism\" (1919).\nNazism and Fascism.\nSpengler was an important influence on Nazi ideology. He \"provided skeletal Nazi ideas\" to the early Nazi movement \"and gave them a respectable pedigree\". Key parts of his writings were incorporated into Nazi Party ideology. Spengler's criticism of the Nazi Party was taken seriously by Hitler, and Carl Deher credited him for inspiring Hitler to carry out the Night of the Long Knives in which Ernst R\u00f6hm and other leaders of the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) were executed. In 1934, Spengler pronounced the funeral oration for one of the victims of the Night of the Long Knives and retired in 1935 from the board of the highly influential Nietzsche Archive which was viewed as opposition to the regime.\nSpengler considered Judaism to be a \"disintegrating element\" (\"zersetzendes Element\") that acts destructively \"wherever it intervenes\" (\"wo es auch eingreift\"). In his view, Jews are characterized by a \"cynical intelligence\" (\"zynische Intelligenz\"), and by \"money thinking\" (\"Gelddenken\"). As a result, he claimed they were incapable of adapting to Western culture and represented a foreign body in Europe. He also explained in \"The Decline of the West\" that this is a pattern shared in all civilizations amd how the ancient Jew would have seen the cynical atheistic Romans of the late Roman Empire the same way Westerners today see Jews. Alexander Bein argues that with these characterizations Spengler contributed significantly to the enforcement of Jewish stereotypes in pre-World War II German circles.\nSpengler viewed Nazi antisemitism as self-defeating, and personally took an ethnological view of race and culture. In his private papers, he remarked upon \"how much envy of the capability of other people in view of one's lack of it lies hidden in anti-Semitism!\", and arguing that \"when one would rather destroy business and scholarship than see Jews in them, one is an ideologue, i.e., a danger for the nation. Idiotic.\" Spengler regarded the transformation of ultra-capitalist mass democracies into dictatorial regimes as inevitable, and he had expressed acknowledgement for Benito Mussolini and the Italian fascist movement as a first symptom of this development.\nLegacy.\nSpengler influenced other academics, including historians Arnold J. Toynbee, Carroll Quigley, and Samuel P. Huntington. Others include fascist ideologues Francis Parker Yockey and Oswald Mosley. John Calvert observed that Spengler's criticism of Western civilisation remains popular among Islamists.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22589", "revid": "432843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22589", "title": "Oracle", "text": "Provider of prophecies or insights\nAn oracle is a person or thing considered to provide insight, wise counsel or prophetic predictions, most notably including precognition of the future, inspired by deities. If done through occultic means, it is a form of divination.\nDescription.\nThe word \"oracle\" comes from the Latin verb \"\u014dr\u0101re\", \"to speak\" and properly refers to the priest or priestess uttering the prediction. In extended use, \"oracle\" may also refer to the \"site of the oracle\", and the oracular utterances themselves, are called \"khr\u0113smo\u00ed\" (\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03af) in Greek.\nOracles were thought to be portals through which the gods spoke directly to people. In this sense, they were different from seers (\"manteis\", \u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) who interpreted signs sent by the gods through bird signs, animal entrails, and other various methods.\nThe most important oracles of Greek antiquity were Pythia (priestess to Apollo at Delphi), and the oracle of Dione and Zeus at Dodona in Epirus. Other oracles of Apollo were located at Didyma and Mallus on the coast of Anatolia, at Corinth and Bassae in the Peloponnese, and at the islands of Delos and Aegina in the Aegean Sea.\nThe Sibylline Oracles are a collection of oracular utterances written in Greek hexameters, ascribed to the Sibyls, prophetesses who uttered divine revelations in frenzied states.\nOrigins.\nWalter Burkert observes that \"Frenzied women from whose lips the God speaks\" are recorded in the Near East as in Mari in the second millennium BC and in Assyria in the first millennium BC. In Egypt, the goddess Wadjet (eye of the moon) was depicted as a snake-headed woman or a woman with two snake-heads. Her oracle was in the renowned temple in Per-Wadjet (Greek name Buto). The oracle of Wadjet may have been the source for the oracular tradition which spread from Egypt to Greece. Evans linked Wadjet with the \"Minoan Snake Goddess\".\nAt the oracle of Dodona, she is called Di\u014dn\u0113 (the feminine form of \"Di\u00f3s\", genitive of \"Zeus\"; or of \"d\u012bos\", \"godly\", literally \"heavenly\"), who represents the earth-fertile soil, probably the chief female goddess of the proto-Indo-European pantheon. Python, daughter (or son) of Gaia was the earth dragon of Delphi represented as a serpent and became the chthonic deity, enemy of Apollo, who slew her and possessed the oracle.\nIn classical antiquity.\nPythia at Delphi.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;When the Prytanies' seat shines white in the island of Siphnos,\nWhite-browed all the forum\u2014need then of a true seer's wisdom\u2014\nDanger will threat from a wooden boat, and a herald in scarlet.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe Pythia was the mouthpiece of the oracles of the god Apollo, and was also known as the Oracle of Delphi.\nThe Delphic Oracle exerted considerable influence throughout Hellenic culture. Distinctively, this woman was essentially the highest authority both civilly and religiously in male-dominated ancient Greece. She responded to the questions of citizens, foreigners, kings, and philosophers on issues of political impact, war, duty, crime, family, laws\u2014even personal issues. The semi-Hellenic countries around the Greek world, such as Lydia, Caria, and even Egypt also respected her and came to Delphi as supplicants.\nCroesus, king of Lydia beginning in 560 BC, tested the oracles of the world to discover which gave the most accurate prophecies. He sent out emissaries to seven sites who were all to ask the oracles on the same day what the king was doing at that very moment. Croesus proclaimed the oracle at Delphi to be the most accurate, who correctly reported that the king was making a lamb-and-tortoise stew, and so he graced her with a magnitude of precious gifts. He then consulted Delphi before attacking Persia, and according to Herodotus was advised: \"If you cross the river, a great empire will be destroyed\". Believing the response favourable, Croesus attacked, but it was his own empire that ultimately was destroyed by the Persians.\nShe allegedly also proclaimed that there was no man wiser than Socrates, to which Socrates said that, if so, this was because he alone was aware of his own ignorance. After this confrontation, Socrates dedicated his life to a search for knowledge that was one of the founding events of Western philosophy. He claimed that she was \"an essential guide to personal and state development.\" This oracle's last recorded response was given in 362 AD, to Julian the Apostate.\nThe oracle's powers were highly sought after and never doubted. Any inconsistencies between prophecies and events were dismissed as failure to correctly interpret the responses, not an error of the oracle. Very often prophecies were worded ambiguously, so as to cover all contingencies \u2013 especially so \"ex post facto\". One famous such response to a query about participation in a military campaign was \"You will go you will return never in war will you perish\". This gives the recipient liberty to place a comma before or after the word \"never\", thus covering both possible outcomes. Another was the response to the Athenians when the vast army of king Xerxes I was approaching Athens with the intent of razing the city to the ground. \"Only the wooden palisades may save you\", answered the oracle, probably aware that there was sentiment for sailing to the safety of southern Italy and re-establishing Athens there. Some thought that it was a recommendation to fortify the Acropolis with a wooden fence and make a stand there. Others, Themistocles among them, said the oracle was clearly for fighting at sea, the metaphor intended to mean war ships. Others still insisted that their case was so hopeless that they should board every ship available and flee to Italy, where they would be safe beyond any doubt. In the event, variations of all three interpretations were attempted: some barricaded the Acropolis, the civilian population was evacuated over sea to nearby Salamis Island and to Troizen, and the war fleet fought victoriously at Salamis Bay. Should utter destruction have happened, it could always be claimed that the oracle had called for fleeing to Italy after all.\nSibyl at Cumae.\nCumae was the first Greek colony on the mainland of Italy, near Naples, dating back to the 8th century BC. The \"sibylla\" or prophetess at Cumae became famous because of her proximity to Rome and the Sibylline Books acquired and consulted in emergencies by Rome wherein her prophecies were transcribed. The Cumaean Sibyl was called \"Herophile\" by Pausanias and Lactantius, \"Deiphobe, daughter of Glaucus\" by Virgil, as well as \"Amaltheia\", \"Demophile\", or \"Taraxandra\" by others. Sibyl's prophecies became popular with Christians as they were thought to predict the birth of Jesus Christ.\nOracle at Didyma.\nDidyma near Ionia in Asia Minor in the domain of the famous city of Miletus.\nOracle at Dodona.\nDodona in northwestern Greece was another oracle devoted to the Mother Goddess identified at other sites with Rhea or Gaia, but here called Dione. The shrine of Dodona, set in a grove of oak trees, was the oldest Hellenic oracle, according to the fifth-century historian Herodotus, and dated from pre-Hellenic times, perhaps as early as the second millennium BC, when the tradition may have spread from Egypt. By the time of Herodotus, Zeus had displaced the Mother Goddess, who had been assimilated to Aphrodite, and the worship of the deified hero Heracles had been added. Dodona became the second most important oracle in ancient Greece, after Delphi. At Dodona, Zeus was worshipped as Zeus Naios or Naos (god of springs Naiads, from a spring under the oaks), or as Zeus Bouleos (chancellor). Priestesses and priests interpreted the rustling of the leaves of the oak tree that stood on this spot as Zeus' sanctuary to determine the correct actions to be taken.\nOracle at Abae.\nThe oracle of Abae was one of the most important oracles. It was almost completely destroyed by the Persians during the Second Persian invasion of Greece.\nOther oracles.\nErythrae near Ionia in Asia Minor was home to a prophetess.\nTrophonius was an oracle at Lebadea of Boeotia devoted to the chthonian Zeus Trophonius. Trophonius was a Greek hero nursed by Europa.\nNear the Menestheus's port or \"Menesthei Portus\" (), modern El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda, Spain, was the oracle of Menestheus (), to whom also the inhabitants of Gades offered sacrifices.\nAt the Ikaros island in the Persian Gulf (modern Failaka Island in Kuwait), there was an oracle of Artemis Tauropolus.\nAt Claros, there was the oracle of Apollo Clarius.\nAt Ptoion, there was an oracle of Ptoios and later of Apollo.\nAt Gryneium, there was a sanctuary of Apollo with an ancient oracle.\nAt Livadeia, there was the oracle of Trophonius.\nThe oracle of Zeus Ammon at Siwa Oasis was so famous that Alexander the Great visited it when he conquered Egypt.\nThere was also another oracle of Zeus Ammon at Aphytis in Chalkidiki.\nThe oracle of Zeus at Olympia.\nIn the city of Anariace (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7) at the Caspian Sea, there was an oracle for sleepers. Persons should sleep in the temple in order to learn the divine will.\nThe oracle of Apollo at Eutresis and the oracle of Apollo at Tegyra.\nOracle of Aphrodite at Paphos.\nThere were many \"oracles of the dead\", such as in Argolis, Cumae, Herakleia in Pontos, in the Temple of Poseidon in Taenaron, but the most important was the Necromanteion of Acheron.\nIn other cultures.\nThe term \"oracle\" is also applied in modern English to parallel institutions of divination in other cultures. Specifically, it is used in the context of Christianity for the concept of divine revelation, and in the context of Judaism for the Urim and Thummim breastplate, and in general any utterance considered prophetic.\nCaucasus.\nAccording to Strabo, the city of Anariace (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7), which belonged to a people known as the Anariacae in the Caucasus, contained an oracle that revealed the will of the gods to those who slept within its temple.\nCeltic polytheism.\nIn Celtic polytheism, divination was performed by the priestly caste, either the druids or the vates. This is reflected in the role of \"seers\" in Dark Age Wales (\"dryw\") and Ireland (\"f\u00e1ith\").\nChina.\nIn China, oracle bones were used for divination in the late Shang dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BC). Diviners applied heat to these bones, usually ox scapulae or tortoise plastrons, and interpreted the resulting cracks.\nA different divining method, using the stalks of the yarrow plant, was practiced in the subsequent Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BC). Around the late 9th century BC, the divination system was recorded in the \"I Ching\", or \"Book of Changes\", a collection of linear signs used as oracles. In addition to its oracular power, the \"I Ching\" has had a major influence on the philosophy, literature and statecraft of China since the Zhou period.\nEgypt.\nAccording to the Ancient Egyptian religion, some ancient Egyptian gods (and rarely deified humans), acted as intermediaries between humans and the divine. This was exemplified by the Ancient Egyptian title \"Reporter/Herald\" (\"w\u1e25mw\"), whom in the religious context, reports requests and petitions to the local gods.\nHawaii.\nIn Hawaii, oracles were found at certain \"heiau\", Hawaiian temples. These oracles were found in towers covered in white \"kapa\" cloth made from plant fibres. In here, priests received the will of gods. These towers were called \" 'Anu'u\". An example of this can be found at Ahu'ena heiau in Kona.\nIndia and Nepal.\nIn ancient India, the oracle was known as \"\u0101k\u0101\u015bav\u0101n\u012b\" (\"voice/speech from the sky/aether\") or \"a\u015bar\u012brav\u0101n\u012b\" (\"a disembodied voice (or voice of the unseen)\") (\"asariri\" in Tamil), and was related to the message of a god. Oracles played key roles in many of the major incidents of the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. An example is that Kamsa (or Kansa), the evil uncle of Krishna, was informed by an oracle that the eighth son of his sister Devaki would kill him. The opening verse of the \"Tiruvalluva Maalai\", a medieval Tamil anthology usually dated by modern scholars to between c. 7th and 10th centuries CE, is attributed to an \"asariri\" or oracle.16 However, there are no references in any Indian literature of the oracle being a specific person.\nContemporarily, Theyyam or \"theiyam\" in Malayalam - a south Indian language - the process by which a Priest invites a Hindu god or goddess to use his or her body as a medium or channel and answer other devotees' questions, still happens. The same is called \"arulvaakku\" or \"arulvaak\" in Tamil, another south Indian language - Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetam is famous for arulvakku in Tamil Nadu. The people in and around Mangalore in Karnataka call the same, Buta Kola, \"paathri\" or \"darshin\"; in other parts of Karnataka, it is known by various names such as, \"prashnaavali\", \"vaagdaana\", \"asei\", \"aashirvachana\" and so on. In Nepal it is known as, \"Devta ka dhaamee\" or \"jhaakri\".\nNigeria.\nThe Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria in Africa have a long tradition of using oracles. In Igbo villages, oracles were usually female priestesses to a particular deity, usually dwelling in a cave or other secluded location away from urban areas, and, much as the oracles of ancient Greece, would deliver prophecies in an ecstatic state to visitors seeking advice. Two of their ancient oracles became especially famous during the pre-colonial period: the Agbala oracle at Awka and the Chukwu oracle at Arochukwu. Although the vast majority of Igbos today are Christian, many of them still use oracles.\nAmong the related Yoruba peoples of the same country, the Babalawos (and their female counterparts, the Iyanifas) serve collectively as the principal aspects of the tribe's world-famous Ifa divination system. Due to this, they customarily officiate at a great many of its traditional and religious ceremonies.\nNorse mythology.\nIn Norse mythology, Odin took the severed head of the god Mimir to Asgard for consultation as an oracle. The \"Havamal\" and other sources relate the sacrifice of Odin for the oracular runes whereby he lost an eye (external sight) and won wisdom (internal sight; insight).\nPre-Columbian Americas.\nIn the migration myth of the Mexitin, i.e., the early Aztecs, a mummy-bundle (perhaps an effigy) carried by four priests directed the trek away from the cave of origins by giving oracles. An oracle led to the foundation of Mexico-Tenochtitlan. The Yucatec Mayas knew oracle priests or \"chilanes\", literally 'mouthpieces' of the deity. Their written repositories of traditional knowledge, the Books of Chilam Balam, were all ascribed to one famous oracle priest who had correctly predicted the coming of the Spaniards and its associated disasters.\nTibet.\nIn Tibet, oracles (Tib. \u0f66\u0f90\u0f74\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f9f\u0f7a\u0f53\u0f0b, ku ten, Wyl. sku rten) have played, and continue to play, an important part in religion and government. The word \"oracle\" is used by Tibetans to refer to the spirit that enters those men and women who act as mediums between the natural and the spiritual realms. The media are, therefore, known as \"kuten\", which literally means, \"the physical basis\".\nThe Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the \"Nechung Oracle\", which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. The Dalai Lama has, according to centuries-old custom, consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities of Losar. Nechung and Gadhong are the primary oracles currently consulted; former oracles such as Karmashar and Darpoling are no longer active in exile. The Gadhong oracle has died leaving Nechung to be the only primary oracle. Another oracle the Dalai Lama consults is the \"Tenma Oracle\", for which a young Tibetan woman by the name of Khandro La is the medium for the mountain goddesses Tseringma along with the other 11 goddesses. The Dalai Lama gives a complete description of the process of trance and spirit possession in his book \"Freedom in Exile\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Co-founded in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, by its current executive chairman Larry Ellison, Oracle is among the 20 largest companies in the world by market cap, and ranked 66th on the \"Forbes Global 2000\" as of 2025. \nThe company sells database software (particularly the Oracle Database), and cloud computing software and hardware. Oracle's core application software is a suite of enterprise software products, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management (HCM), customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise performance management (EPM), Customer Experience Commerce (CX Commerce) and supply chain management (SCM) software.\nHistory.\nLarry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates co-founded Oracle in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, as Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Beginning as consultants with a background in large-scale memory after a project for Ampex, Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.\" He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the \"IBM Research Journal\" provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983, to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. The name also drew from the codename of a 1977 project for the Central Intelligence Agency, Oracle's first customer; the company received permission to use the code name for the new product. (According to Oracle executive Mike Humphries, Miner told him that the new company had the choice of the CIA database project or another offer to develop a compiler for the PDP-4, and the founders flipped a coin to decide.)\nMiner served as a senior programmer, and Oates also worked in development. The three founders decided that Ellison was the worst programmer so he became the salesman. Understanding both customers and technology, Ellison designed database tables that he used to demonstrate the power of SQL to customers. By February 1983 the \"Rosen Electronics Letter\" said that Oracle was \"the most comprehensive offering we've seen\" among databases, with good marketing and a substantial installed base encouraging developers to write software for it. The newsletter said that revenue in fiscal 1983 would be about $8 million and would double in 1984. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering. In 1989, Oracle moved its world headquarters to the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California, though its https:// was not completed until 1995. The company hired so many from top universities that Humphries compared it to \"Cargill buying crops\". Some new employees worked as receptionists or distributed coffee until more suitable positions became available.\nOracle in the late 1980s began selling enterprise software running on the database, starting with financial software, then manufacturing. Many at Oracle wanted to discontinue applications; the first several versions were weak, they competed with the company's independent software vendors and value-added reseller partners, and applications were never profitable for Oracle until after 2000. Selling them (and acquiring vendors such as JD Edwards and PeopleSoft, the latter being the second hostile takeover in the history of software) nonetheless allowed Oracle to compete with SAP; by the mid-2000s it was the world's largest enterprise software vendor. The company's Ken Jacobs later said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It created a strategic footprint in our customers. It gave us a whole stack, a credible stack. And we could now sell at a higher point into the companies, into the board room. And, our large customers wanted to consider us a strategic partner, rather than just a vendor of technology. So, it has, actually, had a big impact on the way our sales force could sell.\nIn 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.\nOracle acquired the following technology companies:\nOn July 15, 2013, Oracle transferred its stock listing from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange. At the time, it was the largest-ever U.S. market transfer.\nIn an effort to compete with Amazon Web Services and its products, Oracle announced in 2019 it was partnering with former rival Microsoft. The alliance claimed that Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure would be directly connected, allowing customers of each to store data on both cloud computing platforms and run software on either Oracle or Azure. Some saw this not only as an attempt to compete with Amazon but also with Google and Salesforce, which acquired Looker and Tableau Software, respectively.\nIn 2018, Oracle opened a new office in southeast Austin, Texas. In December 2020, Oracle announced that it was moving its world headquarters from Redwood Shores to Austin, Texas.\nIn December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner, a health information technology company. The acquisition of Cerner was completed on June 8, 2022, for US$28.3 billion in cash. Also in December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Federos, an artificial intelligence (AI) and automation tools company for network performance.\nIn February 2023, the company announced it was going to invest $1.5 billion into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including opening a data centre in the country's capital, Riyadh.\nIn April 2024, Oracle announced it was moving its world headquarters from Austin to a new complex in Nashville, Tennessee. No timeframe was given.\nIn June 2024, Oracle announced a $1 billion investment in Spain to enhance artificial intelligence and cloud computing. This investment will create a new cloud region in Madrid in partnership with Telef\u00f3nica. The goal is to help Spanish businesses and the public sector with digital transformation and to meet European Union regulations.\nIn January 2025, President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a joint venture by Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank and investment firm MGX to invest $500 billion over four years in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.\nProducts and services.\nDatabases.\nOracle Corporation has acquired and developed the following additional database technologies:\nMiddleware.\nOracle Fusion Middleware is a family of middleware software products, including (for instance) application server, system integration, business process management (BPM), user interaction, content management, identity management and business intelligence (BI) products.\nOracle Secure Enterprise Search.\nOracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES), Oracle's enterprise-search offering, gives users the ability to search for content across multiple locations, including websites, XML files, file servers, content management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, business intelligence systems, and databases.\nOracle Beehive.\nReleased in 2008, the Oracle Beehive collaboration software provides team workspaces (including wikis, team calendaring and file sharing), email, calendar, instant messaging, and conferencing on a single platform. Customers can use Beehive as licensed software or as software as a service (\"SaaS\").\nApplications.\nOracle Applications, software sold by Oracle based on its own database, first appeared in the late 1980s. Following a number of acquisitions beginning in 2003, especially in the area of applications, Oracle Corporation as of 2008[ [update]] maintains a number of product lines:\nDevelopment of applications commonly takes place in Java (using Oracle JDeveloper) or through PL/SQL (using, for example, Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports/BIPublisher). Oracle Corporation has started a drive toward \"wizard\"-driven environments with a view to enabling non-programmers to produce simple data-driven applications.\nThird-party applications.\nOracle Corporation works with \"Oracle Certified Partners\" to enhance its overall product marketing. The variety of applications from third-party vendors includes database applications for archiving, splitting and control, ERP and CRM systems, as well as more niche and focused products providing a range of commercial functions in areas like human resources, financial control and governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). Vendors include Hewlett-Packard, Creoal Consulting, UC4 Software, Motus, and Knoa Software.\nEnterprise management.\nOracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) provides web-based monitoring and management tools for Oracle products (and for some third-party software), including database management, middleware management, application management, hardware and virtualization management and cloud management.\nThe Primavera products of Oracle's Construction &amp; Engineering Global Business Unit (CEGBU) consist of project-management software.\nDevelopment software.\nOracle Corporation's tools for developing applications include (among others):\nMany external and third-party tools make the Oracle database administrator's tasks easier.\nOperating systems.\nOracle Corporation develops and supports two operating systems: Oracle Solaris and Oracle Linux.\nServices.\nOracle Cloud.\nOracle Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by Oracle Corporation providing servers, storage, network, applications and services through a global network of Oracle Corporation managed data centers. The company allows these services to be provisioned on demand over the Internet.\nOracle Cloud provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS). These services are used to build, deploy, integrate and extend applications in the cloud. This platform supports open standards (SQL, HTML5, REST, etc.) open-source solutions (Kubernetes, Hadoop, Kafka, etc.) and a variety of programming languages, databases, tools and frameworks including Oracle-specific, free and third-party software and systems.\nOn May 16, 2018, Oracle announced that it had acquired DataScience.com, a privately held cloud workspace platform for data science projects and workloads.\nIn 2022 Oracle shared a $9 billion contract from the United States Department of Defense for cloud computing with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.\nMarketing.\nSales practices.\nIn 1990, Oracle laid off 10% (about 400 people) of its work force because of accounting errors. This crisis came about because of Oracle's \"up-front\" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made \"an incredible business mistake\".\nHumphries described the cause\u2014\"building for years\"\u2014as a combination of technical problems that benefited rivals, and the sales force using side letters and other improper tactics to meet the company's longstanding goal of doubling revenue each year. Ellison hired (\"bring in adults\", Jerry Held said) new executives Jeff Henley and Raymond J. Lane, who helped the company recover from what Ken Jacobs later described as a \"near death experience\", in which Oracle required an investment from a Japanese steel company to meet payroll.\nCompetition.\nThe relational database industry was unusually concentrated. Besides being headquartered near each other in the San Francisco Bay area, database technology experts attended the same universities and served on the same standards committees (with Jim Gray serving as neutral arbiter as companies tried to get competing proposals enacted). Sales and marketing people were both fierce rivals and often moved between the companies, even as engineers socialized with each other. The smaller, later-founded database vendors viewed Oracle as their top enemy\u2014the \"evil empire\", said Bob MacDonald of Informix Software\u2014 while Humphries described his company as \"the Klingons of\" the bay.\nHeld later described his company's philosophy as \"it's not good enough for Oracle to win. It was important for somebody else to lose\". Ingres was its first major competitor; Oracle's strategy of focusing on one opponent at a time\u2014even publicly complimenting other rivals \"to take the pressure off\", Held said\u2014while effective, caused it to neglect Sybase as a threat. Conversely, when Sybase had technical problems \"it was: how do you put every ounce of product marketing, sales effort and focus on that\". IBM's endorsement of SQL in Db2 in the early 1980s benefited Oracle and forced rivals like Ingres and Informix Corporation to adopt SQL to compete. Oracle acknowledged IBM as the standard while emphasizing its own superiority, touting \"total IBM SQL compatibility\" while IBM's software ran \"only on IBM mainframes\". By the mid-1980s the company described its database as \"the last DBMS\", bragging that Oracle now had larger database revenue than dBASE maker Ashton-Tate, and stating that Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, and Sybase's planned Microsoft SQL Server \"jumped on Oracle's SQL bandwagon\".\nMacDonald credited Oracle with \"being marketing oriented before any of the competitors ... pushing the envelope on selling the future way ahead of the rest of us\". Stu Schuster of Sybase said \"Larry taught us a lot about marketing\". While other database companies' brochures emphasized technical features, Oracle advertisements showed an Oracle jet fighter shooting down an Ashton-Tate biplane. dBASE, IBM, and Db2 were among the many competitors Oracle marketing criticized by name. Conversely, another Oracle ad quoted Microsoft's Bill Gates, Sun's Scott McNealy, Hewlett-Packard's John A. Young, and Apple Computer's John Sculley as agreeing with Ellison on Oracle's database breakthroughs. Larry Rowe of Ingres said \"you could never come up with a strategy to beat Oracle because whatever you said today, two days later Ellison was saying it with more marketing dollars\". Jacobs said, by contrast:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It really surprises me when people say Oracle's a great marketing machine because by definition, if you think a company has great marketing, they don't. If you think they have great technology then they do have a great marketing machine. Larry's belief has fundamentally always been that marketing isn't critical; he's famous for saying, \"If you're not building the product and you're not selling it, tell me what it is you do.\" Because those are the things that he felt were important. So marketing has never been a focus.\nThe \"benchmark wars\" began in the early 1980s; Roger Sippl of Informix said that when his company's product beat Oracle on 27 of 30 benchmarks, advertisements titled \"Oracle wins again!\" appeared citing the three it won, and Ellison allegedly called Dave DeWitt at the University of Wisconsin after he developed a benchmark unfavorable to Oracle, threatening to get the professor fired. Schuster and Held recalled \"a not very pleasant environment because it was so directly competitive\". They and Sippl described \"a vicious cycle\" of companies battling each other over, for example, whose distributed database had the best two-phase commit:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The ads weren't to let me show you how my product helps you solve your business problem, Mr. Customer. It's let me tell you how much better I am than the guy down the street to the point of taking out billboards.\nEven IBM participated in the \"billboard wars\". By 1995 Oracle had 44% of the $2.4 billion relational database market; Sybase had 17% and Informix had 16%. By 1996 Informix, after acquiring Illustra, became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison made front-page news in Silicon Valley for three years. Informix claimed that Oracle had hired away Informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product. Informix finally dropped its lawsuit against Oracle in 1997. Held said\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And, in one year, we kind of turned the focus from Sybase to Informix, and basically they never knew what hit them. It was such a concerted effort. I mean, it was amazing how you could get product management, marketing, and sales focused. We had a thing, \"Where in the world is Phil White,\" because Phil White was their best sales person. If he went into an account, one of our best guys was in right after them to make sure that they didn't win that business. It was such amazingly focused effort. And within 12 months, Informix was basically on the floor.\nIn November 2005, a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published, titled \"The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White\". It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle, and how Informix Software's CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison.\nAfter what Held described as \"the period of time where some of the wheels came off, first at Ingres then at Sybase, and then at Informix\", Oracle was the only substantial independent database vendor until Microsoft SQL Server became widespread in the late 1990s and IBM acquired Informix Software in 2001 (to complement its Db2 database). Today[ [update]] Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX, GNU, and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM's Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server. IBM's Db2 still[ [update]] dominates the mainframe database market.\nIn 2004, Oracle's sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2\u00a0billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (\"InformationWeek\" \u2013 March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources.\nOracle Corporation's main competitors in the database arena remain IBM Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server, and to a lesser extent Sybase and Teradata, with free databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL also having a significant share of the market. EnterpriseDB, based on PostgreSQL, has recently[ [update]] made inroads by proclaiming that its product delivers Oracle compatibility features at a much lower price-point.\n Oracle's top competitors are IBM, Microsoft, and in applications, SAP. On March 22, 2007, Oracle sued SAP, accusing them of fraud and unfair competition.\nIn the market for business intelligence software, many other software companies\u2014small and large\u2014have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products. Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the \"big four\" consolidated BI firms such as Oracle, who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions (including Hyperion Solutions), and the independent \"pure play\" vendors such as MicroStrategy, Actuate, and SAS.\nOracle Financials was ranked in the Top 20 Most Popular Accounting Software Infographic by Capterra in 2014, beating out SAP and a number of their other competitors.\nOracle and SAP.\nFrom 1988, Oracle Corporation and the German company SAP AG had a decade-long history of cooperation, beginning with the integration of SAP's R/3 enterprise application suite with Oracle's relational database products. Despite the SAP partnership with Microsoft, and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products (such as Microsoft SQL Server, a competitor to Oracle Database), Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation. According to Oracle Corporation, the majority of SAP's customers use Oracle databases.\nIn 2004, Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise-applications market (in 1989, Oracle had already released Oracle Financials). A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began, most notably with those of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems, and Hyperion.\nSAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a markets where SAP had the leadership, and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired. SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications.\nOracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy, by advising SAP customers to get \"OFF SAP\" (a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform \"Oracle Fusion for SAP\"), and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to SAP customers who chose Oracle Corporation products.\nCurrently[ [update]] Oracle and SAP (the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary TomorrowNow) compete in the third-party enterprise software maintenance and support market. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP. In Oracle Corporation v. SAP AG Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow, which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines, used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle's website and to appropriate them for SAP's use. Some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by Oracle Corporation to decrease competition with SAP in the market for third-party enterprise software maintenance and support.\nOn July 3, 2007, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made \"inappropriate downloads\" from the Oracle support website. However, it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow. SAP's CEO Henning Kagermann stated that \"Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective. We regret very much that this occurred.\" Additionally, SAP announced that it had \"instituted changes\" in TomorrowNow's operational oversight.\nOn November 23, 2010, a U.S. district court jury in Oakland, California, found that SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp $1.3\u00a0billion for copyright infringement, awarding damages that could be the largest-ever for copyright infringement. While admitting liability, SAP estimated the damages at no more than $40\u00a0million, while Oracle claimed that they are at least $1.65\u00a0billion. The awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in U.S. legal history. SAP said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal. On September 1, 2011, a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial, calling Oracle's original award \"grossly\" excessive. Oracle chose a new trial.\nOn August 3, 2012, SAP and Oracle agreed on a judgment for $306 million in damages, pending approval from the U.S. district court judge, \"to save time and expense of [a] new trial\". After the accord has been approved, Oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict. In addition to the damages payment, SAP has already paid Oracle $120 million for its legal fees.\nCorporate affairs.\nFinances.\nOracle was ranked No. 82 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. According to Bloomberg, Oracle's CEO-to-employee pay ratio is 1,205:1. The CEO's compensation in 2017 was $108,295,023. Oracle is one of the approved employers of ACCA and the median employee compensation rate was $89,887.\nPersonnel.\nBoard of directors.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], the company's board consisted of the following directors:\nControversies.\nTrashgate.\nIn 2000, Oracle attracted attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an antitrust trial against Microsoft. The Chairman of Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison, staunchly defended his company's hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial, calling the snooping a \"public service\". The investigation reportedly included a $1,200 offer to janitors at the Association for Competitive Technology to look through Microsoft's trash. When asked how he would feel if others were looking into Oracle's business activities, Ellison said: \"We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full disclosure.\"\n\"Can't break it, can't break in\".\nIn 2002, Oracle Corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan \"Can't break it, can't break in\", or \"Unbreakable\". This signified a claim of information security. Oracle Corporation also stressed the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points.\nHowever, two weeks after its introduction, David Litchfield, Alexander Kornbrust, Cesar Cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against Oracle products. Oracle Corporation's chief security officer Mary Ann Davidson said that, rather than representing a literal claim of Oracle's products' impregnability, she saw the campaign in the context of fourteen independent security evaluations that Oracle Corporation's database server had passed.\nRelationship with John Ashcroft.\nIn 2004, then-United States Attorney General John Ashcroft sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion-dollar intelligence contract. After Ashcroft's resignation from government, he founded a lobbying firm, The Ashcroft Group, which Oracle hired in 2005. With the group's help, Oracle went on to acquire the contract.\nExpeditionary Combat Support System.\nComputer Sciences Corporation, as the prime contractor, reportedly spent a billion dollars developing the Expeditionary Combat Support System for the United States Air Force. It yielded no significant capability, because, according to an Air Force source, the prime contractor \"was simply not up to the task of adapting\" the Oracle software, on which the system was based, to meet the specialized performance criteria.\nCover Oregon Healthcare Exchange.\nOracle Corporation was awarded a contract by the State of Oregon's Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to develop Cover Oregon, the state's healthcare exchange website, as part of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. When the site tried to go live on October 1, 2013, it failed, and registrations had to be taken using paper applications until the site could be fixed.\nOn April 25, 2014, the State of Oregon voted to discontinue Cover Oregon and instead use the federal exchange to enroll Oregon residents. The cost of switching to the federal portal was estimated at $5 million, whereas fixing Cover Oregon would have required another $78 million.\nOracle president Safra Catz responded to Cover Oregon and the OHA in a letter claiming that the site's problems were due to OHA mismanagement, specifically that a third-party systems integrator was not hired to manage the complex project.\nIn August 2014, Oracle Corporation sued Cover Oregon for breach of contract, and then later that month the state of Oregon sued Oracle Corporation, in a civil complaint for breach of contract, fraud, filing false claims and \"racketeering\". In September 2016, the two sides reached a settlement valued at over $100 million to the state, and a six-year agreement for Oracle to continue modernizing state software and IT.\nClass action tracking lawsuit.\nIn August 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against Oracle by the law firm Lieff Cabraser. The lawsuit alleges that Oracle engaged in \"deliberate and purposeful surveillance of the general population via their digital and online existence\", specifically focusing on Oracle operating a surveillance machine which tracks in real-time and records indefinitely the personal information of hundreds of millions of people. The litigants argue that through such surveillance, the company violates the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California's state constitution, the California Invasion of Privacy Act, competition law, and California Common Law.\nThe lawsuit was settled in July 2024 when Oracle paid $115 million to some of its customers and agreed to stop tracking users.\nHeritage Foundation database of employees for Republican administration.\nIn 2023, Oracle was contracted by conservative think tank Heritage Foundation to construct a database of conservative employees to help staff a prospective Republican presidency in 2025, part of the Foundation's Project 2025.\nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nAfrica.\nIn August 2011, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Oracle was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for paying bribes to government officials in order to win business in Africa, in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).\nIndia.\nIn 2012 Oracle agreed to pay about $2 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC at the time alleged that the company's Indian subsidiary structured transactions with foreign governments in a way that enabled them to hold about $2.2 million of the proceeds inside funds that could be used for unauthorized purposes and therefore was a violation of the FCPA.\nIndia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates.\nIn September 2022, Oracle settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) without admitting or denying its findings, by agreeing to pay $23 million to settle the charges. The SEC announced that Oracle violated the FCPA between 2014 and 2019 when its subsidiaries in India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) created slush funds to bribe foreign officials in order to win business.\nSouth African National Treasury contract and corruption probe.\nIn 2017, a whistleblower notified the SEC and US Department of Justice, alleging possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in awarding of a R\u00a0(2015) contract by National Treasury in 2015.\nIn March 2024, South Africa's Special Investigating Unit found that there were conflicts of interest, irregular processes, and non-compliance with policies and legislation, and said it would petition to blacklist Oracle in South Africa, cancel the contract and recover the money paid.\nOwnership of JavaScript trademark.\nIn November 2024, Deno Land filed a petition with the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel Oracle's registered trademark for \"JavaScript\" because it is \"a generic term that Oracle has never controlled and thus isn't eligible under the law for trademark protection\", \"Oracle abandoned the JavaScript trademark because it doesn't actually use the term in any of the products or services it sells\", and because Oracle made false statements when Oracle applied for the trademark. In February 2025, Oracle denied all three claims.\nReaction to the Israel-Hamas war 2023-2025.\nFollowing the 2023\u20132025 Gaza genocide by Israel, Oracle\u2019s top executives, including Safra Catz and Larry Ellison, publicly aligned the company with Israel\u2019s military operations. They issued statements of solidarity, paid double salaries to Israeli employees, and donated to organizations connected to Israel\u2019s wartime response. Critics argue that these moves demonstrate corporate complicity in the suffering of Palestinian civilians and reflect a broader normalization of support for military action under the guise of \u201ccorporate values.\u201d\nEvents.\nAcquisition of Sun Microsystems.\nIn January 2010, Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems\u2014valued at more than $7\u00a0billion\u2014a move that transformed Oracle from solely a software company to a manufacturer of both software and hardware. The acquisition was delayed for several months by the European Commission because of concerns about MySQL, but was unconditionally approved in the end. In September 2011, U.S. State Department Embassy cables were leaked to WikiLeaks. One cable revealed that the U.S. pressured the E.U. to allow Oracle to acquire Sun.\nThe Sun acquisition was closely watched by free software users and some companies, due to the fear that Oracle might end Sun's traditional support of free projects. Since the acquisition, Oracle has discontinued OpenSolaris and StarOffice, and sued Google over the Java patents Oracle acquired from Sun.\nFraud Accusations by the US Department of Justice.\nOn July 29, 2010, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) filed suit against Oracle Corporation alleging fraud. The lawsuit argues that the government received deals inferior to those Oracle gave to its commercial clients. The DoJ added its heft to an already existing whistleblower lawsuit filed by Paul Frascella, who was once senior director of contract services at Oracle. It was settled in 2011.\nLawsuit against Google.\nBackground.\nOracle, the plaintiff, acquired ownership of the Java computer programming language when it acquired Sun Microsystems in January 2010. The Java software includes sets of pre-developed software code to allow programs and apps to accomplish common tasks in a consistent manner. The pre-developed code is organized into separate \"packages\" which each contain a set of \"classes\". Each class contains numerous methods, which instruct a program or app to do a certain task. Software developers \"became accustomed to using Java's designations at the package, class, and method level\".\nOracle and Google (the defendant) tried to negotiate an agreement for Oracle to license Java to Google, which would have allowed Google to use Java in developing programs for mobile devices using the Android operating system. However, the two companies never reached an agreement. After negotiations failed, Google created its own programming platform, which was based on Java, and contained 37 copied Java packages as well as new packages developed by Google.\nFirst trial.\nIn 2010, Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement for the use of the 37 Java packages. The case was handled in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to Judge William Alsup (who taught himself how to code computers). In the lawsuit, Oracle sought between $1.4 billion and $6.1 billion. In June 2011 the judge had to force Google through a judicial order to make public the details about Oracle's claim for damages.\nBy the end of the first jury trial (the legal dispute would eventually go on to another trial) the arguments made by Oracle's attorneys focused on a Java function called \"rangeCheck\":The argument centered on a function called rangeCheck. Of all the lines of code that Oracle had tested\u201415 million in total\u2014these were the only ones that were 'literally' copied. Every keystroke, a perfect duplicate. \u2013 \"The Verge\", 10/19/17Although Google admitted to copying the packages, Judge Alsup found that none of the Java packages were covered under copyright protection, and therefore Google did not infringe.\nFirst appeal.\nAfter the case was over, Oracle appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (750 F.3d 1339 (2014)). On May 9, 2014, the appeals court partially reversed Judge Alsup's decision, finding that Java APIs are copyrightable. API stands for \"application programming interface\" and are how different computer programs or apps communicate with each other. However, the appeals court also left open the possibility that Google might have a \"fair use\" defense.\nSupreme Court petition.\nOn October 6, 2014, Google filed a petition to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court denied the petition.\nSecond trial.\nThe case was then returned to the U.S. District Court for another trial about Google's fair use defense. Oracle sought $9 billion in damages. In May 2016, the trial jury found that Google's use of Java's APIs was considered fair use.\nSecond appeal.\nIn February 2017, Oracle filed another appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This time it was asking for a new trial because the District Court \"repeatedly undermined Oracle's case\", which Oracle argued led the jury to make the wrong decision. According to ZDNet, \"For example, it [Oracle] says the court wrongly bought Google's claim that Android was limited to smartphones while Java was for PCs, whereas Oracle contends that Java and Android both compete as platforms for smart TVs, cars, and wearables.\"\nDiscontinuation of OpenSolaris.\nOn August 13, 2010, an internal Oracle memo leaked to the Internet cited plans for ending the OpenSolaris operating system project and community. With Oracle planning to develop Solaris only in a closed source fashion, OpenSolaris developers moved to the Illumos and OpenIndiana project, among others.\nDiscontinuation of OpenSSO.\nAs Oracle completed their acquisition of Sun Microsystems in February 2010, they announced that OpenSSO would no longer be their strategic product. Shortly after, OpenSSO was forked to OpenAM, and will continue to be developed and supported by ForgeRock.\nMark Hurd as president.\nOn September 6, 2010, Oracle announced that former Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd was to replace Charles Phillips, who resigned as Oracle co-president. In an official statement made by Larry Ellison, Phillips had previously expressed his desire to transition out of the company. Ellison had asked Phillips to stay on through the integration of Sun Microsystems Inc. In a separate statement regarding the transition, Ellison said \"Mark did a brilliant job at HP and I expect he'll do even better at Oracle. There is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark.\"\nOn September 7, 2010, HP announced a civil lawsuit against Mark Hurd \"to protect HP's trade secrets\", in response to Oracle hiring Hurd. On September 20, Oracle and HP published a joint press release announcing the resolution of the lawsuit on confidential terms and reaffirming commitment to long-term strategic partnership between the companies.\nOpenOffice.org issue.\nA number of OpenOffice.org developers formed The Document Foundation and received backing by Google, Novell, Red Hat, and Canonical, as well as some others, but were unable to get Oracle to donate the brand OpenOffice.org, causing a fork in the development of OpenOffice.org with the foundation now developing and promoting LibreOffice. Oracle expressed no interest in sponsoring the new project and asked the OpenOffice.org developers that started the project to resign from the company due to \"conflicts of interest\". On November 1, 2010, 33 of the OpenOffice.org developers gave their letters of resignation. On June 1, 2011, Oracle donated OpenOffice.org to the Apache Software Foundation.\nHP and Oracle lawsuit.\nOn June 15, 2011, HP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP's high-end enterprise servers. Oracle called the lawsuit \"an abuse of the judicial process\" and said that had it known SAP's L\u00e9o Apotheker was about to be hired as HP's new CEO, any support for HP's Itanium servers would not have been implied.\nOn August 1, 2012, a California judge said in a tentative ruling that Oracle must continue porting its software at no cost until HP discontinues its sales of Itanium-based servers. HP was awarded $3 billion in damages against Oracle in 2016. HP argued Oracle's canceling support damaged HP's Itanium server brand. Oracle had announced that it would appeal both the decision and damages, but the decision stayed.\nGSA business bidding ban.\nOn April 20, 2012, the US General Services Administration banned Oracle from the most popular portal for bidding on GSA contracts for undisclosed reasons. Oracle has previously used this portal for around four hundred million dollars a year in revenue. Oracle previously settled a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act, which accused the company of overbilling the US government between 1998 and 2006. The 2011 settlement forced Oracle to pay $199.5 million to the General Services Administration.\nCerner acquisition.\nOn December 20, 2021, Oracle announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Cerner Corporation (now \"Oracle Health\" and \"Oracle Life Sciences\") for approximately US$, creating a dedicated Industry Business Unit within the company. Cerner is the largest international supplier of health information technology, such as electronic health records (EHR), revenue cycle solutions, and biomedical device integration platforms, and has its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, US. The deal closed in early July 2022 after receiving final approval from European regulators, making it Oracle's largest acquisition and one of the largest in corporate history.\nOracle's purchase of Cerner is part of an effort to introduce Oracle products into the healthcare market, particularly in the United States although Oracle plans to expand Cerner's global operations. It mirrors closely to expansions of other large information technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon into the healthcare sector. Cerner already used Oracle solutions for its \"largest business and most important clinical system\", and Oracle announced its intention to integrate autonomous solutions such as the Oracle Voice Digital Assistant into Cerner clinical solutions. Oracle additionally has shared its plans to improve the usability and user experience of Cerner solutions.\nWhile the acquisition was originally met with mixed reactions by industry and investors, some industry experts have developed a more positive perception of the purchase. Cerner won a major contract in 2017 to supply its EHR software to the US Department of Defense and Veterans Administration Hospitals, which resulted in Cerner \"leaving its traditional base of hospital systems high and dry\" with delays in resolving issues and implementing innovations. Oracle's acquisition allows for the larger corporation to support Cerner's operations, with the goal of \"addressing basic operational issues... improving resiliency and usability\" in the short-term. Some opinions have expressed longer-term concern, with Oracle Health expecting a decline in US-based sales in 2024, although an increase in global sales. Additionally, clients of Cerner have reported minimal improvements to the core system and a focus by Oracle on future advancements over resolving current issues.\nA September 2024 announcement by Oracle listed \"tens of thousands of engineering hours and millions of dollars\" of investments in the core clinical operations, and the release of the highly anticipated Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant, a generative AI system that automatically creates consultation documentation and proposes orders.\nOracle Health data breach.\nIn March 2025, a threat actor claimed to have stolen 6 million data records from Oracle Health (formerly Cerner), affecting 140,000 patients. Oracle has denied the breach despite multiple online reports and legal complaints filed. In April 2025, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning to Oracle customers to secure their environments, despite no public acknowledgment of the breach by Oracle.\nU.S. TikTok's operations.\nOn September 13, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Oracle won a bidding war with other U.S.-based companies to take over social media company TikTok's operations in the United States following the company's pressure to forcibly be shut down by the Trump administration. Oracle was described as a \"trusted tech partner\" by TikTok, suggesting the deal may not be as structured as an outright sale. On September 19, 2020, the Trump administration approved of the sale of TikTok's US operations to Oracle \"[delaying] \u2014 by one week \u2014 restrictions that were originally to take effect\" on September 20 as indicated by the United States Department of Commerce.\nOn February 10, 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, the Biden administration would be backing off from banning TikTok and shelving the sale of TikTok indefinitely, as the U.S. Commerce Department began reviewing whether or not Trump's claims about TikTok can justify the attempts to ban it.\nOn February 27, 2023, Biden changed his \"indefinite\" stance on TikTok as he echoed Trump's 2020 claims of disapproval. Biden said Federal agencies have thirty days to remove TikTok from all federal devices. Federal contractors must meet the same standard in ninety days. On March 8, 2024, Biden said he would sign a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States if the Chinese company ByteDance didn't divest.\nAs of the 25th September 2025, TikTok was bought by Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX. Oracle will own 45% of the app in the US, and ByteDance 35% after delays with the ban for the 4th time.\nOracle will store data of US TikTok users on its cloud computers, and it will be involved in the new TikTok spinoff's cybersecurity.\nOffices.\nSince December 2020, Oracle Corporation's world headquarters has been located in Austin, Texas. Oracle has plans to build its largest office hub, with 8,500 jobs, in Nashville, Tennessee within the next few decades.\nOracle has a large office complex located on the San Francisco Peninsula in the Redwood Shores area of Redwood City. This complex was home to Oracle world headquarters from 1989 to 2020. It is located on the former site of Marine World/Africa USA, which moved from Redwood Shores to Vallejo in 1986. Oracle Corporation originally leased two buildings on the Oracle Parkway site, moving its finance and administration departments from the corporation's former headquarters on Davis Drive, Belmont, California. Eventually, Oracle purchased the complex and constructed four additional buildings.\nThe distinctive Oracle Parkway buildings, nicknamed the Emerald City, served as sets for the futuristic headquarters of the fictional company \"NorthAm Robotics\" in the Robin Williams film \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999). The campus also represented the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems in the movie \"Terminator Genisys\" (2015).\nCorporate structures.\nOracle Corporation operates in multiple markets and has acquired many companies to help it do so. In some cases these companies became the starting points for global business units (GBUs) targeting particular vertical markets., including: \nSponsorships.\nIn 1994 and 1995, Oracle sponsored Benetton Formula.\nFrom 2001 to 2021, Sean Tucker's stunt biplane was sponsored by Oracle and performed frequently at air shows around the US.\nIn October 2006, the Golden State Warriors and the Oracle Corporation announced a 10-year agreement in which the Oakland Arena would become known as the Oracle Arena. The agreement ended after the 2018\u20132019 NBA season when the Warriors relocated to the Chase Center in San Francisco. In January 2019, the San Francisco Giants entered into a 20-year agreement to rename their stadium Oracle Park.\nLarry Ellison's sailing team competes as Oracle Team USA. The team won the America's Cup twice, in 2010 (as BMW Oracle Racing) and in 2013, despite being penalized for cheating.\nFrom the 2022 Formula One season, Oracle signed a five-year deal worth $500 million to become title sponsors of Red Bull Racing, after already being a sponsor effective from the 2021 season.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is notable for its deliberately bizarre policies and it effectively exists to satirise British politics, and by fielding novelty candidates to offer itself as an alternative for protest voters, especially in constituencies where the party holding a safe seat is unlikely to lose it.\nHistory.\nSutch era.\nStarting in 1963, David Sutch, head of the rock group Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, stood in British parliamentary elections under a range of party names, initially as the National Teenage Party candidate. At that time, the minimum voting age was 21. The party's name was intended to highlight what Sutch and others viewed as hypocrisy, since teenagers were unable to vote because of their supposed immaturity while the adults running the country were involved in scandals such as the Profumo affair.\nSutch moved to America in 1968. After being shot during a mugging attempt while living in the United States, Sutch returned to Britain (and to politics) during the 1980s. The Raving Loony name first appeared at the Bermondsey by-election of 1983.\nA similar concept had appeared earlier in the Election Night Special sketch on the television comedy series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", in which the Silly and Sensible parties competed; and a similar skit by \"The Goodies\", in which Graeme Garden stood as a Science Loony. A Science Fiction Looney candidate had also competed in the 1976 Cambridge by-election.\nTwo others were important in the formation of the OMRLP: John Desmond Dougrez-Lewis stood in the Crosby by-election of 1981 (won by the Social Democratic Party's co-founder Shirley Williams); and Dougrez-Lewis stood in the by-election as Tarquin Fin-tim-lin-bin-whin-bim-lim-bus-stop-F'tang-F'tang-Ol\u00e9-Biscuitbarrel, taken from the Election Night Special Monty Python sketch. He had changed his name by deed poll from John Desmond Lewis, on behalf of the Cambridge University Raving Loony Society (Curls), an \"anti-political party\" and charity fundraising group formed largely as a fun counter-response to increasingly polarised student politics in Cambridge. It was responsible for a number of fun stunts. Its Oxford University equivalents were the \"Oxford Raving Lunatics\". Dougrez-Lewis became Sutch's agent at the notorious Bermondsey by-election, where the OMRLP banner was first officially unfurled. Reverting to his original name, Dougrez-Lewis stood for the new party in Cambridge in the 1983 general election.\nAnother serial offbeat by-election candidate was Commander Bill Boaks, a retired World War II hero who took part in sinking the \"Bismarck\". Boaks campaigned and stood for election for over 30 years on limited funds, always on the issue of road safety. Boaks proved influential on Sutch's direction as the leading anti-politician: \"It's the ones who \"don't\" vote you really want, because they're the ones who think.\"\nBoaks thought that increased traffic and more roads would cause problems, and he addressed road safety with flamboyant campaigning and a variety of tactics, including private prosecution of public figures who escaped public prosecution for drunk driving. He successfully campaigned with Sutch and others to pedestrianise London's Carnaby Street. While recovering from being struck by a motorcycle, Boaks was one of Sutch's counting agents at Bermondsey in 1983. Following Boaks's death, popular opinion towards road safety has become closer to his views.\nScreaming Lord Sutch died by suicide on 16 June 1999 while suffering from clinical depression after his mother, Annie, died in 1998. A biography of Sutch, \"The Man Who Was Screaming Lord Sutch\" (by Graham Sharpe, the media relations manager of bookmaker William Hill), was published in April 2005, describing what remained of the party as \"wannabes, never-would-bes and some bloody-well-shouldn't-bes\".\nPost-Sutch.\nSutch's funeral \u2013 organised by his friend, the session drummer and former Rolling Stones member Carlo Little \u2013 was attended by members of the OMRLP and Raving Loony Green Giant Party, including Stuart Hughes, who with Freddie Zapp brought along a huge floral tribute shaped as an OMRLP rosette. The running of the OMRLP fell to Alan \"Howling Laud\" Hope and his cat, Catmando, who were the joint winners of the 1999 membership ballot for the replacement for Sutch. Although Hope took over as party leader after Sutch's death, the real day-to-day running of the party has always been done by other party members.\nThe OMRLP fielded 15 candidates in the 2001 general election, at which it had its best general election results to date.\nThe manifesto, entitled \"The Manicfesto\", for the 2005 general election featured the major commitment of their long held pledge to abolish income tax, citing as always that it was only meant to be a temporary measure during the Napoleonic Wars. Also included was another old staple, the \"Putting Parliament on Wheels\" idea of having Parliament sit throughout the country rather than solely in London\u00a0\u2013 with special emphasis this time in its creation negating the need for national/regional assemblies.\nThe OMRLP has fielded candidates since 2001, with reduced success and losing their deposits.\nThe OMRLP's official headquarters was originally the Golden Lion Hotel in Ashburton, Devon, then the Dog &amp; Partridge pub at Yateley in Hampshire, but this was lost shortly after the 2005 general election. Conference venues are now chosen in advance: the 2006 conference was held at Torrington in Devon, and the 2007 conference was held in Jersey. The conference was held in Blackpool in 2017.\nThe party's last elected representative was R. U. Seerius (formerly Jon Brewer) on the eleven-member Sawley Parish Council in Derbyshire, first elected (uncontested) in 2005. He was no longer a member as of May 2007, having failed to appear at no fewer than 11 statutory meetings during his time in office, due to illness.\nIn March 2007, the party's vice-president Melodie \"Boney Maroney\" Staniforth left the party, although she ran in the Kirklees election in April 2007. The OMRLP succeeded in standing in the two by-elections of 19 July 2007 in Sedgefield and Ealing Southall, but again achieving derisory results: Alan Hope acquiring 129 votes (0.46%) and John Cartwright taking 188 (0.51%), beating the English Democrats but coming behind the Christian Party of the Reverend George Hargreaves and David Braid.\nIn recognition that reforms were needed, Peter 'T.C.' Owen was moved from the honorary position of party chairman to that of deputy leader (and thus effective day-to-day leader) of the OMRLP, while Anthony \"The Jersey Flyer\" Blyth (owner of the Ommaroo Hotel and a member of the Jersey Heritage Trust) took over Owen's role. Owen is one of four Raving Loonies to have scored more than 1,000 votes in an election (he polled 2,859 votes in the 1994 European elections).\nOn 31 May 2017, Hope was interviewed by Andrew Neil on the BBC's \"Daily Politics\" programme.\nElectoral performance.\nIn 1987, the OMRLP won its first seat on Ashburton Town Council in Devon, as Alan \"Howling Laud\" Hope was elected unopposed. He subsequently became deputy mayor and later mayor of Ashburton in 1998 (mainly opposed by the local Conservatives; they allegedly never forgave him for becoming a member of the OMRLP) until he moved to Hampshire after Sutch's death. For over a decade, his hotel The Golden Lion in Ashburton (referred to by some in the party as \"The Mucky Mog\") was the party's headquarters and conference centre.\nTwo councillors subsequently became mayors: Alan Hope in Ashburton in Devon and Chris \"Screwy\" Driver on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.\nAt the Bootle by-election in May 1990, the Loony candidate (Sutch) received more votes than the candidate for the continuing Social Democrats. The story was a major headline in many UK newspapers; ironically, the by-election itself had attracted little coverage. Bootle is still regarded by the party as their most significant result in politics, albeit one largely lampooning the political world.\nIn the 1995 Perth and Kinross by-election, the OMRLP received more votes than the United Kingdom Independence Party and the Scottish Greens. In the 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, the OMRLP candidate Lady Lily the Pink polled more votes than UKIP. The party fielded 24 candidates and won a record number of votes in the 2019 general election, when it polled 9,739 votes, the party's highest vote at a general election.\nThe party has yet to save its deposit at a by-election by winning at least 5% of the vote, although Screaming Lord Sutch came close at the 1994 Rotherham by-election as the party's leader, winning 4.2% of the vote.\nBy-elections.\n48th Parliament\n49th Parliament\n50th Parliament\n51st Parliament\n52nd Parliament\n53rd Parliament\n54th Parliament\n55th Parliament\n56th Parliament\n57th Parliament\n58th Parliament\nParish and town councillors.\nAs of 2021, the party has seven parish and town councillors, one via the Molesey Residents Association.\n2010 William Hill branding.\nFor the 2010 general election, the OMRLP used the description \"Monster Raving Loony William Hill Party\", which was met with criticism by some members, with John Cartwright, Loony candidate in Croydon, publicly stating: \"I am not and will not be a mercenary, or an advert, for a commercial company during the course of the election campaign.\"\nMembership.\nThe statement of accounts for the period 1 January to 31 December 2008 outlines membership at 1,354, made up of 173 paying members and 1,181 \"lifetime but non-paying\". It currently costs \u00a315 per year for membership, which includes a party rosette, a certificate of insanity, a Loony badge, a party membership card and a letter from the party's leader. A \u00a320.00 membership is available for those overseas.\nSir Patrick Moore (1923\u20132012), the British TV amateur astronomer, was the finance minister of the party for a short time. He once said that the Monster Raving Loony Party \"had an advantage over all the other parties, in that they knew they were loonies\".\nIn 1992, the Glasgow band Hugh Reed and the Velvet Underpants released the song \"Vote Monster Raving Looney\", despite not having any actual ties to the party.\nPolicies and electoral strategy.\nThe OMRLP are distinguished by having a deliberately bizarre manifesto, which contains things that seem to be impossible or too absurd to implement \u2013 usually to highlight what they see as real-life absurdities. Despite its satirical nature, some of the things that have featured in Loony manifestos have actually become law, such as \"passports for pets\", abolition of dog licences and all-day pub openings.\nOther suggestions so far unadopted included minting a 99p coin and forbidding greyhound racing in order to \"stop the country going to the dogs\".\nThe Loonies generally field as many candidates as possible in United Kingdom general elections, some (but by no means all) standing under ridiculous names they have adopted via deed poll. Sutch himself stood against all three main party leaders (John Major, Neil Kinnock and Paddy Ashdown) in the 1992 general election. Parliamentary candidates have to pay their own deposit (which currently stands at \u00a3500) and cover all of their expenses. No OMRLP candidate has managed to get the required 5% of the popular vote needed to retain their deposit, but this does not stop people standing. Sutch came closest with 4.2% and over 1,100 votes at the 1994 Rotherham by-election, while Stuart Hughes still holds the record for the largest number of votes for a Loony candidate at a Parliamentary election, with 1,442 at the 1992 general election in the Honiton seat in east Devon. The all-time highest vote achieved was by comedian Danny Blue, who secured 3,339 votes in the 1994 European elections under the pseudonym of \"John Major\". Bamford had also acted as an election agent for Lindi St Clair's rival Corrective Party, and was a former close associate of Stuart Hughes.\nIn the run-up to the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum, the party adopted an equivocal stance, advising its supporters, on 8 April, to \"vote as you see fit\". In response to mainstream parties debating Brexit, the OMRLP suggested sending Noel Edmonds to the European Parliament \"because he understands Deal or No Deal\". It has advocated an \"al dente Brexit\" rather than a hard or soft Brexit.\nIn popular culture.\nScreaming Lord Sutch appeared as himself in the opening episode of television sitcom \"The New Statesman\", standing for election in the seat of Haltemprice, which was won by Alan B'Stard for the Conservative Party. Sutch and his party polled second, ahead of Labour and the SDP.\nThe party's regular appearances at by-elections were satirised in the \"Blackadder the Third\" episode \"Dish and Dishonesty\", with a candidate from the Standing at the Back Dressed Stupidly and Looking Stupid Party standing as one of Baldrick's rivals in a by-election held in a rotten borough.\nA candidate was shown canvassing for a by-election on the \"One Foot in the Grave\" episode \"I'll Retire to Bedlam\" where a regional news programme filmed him knocking on the Meldrews' door. He explained the nature of the party, that they had some clearly set out policies, and that people could choose to vote for them as a protest vote; all while dressed vaguely as a bee. Later in the episode, another candidate for one of the major parties was shaking hands with patients in hospital, then came up to Victor to shake his hand and asked if Victor would be voting for him. Victor replied that he would be voting for the Monster Raving Loony Party and that he found their political platform the most sensible of all the major parties.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n32.

{"id": "22594", "revid": "50837694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22594", "title": "Omega\u22123 fatty acid", "text": "Class of polyunsaturated fatty acids\nomega\u22123 oils, \u03c9\u22123 fatty acids or \"n\"\u22123 fatty acids, are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) characterized by the presence of a double bond three atoms away from the terminal methyl group (numbered \u03c9, the last letter of the Greek alphabet) in their chemical structure. They are widely distributed in nature, are important constituents of animal lipid metabolism, and play an important role in the human diet and in human physiology. The three types of omega\u22123 fatty acids involved in human physiology are \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA can be found in plants, while DHA and EPA are found in algae and fish. Marine algae and phytoplankton are primary sources of omega\u22123 fatty acids. DHA and EPA accumulate in fish that eat these algae. Common sources of plant oils containing ALA include walnuts, edible seeds and flaxseeds as well as hempseed oil, while sources of EPA and DHA include fish and fish oils, and algae oil.\nAlmost without exception, animals are unable to synthesize the essential omega\u22123 fatty acid ALA and can only obtain it through diet. However, they can use ALA, when available, to form EPA and DHA, by creating additional double bonds along its carbon chain (desaturation) and extending it (elongation). ALA (18 carbons and 3 double bonds) is used to make EPA (20 carbons and 5 double bonds), which is then used to make DHA (22 carbons and 6 double bonds). The ability to make the longer-chain omega\u22123 fatty acids from ALA may be impaired in aging. In foods exposed to air, unsaturated fatty acids are vulnerable to oxidation and rancidity.\nOmega\u22123 fatty acid supplementation has limited evidence of benefit in preventing cancer, all-cause mortality and most cardiovascular outcomes, although it modestly lowers blood pressure and reduces triglycerides. Since 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four fish oil-based prescription drugs for the management of hypertriglyceridemia, namely Lovaza, Omtryg (both omega-3-acid ethyl esters), Vascepa (ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid) and Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids).\nHistory.\nIn 1929, George and Mildred Burr discovered that fatty acids were critical to health. If fatty acids were absent from the diet, a life-threatening deficiency syndrome ensued. The Burrs coined the phrase \"essential fatty acids\". Since then, researchers have shown a growing interest in unsaturated essential fatty acids as they form the framework for the organism's cell membranes. Subsequently, awareness of the health benefits of essential fatty acids has dramatically increased since the 1980s.\nOn 8 September 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave \"qualified health claim\" status to EPA and DHA omega\u22123 fatty acids, stating, \"supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA [omega\u22123] fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease\". This updated and modified their health risk advice letter of 2001 (see below).\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency has recognized the importance of DHA omega\u22123 and permits the following claim for DHA: \"DHA, an omega\u22123 fatty acid, supports the normal physical development of the brain, eyes and nerves primarily in children under two years of age.\"\nHistorically, whole food diets contained sufficient amounts of omega\u22123, but because omega\u22123 is readily oxidized, the trend toward shelf-stable processed foods has led to a deficiency in omega\u22123 in manufactured foods.\nNomenclature.\nThe terms \"\u03c9\u22123 (\"omega\u22123\") fatty acid\" and \"n\u22123 fatty acid\" are derived from the nomenclature of organic chemistry. One way in which an unsaturated fatty acid is named is determined by the location, in its carbon chain, of the double bond which is closest to the methyl end of the molecule. In general terminology, \"n\" (or \u03c9) represents the locant of the methyl end of the molecule, while the number \"n\u2212x\" (or \u03c9\u2212\"x\") refers to the locant of its nearest double bond. Thus, in omega\"\u2212\"3 fatty acids in particular, there is a double bond located at the carbon numbered 3, starting from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. This classification scheme is useful since most chemical changes occur at the carboxyl end of the molecule, while the methyl group and its nearest double bond are unchanged in most chemical or enzymatic reactions.\nIn the expressions \"n\u2212x\" or \u03c9\u2212\"x\", the symbol is a minus sign rather than a hyphen (or dash), although it is never read as such. Also, the symbol \"n\" (or \u03c9) represents the locant of the methyl end, counted from the carboxyl end of the fatty acid carbon chain. For instance, in an omega\u22123 fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms (see illustration), where the methyl end is at location 18 from the carboxyl end, \"n\" (or \u03c9) represents the number 18, and the notation \"n\"\u22123 (or \u03c9\u22123) represents the subtraction 18\u22123 = 15, where 15 is the locant of the double bond which is closest to the methyl end, counted from the carboxyl end of the chain.\nAlthough \"n\" and \u03c9 (omega) are synonymous, the IUPAC recommends that \"n\" be used to identify the highest carbon number of a fatty acid. Nevertheless, the more common name \u2013 omega\"\u2212\"3 fatty acid \u2013 is used in both the lay media and scientific literature.\nExample.\nFor example, \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA; illustration) is an 18-carbon chain having three double bonds, the first located at the third carbon from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. Hence, it is an omega\"\u2212\"3 fatty acid. Counting from the other end of the chain, that is the carboxyl end, the three double bonds are located at carbons 9, 12, and 15. These three locants are typically indicated as \u03949c, \u039412c, \u039415c, or cis\u03949, cis\u039412, cis\u039415, or cis-cis-cis-\u03949,12,15, where \"c\" or \"cis\" means that the double bonds have a \"cis\" configuration.\n\u03b1-Linolenic acid is polyunsaturated (containing more than one double bond) and is also described by a lipid number, 18:3, meaning that there are 18 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds.\nChemistry.\nAn omega\u22123 fatty acid is a fatty acid with multiple double bonds, where the first double bond is between the third and fourth carbon atoms from the end of the carbon atom chain. \"Short-chain\" omega\u22123 fatty acids have a chain of 18 carbon atoms or less, while \"long-chain\" omega\u22123 fatty acids have a chain of 20 or more.\nThree omega\u22123 fatty acids are important in human physiology, \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3, \"n\"\u22123; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, \"n\"\u22123; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, \"n\"\u22123; DHA). These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5, or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18, 20, or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. As with most naturally-produced fatty acids, all double bonds are in the \"cis\"-configuration, in other words, the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond; and the double bonds are interrupted by methylene bridges (), so that there are two single bonds between each pair of adjacent double bonds.\nThe atoms at bis-allylic (between double bonds) sites are prone to oxidation by free radicals. Replacement of hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms in this location protects the omega\u22123 fatty acid from lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.\nList of omega\u22123 fatty acids.\nThis table lists several different names for the most common omega\u22123 fatty acids found in nature.\nForms.\nOmega\u22123 fatty acids occur naturally in two forms, triglycerides and phospholipids. In the triglycerides, they, together with other fatty acids, are bonded to glycerol; three fatty acids are attached to glycerol. Phospholipid omega\u22123 is composed of two fatty acids attached to a phosphate group via glycerol.\nThe triglycerides can be converted to the free fatty acid or to methyl or ethyl esters, and the individual esters of omega\u22123 fatty acids are available.\nMechanism of action.\nThe 'essential' fatty acids were given their name when researchers found that they are essential to normal growth in young children and animals. The omega\u22123 fatty acid DHA, also known as docosahexaenoic acid, is found in high abundance in the human brain. It is produced by a desaturation process, but humans lack the desaturase enzyme, which acts to insert double bonds at the \u03c96 and \u03c93 position. Therefore, the \u03c96 and \u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be synthesized, are appropriately called essential fatty acids, and must be obtained from the diet.\nIn 1964, it was discovered that enzymes found in sheep tissues convert omega\u22126 arachidonic acid into the inflammatory agent, prostaglandin E2, which is involved in the immune response of traumatized and infected tissues. By 1979, eicosanoids were further identified, including thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes. The eicosanoids typically have a short period of activity in the body, starting with synthesis from fatty acids and ending with metabolism by enzymes. If the rate of synthesis exceeds the rate of metabolism, the excess eicosanoids may have deleterious effects. Researchers found that certain omega\u22123 fatty acids are also converted into eicosanoids and docosanoids, but at a slower rate. If both omega\u22123 and omega\u22126 fatty acids are present, they will \"compete\" to be transformed, so the ratio of long-chain omega\u22123:omega\u22126 fatty acids directly affects the type of eicosanoids that are produced.\nInterconversion.\nConversion efficiency of ALA to EPA and DHA.\nHumans can convert short-chain omega\u22123 fatty acids to long-chain forms (EPA, DHA) with an efficiency below 5%. The omega\u22123 conversion efficiency is greater in women than in men, but less studied. Higher ALA and DHA values found in plasma phospholipids of women may be due to the higher activity of desaturases, especially that of delta-6-desaturase.\nThese conversions occur competitively with omega\u22126 fatty acids, which are essential closely related chemical analogues that are derived from linoleic acid. They both utilize the same desaturase and elongase proteins in order to synthesize inflammatory regulatory proteins. The products of both pathways are vital for growth, making a balanced diet of omega\u22123 and omega\u22126 important to an individual's health. A balanced intake ratio of 1:1 was believed to be ideal in order for proteins to be able to synthesize both pathways sufficiently, but this has been controversial as of recent research.\nThe conversion of ALA to EPA and further to DHA in humans has been reported to be limited, but varies with individuals. Women have higher ALA-to-DHA conversion efficiency than men, which is presumed to be due to the lower rate of use of dietary ALA for beta-oxidation. One preliminary study showed that EPA can be increased by lowering the amount of dietary linoleic acid, and DHA can be increased by elevating intake of dietary ALA.\nOmega\u22126 to omega\u22123 ratio.\nHuman diet has changed rapidly in recent centuries resulting in a reported increased diet of omega\u22126 in comparison to omega\u22123. The rapid evolution of human diet away from a 1:1 omega\u22123 and omega\u22126 ratio, such as during the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, has presumably been too fast for humans to have adapted to biological profiles adept at balancing omega\u22123 and omega\u22126 ratios of 1:1. This is commonly believed to be the reason why modern diets are correlated with many inflammatory disorders. While omega\u22123 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be beneficial in preventing heart disease in humans, the level of omega\u22126 polyunsaturated fatty acids (and, therefore, the ratio) does not matter.\nBoth omega\u22126 and omega\u22123 fatty acids are essential: humans must consume them in their diet. Omega\u22126 and omega\u22123 eighteen-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids compete for the same metabolic enzymes, thus the omega\u22126:omega\u22123 ratio of ingested fatty acids has significant influence on the ratio and rate of production of eicosanoids, a group of hormones intimately involved in the body's inflammatory and homeostatic processes, which include the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes, among others. Altering this ratio can change the body's metabolic and inflammatory state.\nMetabolites of omega\u22126 are more inflammatory (esp. arachidonic acid) than those of omega\u22123. However, in terms of heart health, omega\u22126 fatty acids are less harmful than they are presumed to be. A meta-analysis of six randomized trials found that replacing saturated fat with omega\u22126 fats reduced the risk of coronary events by 24%.\nA healthy ratio of omega\u22126 to omega\u22123 is needed; healthy ratios, according to some authors, range from 1:1 to 1:4. Other authors believe that a ratio of 4:1 (4 times as much omega\u22126 as omega\u22123) is already healthy.\nTypical Western diets provide ratios of between 10:1 and 30:1 (i.e., dramatically higher levels of omega\u22126 than omega\u22123). The ratios of omega\u22126 to omega\u22123 fatty acids in some common vegetable oils are: canola 2:1, hemp 2\u20133:1, soybean 7:1, olive 3\u201313:1, sunflower (no omega\u22123), flax 1:3, cottonseed (almost no omega\u22123), peanut (no omega\u22123), grapeseed oil (almost no omega\u22123) and corn oil 46:1.\nBiochemistry.\nTransporters.\nDHA in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine is transported into the brain by a membrane transport protein, MFSD2A, which is exclusively expressed in the endothelium of the blood\u2013brain barrier.\nDietary sources.\nDietary recommendations.\nIn the United States, the Institute of Medicine publishes a system of Dietary Reference Intakes, which includes Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for individual nutrients, and Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs) for certain groups of nutrients, such as fats. When there is insufficient evidence to determine an RDA, the institute may publish an Adequate Intake (AI) instead, which has a similar meaning but is less certain. The AI for \u03b1-linolenic acid is 1.6\u00a0grams/day for men and 1.1\u00a0grams/day for women, while the AMDR is 0.6% to 1.2% of total energy. Because the physiological potency of EPA and DHA is much greater than that of ALA, it is not possible to estimate one AMDR for all omega\u22123 fatty acids. Approximately 10 percent of the AMDR can be consumed as EPA and/or DHA. The Institute of Medicine has not established a RDA or AI for EPA, DHA or the combination, so there is no Daily Value (DVs are derived from RDAs), no labeling of foods or supplements as providing a DV percentage of these fatty acids per serving, and no labeling a food or supplement as an excellent source, or \"High in...\" As for safety, there was insufficient evidence as of 2005 to set an upper tolerable limit for omega\u22123 fatty acids, although the FDA has advised that adults can safely consume up to a total of 3\u00a0grams per day of combined DHA and EPA, with no more than 2\u00a0g from dietary supplements.\nThe European Commission sponsored a working group to develop recommendations on dietary fat intake in pregnancy and lactation. In 2008, the working group published consensus recommendations, including the following:\nHowever, the seafood supply to meet these recommendations is currently too low in most European countries and if met would be unsustainable.\nIn the EU, the EFSA publishes the Dietary Reference Values (DRVs), recommending Adequate Intake values for EPA+DHA and DHA:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^1 AI, Adequate Intake\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^2 i.e. the second half of the first year of life (from the beginning of the 7th month to the 1st birthday)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^3 in addition to combined intakes of EPA and DHA of 250 mg/day\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) has made recommendations for EPA and DHA due to their cardiovascular benefits: individuals with no history of coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction should consume oily fish two times per week; and \"Treatment is reasonable\" for those having been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. For the latter the AHA does not recommend a specific amount of EPA + DHA, although it notes that most trials were at or close to 1000\u00a0mg/day. The benefit appears to be on the order of a 9% decrease in relative risk. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved a claim \"EPA and DHA contributes to the normal function of the heart\" for products that contain at least 250\u00a0mg EPA + DHA. The report did not address the issue of people with pre-existing heart disease. The World Health Organization recommends regular fish consumption (1-2 servings per week, equivalent to 200 to 500\u00a0mg/day EPA + DHA) as protective against coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke.\nContamination.\nHeavy metal poisoning from consuming fish oil supplements is highly unlikely, because heavy metals (mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic, and cadmium) selectively bind with protein in the fish flesh rather than accumulate in the oil.\nHowever, other contaminants (PCBs, furans, dioxins, and PBDEs) might be found, especially in less-refined fish oil supplements.\nThroughout their history, the Council for Responsible Nutrition and the World Health Organization have published acceptability standards regarding contaminants in fish oil. The most stringent current standard is the International Fish Oils Standard. Fish oils that are molecularly distilled under vacuum typically make this highest-grade; levels of contaminants are stated in parts per billion per trillion.\nRancidity.\nA 2022 study found that a number of products on the market used oxidised oils, with the rancidity often masked by flavourings. Another study in 2015 found that an average of 20% of products had excess oxidation. Whether rancid fish oil is harmful remains unclear. Some studies show that highly oxidised fish oil can have a negative impact on cholesterol levels. Animal testing showed that high doses have toxic effects. Furthermore, rancid oil is likely to be less effective than fresh fish oil.\nFish.\nThe most widely available dietary source of EPA and DHA is oily fish, such as (ranked by grams per serving): salmon, herring, sardines, mackerel, anchovies, and trout. Although fish are a dietary source of omega\u22123 fatty acids, fish do not synthesize omega\u22123 fatty acids, but rather obtain them via their food supply, including algae or plankton.\nIn order for farmed marine fish to have amounts of EPA and DHA comparable to those of wild-caught fish, their feed must be supplemented with EPA and DHA, most commonly in the form of fish oil. For this reason, 81% of the global fish oil supply in 2009 was consumed by aquaculture.\nFish oil.\nMarine and freshwater fish oil vary in content of arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA. They also differ in their effects on organ lipids.\nNot all forms of fish oil may be equally digestible. Of four studies that compare bioavailability of the glyceryl ester form of fish oil vs. the ethyl ester form, two have concluded the natural glyceryl ester form is better, and the other two studies did not find a significant difference. No studies have shown the ethyl ester form to be superior, although it is cheaper to manufacture. \nKrill.\nKrill oil is a source of omega\u22123 fatty acids. The effect of krill oil, at a lower dose of EPA + DHA (62.8%), was demonstrated to be similar to that of fish oil on blood lipid levels and markers of inflammation in healthy humans. While not an endangered species, krill are a mainstay of the diets of many ocean-based species including whales, causing environmental and scientific concerns about their sustainability.\nPreliminary studies indicate that the DHA and EPA omega\u22123 fatty acids found in krill oil are more bio-available than in fish oil. Additionally, krill oil contains astaxanthin, a marine-source keto-carotenoid antioxidant that may act synergistically with EPA and DHA.\nPlant sources.\nLinseed (or flaxseed) (\"Linum usitatissimum\") and its oil are perhaps the most widely available botanical source of the omega\u22123 fatty acid ALA. Flaxseed oil consists of approximately 55% ALA, which makes it six times richer than most fish oils in omega\u22123 fatty acids. A portion of this is converted by the body to EPA and DHA, though the actual converted percentage may differ between men and women.\nThe longer-chain EPA and DHA are only naturally made by marine algae and phytoplankton. The microalgae \"Crypthecodinium cohnii\" and \"Schizochytrium\" are rich sources of DHA, but not EPA, and can be produced commercially in bioreactors for use as food additives. Oil from brown algae (kelp) is a source of EPA. The alga \"Nannochloropsis\" also has high levels of EPA.\nSome transgenic initiatives have transferred the ability to make EPA and DHA into existing high-yielding crop species of land plants:\nEggs.\nEggs produced by hens fed a diet of greens and insects contain higher levels of omega\u22123 fatty acids than those produced by chickens fed corn or soybeans. In addition to feeding chickens insects and greens, fish oils may be added to their diets to increase the omega\u22123 fatty acid concentrations in eggs.\nThe addition of flax and canola seeds, both good sources of alpha-linolenic acid, to the diets of laying chickens, increases the omega\u22123 content of the eggs, predominantly DHA. However, this enrichment could lead to an increment of lipid oxidation in the eggs if the seeds are used in higher doses, without using an appropriate antioxidant.\nThe addition of green algae or seaweed to the diets boosts the content of DHA and EPA, which are the forms of omega\u22123 approved by the FDA for medical claims. A common consumer complaint is \"Omega\u22123 eggs can sometimes have a fishy taste if the hens are fed marine oils\".\nMeat.\nOmega\u22123 fatty acids are formed in the chloroplasts of green leaves and algae. While seaweeds and algae are the sources of omega\u22123 fatty acids present in fish, grass is the source of omega\u22123 fatty acids present in grass-fed animals. When cattle are taken off omega\u22123 fatty acid-rich grass and shipped to a feedlot to be fattened on omega\u22123 fatty acid deficient grain, they begin losing their store of this beneficial fat. Each day that an animal spends in the feedlot, the amount of omega\u22123 fatty acids in its meat is diminished.\nThe omega\u22126:omega\u22123 ratio of grass-fed beef is about 2:1, making it a more useful source of omega\u22123 than grain-fed beef, which usually has a ratio of 4:1.\nIn a 2009 joint study by the USDA and researchers at Clemson University in South Carolina, grass-fed beef was compared with grain-finished beef. The researchers found that grass-finished beef is higher in moisture content, 42.5% lower total lipid content, 54% lower in total fatty acids, 54% higher in beta-carotene, 288% higher in vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), higher in the B-vitamins thiamin and riboflavin, higher in the minerals calcium, magnesium, and potassium, 193% higher in total omega\u22123s, 117% higher in CLA (cis-9, trans-11 octadecenoic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid, which is a potential cancer fighter), 90% higher in vaccenic acid (which can be transformed into CLA), lower in the saturated fats, and has a healthier ratio of omega\u22126 to omega\u22123 fatty acids (1.65 vs 4.84). Protein and cholesterol content were equal.\nThe omega\u22123 content of chicken meat may be enhanced by increasing the animals' dietary intake of grains high in omega\u22123, such as flax, chia, and canola.\nKangaroo meat is also a source of omega\u22123, with fillet and steak containing 74\u00a0mg per 100\u00a0g of raw meat.\nSeal oil.\nSeal oil is a source of EPA, DPA, and DHA, and is commonly used in Arctic regions. According to Health Canada, it helps to support the development of the brain, eyes, and nerves in children up to 12 years of age. Like all seal products, it is not allowed to be imported into the European Union.\nA Canadian company, FeelGood Natural Health, pleaded guilty in 2023 to illegally selling seal oil capsules to American consumers. The company sold over 900 bottles of the capsules, worth over $10,000. Seal oil is made from the blubber of dead seals, and is illegal to sell in the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The global population of harp seals stands at around 7 million, and they have been hunted in Canada for thousands of years. FeelGood was sentenced to pay a fine of $20,000 and three years of probation.\nOther sources.\nA trend in the early 21st century was to fortify food with omega\u22123 fatty acids.\nResearch.\nThe association between supplementation and a lower risk of all-cause mortality is inconclusive.\nCancer.\nThere is insufficient evidence that supplementation with omega\u22123 fatty acids has an effect on different cancers. Omega\u22123 supplements do not improve body weight, muscle maintenance or quality of life in cancer patients.\nCardiovascular disease.\nModerate and high quality evidence from a 2020 review showed that EPA and DHA, such as that found in omega\u22123 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements, does not appear to improve mortality or cardiovascular health. There is weak evidence indicating that \u03b1-linolenic acid may be associated with a small reduction in the risk of a cardiovascular event or the risk of arrhythmia.\nA 2018 meta-analysis found no support that daily intake of one gram of omega\u22123 fatty acid in individuals with a history of coronary heart disease prevents fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction or any other vascular event. However, omega\u22123 fatty acid supplementation greater than one gram daily for at least a year may be protective against cardiac death, sudden death, and myocardial infarction in people who have a history of cardiovascular disease. No protective effect against the development of stroke or all-cause mortality was seen in this population. A 2021 meta-analysis found that supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease.\nFish oil supplementation has not been shown to benefit revascularization or abnormal heart rhythms and has no effect on heart failure hospital admission rates. Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes. In the EU, a review by the European Medicines Agency of omega\u22123 fatty acid medicines containing a combination of an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid at a dose of 1 g per day concluded that these medicines are not effective in secondary prevention of heart problems in people who have had a myocardial infarction.\nEvidence suggests that omega\u22123 fatty acids modestly lower blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) in people with hypertension and in people with normal blood pressure. The American Heart Association position (2019) is that omega\u22123 fatty acid supplementation at a dose of 4 grams per day may be effective for reducing levels of blood triglycerides as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Since 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four fish oil-based prescription drugs for the management of hypertriglyceridemia, namely Lovaza, Omtryg (both omega-3-acid ethyl esters), Vascepa (ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid), and Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids). \nA 2019 review found that omega\u22123 fatty acid supplements make little or no difference to cardiovascular mortality and that people with myocardial infarction have no benefit in taking the supplements. A 2021 review found that omega\u22123 supplementation did not affect cardiovascular disease outcomes.\nA 2021 review concluded that use of omega\u22123 supplements was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in people having high blood triglycerides. A meta-analysis showed that use of marine omega\u22123 supplementation was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, with the risk appearing to increase for doses greater than one gram per day.\nChronic kidney disease.\nIn people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require hemodialysis, vascular blockage due to clotting may prevent dialysis therapy. Omega\u22123 fatty acids contribute to the production of eicosanoid molecules that reduce clotting. However, a Cochrane review in 2018 did not find clear evidence that omega\u22123 supplementation has any impact on the prevention of vascular blockage in people with CKD. There was also moderate certainty that supplementation did not prevent hospitalisation or death within a 12-month period.\nStroke.\nA 2022 Cochrane review of controlled trials did not find clear evidence that marine-derived omega\u22123 supplementation improves cognitive and physical recovery or social, and emotional wellbeing following stroke diagnosis, nor prevents stroke recurrence and mortality. In this review, mood appeared to worsen slightly among those receiving 3g fish oil supplementation for 12 weeks; psychometric scores changed by 1.41 (0.07 to 2.75) points less than those receiving palm and soy oil. However, this represented only a single small study and was not observed in a study lasting more than 3 months. Overall, the review was limited by the small amount of high-quality evidence available.\nInflammation.\nA 2013 systematic review found tentative evidence of benefit for lowering inflammation levels in healthy adults and in people with one or more biomarkers of metabolic syndrome. Consumption of omega\u22123 fatty acids from marine sources lowers blood markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and TNF alpha.\nFor rheumatoid arthritis, one systematic review found consistent but modest evidence for the effect of marine n\u22123 PUFAs on symptoms such as \"joint swelling and pain, duration of morning stiffness, global assessments of pain and disease activity\" as well as the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The American College of Rheumatology has stated that there may be modest benefit from the use of fish oils, but that it may take months for effects to be seen, and cautions for possible gastrointestinal side effects and the possibility of the supplements containing mercury or vitamin A at toxic levels. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has concluded that \"supplements containing omega\u22123 fatty acids... may help relieve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms\" but warns that such supplements \"may interact with drugs that affect blood clotting\".\nDevelopmental disabilities.\nOne meta-analysis concluded that omega\u22123 fatty acid supplementation demonstrated a modest effect for improving ADHD symptoms. A Cochrane review of PUFA (not necessarily omega\u22123) supplementation found \"there is little evidence that PUFA supplementation provides any benefit for the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents\", while a different review found \"insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion about the use of PUFAs for children with specific learning disorders\". Another review concluded that the evidence is inconclusive for the use of omega\u22123 fatty acids in behavior and non-neurodegenerative neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD and depression.\nA 2018 Cochrane systematic review with moderate to high quality of evidence suggested that omega\u22123 fatty acids may reduce risk of perinatal death, risk of low body weight babies; and possibly mildly increased LGA babies.\nA 2021 umbrella review with moderate to high quality of evidence suggested that \"omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy can exert favorable effects against pre-eclampsia, low-birth weight, pre-term delivery, and post-partum depression, and can improve anthropometric measures, immune system, and visual activity in infants and cardiometabolic risk factors in pregnant mothers.\"\nDepressive disorders.\nA 2019 review found that omega\u22123 polyunsaturated fatty acids\u2014particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)\u2014had evidence for use as an adjunctive treatment of depression. The review noted that effects vary by formulation, population, and treatment duration, and are influenced by publication bias.\nA 2021 systematic review concluded that despite widespread belief in their benefits, long-chain omega\u22123 (EPA and DHA) supplements likely have little or no effect on preventing or treating depression or anxiety. A 2021 Cochrane review concluded that current evidence suggests that omega\u22123 supplements may have a small, statistically detectable but not clinically meaningful effect on major depressive disorder, with low to very low certainty and high variability across studies.\nTwo reviews have suggested that omega\u22123 fatty acid supplementation improves depressive symptoms in perinatal women. \nCognitive aging.\nA 2016 review found no convincing evidence for the use of omega\u20103 PUFA supplements in treatment of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. There is preliminary evidence of effect on mild cognitive problems, but none supporting an effect in healthy people or those with dementia. A 2020 review suggested that omega\u22123 supplementation has no effect on global cognitive function, but has a mild benefit in improving memory in non-demented adults.\nA 2020 review concluded that long-chain omega\u22123 supplements do not deter cognitive decline in older adults.\nBrain and visual functions.\nA major structural component of the mammalian brain, DHA is the most abundant omega\u22123 fatty acid in the brain. Omega\u22123 PUFA supplementation has no effect on macular degeneration or development of visual loss.\nAsthma.\nAs of 2015, there was no evidence that taking omega\u22123 supplements can prevent asthma attacks in children.\nDiabetes.\nA 2019 review found that omega\u22123 supplements have no effect on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. A 2021 meta-analysis found that supplementation with omega\u22123 had positive effects on diabetes biomarkers, such as fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance.\nMethodological issues.\nIn contrast to dietary supplementation studies, there is significant difficulty in interpreting the literature regarding dietary intake of omega\u22123 fatty acids (e.g. from fish) due to participant recall and systematic differences in diets. There is also controversy as to the efficacy of omega\u22123, with many meta-analyses finding heterogeneity among results which can be explained mostly by publication bias. A significant correlation between shorter treatment trials was associated with increased omega\u22123 efficacy for treating depressed symptoms, further implicating bias in publication.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "22595", "revid": "34174371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22595", "title": "Ore", "text": "Rock with valuable metals, minerals and elements\nOre is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically including metals, concentrated above background levels, and that is economically viable to mine and process. Ore grade refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. The value of the metals or minerals a rock contains must be weighed against the cost of extraction to determine whether it is of sufficiently high grade to be worth mining and is therefore considered an ore. A complex ore is one containing more than one valuable mineral.\nMinerals of interest are generally oxides, sulfides, silicates, or native metals such as copper or gold. Ore bodies are formed by a variety of geological processes generally referred to as ore genesis and can be classified based on their deposit type. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. Some ores, depending on their composition, may pose threats to health or surrounding ecosystems.\nThe word ore is of Anglo-Saxon origin, meaning \"lump of metal\".\nGangue and tailings.\nIn most cases, an ore does not consist entirely of a single mineral, but is mixed with other valuable minerals and with unwanted or valueless rocks and minerals. The part of an ore that is not economically desirable and that cannot be avoided in mining is known as gangue. The valuable ore minerals are separated from the gangue minerals by froth flotation, gravity concentration, electric or magnetic methods, and other operations known collectively as mineral processing or ore dressing.\nMineral processing consists of first liberation, to free the ore from the gangue, and concentration to separate the desired mineral(s) from it. Once processed, the gangue is known as tailings, which are useless but potentially harmful materials produced in great quantity, especially from lower grade deposits.\nOre deposits.\nAn ore deposit is an economically significant accumulation of minerals within a host rock. This is distinct from a mineral resource in that it is a mineral deposit occurring in high enough concentration to be economically viable. An ore deposit is one occurrence of a particular ore type. Most ore deposits are named according to their location, or after a discoverer (e.g. the Kambalda nickel shoots are named after drillers), or after some whimsy, a historical figure, a prominent person, a city or town from which the owner came, something from mythology (such as the name of a god or goddess) or the code name of the resource company which found it (e.g. MKD-5 was the in-house name for the Mount Keith nickel sulphide deposit).\nClassification.\nOre deposits are classified according to various criteria developed via the study of economic geology, or ore genesis. The following is a general categorization of the main ore deposit types:\nMagmatic deposits.\nMagmatic deposits are ones which originate directly from magma\nMetamorphic deposits.\nThese are ore deposits which form as a direct result of metamorphism.\nPorphyry copper deposits.\nThese are the leading source of copper ore. Porphyry copper deposits form along convergent boundaries and are thought to originate from the partial melting of subducted oceanic plates and subsequent concentration of Cu, driven by oxidation. These are large, round, disseminated deposits containing on average 0.8% copper by weight.\nHydrothermal Hydrothermal deposits are a large source of ore. They form as a result of the precipitation of dissolved ore constituents out of fluids.\nSedimentary deposits.\nLaterites form from the weathering of highly mafic rock near the equator. They can form in as little as one million years and are a source of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and aluminum (Al). They may also be a source of nickel and cobalt when the parent rock is enriched in these elements.\nBanded iron formations (BIFs) are the highest concentration of any single metal available. They are composed of chert beds alternating between high and low iron concentrations. Their deposition occurred early in Earth's history when the atmospheric composition was significantly different from today. Iron rich water is thought to have upwelled where it oxidized to Fe (III) in the presence of early photosynthetic plankton producing oxygen. This iron then precipitated out and deposited on the ocean floor. The banding is thought to be a result of changing plankton population.\nSediment Hosted Copper forms from the precipitation of a copper rich oxidized brine into sedimentary rocks. These are a source of copper primarily in the form of copper-sulfide minerals.\nPlacer deposits are the result of weathering, transport, and subsequent concentration of a valuable mineral via water or wind. They are typically sources of gold (Au), platinum group elements (PGE), sulfide minerals, tin (Sn), tungsten (W), and rare-earth elements (REEs). A placer deposit is considered alluvial if formed via river, colluvial if by gravity, and eluvial when close to their parent rock.\nManganese nodules.\nPolymetallic nodules, also called manganese nodules, are mineral concretions on the sea floor formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. They are formed by a combination of diagenetic and sedimentary precipitation at the estimated rate of about a centimeter over several million years. The average diameter of a polymetallic nodule is between 3 and 10\u00a0cm (1 and 4 in) in diameter and are characterized by enrichment in iron, manganese, heavy metals, and rare earth element content when compared to the Earth's crust and surrounding sediment. The proposed mining of these nodules via remotely operated ocean floor trawling robots has raised a number of ecological concerns.\nExtraction.\nThe extraction of ore deposits generally follows these steps. Progression from stages 1\u20133 will see a continuous disqualification of potential ore bodies as more information is obtained on their viability:\nWith rates of ore discovery in a steady decline since the mid 20th century, it is thought that most surface level, easily accessible sources have been exhausted. This means progressively lower grade deposits must be turned to, and new methods of extraction must be developed.\nHazards.\nSome ores contain heavy metals, toxins, radioactive isotopes and other potentially negative compounds which may pose a risk to the environment or health. The exact effects an ore and its tailings have is dependent on the minerals present. Tailings of particular concern are those of older mines, as containment and remediation methods in the past were next to non-existent, leading to high levels of leaching into the surrounding environment. Mercury and arsenic are two ore related elements of particular concern. Additional elements found in ore which may have adverse health affects in organisms include iron, lead, uranium, zinc, silicon, titanium, sulfur, nitrogen, platinum, and chromium. Exposure to these elements may result in respiratory and cardiovascular problems and neurological issues. These are of particular danger to aquatic life if dissolved in water. Ores such as those of sulphide minerals may severely increase the acidity of their immediate surroundings and of water, with numerous, long lasting impacts on ecosystems. When water becomes contaminated it may transport these compounds far from the tailings site, greatly increasing the affected range.\nUranium ores and those containing other radioactive elements may pose a significant threat if leaving occurs and isotope concentration increases above background levels. Radiation can have severe, long lasting environmental impacts and cause irreversible damage to living organisms.\nHistory.\nMetallurgy began with the direct working of native metals such as gold, lead and copper. Placer deposits, for example, would have been the first source of native gold. The first exploited ores were copper oxides such as malachite and azurite, over 7000 years ago at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck . These were the easiest to work, with relatively limited mining and basic requirements for smelting. It is believed they were once much more abundant on the surface than today. After this, copper sulphides would have been turned to as oxide resources depleted and the Bronze Age progressed. Lead production from galena smelting may have been occurring at this time as well.\nThe smelting of arsenic-copper sulphides would have produced the first bronze alloys. The majority of bronze creation however required tin, and thus the exploitation of cassiterite, the main tin source, began. Some 3000 years ago, the smelting of iron ores began in Mesopotamia. Iron oxide is quite abundant on the surface and forms from a variety of processes.\nUntil the 18th century gold, copper, lead, iron, silver, tin, arsenic and mercury were the only metals mined and used. In recent decades, Rare Earth Elements have been increasingly exploited for various high-tech applications. This has led to an ever-growing search for REE ore and novel ways of extracting said elements.\nTrade.\nOres (metals) are traded internationally and comprise a sizeable portion of international trade in raw materials both in value and volume. This is because the worldwide distribution of ores is unequal and dislocated from locations of peak demand and from smelting infrastructure.\nMost base metals (copper, lead, zinc, nickel) are traded internationally on the London Metal Exchange, with smaller stockpiles and metals exchanges monitored by the COMEX and NYMEX exchanges in the United States and the Shanghai Futures Exchange in China. The global Chromium market is currently dominated by the United States and China.\nIron ore is traded between customer and producer, though various benchmark prices are set quarterly between the major mining conglomerates and the major consumers, and this sets the stage for smaller participants.\nOther, lesser, commodities do not have international clearing houses and benchmark prices, with most prices negotiated between suppliers and customers one-on-one. This generally makes determining the price of ores of this nature opaque and difficult. Such metals include lithium, niobium-tantalum, bismuth, antimony and rare earths. Most of these commodities are also dominated by one or two major suppliers with &gt;60% of the world's reserves. China is currently leading in world production of Rare Earth Elements.\nThe World Bank reports that China was the top importer of ores and metals in 2005 followed by the US and Japan.\nImportant ore minerals.\nFor detailed petrographic descriptions of ore minerals see \"Tables for the Determination of Common Opaque Minerals\" by Spry and Gedlinske (1987). Below are the major economic ore minerals and their deposits, grouped by primary elements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of fabric and paper, causing a \"whitening\" effect; they make intrinsically yellow/orange materials look less so, by compensating the deficit in blue and purple light reflected by the material, with the blue and purple optical emission of the fluorophore.\nProperties.\nThe most common classes of compounds with this property are the stilbenes, e.g., 4,4\u2032-diamino-2,2\u2032-stilbenedisulfonic acid. Older, non-commercial fluorescent compounds include umbelliferone, which absorbs in the UV portion of the spectrum and re-emit it in the blue portion of the visible spectrum. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white.\nApproximately 400 brightener types are listed in the international Colour Index database, but fewer than 90 are produced commercially, and only a handful are commercially important. The Colour Index Generic Names and Constitution Numbers can be assigned to a specific substance. However, some are duplicated, since manufacturers apply for the index number when they produce it. The global OBA production for paper, textiles, and detergents is dominated by just a few di- and tetra-sulfonated triazole-stilbenes and a di-sulfonated stilbene-biphenyl derivatives. The stilbene derivatives are subject to fading upon prolonged exposure to UV, due to the formation of optically inactive cis-stilbenes. They are also degraded by oxygen in air, like most dye colorants. All brighteners have extended conjugation and/or aromaticity, allowing for electron movement. Some non-stilbene brighteners are used in more permanent applications such as whitening synthetic fiber.\nBrighteners can be \"boosted\" by the addition of certain polyols, such as high molecular weight polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol. These additives increase the visible blue light emissions significantly. Brighteners can also be \"quenched\". Excess brightener will often cause a greening effect as emissions start to show above the blue region in the visible spectrum.\nCommon uses.\nBrighteners are commonly added to laundry detergents to make the clothes appear cleaner. Normally cleaned laundry appears yellowish, which consumers do not like. Optical brighteners have replaced bluing which was formerly used to produce the same effect.\nBrighteners are used in many papers, especially high brightness papers, resulting in their strongly fluorescent appearance under UV illumination. Paper brightness is typically measured at 457\u00a0nm, well within the fluorescent activity range of brighteners. Paper used for banknotes does not contain optical brighteners, so a common method for detecting counterfeit notes is to check for fluorescence.\nOptical brighteners have also found use in cosmetics. One application is to formulas for washing and conditioning grey or blonde hair, where the brightener can not only increase the luminance and sparkle of the hair, but can also correct dull, yellowish discoloration without darkening the hair. Some advanced face and eye powders contain optical brightener microspheres that brighten shadowed or dark areas of the skin, such as \"tired eyes\".\nEnd uses of optical brighteners include:\nMisuse.\nFrom around 2002 to 2012, chemical brighteners were used by many Chinese farmers to enhance the appearance of their white mushrooms. This illegal use was mostly eliminated by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been the most common technique for artistic painting on canvas, wood panel, or copper for several centuries. The advantages of oil for painting images include \"greater flexibility, richer and denser color, the use of layers, and a wider range from light to dark\". \nThe oldest known oil paintings were created by Buddhist artists in Afghanistan, and date back to the 7th century AD. Oil paint was later developed by Europeans for painting statues and woodwork from at least the 12th century, but its common use for painted images began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of egg tempera paints for panel paintings in most of Europe, though not for Orthodox icons or wall paintings, where tempera and fresco, respectively, remained the usual choice.\nCommonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. The paint could be thinned with turpentine. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish to provide protection and texture. The paint itself can be molded into different textures depending on its plasticity.\nTechniques.\nTraditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. Oil paint is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade mineral spirits, or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower drying. (Because the solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is 'fat over lean', meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. The consistency on the canvas depends on the layering of the oil paint. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film.\nOther media can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or 'body' of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint.\nTraditionally, paint was most often transferred to the painting surface using paintbrushes, but there are other methods, including using palette knives and rags. Palette knives can scrape off any paint from a canvas and can also be used for application. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture, or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some turpentine for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped off. Oil paint dries by oxidation, not evaporation, and is usually dry to the touch within two weeks (some colors dry within days).\nHistory.\nThe earliest known surviving oil paintings are Buddhist murals created c.\u2009650 AD in Bamiyan, Afghanistan. Bamiyan is a historic settlement along the Silk Road and is famous for the Bamiyan Buddhas, a series of giant statues, behind which rooms and tunnels are carved from the rock. The murals are located in these rooms. The artworks display a wide range of pigments and ingredients and even include the use of a final varnish layer. The application technique and refined level of the paint media used in the murals and their survival into the present day suggest that oil paints had been used in Asia for some time before the 7th century. The technique used, of binding pigments in oil, was unknown in Europe for another 900 years or so.\nIn a treatise written about 1125, monk Theophilus Presbyter (a pseudonymous author who is sometimes identified as Roger of Helmarshausen) gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, ('on various arts'), written about 1125. At this period, it was probably used for painting sculptures, carvings, and wood fittings, perhaps especially for outdoor use. Surfaces exposed to the weather or of items like shields\u2014both those used in tournaments and those hung as decorations\u2014were more durable when painted in oil-based media than when painted in traditional tempera paints. Cennino Cennini, in his \"Book of Art\", also mentions and describes the oil technique. Most European Renaissance sources, in particular Vasari, falsely credit northern European painters of the 15th century, and Jan van Eyck in particular, with the invention of oil paints.\nHowever, early Netherlandish paintings with artists like Van Eyck and Robert Campin in the early and mid-15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium and explore the use of layers and glazes, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and then Italy.\nSuch works were painted on wooden panels, but towards the end of the 15th century canvas began to be used as a support, as it was cheaper, easier to transport, allowed larger works, and did not require complicated preliminary layers of gesso (a fine type of plaster). Venice, where sail-canvas was easily available, was a leader in the move to canvas. Small cabinet paintings were also made on metal, especially copper plates. These supports were more expensive but very firm, allowing intricately fine detail. Often printing plates from printmaking were reused for this purpose. The increasing use of oil spread through Italy from Northern Europe, starting in Venice in the late 15th century. By 1540, the previous method for painting on panel (tempera) had become all but extinct, although Italians continued to use chalk-based fresco for wall paintings, which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates.\nRenaissance techniques used several thin almost transparent layers or glazes, usually each allowed to dry before the next was added, greatly increasing the time a painting took. The underpainting or ground beneath these was usually white (typically gesso coated with a primer), allowing light to reflect through the layers. But van Eyck, and Robert Campin a little later, used a wet-on-wet technique in places, painting a second layer soon after the first. Initially, the aim was, as with the established techniques of tempera and fresco, to produce a smooth surface when no attention was drawn to the brushstrokes or texture of the painted surface. Among the earliest impasto effects, using a raised or rough texture in the surface of the paint, are those from the later works of the Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini, around 1500.\nThis became much more common in the 16th century, as many painters began to draw attention to the process of their painting, by leaving individual brushstrokes obvious, and a rough painted surface. Another Venetian, Titian, was a leader in this. In the 17th century some artists, including Rembrandt, began to use dark grounds. Until the mid-19th century, there was a division between artists who exploited \"effects of handling\" in their paintwork, and those who continued to aim at \"an even, glassy surface from which all evidences of manipulation had been banished\".\nBefore the 19th century, artists or their apprentices ground pigments and mixed their paints for the range of painting media. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the studio. This changed when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter John Goffe Rand's invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841. Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient plein air painting (a common approach in French Impressionism)\nIngredients.\nThe linseed oil itself comes from the flax seed, a common fiber crop. Linen, a \"support\" for oil painting (see relevant section), also comes from the flax plant. Safflower oil or the walnut or poppyseed oil or Castor Oil are sometimes used in formulating lighter colors like white because they \"yellow\" less on drying than linseed oil, but they have the slight drawback of drying more slowly and may not provide the strongest paint film. Linseed oil tends to dry yellow and can change the hue of the color. In some regions, this technique is referred to as the drying oil technique. \nRecent advances in chemistry have produced modern water miscible oil paints that can be used and cleaned up with water. Small alterations in the molecular structure of the oil create this water miscible property.\nSupports for oil painting.\nThe earliest oil paintings were almost all panel paintings on wood, which had been seasoned and prepared in a complicated and rather expensive process with the panel constructed from several pieces of wood, although such support tends to warp. Panels continued to be used well into the 17th century, including by Rubens, who painted several large works on wood. The artists of the Italian regions moved towards canvas in the early 16th century, led partly by a wish to paint larger images, which would have been too heavy as panels. Canvas for sails was made in Venice and so easily available and cheaper than wood.\nSmaller paintings, with very fine detail, were easier to paint on a very firm surface, and wood panels or copper plates, often reused from printmaking, were often chosen for small cabinet paintings even in the 19th century. Portrait miniatures normally used very firm supports, including ivory, or stiff paper card.\nTraditional artists' canvas is made from linen, but less expensive cotton fabric has been used. The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a \"stretcher\" or \"strainer\". The difference between the two names is that \"stretchers\" are slightly adjustable, while \"strainers\" are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a \"size\" to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of animal glue (modern painters use rabbit skin glue) as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a \"gesso\", a mixture of glue and chalk.\nModern acrylic \"gesso\" is made of titanium dioxide with an acrylic binder. It is frequently used on canvas, whereas real gesso is not suitable for canvas. The artist might apply several layers of gesso, sanding each smooth after it has dried. Acrylic gesso is very difficult to sand. One manufacturer makes a \"sandable\" acrylic gesso, but it is intended for panels only and not canvas. It is possible to make the gesso a particular color, but most store-bought gesso is white. The gesso layer, depending on its thickness, will tend to draw the oil paint into the porous surface. Excessive or uneven gesso layers are sometimes visible on the surface of finished paintings as a change that's not from the paint.\nStandard sizes for oil paintings were set in France in the 19th century. The standards were used by most artists, not only the French, as it was\u2014and still is\u2014supported by the main suppliers of artists' materials. Size 0 (\"toile de 0\") to size 120 (\"toile de 120\") is divided into separate \"runs\" for figures (\"figure\"), landscapes (), and marines () that more or less preserve the diagonal. Thus a \"0 figure\" corresponds in height with a \"paysage 1\" and a \"marine 2\".\nAlthough surfaces like linoleum, wooden panel, paper, slate, pressed wood, Masonite, and cardboard have been used, the most popular surface since the 16th century has been canvas, although many artists used panel through the 17th century and beyond. The panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.\nSome artists are now painting directly onto prepared Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) panels. Others combine the perceived benefits of canvas and panel by gluing canvas onto panels made from ACM, Masonite or other material.\nProcess.\nOil paint is made by mixing pigments of colors with an oil medium. Since the 19th century the different main colors are purchased in paint tubes pre-prepared before painting begins, further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities as the painting process is underway. An artist's palette, traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as sulfides for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.\nA brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristles might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and mongoose hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red sable brushes (weasel hair). The finest quality brushes are called \"kolinsky sable\"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the Siberian weasel. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's \"snap\". Floppy fibers with no snap, such as squirrel hair, are generally not used by oil painters.\nIn the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as cost efficient.\nBrushes come in multiple sizes and are used for different purposes. The \"type\" of brush also makes a difference. For example, a \"round\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \"Flat\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \"Bright\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for \"scrubbing in\". \"Filbert\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \"Egbert\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their fingers.\nOld masters usually applied paint in thin layers known as \"glazes\" that allow light to penetrate completely through the layer, a method also simply called \"indirect painting\". This technique is what gives oil paintings their luminous characteristics. This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the egg tempera painting technique (egg yolks used as a binder, mixed with pigment), and was applied by the Early Netherlandish painters in Northern Europe with pigments usually ground in linseed oil. This approach has been called the \"mixed technique\" or \"mixed method\" in modern times. The first coat (the underpainting) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \"tone\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \"cartooning\" method used in fresco technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \"mosaic\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended when the \"mosaic\" is completed and then left to dry before applying details.\nArtists in later periods, such as the Impressionist era (late 19th century), often expanded on this wet-on-wet method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \"alla prima\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from dammar gum crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and conservation. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished to avoid a glossy look.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original \"Old Glory\" was a flag owned by the 19th-century American sea captain William Driver (March 17, 1803 \u2013 March 3, 1886). He flew the flag during his career at sea and later brought it to Nashville, Tennessee, where he settled. Driver greatly prized the flag and ensured its safety from the Confederates, who attempted to seize the flag during the American Civil War. In 1922, Driver's daughter and niece claimed to own the original \"Old Glory\", which became part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, which remains at the National Museum of American History.\nHistory of the original \"Old Glory\".\nCaptain William Driver was born on March 17, 1803, in Salem, Massachusetts. At age 13, Driver ran away from home to become a cabin boy on a ship.\nAt 21, Driver qualified as a master mariner and assumed command of his own ship, the \"Charles Doggett\". In celebration of his appointment, Driver's mother and other women sewed the flag and gave it to him as a gift in 1824. It was believed that while leaving the harbor, the Captain unfurled his new flag, calling out \"Behold Old Glory.\" With this flag flying over his ship, Driver went on to have a colorful career as a U.S. merchant seaman, sailing to China, India, Gibraltar, and the South Pacific. He participated in the tortoiseshell trade and knew some Fijian. In 1831, while voyaging in the South Pacific, Driver's ship \"was the sole surviving vessel of six that departed Salem the same day.\" In Tahiti, where they withdrew because of illness, Driver picked up the 65 descendants of the mutineers of HMS \"Bounty\" and brought them back to Pitcairn Island (a noteworthy act that helped publicize Driver's nickname for the flag). Driver was convinced that God saved his ship to rescue the islanders.\nDriver was deeply attached to the flag, writing: \"It has ever been my staunch companion and protection. Savages and heathens, lowly and oppressed, hailed and welcomed it at the far end of the wide world. Then, why should it not be called Old Glory?\"\nDriver retired from seafaring in 1837 after his wife Martha Silsbee Babbage died from throat cancer. Driver was 34-years-old and had three young children. He settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where his three brothers operated a store. Driver remarried the next year to Sarah Jane Parks, a Southerner with whom he had several more children. Driver took his flag to Nashville, flying it on holidays, rain or shine. The flag was so large that he attached it to a rope from his attic window and stretched it on a pulley across the street to secure it to a locust tree. Driver worked as a salesman and served as vestryman of Christ Episcopal Church.\nIn 1860, Driver, his wife, and daughters repaired the flag, sewing on ten additional stars. Driver added by appliqu\u00e9 a small white anchor in the lower right corner to symbolize his maritime career. By that time, the secession crisis had begun, and Driver's family was split. While Driver was a staunch Unionist, two of his sons were fervent Confederates who enlisted in local regiments. One of Driver's sons died from wounds suffered at Perryville. In March 1862, Driver wrote: \"Two sons in the army of the South! My entire house estranged . . . and when I come home . . . no one to soothe me.\"\nSoon after Tennessee seceded from the Union, Governor Isham G. Harris sent men to Driver's home to demand the flag. Driver, 58 years old, turned the men away at his door after demanding they produce a search warrant. An armed group returned to Driver's front porch, who refused to produce the flag, saying \"If you want my flag you'll have to take it over my dead body.\"\nTo save the flag from further threats, Driver and some of his Unionist neighbors secretly sewed it into a coverlet. The flag was thus hidden until February 1862, when Nashville fell to Union forces. When the Union Army, led by the 6th Ohio Infantry, entered the city, Driver went to Tennessee state capitol after seeing the U.S. flag, and the 6th Ohio's regimental colors raised on the Capitol flagstaffand asked to see the general in command.\nHorace Fisher, the aide-de-camp to the Union commander in the city, Brigadier General William \"Bull\" Nelson, described Driver as \"a stout, middle-aged man, with hair well shot with gray, short in stature, broad in shoulder, and with a roll in his gait.\" Introducing himself as a sea captain and Unionist, Driver had brought the coverlet with him and with a pocket knife ripped open the seams, revealing the flag. Nelson accepted the flag and ordered it run up on the Capitol flagstaff. The 6th Ohio later adopted the motto \"Old Glory.\"\nThat night, a violent storm threatened to tear the flag, so Driver replaced it with a newer flag, taking the original Old Glory for safekeeping. The flag remained in his home until December 1864, when the Battle of Nashville was fought. As Confederate troopers under the command of John Bell Hood sought to retake the city, Driver hung the flag out of the third-story window and left to join the city's defense. For the rest of the American Civil War, Driver served as provost marshal of Nashville, serving in hospitals.\nMary Jane Roland, Driver's daughter, said Driver gave her the flag as a gift on July 10, 1873, telling her, \"This is my old ship flag Old Glory. I love it as a mother loves her child. Take it and cherish it as I have always cherished it; for it has been my steadfast friend and protector in all parts of the world\u2014savage, heathen and civilized.\"\nDriver died on March 3, 1886, and was buried in the Nashville City Cemetery, where, at Driver's request, his rescue of the \"Bounty\" descendants is noted on his grave stone.\nFollowing Driver's death, a family feud erupted over the ownership of the flag. Driver's niece, Harriet Ruth Waters Cooke, the daughter of Driver's youngest sister, said she inherited the flag and presented her version of Old Glory to the Essex Institute in Salem, which became the Peabody Essex Museum, along with family memorabilia that included a letter from the Pitcairn Islands to Driver. Cooke published a family memoir in 1889, omitting any mention of Mary Jane Roland.\nRoland wrote an account of the flag, publishing \"Old Glory, The True Story\" in 1918. In that memoir, Roland disputed Cooke's narrative. She presented evidence for her claim that the flag she owned was the true Old Glory. In 1922, Roland gave her Old Glory to President Warren G. Harding. Harding had the flag sent to the Smithsonian Institution. The same year, the Peabody Essex Museum sent its Old Glory to the Smithsonian.\nIn 2019, Captain Driver's great-great grandson, Jack Benz, published a novel depicting the life and adventures of Captain William Driver using information collected from personal research and inherited from Captain Driver's descendants. \nSmithsonian Institution collection.\nThe Smithsonian Institution has regarded the Roland flag as the authentic Old Glory, since \"documentary evidence in the Tennessee State Library and Archives suggests it was the one hidden in the quilt and presented to Union troops who took Nashville. The Roland flag is 17\u00d710 feet. The Peabody flag is 12\u00d76 feet.\nIn June 2006, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History (NMAH) loaned the Roland flag to the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville for an eight-month exhibit entitled \"Old Glory: An American Treasure Comes Home\". The flag was in fragile condition and had to be carefully shipped and displayed.\nA conservation evaluation of both flags by NMAH curator Jennifer Locke Jones and Thomassen-Krauss began in 2012. Preliminary findings indicate that the larger Roland flag has the stronger claim to being the original Old Glory but that the Peabody flag dated to the same era and is a legitimate Driver family heirloom and Civil War\u2013era relic. The Roland Old Glory is heavily worn on the fly edges, consistent with the wear of a seagoing flag.\nThe Peabody Essex Museum has in its collection fragmentary scraps from what was claimed to be Old Glory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A member of the Socialist Party of Chile, he fled from the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, Letelier accepted several academic positions in Washington D.C. after his exile from Chile. In 1976, agents of Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA), the Pinochet regime's secret police, assassinated Letelier in Washington in a car bombing. The agents had been working in collaboration with members of the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, an anti-Castro militant group.\nBackground.\nSergio Orlando Letelier del Solar was born in Temuco, Chile, in South-Central Chile, the youngest child of Orlando Letelier Ruiz and In\u00e9s del Solar. He studied at the Instituto Nacional in Santiago. At 16, he was accepted as a cadet at the Chilean Military Academy, where he completed his secondary studies. Later, he abandoned a military career. He did not finish college and never received a university degree. In 1955, he joined the recently formed Copper Office (\"Departamento del Cobre\", now CODELCO) and worked there until 1959 as a research analyst in the copper industry.\nOn 17 December 1955, Letelier married Isabel Margarita Morel Gumucio and they had four children: Cristi\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9, Francisco, and Juan Pablo.\nIn 1959 Letelier was fired from the Copper Office, ostensibly for having supported Salvador Allende's unsuccessful second presidential campaign. The Letelier family left for Venezuela, where Orlando Letelier became a copper consultant to the Finance Ministry.\nPolitical career.\nWhile at university, Letelier became a student representative in the University of Chile's Student Union. In 1959, he joined the Chilean Socialist Party (PS). In 1971, President Allende appointed him ambassador to the United States. His specific mission was to advocate in defense of the Chilean nationalization of copper, which had replaced the private ownership model favored by the U.S. government.\nIn 1973, Letelier was recalled to Chile and served successively as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Interior, and Defense. In the coup d'\u00e9tat of 11 September 1973, he was the first high-ranking member of the Allende administration to be arrested. He was held for twelve months in various concentration camps and suffered severe torture: first at the Tacna Regiment, then at the Military Academy. Later he was sent for eight months to a political prison on Dawson Island; from there he was transferred to the basement of the Air Force War Academy, and finally to Riotoque, a concentration camp north of Valpara\u00edso, Chile. After international diplomatic pressure, especially from Diego Arria, then Governor of Distrito Federal of Venezuela, he was released in September 1974 on the condition that he immediately leave Chile.\nAfter his release, he and his family moved to Caracas, Venezuela, but later went to the United States on the recommendation of American writer Saul Landau. In 1975, Letelier moved to Washington D.C., where he became senior fellow of the Washington, D.C.\u2013based Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank in which Landau was involved. Letelier became director of the Amsterdam-based Transnational Institute and taught at the School of International Service of the American University in Washington, D.C.\nLetelier wrote several articles criticizing the \"Chicago Boys\", a group of South American economists trained at the University of Chicago by Milton Friedman and Arnold Harberger who returned to their home countries to promote and advise leaders on the benefits of a free-market economy. This economic model was used to great effect in Chile where General Pinochet sought to dismantle the country's socialist economic system and replace it with a free-market economy. Letelier believed that in a resource-driven economy such as Chile, allowing markets to operate freely simply guaranteed the movement of wealth from the lower and middle classes to the monopolists and financial speculators. He soon became the leading voice of the Chilean resistance, preventing several loans (especially from Europe) from being awarded to the Chilean government. On 10 September 1976, he was stripped of his Chilean nationality.\nDeath.\nLetelier was killed by a car bombing on 21 September 1976 in Sheridan Circle in Washington, D.C., along with his American secretary and interpreter, Ronni Karpen Moffitt.\nMoffitt's husband, Michael Moffitt, was injured but survived. Several people were prosecuted and convicted for the murder. Among them were Michael Townley, a U.S. expatriate working for DINA, General Manuel Contreras, former head of DINA, and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza, also formerly of DINA. Townley was convicted in the United States in 1978 and served 62 months in prison for the murder. He is now free as a participant in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. Contreras and Espinoza were convicted in Chile in 1993.\nDuring the FBI investigation into the assassination, documents in Letelier's possession were copied and leaked to journalists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak of \"The Washington Times\" and Jack Anderson by the FBI before being returned to his widow. The documents purportedly show Letelier was working with Eastern Bloc intelligence agencies for a decade and coordinating his activities with the surviving political leadership of the Popular Unity coalition exiled in East Berlin, East Germany. The FBI suspected that these individuals had been recruited by the Stasi. Documents in the briefcase showed that Letelier had maintained contact with Salvador Allende's daughter, Beatriz Allende, who was married to Cuban DGI station chief Luis Fernandez Ona.\nLetelier's funeral was held at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington D.C. and then there was a march to the site of the car-bombing at Sheridan Circle on Massachusetts Avenue, where folksinger Joan Baez sang in honor of Letelier. Several thousand U.S. citizens and Chilean exiles took part. Diego Arria again intervened by bringing Letelier's body to Caracas for burial, where Arria remained until 1994 after the end of Pinochet's rule.\nGeneral Augusto Pinochet, who died on 10 December 2006, was never brought to trial for the murders, despite some evidence implicating him as having ordered them. However, in a letter dated March 14, 1976, Townley discussed plans for the assassination and noted that he in fact received the assassination order from Manuel Contreras's deputy Pedro Espinoza. Townley also later claimed he conducted his operations, including the assassination of Letelier, by \"following orders from General Contreras.\" After the assassination, the United States cut military aid to Chile, and took a stance of 'unobtrusiveness' within the country.\nAftermath.\nAfter the death of Pinochet in December 2006, the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), for which both Letelier and Moffitt worked, called for the release of all classified documents relating to the Letelier\u2013Moffitt assassination.\nAccording to the IPS, the Clinton administration de-classified more than 16,000 documents relating to Chile, but withheld documents relating to the Letelier-Moffitt assassination in Washington on the grounds that they were associated with an ongoing investigation. The IPS said the Clinton administration had re-opened the investigation into the Letelier-Moffitt murders and sent agents to Chile to gather additional evidence that Pinochet had authorized the crime. The former Chilean Secret Police Chief, Manuel Contreras, who was convicted for his role in the crime in 1993, later pointed the finger at his superiors, claiming that all relevant orders had come from Pinochet.\nSubsequent disclosures.\nA US State Department document made available by the National Security Archive on 10 April 2010 reveals that a d\u00e9marche protesting Pinochet's Operation Condor assassination program was proposed and sent on 23 August 1976 to U.S. diplomatic missions in Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile to be delivered to their host governments but later rescinded on 16 September 1976 by Henry Kissinger, after concerns were raised by US ambassadors assigned there of both personal safety and a likely diplomatic contretemps. Five days later, the Letelier assassination took place.\nDocuments released in 2015 revealed a CIA report dated 28 April 1978, which claimed that the agency by then had knowledge that Pinochet ordered the murders. The report said, \"Contreras told a confidante he authorized the assassination of Letelier on orders from Pinochet.\" A State Department document also referred to eight separate CIA reports from around the same date, each sourced to \"extremely sensitive informants\" who provided evidence of Pinochet's direct involvement in ordering the assassination and in directing the subsequent cover-up. However, letters written by Letelier assassin Michael Townley, and which were published by the National Security Archive in November 2023, implied otherwise and instead linked Townley, DINA head Manuel Contreras and Contreras' deputy Pedro Esponiza to the assassination order. Townley said in his March 1978 \"confession\" letter that while he bore responsibility, he carried out his DINA operations on order on Contreras, writing, \u201cIt is obvious that they intend to use the fact that I am a foreigner, to attempt to divert the responsibility of the Chilean government, and also to stop me from talking about the other things that I have done for DINA following orders from General Contreras.\" \nIn a U.S. Department of Justice affidavit from August 1991, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric B. Marcy noted that numerous confession letters were obtained from Mariana Callejas between 1982 and 1990 (she was a writer), and that while the Pinochet regime employed Operaci\u00f3n Mascarada to cover up its role in Letelier and Montiff's assassination, the people in the Pinochet regime who Townley sought protection from, were in fact Contreras and Espinoza. In one letter, Townley said that he received the order to assassinate Letelier from Espinoza in March 1976 and, after the assassination was carried out, disclosed details on how he in fact was the one who recruited the assassination team which consisted of American Cuban exiles after entering the U.S. while in possession of phony visas he obtained in Paraguay. In another letter, Townley even accused Contreas of deceiving Pinochet about the assassination details.\nDuring the tenure of Richard D. Downie at the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, a U.S. Southern Command educational institution at the National Defense University in Washington D.C., the role of Jaime Garcia Covarrubias, a Chilean professor who was head of counterintelligence for DINA\u2014Pinochet\u2019s state terrorism organization\u2014in the 1970s, in the torture and murder of seven detainees was revealed inside the center. The case was first brought to Downie's attention in early 2008 by Center assistant professor Martin Edwin Andersen, a senior staff member who earlier, as a senior advisor for policy planning at the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, was the first national security whistleblower to receive the U.S Office of Special Counsel's \"Public Servant Award.\" By 2023, the time of the fiftieth anniversary of the far-right coup, Garcia Covarrubias was serving life imprisonment for his role in three separate cases of the murders of nine unarmed people, being found guilty in the case involving four university students and others. In an October 1987 investigative report in The Nation, Andersen broke the story of how, in a June 1976 meeting in the Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Kissinger gave the bloody military junta in neighboring Argentina the \"green light\" for their own dirty \"war.\"\nOn 22 November 2023, Michael Townley confession documents were published by the National Security Archive. Included among the documents were letters from March 1976 and March 1978 where Townley personally detailed his role in planning and undergoing Letelier's assassination. Townley personally implicated himself in earlier letters saying that Espinoza was the one who gave him the order to go through with the assassination and Contreras as being the one who he took order from when he took part in missions for DINA. The August 1991 U.S. Department of Justice affidavit also said that Townley in fact prepared his confession letters prior to his departure from Chile \"in order to protect him from the fugitives Manuel Contreras and Pedro Espinoza.\" In a separate letter which Townley sent to Manuel Contreras on March 1, 1978, he referred to Contreras as \"Don Manuel\" and made clear his belief that Contreras had not \u201clet his Excellency [Pinochet] know the truth about this case\u201d when he brought up Letelier's assassination.\nIn culture.\nThe years leading up to the death of Orlando Letelier and the terrorist attack which ended his life in Washington D.C. are one of the central themes of the novel \"1976\" by Jorge Majfud, an Uruguayan author.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22614", "revid": "290357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22614", "title": "Oscar Wilde", "text": "Irish poet and playwright (1854\u20131900)\nOscar Fingal O'Fflahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854\u00a0\u2013 30 November 1900) was an Irish author, poet and playwright. After writing in different literary styles throughout the 1880s, he became one of the most popular and influential dramatists in London in the early 1890s. He was a key figure in the emerging Aestheticism movement of the late 19th century and is regarded by many as the greatest playwright of the Victorian era. Wilde is best known for his Gothic novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1890), his epigrams, plays and bedtime stories for children, as well as his criminal conviction in 1895 for gross indecency for homosexual acts.\nWilde's parents were Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. In his youth, Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German. At university, he read Greats; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist, first at Trinity College Dublin, then at Magdalen College, Oxford. He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism during this time, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles.\nWilde tried his hand at various literary activities: he wrote a play, published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on \"The English Renaissance\" in art and interior decoration, and then returned to London where he lectured on his American travels and wrote reviews for various periodicals. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity and beauty into what would be his only novel, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1890). Wilde returned to drama, writing \"Salome\" (1891) in French while in Paris, but it was refused a licence for England due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of biblical subjects on the English stage. Undiscouraged, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London.\nAt the height of his fame and success, while \"An Ideal Husband\" (1895) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895) were still being performed in London, Wilde issued a civil writ against John Sholto Douglas, the 9th Marquess of Queensberry for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel hearings unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and criminal prosecution for gross indecency with other males. The jury was unable to reach a verdict and so a retrial was ordered. In the second trial Wilde was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison he wrote \"De Profundis\" (published posthumously in abridged form in 1905), a long letter that discusses his spiritual journey through his trials and is a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. On the day of his release, he caught the overnight steamer to France, never to return to Britain or Ireland. In France and Italy, he wrote his last work, \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life.\nEarly life.\nOscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854 at 21 Westland Row, Dublin (now home of the Oscar Wilde Centre, Trinity College), the second of three children born to an Anglo-Irish couple: Jane, n\u00e9e Elgee, and Sir William Wilde. Oscar was two years younger than his brother, William (Willie) Wilde.\nJane Wilde was a niece (by marriage) of the novelist, playwright and clergyman Charles Maturin, who may have influenced her own literary career. She believed, mistakenly, that she was of Italian ancestry, and under the pseudonym \"Speranza\" (the Italian word for 'hope'), she wrote poetry for the revolutionary Young Irelanders in 1848; she was a lifelong Irish nationalist. Jane Wilde read the Young Irelanders' poetry to Willie and Oscar, inculcating a love of these poets in her sons. Her interest in the neo-classical revival showed in the paintings and busts of ancient Greece and Rome in her home.\nSir William Wilde was Ireland's leading oto-ophthalmologic (ear and eye) surgeon and was knighted in 1864 for his services as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland. He also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. A renowned philanthropist, his dispensary for the care of the city's poor at the rear of Trinity College Dublin (TCD), was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road. On his father's side Wilde was descended from a Dutch soldier, Colonel de Wilde, who came to Ireland with King William of Orange's invading army in 1690, and numerous Anglo-Irish ancestors. On his mother's side, Wilde's ancestors included a bricklayer from County Durham, who emigrated to Ireland sometime in the 1770s.\nWilde was baptised as an infant in St. Mark's Church, Dublin, the local Church of Ireland (Anglican) church. When the church was closed, the records were moved to the nearby St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street. A Catholic priest in Glencree, County Wicklow, also claimed to have baptised Wilde and his brother Willie.\nIn addition to his two full siblings, Wilde had three paternal half-siblings, who were born out of wedlock before the marriage of his father: Henry Wilson, born in 1838 to one woman, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, to a second woman. Sir William acknowledged paternity of his children and provided for their education, arranging for them to be raised by his relatives.\nThe family moved to No 1 Merrion Square in 1855. With both Sir William and Lady Wilde's success and delight in social life, the home soon became the site of a \"unique medical and cultural milieu\". Guests at their salon included Sheridan Le Fanu, Charles Lever, George Petrie, Isaac Butt, William Rowan Hamilton and Samuel Ferguson.\nWilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, was born on 2 April 1857. She was named in tribute to Iseult of Ireland, wife of Mark of Cornwall and lover of the Cornish knight, Sir Tristan. She shared the name Francesca with her mother, while Emily was the name of her maternal aunt. Oscar would later describe how his sister was like \"a golden ray of sunshine dancing about our home\" and he was grief stricken when she died at the age of nine of a febrile illness. His poem \"\" was written in her memory; the first stanza reads:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nTread lightly, she is near\nUnder the snow\nSpeak gently, she can hear\nThe daisies grow.&lt;/poem&gt;\nUntil he was nine Wilde was educated at home, where a French nursemaid and a German governess taught him their languages. He joined his brother Willie at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which he attended from 1864 to 1871. At Portora, although he was not as popular as his older brother, Wilde impressed his peers with the humorous and inventive school stories he told. Later in life, he claimed that his fellow students had regarded him as a prodigy for his ability to speed read, claiming that he could read two facing pages simultaneously and consume a three-volume book in half an hour, retaining enough information to give a basic account of the plot. He excelled academically, particularly in the subject of classics, in which he ranked fourth in the school in 1869. His aptitude for giving oral translations of Greek and Latin texts won him multiple prizes, including the Carpenter Prize for Greek Testament. He was one of only three students at Portora to win a Royal School scholarship to Trinity in 1871.\nIn 1871, when Wilde was seventeen, his elder half-sisters Mary and Emily died aged 22 and 24, fatally burned at a dance at Drumacon, Co Monaghan. One of the sisters had brushed against the flames of a fire or a candelabra and her dress caught fire; in different versions, the man she was dancing with carried her and her sister down to douse the flames in the snow, or her sister ran her down the stairs and rolled her in the snow, causing her own muslin dress to catch fire too.\nUntil his early twenties, Wilde summered at Moytura House, a villa his father had built in Cong, County Mayo. There the young Wilde and his brother Willie played with George Moore.\nUniversity education: 1870s.\nTrinity College Dublin.\nWilde left Portora with a royal scholarship to read classics at Trinity College Dublin (TCD), from 1871 to 1874, sharing rooms with his older brother Willie Wilde. Trinity, one of the leading classical schools, placed him with scholars such as R. Y. Tyrell, Arthur Palmer, Edward Dowden and his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature. As a student, Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latter's book \"Social Life in Greece\". Wilde, despite later reservations, called Mahaffy \"my first and best teacher\" and \"the scholar who showed me how to love Greek things\". For his part, Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later, he said Wilde was \"the only blot on my tutorship\".\nThe University Philosophical Society also provided an education, as members discussed intellectual and artistic subjects such as the work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne weekly. Wilde quickly became an established member\u00a0\u2013 the members' suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter sportingly mocking Wilde's emergent aestheticism. He presented a paper titled \"Aesthetic Morality\". At Trinity, Wilde established himself as an outstanding student: he came first in his class in his first year, won a scholarship by competitive examination in his second and, in his finals, won the Berkeley Gold Medal in Greek, the university's highest academic award. He was encouraged to compete for a demyship, a half-scholarship worth \u00a395 per year (), at Magdalen College, Oxford, which he won easily.\nMagdalen College, Oxford.\nAt Magdalen, he read Greats from 1874 to 1878. He applied to join the Oxford Union, but failed to be elected.\nAttracted by its dress, secrecy and ritual, Wilde petitioned the Apollo Masonic Lodge at Oxford and was soon raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. During a resurgent interest in Freemasonry in his third year, he commented he \"would be awfully sorry to give it up if I secede from the Protestant Heresy\". Wilde's active involvement in Freemasonry lasted only for the time he spent at Oxford; he allowed his membership of the Apollo University Lodge to lapse after failing to pay subscriptions.\nCatholicism deeply appealed to him, especially its rich liturgy, and he discussed converting to it with clergy several times. In 1877, Wilde was left speechless after an audience with Pope Pius\u00a0IX in Rome. He eagerly read the books of Cardinal Newman, a noted Anglican priest who had converted to Catholicism and risen in the church hierarchy. He became more serious in 1878, when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the Brompton Oratory who had received some high-profile converts. Neither Mahaffy nor Sir William, who threatened to cut off his son's funding, thought much of the plan; but Wilde, the supreme individualist, balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed. On the appointed day of his baptism into Catholicism, he sent Father Bowden a bunch of altar lilies instead. Wilde did retain a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.\nWhile at Magdalen College, Wilde became well known for his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. He wore his hair long, openly scorned \"manly\" sports\u00a0\u2013 though he occasionally boxed\u00a0\u2013 and decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other \"objets d'art\". He entertained lavishly and once remarked to some friends, \"I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china.\" The line spread famously; aesthetes adopted it as a slogan, but it was criticised as being terribly vacuous. Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languorous attitudes and showy costumes became a recognisable pose. When four of his fellow students physically assaulted Wilde, he fended them off single-handedly, to the surprise of his detractors. By his third year Wilde had truly begun to develop himself and his myth, and considered his learning to be more expansive than what was within the prescribed texts. He was rusticated for one term, after he had returned late to a college term from a trip to Greece with Mahaffy.\nWilde did not meet Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his \"Studies in the History of the Renaissance\", published during Wilde's final year in Trinity. Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in \"De Profundis\", Wilde described Pater's \"Studies...\" as \"that book that has had such a strange influence over my life\". He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though he gained a purpose for it through the lectures and writings of critic John Ruskin. Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing that the importance of art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series \"The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence\", he learned about aesthetics as the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.\nWilde won the 1878 Newdigate Prize for his poem \"\", which reflected on his visit there in the previous year, and he duly read it at Encaenia. In November 1878, he graduated Bachelor of Arts with a double first, having been placed in the first class in Classical Moderations (the first part of the course) and then again in the final examination in Literae Humaniores (Greats). Wilde wrote to a friend, \"The dons are 'astonied' beyond words\u00a0\u2013 the Bad Boy doing so well in the end!\"\nApprenticeship of an aesthete: 1880s.\nDebut in society.\nAfter graduation from Oxford, Wilde returned to Dublin, where he met again Florence Balcombe, a childhood sweetheart. She became engaged to Bram Stoker and they married in 1878. Wilde was disappointed but stoic. He wrote to Balcombe remembering; \"the two sweet years\u00a0\u2013 the sweetest years of all my youth\" during which they had been close. He also stated his intention to \"return to England, probably for good\". This he did in 1878, only briefly visiting Ireland twice after that.\nUnsure of his next step, Wilde wrote to various acquaintances enquiring about Classics positions at Oxford or Cambridge. \"The Rise of Historical Criticism\" was his submission for the Chancellor's Essay prize of 1879, which, though no longer a student, he was still eligible to enter. Its subject, \"Historical Criticism among the Ancients\" seemed ready-made for Wilde\u00a0\u2013 with both his skill in composition and ancient learning\u00a0\u2013 but he struggled to find his voice in the long, flat, scholarly style. Unusually, no prize was awarded that year.\nWith the last of his inheritance from the sale of his father's houses, he set himself up as a bachelor in London. The 1881 British Census listed Wilde as a boarder at 1 (now 44) Tite Street, Chelsea, where Frank Miles, a society painter, was the head of the household.\nLillie Langtry was introduced to Wilde at Frank Miles' studio in 1877. The most glamorous woman in England, Langtry assumed great importance to Wilde during his early years in London and they remained close friends for many years; he tutored her in Latin and later encouraged her to pursue acting. She wrote in her autobiography that he \"possessed a remarkably fascinating and compelling personality\", and \"the cleverness of his remarks received added value from his manner of delivering them.\"\nWilde regularly attended the theatre and was especially taken with star actresses such as Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt. In 1880 he completed his first play, \"Vera; or, The Nihilists\", a tragic melodrama about Russian nihilism, and distributed privately printed copies to various actresses whom he hoped to interest in its sole female role. A one-off performance in London was advertised in November 1881 with Mrs. Bernard Beere as Vera, but withdrawn by Wilde for what was claimed to be consideration for political feeling in England.\nHe had been publishing lyrics and poems in magazines since entering Trinity College, especially in \"Kottabos\" and the \"Dublin University Magazine\". In mid-1881, at 27 years old, he published \"Poems\", which collected, revised and expanded his poems.\nThough the book sold out its first print run of 750 copies, it was not generally well received by the critics: \"Punch\", for example, said that \"The poet is Wilde, but his poetry's tame\". By a tight vote, the Oxford Union condemned the book for alleged plagiarism. The librarian, who had requested the book for the library, returned the presentation copy to Wilde with a note of apology. Biographer Richard Ellmann argues that Wilde's poem \"\" was a sincere, though flamboyant, attempt to explain the dichotomies the poet saw in himself; one line reads: \"To drift with every passion till my soul / Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play\".\nThe book had further printings in 1882. It was bound in a rich, enamel parchment cover (embossed with gilt blossom) and printed on hand-made Dutch paper; over the next few years, Wilde presented many copies to the dignitaries and writers who received him during his lecture tours.\nNorth America: 1882.\nAestheticism was sufficiently in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in \"Patience\" (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde to make a lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of \"Patience\" and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS \"Arizona\", arriving on 2 January 1882 and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, the tour continued for almost a year owing to its commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design. In a British Library article on aestheticism and decadence, Carolyn Burdett writes, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wilde teased his readers with the claim that life imitates art rather than the other way round. His point was a serious one: we notice London fogs, he argued, because art and literature has taught us to do so. Wilde, among others, 'performed' these maxims. He presented himself as the impeccably dressed and mannered dandy figure whose life was a work of art.\nWhen asked to explain reports that he had paraded down Piccadilly in London carrying a lily, long hair flowing, Wilde replied, \"It's not whether I did it or not that's important, but whether people believed I did it\". Wilde believed that the artist should hold forth higher ideals and that pleasure and beauty would replace utilitarian ethics.\nWilde and aestheticism were both mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press: the \"Springfield Republican\", for instance, commented on Wilde's behaviour during his visit to Boston to lecture on aestheticism, suggesting that Wilde's conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. T. W. Higginson, a cleric and abolitionist, wrote in \"Unmanly Manhood\" of his general concern that Wilde, \"whose only distinction is that he has written a thin volume of very mediocre verse\", would improperly influence the behaviour of men and women.\nAccording to biographer Mich\u00e8le Mendelssohn, Wilde was the subject of anti-Irish caricature and was portrayed as a monkey, a blackface performer and a Christy's Minstrel throughout his career. \"\"Harper's Weekly\" put a sunflower-worshipping monkey dressed as Wilde on the front of the January 1882 issue. The drawing stimulated other American maligners and, in England, had a full-page reprint in the \"Lady's Pictorial\". ... When the \"National Republican\" discussed Wilde, it was to explain 'a few items as to the animal's pedigree.' And on 22 January 1882, the \"Washington Post\" illustrated the Wild Man of Borneo alongside Oscar Wilde of England and asked 'How far is it from this to this?'\" When he visited San Francisco, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" reported, \"The city is divided into two camps, those who thought Wilde was an engaging speaker and an original thinker, and those who thought he was the most pretentious fraud ever perpetrated on a groaning public.\" Though his press reception was hostile, Wilde was well received in diverse settings across America: he drank whiskey with miners in Leadville, Colorado, and was f\u00eated at the most fashionable salons in many cities he visited.\nLondon life and marriage.\nHis earnings, plus expected income from \"The Duchess of Padua\", allowed him to move to Paris between February and mid-May 1883. While there he met Robert Sherard, whom he entertained constantly. \"We are dining on the Duchess tonight\", Wilde would declare before taking him to an expensive restaurant. In August he briefly returned to New York for the production of \"Vera\", the rights of which he had sold to the American actress Marie Prescott. The play was initially well received by the audience, but when the critics wrote lukewarm reviews, attendance fell sharply and the play closed a week after it had opened.\nIn London, he had been introduced in 1881 to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel (lawyer). She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884 when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington, in London. Although Constance had an annual allowance of \u00a3250, which was generous for a young woman (), the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes. They had preached to others for so long on the subject of design that people expected their home to set new standards.\nNo 16 Tite Street in Chelsea, west London was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886.\n In 1886, while at Oxford, Wilde met Robert Ross. Ross, who had read Wilde's poems before they met, seemed unrestrained by the Victorian prohibition against homosexuality. By Richard Ellmann's account, he was a precocious seventeen-year-old who \"so young and yet so knowing, was determined to seduce Wilde\". According to Daniel Mendelsohn, Wilde, who had long alluded to Greek love, was \"initiated into homosexual sex\" by Ross, while his \"marriage had begun to unravel after his wife's second pregnancy, which left him physically repelled\".\nWilde had a number of favourite haunts in London. These included the Caf\u00e9 Royal in Piccadilly, Hatchards bookstore in Piccadilly, and the department stores Liberty &amp; Co. on Great Marlborough Street and Harrods in Knightsbridge; Wilde was among Harrods' first selected customers who were granted extended credit.\nProse writing: 1886\u20131891.\nJournalism and editorship: 1886\u20131889.\nCriticism over artistic matters in \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" provoked a letter of self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885\u201387. Although Richard Ellmann has claimed that Wilde enjoyed reviewing, Wilde's wife would tell friends that \"Mr Wilde hates journalism\". Like his parents before him, Wilde supported Ireland's cause, and when Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder, he wrote a series of astute columns defending the politician in the \"Daily Chronicle\".\nHis flair, having previously been put mainly into socialising, suited journalism and rapidly attracted notice. With his youth nearly over and a family to support, in mid-1887 Wilde became the editor of \"The Lady's World\" magazine, his name prominent on the cover. He promptly renamed it as \"The Woman's World\" and raised its tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture and politics, while keeping discussions of fashion and arts. Two pieces of fiction were usually included, one to be read to children, the other for adult readers. Wilde worked hard to solicit good contributions from his wide artistic acquaintance, including those of Lady Wilde and his wife, Constance, while his own \"Literary and Other Notes\" were themselves popular and amusing.\nThe initial vigour and excitement which he brought to the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At the same time as Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, Wilde began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, at the end of the second volume, Wilde left \"The Woman's World\". The magazine outlasted him by only a year.\nWilde's period at the helm of the magazine played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor was forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.\nDuring the 1880s, Wilde was a close friend of the artist James McNeill Whistler and they dined together on many occasions. At one of these dinners, Whistler produced a \"bon mot\" that Wilde found particularly witty, Wilde exclaimed that he wished that he had said it. Whistler retorted \"You will, Oscar, you will.\" Herbert Vivian\u00a0\u2013 a mutual friend of Wilde and Whistler\u00a0\u2013 attended the dinner and recorded it in his article \"The Reminiscences of a Short Life\", which appeared in \"The Sun\" in 1889. The article alleged that Wilde had a habit of passing off other people's witticisms as his own\u00a0\u2013 especially Whistler's. Wilde considered Vivian's article to be a scurrilous betrayal, and it directly caused the broken friendship between Wilde and Whistler. \"The Reminiscences\" also caused great acrimony between Wilde and Vivian, Wilde accusing Vivian of \"the inaccuracy of an eavesdropper with the method of a blackmailer\" and banishing Vivian from his circle. Vivian's allegations did not diminish Wilde's reputation as an epigrammatist. London theatre director Luther Munday recounted some of Wilde's typical quips: Wilde said of Whistler that \"he had no enemies but was intensely disliked by his friends\", of Hall Caine that \"he wrote at the top of his voice\", of Rudyard Kipling that \"he revealed life by splendid flashes of vulgarity\", of Henry James that \"he wrote fiction as if it were a painful duty\", and of Marion Crawford that \"he immolated himself on the altar of local colour\".\nShorter fiction.\nWilde had been regularly writing fairy stories for magazines. He published \"The Happy Prince and Other Tales\" in 1888. In 1891 he published two more collections, \"Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories\", and in September \"A House of Pomegranates\" was dedicated \"To Constance Mary Wilde\". \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", which Wilde had begun in 1887, was first published in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\" in July 1889. It is a short story which reports a conversation in which the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\", is advanced, retracted and then propounded again. The only evidence for this is two supposed puns within the sonnets themselves.\nThe anonymous narrator is at first sceptical, then believing and finally flirtatious with the reader: he concludes that \"there is really a great deal to be said of the Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare's sonnets.\" By the end fact and fiction have melded together. Arthur Ransome wrote that Wilde \"read something of himself into Shakespeare's sonnets\" and became fascinated with the \"Willie Hughes theory\" despite the lack of biographical evidence for the historical William Hughes' existence. Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question, Wilde tossed the theory to the three characters of the story, allowing it to unfold as background to the plot \u00a0\u2013 an early masterpiece of Wilde's combining many elements that interested him: conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth. Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch.\nThough containing nothing but \"special pleading\" \u2013 it would not, he says \"be possible to build an airier castle in Spain than this of the imaginary William Hughes\" \u2013 we continue listening nonetheless to be charmed by the telling. \"You must believe in Willie Hughes,\" Wilde told an acquaintance, \"I almost do, myself.\"\nEssays and dialogues.\nWilde, having tired of journalism, had been busy setting out his aesthetic ideas more fully in a series of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, \"The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue\" appeared in \"The Nineteenth Century\", and \"Pen, Pencil and Poison\", a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in \"The Fortnightly Review\", edited by Wilde's friend Frank Harris. Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, \"bons mots\" and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.\nWilde was concerned about the effect of moralising on art; he believed in art's redemptive, developmental powers: \"Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.\" In his only political text, \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism\", he argued political conditions should establish this primacy \u2013 private property should be abolished and cooperation should be substituted for competition. He wrote \"Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by converting private property into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition, will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the material well-being of each member of the community. It will, in fact, give Life its proper basis and its proper environment\". At the same time, he stressed that the government most amenable to artists was no government at all. Wilde envisioned a society where mechanisation has freed human effort from the burden of necessity, effort which can instead be expended on artistic creation. George Orwell summarised, \"In effect, the world will be populated by artists, each striving after perfection in the way that seems best to him.\"\nThis point of view did not align him with the Fabians, intellectual socialists who advocated using state apparatus to change social conditions, nor did it endear him to the monied classes whom he had previously entertained. Hesketh Pearson, introducing a collection of Wilde's essays in 1950, remarked how \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism\" had been an inspirational text for revolutionaries in Tsarist Russia but laments that in the Stalinist era \"it is doubtful whether there are any uninspected places in which it could now be hidden\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMan is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.\n \u2014From \"The Critic as Artist\" published in \"Intentions\" (1891)\nWilde considered including this pamphlet and \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", his essay-story on Shakespeare's sonnets, in a new anthology in 1891, but eventually decided to limit it to purely aesthetic subjects. \"Intentions\" packaged revisions of four essays: \"The Decay of Lying\"; \"Pen, Pencil and Poison\"; \"The Truth of Masks\" (first published 1885); and \"The Critic as Artist\" in two parts. For Pearson the biographer, the essays and dialogues exhibit every aspect of Wilde's genius and character: wit, romancer, talker, lecturer, humanist and scholar and concludes that \"no other productions of his have as varied an appeal\". 1891 turned out to be Wilde's \"annus mirabilis\"; apart from his three collections he also produced his only novel.\n\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\".\nThe first version of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was published as the lead story in the July 1890 edition of \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\", along with five others. The story begins with a man painting a picture of Gray. When Gray, who has a \"face like ivory and rose leaves\", sees his finished portrait, he breaks down. Distraught that his beauty will fade while the portrait stays beautiful, he inadvertently makes a Faustian bargain in which only the painted image grows old while he stays beautiful and young. For Wilde, the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were its object. As Gray's portrait allows him to escape the corporeal ravages of his hedonism, Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty he saw in art with daily life.\nReviewers immediately criticised the novel's decadence and homosexual allusions; the \"Daily Chronicle\" for example, called it \"unclean\", \"poisonous\" and \"heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction\". Wilde vigorously responded, writing to the editor of the \"Scots Observer\", in which he clarified his stance on ethics and aesthetics in art \u2013 \"If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see its moral lesson.\" He nevertheless revised it extensively for book publication in 1891: six new chapters were added, some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised, and a preface was included consisting of twenty-two epigrams, such as \"Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.\"\nContemporary reviewers and modern critics have postulated numerous possible sources of the story, a search Jershua McCormack argues is futile because Wilde \"has tapped a root of Western folklore so deep and ubiquitous that the story has escaped its origins and returned to the oral tradition\". Wilde claimed the plot was \"an idea that is as old as the history of literature but to which I have given a new form\". Modern critic Robin McKie considered the novel to be technically mediocre, saying that the conceit of the plot had guaranteed its fame, but the device is never pushed to its full. On the other hand, Robert McCrum of \"The Guardian\" lists it among the 100 best novels ever written in English, calling it \"an arresting, and slightly camp, exercise in late-Victorian gothic\". The novel has been the subject of many adaptations to film and stage, and one of its most quoted lines, \"there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\", features in Monty Python's \"Oscar Wilde sketch\" in an episode of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\nTheatrical career: 1892\u20131895.\n\"Salom\u00e9\".\nThe 1891 census records the Wildes' residence at 16 Tite Street, where Oscar lived with his wife Constance and two sons. Not content with being better known than ever in London, though, he returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the \"salons litt\u00e9raires\", including the famous \"mardis\" of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, \"Vera; or, The Nihilists\" and \"The Duchess of Padua\", had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, \"Salom\u00e9\", written rapidly and in French.\nA tragedy, it tells the story of Salome, the stepdaughter of the tetrarch Herod Antipas, who, to her stepfather's dismay but mother's delight, requests the head of Jokanaan (John the Baptist) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the Dance of the Seven Veils. When Wilde returned to London just before Christmas the \"Paris Echo\" referred to him as \"le great event\" of the season. Rehearsals of the play, starring Sarah Bernhardt, began but the play was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain since it depicted biblical characters. \"Salome\" was published jointly in Paris and London in 1893 in the original French, and in London a year later in Lord Alfred Douglas's English translation with illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley, though it was not performed until 1896 in Paris, during Wilde's incarceration.\nComedies of society.\nWilde, who had first set out to irritate Victorian society with his dress and talking points, then to outrage it with \"Dorian Gray\", his novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally found a way to critique society on its own terms. \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James's Theatre, packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: \"it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure\". The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. The play was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics. The success of the play saw Wilde earn \u00a37,000 in the first year alone ().\nHis first hit play was followed by \"A Woman of No Importance\" in 1893, another Victorian comedy, revolving around the spectre of illegitimate births, mistaken identities and late revelations. Wilde was commissioned to write two more plays and \"An Ideal Husband\", written in 1894, followed in January 1895.\nPeter Raby said these essentially English plays were well-pitched: \"Wilde, with one eye on the dramatic genius of Ibsen, and the other on the commercial competition in London's West End, targeted his audience with adroit precision\".\nQueensberry family.\nIn mid-1891, Lionel Johnson introduced Wilde to Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's friend, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford. Known to his family and friends as \"Bosie\", he was a handsome and spoilt young man. An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas and by 1893 Wilde was infatuated with Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair. If Wilde was relatively indiscreet, even flamboyant, in the way he acted, Douglas was reckless in public. Wilde, who was earning up to \u00a3100 a week from his plays (his salary at \"The Woman's World\" had been \u00a36), indulged Douglas's every whim: material, artistic, or sexual.\nDouglas soon initiated Wilde into the Victorian underground of gay prostitution, and Wilde was introduced to a series of young working-class male prostitutes from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: Wilde would meet the boy, offer him gifts, dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room. Unlike Wilde's idealised relations with Ross, John Gray and Douglas, all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle, these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in \"De Profundis\" he wrote to Douglas that \"It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement ... I did not know that when they were to strike at me it was to be at another's piping and at another's pay.\"\nDouglas and some Oxford friends founded a journal, \"The Chameleon\", to which Wilde \"sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the \"Saturday Review\". \" was to come under attack six months later at Wilde's trial, where he was forced to defend the magazine to which he had sent his work. In any case, it became unique: \"The Chameleon\" was not published again.\nLord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, was known for his outspoken atheism, brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing. Queensberry, who feuded regularly with his son, confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred about the nature of their relationship several times, but Wilde was able to mollify him. In June 1894, he called on Wilde at 16 Tite Street, without an appointment, and clarified his stance: \"I do not say that you are it, but you look it, and pose at it, which is just as bad. And if I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you\", to which Wilde responded: \"I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight\". His account in \"De Profundis\" was less triumphant: \"It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father ... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out\". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had \"shown him the white feather\", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew that confronting him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.\n\"The Importance of Being Earnest\".\nWilde's final play again returns to the theme of switched identities: the play's two protagonists engage in \"bunburying\" (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows them to escape Victorian social mores. \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is even lighter in tone than Wilde's earlier comedies. While their characters often rise to serious themes in moments of crisis, \"Earnest\" lacks the by-now-stock Wildean characters: there is no \"woman with a past\", the principals are neither villainous nor cunning, simply idle , and the idealistic young women are not that innocent. Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence, \"Earnest\" lacks the self-conscious decadence found in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" and \"Salome\".\nThe play, now considered Wilde's masterpiece, was rapidly written in Wilde's artistic maturity in late 1894. It was first performed on 14 February 1895, at St James's Theatre in London, Wilde's second collaboration with George Alexander, the actor-manager. Both author and producer assiduously revised, prepared and rehearsed every line, scene and setting in the months before the premiere, creating a carefully constructed representation of late-Victorian society, yet simultaneously mocking it. During rehearsal Alexander requested that Wilde shorten the play from four acts to three, which the author did. Premieres at St James's seemed like \"brilliant parties\", and the opening of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" was no exception. Allan Aynesworth (who played Algernon) recalled to Hesketh Pearson, \"In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than [that] first night.\" \"Earnest\"'s immediate reception as Wilde's best work to date finally crystallised his fame into a solid artistic reputation. In a review of the play for \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" H. G. Wells wrote, \"More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine. Mr Oscar Wilde has decorated a humour that is Gilbertian with innumerable spangles of that wit that is all his own\". \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" remains his most popular play.\nWilde's professional success was mirrored by an escalation in his feud with Queensberry. Queensberry had planned to insult Wilde publicly by throwing a bouquet of rotting vegetables onto the stage; Wilde was tipped off and had Queensberry barred from entering the theatre. Fifteen weeks later Wilde was in prison.\nTrials.\n\"Wilde v Queensberry\".\nOn 18 February 1895, the Marquess of Queensberry left his calling card at Wilde's club, the Albemarle, inscribed: \"For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite [\"sic\"]\". Wilde, encouraged by Douglas and against the advice of his friends, initiated a private prosecution against Queensberry for defamatory libel, since the note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy.\nQueensberry was arrested for criminal libel, a charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison. Under the Libel Act 1843, Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true, and furthermore that there was some \"public benefit\" to having made the accusation openly. Queensberry's lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Wilde's homosexual liaisons.\nWilde's friends had advised him against the prosecution at a \"Saturday Review\" meeting at the Caf\u00e9 Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that \"they are going to prove sodomy against you\" and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying \"it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends\". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome a day or so before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde: that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster, as Wilde wrote in \"De Profundis\". Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play \"The Dark Lady of the Sonnets\".\nThe libel trial became a \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\" as salacious details of Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas began to appear in the press. A team of private detectives had directed Queensberry's lawyers, led by Edward Carson QC, to the world of the Victorian underground. Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to the crimes of which Wilde was accused.\nWilde's preliminary hearing took place at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, before the trial, which captivated Victorian society, opened at the Old Bailey in central London on 3 April 1895 before Mr. Justice Richard Henn Collins, a fellow Dubliner, amid scenes of near hysteria both in the press and the public galleries. The extent of the evidence massed against Wilde forced him to declare meekly, \"I am the prosecutor in this case\". Wilde's barrister, Sir Edward Clarke, opened the case by pre-emptively asking Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession. He characterised the first as a \"prose sonnet\" and admitted that the \"poetical language\" might seem strange to the court but claimed its intent was innocent. Wilde stated that the letters had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him, but he had refused, suggesting they should take the \u00a360 () offered, \"unusual for a prose piece of that length\". He claimed to regard the letters as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed.\nCarson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, cross-examined Wilde on how he perceived the moral content of his works. Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy, claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made, and that only \"brutes and illiterates\", whose views on art \"are incalculably stupid\", would make such judgements about art. Carson, a leading barrister, diverged from the normal practice of asking closed questions. Carson pressed Wilde on each topic from every angle, squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wilde's answers, removing them from their aesthetic context and portraying Wilde as evasive and decadent. While Wilde won the most laughs, Carson scored the most legal points. To undermine Wilde's credibility, and to justify Queensberry's description of Wilde as a \"posing somdomite\", Carson drew from the witness an admission of his capacity for \"posing\", by demonstrating that he had lied about his age under oath. Playing on this, he returned to the topic throughout his cross-examination. Carson also tried to justify Queensberry's characterisation by quoting from Wilde's novel, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", referring in particular to a scene in the second chapter, in which Lord Henry Wotton explains his decadent philosophy to Dorian, an \"innocent young man\", in Carson's words.\nCarson then moved to the factual evidence and questioned Wilde about his friendships with lower-class males, some of whom were as young as sixteen when Wilde had met them. Wilde admitted being on a first-name basis and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, \"Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately ugly\u00a0\u2013 I pitied him for it.\" Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: \"You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously\".\nIn his opening speech for the defence, Carson announced that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. On the advice of his lawyers, Wilde dropped the prosecution. Queensberry was found not guilty, as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was \"posing as a Somdomite [\"sic\"]\" was justified, \"true in substance and in fact\". Under the Libel Act 1843, Queensberry's acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence, which left Wilde bankrupt.\n\"Regina v Wilde\".\nAfter Wilde left the court, a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Pont Street, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner. Both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover and try to get a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, \"The train has gone. It's too late.\" On 6 April 1895, Wilde was arrested for \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning homosexual acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute). At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts and letters, so they would not be sequestered by the police. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway, where he received daily visits from Douglas.\nEvents moved quickly and his prosecution opened on 26 April 1895, before Mr Justice Charles. Wilde pleaded not guilty. He had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris, but Douglas complained bitterly, even wanting to give evidence; he was pressed to go and soon fled to the Hotel du Monde in France. Fearing persecution, Ross and many others also left the United Kingdom during this time. Under cross-examination, Wilde was at first hesitant, then spoke eloquently:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharles Gill (prosecuting): What is \"the love that dare not speak its name\"?\nWilde: \"The love that dare not speak its name\" in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art, like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as \"the love that dare not speak its name\", and on that account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an elder and a younger man, when the elder man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it, and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.\nThis response was counter-productive in a legal sense, for it only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour. The trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. Wilde's counsel, Sir Edward Clarke, was finally able to get a magistrate to allow Wilde and his friends to post bail. The Reverend Stewart Headlam put up most of the \u00a35,000 surety required by the court, having disagreed with Wilde's treatment by the press and the courts. Wilde was freed from Holloway and, shunning attention, went into hiding at the house of Ernest and Ada Leverson, two of his firm friends. Edward Carson approached Sir Frank Lockwood QC, the Solicitor General, and asked: \"Can we not let up on the fellow now?\" Lockwood answered that he would like to do so, but feared that the case had become too politicised to be dropped.\nThe final trial was presided over by Mr Justice Wills. On 25 May 1895, Wilde and Alfred Taylor were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years' hard labour. The judge described the sentence, the maximum allowed, as \"totally inadequate for a case such as this\", and that the case was \"the worst case I have ever tried\". Wilde's response of \"And I? May I say nothing, my Lord?\" was drowned out in cries of \"Shame\" in the courtroom.\nAlthough it is widely believed that the charges were related to Wilde's consensual activities, \"The Trials of Oscar Wilde\", which includes an original transcript of the libel trial (which came to light in 2000), suggests that he took advantage of teenagers. Antony Edmonds feels that Wilde would have faced prosecution today: \"For example, he certainly paid for sex with youths under the age of 18 which is a criminal offence. But even if his activities had led only to exposure and not to arrest, he would have been savagely pilloried in the media. Wilde was 39 when he seduced Alphonse Conway, and Conway was an inexperienced boy of 16\". Another teenager who said he had engaged in sex acts with Wilde, Walter Grainger, who was 16 at the time, said Wilde had threatened him with \"very serious trouble\" if he told anyone about their relationship. Marriageable age (and the age of consent) in England was 16 at the time, having been 13 as recently as 1885: the Offences against the Person Act 1875 raised the age of consent to 13 years old, and a decade later, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raised the age of consent to 16 years old, just ten years before the trial.\nImprisonment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen first I was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget who I was. It was ruinous advice. It is only by realising what I am that I have found comfort of any kind. Now I am advised by others to try on my release to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all. I know that would be equally fatal. It would mean that I would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace, and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else\u00a0\u2013 the beauty of the sun and moon, the pageant of the seasons, the music of daybreak and the silence of great nights, the rain falling through the leaves, or the dew creeping over the grass and making it silver\u00a0\u2013 would all be tainted for me, and lose their healing power, and their power of communicating joy. To regret one's own experiences is to arrest one's own development. To deny one's own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one's own life. It is no less than a denial of the soul.\n\u2014 \"De Profundis\"\nHaving been convicted in \"one of the first celebrity trials\", Wilde was incarcerated from 25 May 1895 to 18 May 1897.\nHe first entered Newgate Prison in London for processing, then was moved to Pentonville Prison, where the \"hard labour\" to which he had been sentenced consisted of many hours of walking a treadmill and picking oakum (separating the fibres in scraps of old navy ropes), and where prisoners were allowed to read only the Bible and \"The Pilgrim's Progress\".\nA few months later he was moved to Wandsworth Prison in London. Inmates there also followed the regimen of \"hard labour, hard fare and a hard bed\", which wore harshly on Wilde's delicate health. In November, he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger. His right ear drum was ruptured in the fall, an injury that later contributed to his death. He spent two months in the infirmary.\nRichard B. Haldane, the Liberal MP and reformer, visited Wilde and had him transferred in November to Reading Gaol, west of London on 23 November 1895. The transfer itself was the lowest point of his incarceration, as a crowd jeered and spat at him on the platform at Clapham Junction railway station (in 2019 a rainbow plaque was unveiled at the station recalling this event). He spent the remainder of his sentence at Reading, addressed and identified only as \"C.3.3\" \u2013 the occupant of the third cell on the third floor of C ward.\nAbout five months after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol (Jail), Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Wooldridge was sentenced to death and returned to Reading for his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896 \u2013 the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. From Wooldridge's hanging, Wilde later wrote \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\".\nWilde was not, at first, even allowed paper and pen, but Haldane eventually succeeded in allowing access to books and writing materials. Wilde requested, among others, the Bible in French; Italian and German grammars; some Ancient Greek texts; Dante's \"Divine Comedy\"; Joris-Karl Huysmans's new French novel about Christian redemption, \"En route\"; and essays by St Augustine, Cardinal Newman and Walter Pater.\nBetween January and March 1897 Wilde wrote a 50,000-word letter to Douglas. He was not allowed to send it but was permitted to take it with him when released from prison. In reflective mode, Wilde coldly examines his career to date, how he had been a colourful \"agent provocateur\" in Victorian society, his art, like his paradoxes, seeking to subvert as well as sparkle. His estimation of himself was: one who \"stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age\". It was from these heights that his life with Douglas began, and Wilde examines that particularly closely, repudiating him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity: he had not forgotten Douglas' remark, when he was ill, \"When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.\" Wilde blamed himself, though, for the ethical degradation of character that he allowed Douglas to bring about in him, and took responsibility for his own fall: \"I am here for having tried to put your father in prison.\" The first half concludes with Wilde forgiving Douglas, for his own sake as much as Douglas's. The second half of the letter traces Wilde's spiritual journey of redemption and fulfilment through his prison reading. He realised that his ordeal had filled his soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time.\nI wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world ... And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.\nWilde was released from prison on 19 May 1897 and sailed that evening for Dieppe, France. He never returned to the United Kingdom.\nOn his release, he gave the manuscript to Ross, who may or may not have carried out Wilde's instructions to send a copy to Douglas (who later denied having received it). The letter was partially published in 1905 as \"De Profundis\"; its complete and correct publication first occurred in 1962 in \"The Letters of Oscar Wilde\".\nFinal years: 1897\u20131900.\nExile.\nThough Wilde's health had suffered greatly from the harshness and diet of prison, he had a feeling of spiritual renewal. He immediately wrote to the Society of Jesus requesting a six-month Catholic retreat; when the request was denied, Wilde wept. \"I intend to be received into the Catholic Church before long\", Wilde told a journalist who asked about his religious intentions.\nWilde spent his last three years usually impoverished and in exile. He took the name \"Sebastian Melmoth\", after Saint Sebastian and the titular character of \"Melmoth the Wanderer\" (a Gothic novel by Charles Maturin, Wilde's great-uncle). Wilde wrote two long letters to the editor of the \"Daily Chronicle\", describing the brutal conditions of English prisons and advocating penal reform. His discussion of the dismissal of Warder Martin for giving biscuits to an anaemic child prisoner repeated the themes of the corruption and degeneration of punishment that he had earlier outlined in \"The Soul of Man under Socialism\".\nThe English writer Ernest Dowson, who had known Wilde for a number of years and was one of the few individuals to support him during and after his conviction, is said to have remade his acquaintance in Dieppe. In a story later repeated by W.B. Yeats, Dowson encouraged Wilde to visit a brothel and have sex with a female prostitute \"in order to repair his reputation\". According to Dowson, after the encounter Wilde \"said in a low voice 'The first these ten years, and it will be the last. It was like cold mutton ... But tell it in England, for it will entirely restore my character'.\"\nWilde spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in the seaside village of Berneval-le-Grand in northern France, where he wrote \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\", narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity. It moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them but rather the poem highlights the brutality of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line \"Yet each man kills the thing he loves\". He adopted the proletarian ballad form and the author was credited as \"C33\", Wilde's cell number in Reading Gaol. He suggested that it be published in \"Reynolds' Magazine\", \"because it circulates widely among the criminal classes\u00a0\u2013 to which I now belong\u00a0\u2013 for once I will be read by my peers\u00a0\u2013 a new experience for me\". It was an immediate roaring commercial success, going through seven editions in less than two years, only after which \"[Oscar Wilde]\" was added to the title page, though many in literary circles had known Wilde to be the author.\nAlthough Douglas had been the cause of his misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money \u2013 three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.\nWilde's final address was at the dingy H\u00f4tel d'Alsace (now known as L'H\u00f4tel), on rue des Beaux-Arts in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, Paris. \"This poverty really breaks one's heart: it is so \"sale\" [filthy], so utterly depressing, so hopeless. Pray do what you can\" he wrote to his publisher. He corrected and published \"An Ideal Husband\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", the proofs of which, according to Ellmann, show a man \"very much in command of himself and of the play\", but he refused to write anything else: \"I can write, but have lost the joy of writing\".\nHe wandered the boulevards alone and spent what little money he had on alcohol. A series of embarrassing chance encounters with hostile English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in better days, drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke, on one of his final trips outside, \"My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go\". On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross: \"Terribly weak. Please come\". His moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner had found Wilde very depressed after a nightmare. \"I dreamt that I had died, and was supping with the dead!\" \"I am sure,\" Turner replied, \"that you must have been the life and soul of the party.\" In early 1900 in Sicily, Oscar Wilde became involved in a relationship with the 15 year old Giuseppe Loverde.\nDeath.\nBy 25 November 1900, Wilde had developed meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\". Robbie Ross arrived on 29 November and sent for a priest; Wilde was conditionally baptised into the Catholic Church by Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin. Fr Dunne recorded the baptism:\nAs the \"voiture\" rolled through the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part repeated to me ... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me as best he could while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious ... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments ... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.\nWilde died of meningitis on 30 November 1900. Different opinions are given as to the cause of the disease: Richard Ellmann judged it was syphilitic; Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson, thought this to be a misconception, noting that Wilde's meningitis followed a surgical intervention, perhaps a mastoidectomy; Wilde's physicians, Paul Cleiss and A'Court Tucker, reported that the condition stemmed from an old suppuration of the right ear (from the prison injury, see above) treated for several years (\"\") and made no allusion to syphilis.\nBurial.\nWilde was initially buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, inside the city. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment to be made for his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia, which were initially censored by French authorities with a golden leaf. The genitals have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace them. In 2011, the tomb was cleaned of the many lipstick marks left there by admirers and a glass barrier was installed to prevent further marks or damage.\nThe epitaph is a verse from \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\",\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\nPity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourners will be outcast men,\nAnd outcasts always mourn.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nPosthumous pardon.\nIn 2017, Wilde was among an estimated 50,000 men who were pardoned for homosexual acts that were no longer considered offences under the Policing and Crime Act 2017 (homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967). The 2017 Act implemented what is known informally as the Alan Turing law.\nIn 2025, the British Library restored Wilde's library card after the conviction-related revocation of the card 130 years before. The new card was accepted by Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland.\nHonours.\nWilde is generally considered by most literary commentators to be the greatest playwright of the Victorian era. Several honours have been erected in his memory. On 14 February 1995, Wilde was commemorated with a stained-glass window at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. The memorial, above the monument to Geoffrey Chaucer, was unveiled by his grandson Merlin Holland, while Sir John Gielgud read from the final part of \"De Profundis\" and Dame Judi Dench read an extract from \"The Importance of Being Earnest\".\nIn 2014, Wilde was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\".\nThe Oscar Wilde Temple, an installation by visual artists McDermott &amp; McGough, opened in 2017 in cooperation with Church of the Village in New York City, then moved to Studio Voltaire in London the next year.\nBiographies.\nWilde's life has been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, \"Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions\" (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. \"Oscar Wilde and Myself\" (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that \"De Profundis\" was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in \"Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up\" (1939) and his \"Autobiography\", Douglas was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote \"Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit\" (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir \"Son of Oscar Wilde\", which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Later on, I think everyone will recognise his achievements; his plays and essays will endure. Of course, you may think with others that his personality and conversation were far more wonderful than anything he wrote, so that his written works give only a pale reflection of his power. Perhaps that is so, and of course, it will be impossible to reproduce what is gone forever.\u2014\u200a\n\"Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study\" by Arthur Ransome was published in 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently, Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. At the High Court in London in April 1913, Douglas lost the libel action after a reading of \"De Profundis\" refuted his claims.\nRichard Ellmann wrote his 1987 biography \"Oscar Wilde\", for which he posthumously won a National (US) Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 and a Pulitzer Prize in 1989. In 1997, it was the basis for the British film \"Wilde\", directed by Brian Gilbert and starring Stephen Fry as the title character.\nNeil McKenna's 2003 biography, \"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde\", offers an exploration of Wilde's sexuality. Often speculative in nature, it was widely criticised for its pure conjecture and lack of scholarly rigour. Thomas Wright's \"Oscar's Books\" (2008) explores Wilde's reading from his childhood in Dublin to his death in Paris. After tracking down many books that once belonged to Wilde's Tite Street library (dispersed at the time of his trials), Wright was the first to examine Wilde's marginalia.\nIn 2018, Matthew Sturgis' \"Oscar: A Life\", was published in London. The book incorporates rediscovered letters and other documents and is the most extensively researched biography of Wilde to appear since 1988. Rupert Everett starred as Wilde in, and wrote the screenplay for, \"The Happy Prince\" (2018), a biographical drama film about Wilde following his release from prison.\nParisian literati also produced several biographies and monographs on him. Andr\u00e9 Gide wrote \"In Memoriam, Oscar Wilde\" and Wilde also features in his journals. Thomas Louis, who had earlier translated books on Wilde into French, produced his own \"L'esprit d'Oscar Wilde\" in 1920. Modern books include Philippe Jullian's \"Oscar Wilde\", and \"L'affaire Oscar Wilde, ou, Du danger de laisser la justice mettre le nez dans nos draps\" (\"The Oscar Wilde Affair, or, On the Danger of Allowing Justice to put its Nose in our Sheets\") by Odon Vallet, a French religious historian.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While some instances clearly expressed popular anger at the citizen, ostracism was often used preemptively as a way of neutralizing someone thought to be a threat to the state or a potential tyrant. The word \n\"ostracism\" continues to be used for various forms of shunning.\nProcedure.\nThe term \"ostracism\" is derived from the pottery shards that were used as voting tokens, called \"ostraka\" (singular: \"ostrakon\"; ) in Greek. Broken pottery, abundant and virtually free, served as a kind of scrap paper (in contrast to papyrus, which was imported from Egypt as a high-quality writing surface, and too costly to be disposable).\nEach year the Athenians were asked in the assembly whether they wished to hold an ostracism. The question was put in the sixth of the ten months used for state business under the democracy (January or February in the modern Gregorian calendar). The process of ostracism could be divided into five elements according to Philochorus: 1) It was a two-stage process, 2) it was open to all Athens citizens, 3) it was overseen by outside officials, 4) must meet a specific quorum, 5) regulated penalties.\nThe majority of citizen must come to a unified agreement to start the procedures of Ostracism. If they voted \"yes\", then an ostracism would be held two months later. In a section of the agora set off and suitably barriered that was called perischoinisma (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1), citizens gave the name of those they wished to be ostracized to a scribe, as many of them were illiterate, and they then scratched the name on pottery shards. The shards were piled up facing down, so the votes would remain anonymous. Ostracism served as a political tool to eliminate rivals. It also helped to reflect the Athenians' belief in the importance of civic engagement and the power of collective decision making. Nine \"Archontes\" and the council of the five hundred supervised the process while the \"Archontes\" counted the \"ostraka\" submitted and sorted the names into separate piles. The person whose pile contained the most \"ostraka\" would be banished, provided that a quorum was met. According to Plutarch, the ostracism was considered valid if the total number of votes cast was at least 6,000; according to a fragment of Philochorus, at least 6,000 votes had to be cast against the person who was to be banished. Plutarch's evidence for a quorum of 6,000 agrees with the number required for grants of citizenship in the following century and is generally preferred.\nThe person newly ostracized had ten days to leave the city. If he attempted to return, the penalty was death. The property of the man banished was not confiscated and there was no loss of status. After ten years, he was allowed to return without stigma. It was possible for the assembly to recall an ostracized person ahead of time; before the Persian invasion of 479 BC, an amnesty was declared under which at least two ostracised leaders\u2014Pericles' father, Xanthippus, and Aristides 'the Just'\u2014are known to have returned. Similarly, Cimon, ostracised in 461 BC, was recalled during an emergency.\nHistory.\nOstracism was not in use throughout the entire period of Athenian democracy (circa 506\u2013322 BC), but only occurred in the fifth century BC. The standard account, found in Aristotle's Constitution of the Athenians 22.3, attributes the establishment to Cleisthenes, a pivotal reformer in the creation of the democracy. In that case, ostracism would have been in place from around 506 BC. The first victim of the practice was not expelled until 487 BC\u2014nearly 20 years later. Over the course of the next 60 years some 12 or more individuals followed him. The list may not be complete. The list of known ostracisms is as follows:\nAround 12,000 political ostraka have been excavated in the Athenian agora and in the Kerameikos. The second victim, Cleisthenes' nephew Megacles, is named by 4647 of these, but for a second undated ostracism not listed above. The known ostracisms seem to fall into three distinct phases: the 480s BC, mid-century 461\u2013443 BC and finally the years 417\u2013415: this roughly correlates with the clustering of known expulsions, although Themistocles before 471 may count as an exception. This may suggest that ostracism fell in and out of fashion.\nThe last known ostracism was that of Hyperbolus in circa 417 BC. There is no sign of its use after the Peloponnesian War, when democracy was restored after the oligarchic coup of the Thirty had collapsed in 403 BC. However, while ostracism was not an active feature of the fourth-century version of democracy, it remained; the question was put to the assembly each year, but they did not wish to hold one.\nDistinction from other Athenian democratic processes.\nOstracism was crucially different from Athenian law at the time; there was no charge and no defense could be mounted by the person expelled. The two stages of the procedure ran in the reverse order from that used under almost any trial system\u2014it is as if a jury were first asked \"Do you want to find someone guilty?\", and subsequently asked \"Whom do you wish to accuse?\". The judicial framework is perhaps the institution's most peculiar feature: it can take place at most once a year, and only for one person. It resembles the Greek \"pharmakos\" or scapegoat\u2014though in contrast, \"pharmakos\" generally ejected a lowly member of the community.\nA further distinction between these two modes (and not obvious from a modern perspective) is that ostracism was an automatic procedure that required no initiative from any individual, with the vote simply occurring on the wish of the electorate\u2014a diffuse exercise of power. By contrast, an Athenian trial needed the initiative of a particular citizen-prosecutor. While prosecution often led to a counterattack (or was a counterattack itself), no such response was possible in the case of ostracism as responsibility lay with the polity as a whole. In contrast to a trial, ostracism generally reduced political tension rather than increased it.\nAlthough ten years of exile may have been challenging for Athenians, it was a lenient punishment compared to the sentences that courts could impose. When dealing with politicians held to be acting against the interests of the people, Athenian juries could inflict severe penalties such as death, unpayably large fines, confiscation of property, permanent exile, or loss of citizens' rights through \"atimia\".\"\" Further, the elite Athenians who suffered ostracism were rich or noble men who had connections or \"xenoi\" in the wider Greek world and who, unlike genuine exiles, were able to access their income in Attica from abroad. In Plutarch, following the anti-democratic thought common in elite sources, people might be recalled early, thus being an example of the inconsistency of majoritarianism characteristic of Athenian democracy. However, ten years of exile usually resolved whatever had prompted the expulsion. Ostracism was a pragmatic measure; the concept of serving out the full sentence did not apply as it was a preventive measure, not a punitive one.\nAn example of the practicalities of ostracism comes from the cache of 190 ostraka discovered dumped in a well next to the acropolis. From the handwriting, they appear to have been written by fourteen individuals and bear the name of Themistocles, ostracised before 471 BC, and were evidently meant for distribution to voters. This was not necessarily evidence of electoral fraud (being no worse than modern voting instruction cards), but their being dumped in the well may suggest that their creators wished to hide them. If so, these ostraka provide an example of organized groups attempting to influence the outcome of ostracisms. The two-month gap between the first and second phases would have allowed for such a campaign.\nThere is another interpretation, however, according to which these ostraka were prepared beforehand by enterprising businessmen who offered them for sale to citizens who could not easily inscribe the desired names for themselves or who simply wished to save time.\nThe two-month gap is a key feature in the institution, much as in elections under modern liberal democracies. It prevented the candidate for expulsion being chosen out of immediate anger, although an Athenian general such as Cimon would have not wanted to lose a battle the week before such a second vote. It opened a period for discussion (or perhaps agitation), whether informally in daily talk or public speeches before the Athenian assembly or Athenian courts. In this process a consensus, or rival consensuses, might emerge.\nPurpose.\nBecause ostracism was carried out by thousands of people over many decades of an evolving political situation and culture, it did not serve one monolithic purpose. Observations can be made about the outcomes, as well as the initial purpose for which it was created.\nThe first instance of people ostracized in the decade after the defeat of the first Persian invasion at Marathon in 490 BC were related or connected to the tyrant Peisistratos, who had controlled Athens for 36 years up to 527 BC. After his son Hippias was deposed with Spartan help in 510 BC, the family sought refuge with the Persians. Nearly twenty years later Hippias landed with an invasion force at Marathon. Tyranny and Persian aggression were paired threats facing the new democratic regime at Athens, and ostracism was used against both.\nTyranny and democracy had arisen at Athens out of clashes between regional and factional groups organized around politicians, including Cleisthenes. As a reaction, in many of its features the democracy strove to reduce the role of factions as the focus of citizen loyalties. Ostracism may have been intended to work in the same to similar ends: by temporarily decapitating a faction, it could help defuse confrontations that threatened the order of the State.\nIn later decades when the threat of tyranny was remote, ostracism seems to have been used to decide between radically opposed policies. For instance, in 443 BC Thucydides, son of Melesias (not to be confused with the historian of the same name) was ostracized. He led an aristocratic opposition to Athenian imperialism and in particular to Pericles' building program on the acropolis, which was funded by taxes created for the wars against the Achaemenid Empire. By expelling Thucydides the Athenian people sent a clear message about the direction of Athenian policy. Similar but controversial claims have been made about the ostracism of Cimon in 461 BC.\nThe motives of individual voting citizens cannot be known. Many of the surviving ostraka name people otherwise unattested. They may well be just someone the submitter disliked, and voted for in a moment of private spite. Some ostraka bear the word \"Limos\" (hunger) instead of a human name. As such, it may be seen as a secular, civic variant of Athenian curse tablets, studied in scholarly literature under the Latin name \"defixiones\", where small dolls were wrapped in lead sheets written with curses and then buried, sometimes stuck through with nails for good measure.\nIn one anecdote about Aristides, known as \"the Just\", who was ostracised in 482, an illiterate citizen, not recognising him, asked him to write the name Aristides on his ostrakon. When Aristides asked why, the man replied it was because he was sick of hearing him being called \"the Just\". Perhaps merely the sense that someone had become too arrogant or prominent was enough to get someone's name onto an ostrakon. Ostracism rituals could have also been an attempt to dissuade people from covertly committing murder or assassination of intolerable or emerging individuals of power so as to create an open arena or outlet for those harbouring primal frustrations and urges or political motivations. The solution for murder, in Gregory H. Padowitz's theory, would then be \"ostracism\" which would ultimately be beneficial for all parties\u2014the ostracised individual would live and get a second chance and society would be spared feuds, civil war, political tensions and/or murder.\nFall into disuse.\nThe last ostracism, that of Hyperbolos in or near 417 BC, is narrated by Plutarch in three separate \"lives\": Hyperbolos is pictured urging the people to expel one of his rivals, but they, Nicias and Alcibiades, laying aside their hostility for a moment, use their influence to have him ostracised instead. According to Plutarch, the people then become disgusted with ostracism and abandoned the procedure forever.\nIn part ostracism lapsed as a procedure at the end of the fifth century because it was replaced by the \"graphe paranomon\", a regular court action under which a much larger number of politicians might be targeted, instead of just one a year as with ostracism, and with greater severity.\nIt may already seemed like an anachronism as factional alliances organised around important men became less significant and power was more specifically located in the interaction of the individual speaker with the power of the assembly and the courts. The threat to the democratic system in the late fifth century came not from tyranny but from oligarchic coups, threats of which became prominent after two brief seizures of power, in 411 BC by \"the Four Hundred\" and in 404 BC by \"the Thirty\", which were not dependent on single powerful individuals. Ostracism was not an effective defence against the oligarchic threat and it was not so used.\nAnalogues.\nOther cities are known to have set up forms of ostracism on the Athenian model, namely Megara, Miletos, Argos and Syracuse, Sicily. In the last of these it was referred to as \"petalismos\", because the names were written on olive leaves. Little is known about these institutions. Furthermore, pottery shards identified as \"ostraka\" have been found in Chersonesos Taurica, leading historians to the conclusion that a similar institution existed there as well, in spite of the silence of the ancient records on that count.\nA similar modern practice is the recall election, in which the electoral body removes its representation from an elected officer.\nUnlike under modern voting procedures, the Athenians did not have to adhere to a strict format for the inscribing of \"ostraka\". Many extant \"ostraka\" show that it was possible to write expletives, short epigrams or cryptic injunctions beside the name of the candidate without invalidating the vote. For example:\nModern usage.\nOstracism is evident in several animal species, as well as in modern human interactions. The social psychologist Kipling Williams defines ostracism as \"any act or acts of ignoring and excluding of an individual or groups by an individual or a group\" without necessarily involving \"acts of verbal or physical abuse\".\nWilliams suggests that the most common form of ostracism is silent treatment, wherein refusing to communicate with a person effectively ignores and excludes them.\nComputer networks.\nOstracism in the context of computer networks (such as the Internet) is termed \"cyberostracism\". In email communication, in particular, it is relatively easy to engage in silent treatment, in the form of \"unanswered emails\" or \"ignored emails\". Being ostracised on social media is seen to be threatening to the fundamental human needs of belonging, self-esteem, control and meaningful existence. Cyber-rejection (receiving \"dislikes\") caused more threat to the need of belonging and self-esteem, and lead to social withdrawal. Cyber-ostracism (being ignored or receiving fewer \"likes\") conversely lead to more prosocial behavior. Ostracism is thought to be associated with social media disorder.\nReactions.\nWilliams and his colleagues have charted responses to ostracism in some five thousand cases, and found two distinctive patterns of response. The first is increased group-conformity, in a quest for re-admittance; the second is to become more provocative and hostile to the group, seeking attention rather than acceptance.\nAge.\nOlder adults report experiencing ostracism less frequently, with a particular dip being around the age of retirement. Regardless of age, ostracism is strongly associated with negative emotions, reduced life satisfaction and dysfunctional social behaviour.\nWhistleblowing.\nResearch suggests that ostracism is a common retaliatory strategy used by organizations in response to whistleblowing. Kipling Williams, in a survey on US whistleblowers, found that all respondents reported post-whistleblowing ostracism. Alexander Brown similarly found that post-whistleblowing ostracism is a common response, and indeed describes ostracism as a form of \"covert\" reprisal, as it is normally so difficult to identify and investigate.\nGhahr and \u00c2shti.\nGhahr and \u00c2shti is a culture-specific Iranian form of personal shunning, most frequently of another family member in Iran. While modern Western concepts of ostracism are based upon enforcing conformity within a societally-recognized group, Ghahr is a private, family-orientated affair of conflict or display of anger that is never disclosed to the public at large, as to do so would be a breach of Iranian social etiquette.\n\"Ghahr\" is avoidance of a lower-ranking family member who has committed a perceived insult. It is one of several ritualised social customs of Iranian culture.\n\"Gozasht\" means 'tolerance, understanding and a desire or willingness to forgive' and is an essential component of Ghahr and \u00c2shti for the psychological needs of closure and cognition.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More than 3.8 million Axis troops invaded the western Soviet Union along a front, with the main goal of capturing territory up to a line between Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan, known as the A\u2013A line. The attack became the largest and costliest military offensive in human history, with around 10 million combatants taking part in the opening phase and over 8 million casualties by the end of the operation on 5 December 1941. It marked a major escalation of World War II, opened the Eastern Front\u2014the largest and deadliest land war in history\u2014and brought the Soviet Union into the Allied powers.\nThe operation, code-named after the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (\"red beard\"), put into action Nazi Germany's ideological goals of eradicating communism and conquering the western Soviet Union to repopulate it with Germans under , which planned for the removal of the native Slavic peoples by mass deportation to Siberia, Germanisation, enslavement, and genocide. The material targets of the invasion were the agricultural and mineral resources of territories such as Ukraine and Byelorussia and oil fields in the Caucasus. The Axis eventually captured five million Soviet Red Army troops on the Eastern Front and deliberately starved to death or otherwise killed 3.3 million prisoners of war, as well as millions of civilians. Mass shootings and gassing operations, carried out by German paramilitary death squads and collaborators, murdered over a million Soviet Jews as part of the Holocaust. \nIn the two years leading up to the invasion, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes. Following the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in July 1940, the German High Command began planning an invasion of the country, which was approved by Adolf Hitler in December. In early 1941, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, despite receiving intelligence about an imminent attack, did not order a mobilization of the Red Army, fearing that it might provoke Germany. As a result, Soviet forces were largely caught unprepared when the invasion began, with many units positioned poorly and understrength.\nThe invasion began on 22 June 1941 with a massive ground and air assault. The main part of Army Group South invaded from occupied Poland on 22 June, and on 2 July was joined by a combination of German and Romanian forces attacking from Romania. Kiev was captured on 19 September, which was followed by the captures of Kharkov on 24 October and Rostov-on-Don on 20 November, by which time most of Crimea had been captured and Sevastopol put under siege. Army Group North overran the Baltic lands, and on 8 September 1941 began a siege of Leningrad with Finnish forces that ultimately lasted until 1944. Army Group Centre, the strongest of the three groups, captured Smolensk in late July 1941 before beginning a drive on Moscow on 2 October. Facing logistical problems with supply, slowed by muddy terrain, not fully outfitted for Russia's brutal winter, and coping with determined Soviet resistance, Army Group Centre's offensive stalled at the city's outskirts by 5 December, at which point the Soviets began a major counteroffensive.\nThe failure of Operation Barbarossa reversed the fortunes of Nazi Germany. Operationally, it achieved significant victories and occupied some of the most important economic regions of the Soviet Union, captured millions of prisoners, and inflicted heavy casualties. The German high command anticipated a quick collapse of resistance as in the invasion of Poland, but instead the Red Army absorbed the German \"Wehrmacht\"'s strongest blows and bogged it down in a war of attrition for which Germany was unprepared. Following the heavy losses and logistical strain of Barbarossa, German forces could no longer attack along the entire front, and their subsequent operations\u2014such as Case Blue in 1942 and Operation Citadel in 1943\u2014ultimately failed.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nNaming.\nThe theme of Barbarossa had long been used by the Nazi Party as part of their political imagery, though this was really a continuation of the glorification of the famous Crusader king by German nationalists since the 19th century. According to a Germanic medieval legend, revived in the 19th century by the nationalistic tropes of German Romanticism, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa\u2014who drowned in Asia Minor while leading the Third Crusade\u2014was not dead but asleep, along with his knights, in a cave in the Kyffh\u00e4user mountains in Thuringia, and would awaken in the hour of Germany's greatest need and restore the nation to its former glory. Originally, the invasion of the Soviet Union was codenamed \"Operation Otto\" (alluding to Holy Roman Emperor Otto the Great's expansive campaigns in Eastern Europe), but Hitler had the name changed to \"Operation Barbarossa\" in December 1940. Hitler had in July 1937 praised Barbarossa as the emperor who first expressed Germanic cultural ideas and carried them to the outside world through his imperial mission. For Hitler, the name Barbarossa signified his belief that the conquest of the Soviet Union would usher in the Nazi \"Thousand-Year Reich\".\nRacial policies of Nazi Germany.\nAs early as 1925, Adolf Hitler vaguely declared in his political manifesto and autobiography \"Mein Kampf\" that he would invade the Soviet Union, asserting that the German people needed to secure ('living space') in which to thrive for generations to come. On 10 February 1939, Hitler told his army commanders that the next war would be \"purely a war of ['worldviews']... totally a war of peoples, a racial war\". On 23 November, once World War II had already started, Hitler declared that \"racial war has broken out and this war shall determine who shall govern Europe, and with it, the world\". The racial policy of Nazi Germany portrayed the Soviet Union (and all of Eastern Europe) as populated by non-Aryan ('sub-humans'), ruled by Jewish Bolshevik conspirators. Hitler claimed in \"Mein Kampf\" that Germany's destiny was to follow the ('drive to the East') as it did \"600 years ago\" (see ). Accordingly, it was a partially secret but well-documented Nazi policy to kill, deport, or enslave the majority of Russian and other Slavic populations and repopulate the land west of the Urals with Germanic peoples, under (General Plan for the East). The Nazis' belief in their ethnic superiority pervades official records and pseudoscientific articles in German periodicals, on topics such as \"how to deal with alien populations.\"\nWhile older histories tended to emphasize the myth of the \"clean \"Wehrmacht,\"\" upholding its honor in the face of Hitler's fanaticism, historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster notes that \"In fact, the military commanders were caught up in the ideological character of the conflict, and involved in its implementation as willing participants\". Before and during the invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops were indoctrinated with anti-Bolshevik, anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic ideology via movies, radio, lectures, books, and leaflets. Likening the Soviets to the forces of Genghis Khan, Hitler told the Croatian military leader Slavko Kvaternik that the \"Mongolian race\" threatened Europe. Following the invasion, many \"Wehrmacht\" officers told their soldiers to target \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans,\" the \"Mongol hordes,\" the \"Asiatic flood\" and the \"Red beast.\" Nazi propaganda portrayed the war against the Soviet Union as an ideological war between German National Socialism and Jewish Bolshevism and a racial war between the disciplined Germans and the Jewish, Romani and Slavic . An 'order from the F\u00fchrer' stated that the paramilitary SS , which closely followed the \"Wehrmacht\"'s advance, were to execute all Soviet functionaries who were \"less valuable Asiatics, Gypsies and Jews.\" Six months into the invasion of the Soviet Union, the had murdered more than 500,000 Soviet Jews, a figure greater than the number of Red Army soldiers killed in battle by then. German army commanders cast Jews as the major cause behind the \"partisan struggle.\" The main view of German troops was \"[w]here there's a partisan, there's a Jew, and where there's a Jew, there's a partisan\", or \"[t]he partisan is where the Jew is.\" Many of them also saw the war in racial terms, and regarded their Soviet enemies as sub-human.\nAfter the war began, the Nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign slaves. There were regulations enacted against the ('Eastern workers') that included the death penalty for sexual relations with a German. Heinrich Himmler, in his secret memorandum, \"Reflections on the Treatment of Peoples of Alien Races in the East\" (dated 25 May 1940), outlined the Nazi plans for the non-German populations in the East. Himmler believed the Germanisation process in Eastern Europe would be complete when \"in the East dwell only men with truly German, Germanic blood.\"\nThe Nazi secret plan , prepared in 1941 and confirmed in 1942, called for a \"new order of ethnographical relations\" in the territories occupied by Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe. It envisaged ethnic cleansing, executions and enslavement of the populations of conquered countries, with very small percentages undergoing Germanisation, expulsion into the depths of Russia or other fates, while the conquered territories would be Germanised. The plan had two parts, the ('small plan'), which covered actions to be taken during the war and the ('large plan'), which covered policies after the war was won, to be implemented gradually over 25 to 30 years.\nA speech given by General Erich Hoepner demonstrates the dissemination of the Nazi racial plan, as he informed the 4th Panzer Group that the war against the Soviet Union was \"an essential part of the German people's struggle for existence\" (), also referring to the imminent battle as the \"old struggle of Germans against Slavs\" and even stated, \"the struggle must aim at the annihilation of today's Russia and must, therefore, be waged with unparalleled harshness.\" Hoepner also added that the Germans were fighting for \"the defence of European culture against Moscovite\u2013Asiatic inundation, and the repulse of Jewish Bolshevism\u00a0... No adherents of the present Russian-Bolshevik system are to be spared.\" Walther von Brauchitsch also told his subordinates that troops should view the war as a \"struggle between two different races and [should] act with the necessary severity.\" Racial motivations were central to Nazi ideology and played a key role in planning for Operation Barbarossa since both Jews and communists were considered equivalent enemies of the Nazi state. Nazi imperialist ambitions rejected the common humanity of both groups, declaring the supreme struggle for to be a ('war of annihilation').\nGerman-Soviet relations of 1939\u201340.\nOn August 23, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact in Moscow known as the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. A secret protocol to the pact outlined an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union on the division of the eastern European border states between their respective \"spheres of influence,\" Soviet Union and Germany would partition Poland in the event of an invasion by Germany, and the Soviets would be allowed to overrun Finland, Estonia, Latvia and the region of Bessarabia. On 23 August 1939 the rest of the world learned of this pact but were unaware of the provisions to partition Poland. The pact stunned the world because of the parties' earlier mutual hostility and their conflicting ideologies. The conclusion of this pact was followed by the German invasion of Poland on 1 September that triggered the outbreak of World War II in Europe, then the Soviet invasion of Poland that led to the annexation of the eastern part of the country. As a result of the pact, Germany and the Soviet Union maintained reasonably strong diplomatic relations for two years and fostered an important economic relationship. The countries entered a trade pact in 1940 by which the Soviets received German military equipment and trade goods in exchange for raw materials, such as oil and wheat, to help the German war effort by circumventing the British blockade of Germany.\nDespite the parties' ostensibly cordial relations, each side was highly suspicious of the other's intentions. For instance, the Soviet invasion of Bukovina in June 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with Germany. After Germany entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, it began negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact. After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12 to 14 November 1940, Ribbentrop presented a draft treaty for a Soviet entry into the Axis. However, Hitler had no intention of allowing the Soviet Union into the Axis and in an order stated, \"Political conversations designed to clarify the attitude of Russia in the immediate future have been started. Regardless of the outcome of these conversations, all preparations for the East previously ordered orally are to be continued. [Written] directives on that will follow as soon as the basic elements of the army's plan for the operation have been submitted to me and approved by me.\" There would be no \"long-term agreement with Russia\" given that the Nazis intended to go to war with them; but the Soviets approached the negotiations differently and were willing to make huge economic concessions to secure a relationship under general terms acceptable to the Germans just a year before. On 25 November 1940, the Soviet Union offered a written counter-proposal to join the Axis if Germany would agree to refrain from interference in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, but Germany did not respond. As both sides began colliding with each other in Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they did sign a border and commercial agreement addressing several open issues in January 1941. According to historian Robert Service, Joseph Stalin was convinced that the overall military strength of the Soviet Union was such that he had nothing to fear and anticipated an easy victory should Germany attack; moreover, Stalin believed that since the Germans were still fighting the British in the west, Hitler would be unlikely to open up a two-front war and subsequently delayed the reconstruction of defensive fortifications in the border regions. When German soldiers swam across the Bug River to warn the Red Army of an impending attack, they were shot as enemy agents. Some historians believe that Stalin, despite providing an amicable front to Hitler, did not wish to remain allies with Germany. Rather, Stalin might have had intentions to break off from Germany and proceed with his own campaign against Germany to be followed by one against the rest of Europe. Other historians contend that Stalin did not plan for such an attack in June 1941, given the parlous state of the Red Army at the time of the invasion.\nAxis invasion plans.\nStalin's reputation as a brutal dictator contributed both to the Nazis' justification of their assault and to their expectations of success, as Stalin's Great Purge of the 1930s had executed many competent and experienced military officers, leaving Red Army leadership weaker than their German adversary. The Nazis often emphasized the Soviet regime's brutality when targeting the Slavs with propaganda. They also claimed that the Red Army was preparing to attack the Germans, and their own invasion was thus presented as a pre-emptive strike.\nHitler also utilised the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans as one of the pretexts for the invasion. While no concrete plans had yet been made, Hitler told one of his generals in June 1940 that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for a \"final showdown\" with Bolshevism. With the successful end to the campaign in France, General Erich Marcks was assigned the task of drawing up the initial invasion plans of the Soviet Union. The first battle plans were entitled \"Operation Draft East\" (colloquially known as the \"Marcks Plan\"). His report advocated the A\u2013A line as the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union. This assault would extend from the northern city of Arkhangelsk on the Arctic Sea through Gorky and Rostov to the port city of Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga on the Caspian Sea. The report concluded that\u2014once established\u2014this military border would reduce the threat to Germany from attacks by enemy bombers.\nAlthough Hitler was warned by many high-ranking military officers, such as Friedrich Paulus, that occupying Western Russia would create \"more of a drain than a relief for Germany's economic situation,\" he anticipated compensatory benefits such as the demobilisation of entire divisions to relieve the acute labour shortage in German industry, the exploitation of Ukraine as a reliable and immense source of agricultural products, the use of forced labour to stimulate Germany's overall economy and the expansion of territory to improve Germany's efforts to isolate the United Kingdom. Hitler was further convinced that Britain would sue for peace once the Germans triumphed in the Soviet Union, and if they did not, he would use the resources gained in the East to defeat the British Empire.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We only have to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.\u2014\u200a\nHitler received the final military plans for the invasion on 5 December 1940, which the German High Command had been working on since July 1940, under the codename \"Operation Otto.\" Upon reviewing the plans, Hitler formally committed Germany to the invasion when he issued on 18 December 1940, where he outlined the precise manner in which the operation was to be carried out. Hitler also renamed the operation to \"Barbarossa\" in honor of medieval Emperor Friedrich I of the Holy Roman Empire, a leader of the Third Crusade in the 12th century. The Barbarossa Decree, issued by Hitler on 30 March 1941, supplemented the Directive by decreeing that the war against the Soviet Union would be one of annihilation and legally sanctioned the eradication of all Communist political leaders and intellectual elites in Eastern Europe. The invasion was tentatively set for May 1941.\nAccording to a 1978 essay by German historian Andreas Hillgruber, the invasion plans drawn up by the German military elite were substantially coloured by hubris, stemming from the rapid defeat of France at the hands of the \"invincible\" \"Wehrmacht\" and by traditional German stereotypes of Russia as a primitive, backward \"Asiatic\" country. Red Army soldiers were considered brave and tough, but the officer corps was held in contempt. The leadership of the \"Wehrmacht\" paid little attention to politics, culture, and the considerable industrial capacity of the Soviet Union, in favour of a very narrow military view. Hillgruber argued that because these assumptions were shared by the entire military elite, Hitler was able to push through with a \"war of annihilation\" that would be waged in the most inhumane fashion possible with the complicity of \"several military leaders,\" even though it was quite clear that this would be in violation of all accepted norms of warfare.\nEven so, in autumn 1940, some high-ranking German military officials drafted a memorandum to Hitler on the dangers of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They argued that the eastern territories (Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic) would only end up as a further economic burden for Germany. It was further argued that the Soviets, in their current bureaucratic form, were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany politically either. Hitler, solely focused on his ultimate ideological goal of eliminating the Soviet Union and Communism, disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man Hermann G\u00f6ring, the chief of the \"Luftwaffe\", that he would no longer listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with the USSR. It is speculated that this was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany in the event of an invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first blow; Thomas revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes. The Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939\u201340 also convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter and therefore, adequate preparations such as the distribution of warm clothing and winterisation of important military equipment like tanks and artillery, were not made.\nFurther to Hitler's Directive, G\u00f6ring's Green Folder, issued in March 1941, laid out the agenda for the next step after the anticipated quick conquest of the Soviet Union. The Hunger Plan outlined how entire urban populations of conquered territories were to be starved to death, thus creating an agricultural surplus to feed Germany and urban space for the German upper class. This genocidal strategy aimed to redirect agricultural resources from the Soviet Union to Germany by cutting off food to vast regions\u2014particularly central and northern Russia\u2014resulting in the intentional starvation of millions. These policies were modified by late 1941 when the original plan proved logistically untenable. Nevertheless, the strategy of feeding only those civilians deemed economically useful continued, leading to mass deaths in urban centres like Leningrad, Kharkiv, and Kiev. \nTo this end, Nazi policy aimed to destroy the Soviet Union as a political entity in accordance with the geopolitical ideals for the benefit of future generations of the \"Nordic master race\". In 1941, Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg\u2014later appointed Reich Minister of the Occupied Eastern Territories\u2014suggested that conquered Soviet territory should be administered in the following ('Reich Commissionerships'):\nGerman military planners also researched Napoleon's failed invasion of Russia. In their calculations, they concluded that there was little danger of a large-scale retreat of the Red Army into the Russian interior, as it could not afford to give up the Baltic countries, Ukraine, or the Moscow and Leningrad regions, all of which were vital to the Red Army for supply reasons and would thus, have to be defended. Hitler and his generals disagreed on where Germany should focus its energy. Hitler, in many discussions with his generals, repeated his order of \"Leningrad first, the Donbas second, Moscow third;\" but he consistently emphasized the destruction of the Red Army over the achievement of specific terrain objectives. Hitler believed Moscow to be of \"no great importance\" in the defeat of the Soviet Union and instead believed victory would come with the destruction of the Red Army west of the capital, especially west of the Western Dvina and Dnieper rivers, and this pervaded the plan for Barbarossa. This belief later led to disputes between Hitler and several German senior officers, including Heinz Guderian, Gerhard Engel, Fedor von Bock and Franz Halder, who believed the decisive victory could only be delivered at Moscow. They were unable to sway Hitler, who had grown overconfident in his own military judgment as a result of the rapid successes in Western Europe.\nGerman preparations.\nThe Germans had begun massing troops near the Soviet border even before the campaign in the Balkans had finished. By the third week of February 1941, 680,000 German soldiers were gathered in assembly areas on the Romanian-Soviet border. In preparation for the attack, Hitler had secretly moved upwards of 3 million German troops and approximately 690,000 Axis soldiers to the Soviet border regions. Additional \"Luftwaffe\" operations included numerous aerial surveillance missions over Soviet territory many months before the attack.\nAlthough the Soviet High Command was alarmed by this, Stalin's belief that Nazi Germany was unlikely to attack only two years after signing the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact resulted in slow Soviet preparation. This fact aside, the Soviets did not entirely overlook the threat of their German neighbor. Well before the German invasion, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko referred to the Germans as the Soviet Union's \"most important and strongest enemy,\" and as early as July 1940, the Red Army Chief of Staff, Boris Shaposhnikov, produced a preliminary three-pronged plan of attack for what a German invasion might look like, remarkably similar to the actual attack. Since April 1941, the Germans had begun setting up Operation Haifisch and Operation Harpune to substantiate their claims that Britain was the real target. These simulated preparations in Norway and the English Channel coast included activities such as ship concentrations, reconnaissance flights and training exercises.\nThe reasons for the postponement of Barbarossa from the initially planned date of 15 May to the actual invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) are debated. The reason most commonly cited is the unforeseen contingency of invading Yugoslavia and Greece on 6 April 1941 until June 1941. Historian Thomas B. Buell indicates that Finland and Romania, which weren't involved in initial German planning, needed additional time to prepare to participate in the invasion. Buell adds that an unusually wet winter kept rivers at full flood until late spring. The floods may have discouraged an earlier attack, even if they occurred before the end of the Balkans Campaign.\nThe importance of the delay is still debated. William Shirer argued that Hitler's Balkan Campaign had delayed the commencement of Barbarossa by several weeks and thereby jeopardised it. Many later historians argue that the 22 June start date was sufficient for the German offensive to reach Moscow by September. Antony Beevor wrote in 2012 about the delay caused by German attacks in the Balkans that \"most [historians] accept that it made little difference\" to the eventual outcome of Barbarossa.\nThe Germans deployed one independent regiment, one separate motorised training brigade and 153 divisions for Barbarossa, which included 104 infantry, 19 panzer and 15 motorised infantry divisions in three army groups, nine security divisions to operate in conquered territories, four divisions in Finland and two divisions as reserve under the direct control of OKH. These were equipped with 6,867 armoured vehicles, of which 3,350\u20133,795 were tanks, 2,770\u20134,389 aircraft (that amounted to 65 percent of the \"Luftwaffe\"), 7,200\u201323,435 artillery pieces, 17,081 mortars, about 600,000 motor vehicles and 625,000\u2013700,000 horses. Finland slated 14 divisions for the invasion, and Romania offered 13 divisions and eight brigades over the course of Barbarossa. The entire Axis forces, 3.8\u00a0million personnel, deployed across a front extending from the Arctic Ocean southward to the Black Sea, were all controlled by the OKH and organised into Army Norway, Army Group North, Army Group Centre and Army Group South, alongside three \"Luftflotten\" (air fleets, the air force equivalent of army groups) that supported the army groups: Luftflotte 1 for North, Luftflotte 2 for Centre and Luftflotte 4 for South.\nArmy Norway was to operate in far northern Scandinavia and bordering Soviet territories. Army Group North was to march through Latvia and Estonia into northern Russia, then either take or destroy the city of Leningrad, and link up with Finnish forces. Army Group Centre, the army group equipped with the most armour and air power, was to strike from Poland into Belorussia and the west-central regions of Russia proper, and advance to Smolensk and then Moscow. Army Group South was to strike the heavily populated and agricultural heartland of Ukraine, taking Kiev before continuing eastward over the steppes of southern USSR to the Volga with the aim of controlling the oil-rich Caucasus. Army Group South was deployed in two sections separated by a gap. The northern section, which contained the army group's only panzer group, was in southern Poland right next to Army Group Centre, and the southern section was in Romania.\nThe German forces in the rear (mostly and units) were to operate in conquered territories to counter any partisan activity in areas they controlled, as well as to execute captured Soviet political commissars and Jews. On 17 June, Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) chief Reinhard Heydrich briefed around thirty to fifty commanders on \"the policy of eliminating Jews in Soviet territories, at least in general terms\". While the were assigned to the \"Wehrmacht\"'s units, which provided them with supplies such as gasoline and food, they were controlled by the RSHA. The official plan for Barbarossa assumed that the army groups would be able to advance freely to their primary objectives simultaneously, without spreading thin, once they had won the border battles and destroyed the Red Army's forces in the border area. \nSoviet preparations.\nIn 1930, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, a prominent military theorist in tank warfare in the interwar period and later Marshal of the Soviet Union, forwarded a memo to the Kremlin that lobbied for colossal investment in the resources required for the mass production of weapons, pressing the case for \"40,000 aircraft and 50,000 tanks.\" In the early 1930s, a modern operational doctrine for the Red Army was developed and promulgated in the 1936 Field Regulations in the form of the Deep Battle Concept. Defence expenditure also grew rapidly from just 12 percent of the gross national product in 1933 to 18 percent by 1940.\nDuring Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the late 1930s, which had not ended by the time of the German invasion on 22 June 1941, much of the officer corps of the Red Army was executed or imprisoned. Many of their replacements, appointed by Stalin for political reasons, lacked military competence. Of the five Marshals of the Soviet Union appointed in 1935, only Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny survived Stalin's purge. Tukhachevsky was killed in 1937. Fifteen of 16 army commanders, 50 of the 57 corps commanders, 154 of the 186 divisional commanders, and 401 of 456 colonels were killed, and many other officers were dismissed. In total, about 30,000 Red Army personnel were executed. Stalin further underscored his control by reasserting the role of political commissars at the divisional level and below to oversee the political loyalty of the army to the regime. The commissars held a position equal to that of the commander of the unit they were overseeing. But in spite of efforts to ensure the political subservience of the armed forces, in the wake of Red Army's poor performance in Poland and in the Winter War, about 80 percent of the officers dismissed during the Great Purge were reinstated by 1941. Also, between January 1939 and May 1941, 161 new divisions were activated. Therefore, although about 75 percent of all the officers had been in their position for less than one year at the start of the German invasion of 1941, many of the short tenures can be attributed not only to the purge but also to the rapid increase in the creation of military units.\nBeginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff developed war plans that identified the \"Wehrmacht\" as the most dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, and that in the case of a war with Germany, the \"Wehrmacht\"'s main attack would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October, he authorised the development of new plans that assumed a German attack would focus on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.\nIn the Soviet Union, speaking to his generals in December 1940, Stalin mentioned Hitler's references to an attack on the Soviet Union in \"Mein Kampf\" and Hitler's belief that the Red Army would need four years to ready itself. Stalin declared \"we must be ready much earlier\" and \"we will try to delay the war for another two years\". As early as August 1940, British intelligence had received hints of German plans to attack the Soviets a week after Hitler informally approved the plans for \"Barbarossa\" and warned the Soviet Union accordingly. Some of this intelligence was based on Ultra information obtained from broken Enigma traffic. However, Stalin's distrust of the British led him to ignore their warnings in the belief that they were a trick designed to bring the Soviet Union into the war on their side. Soviet intelligence also received word of an invasion around 20 June from Mao Zedong whose spy, Yan Baohang, had overheard talk of the plans at a dinner with a German military attach\u00e9 and sent word to Zhou Enlai. The Chinese maintain the tipoff helped Stalin make preparations, though little exists to confirm the Soviets made any real changes upon receiving the intelligence. In early 1941, Stalin's own intelligence services and American intelligence gave regular and repeated warnings of an impending German attack. Soviet spy Richard Sorge also gave Stalin the exact German launch date, but Sorge and other informers had previously given different invasion dates that passed peacefully before the actual invasion. Stalin acknowledged the possibility of an attack in general and therefore made significant preparations, but decided not to run the risk of provoking Hitler.\nIn early 1941, Stalin authorised the State Defence Plan 1941 (DP-41), which along with the Mobilisation Plan 1941 (MP-41), called for the deployment of 186 divisions, as the first strategic echelon, in the four military districts of the western Soviet Union that faced the Axis territories; and the deployment of another 51 divisions along the Dvina and Dnieper Rivers as the second strategic echelon under Stavka control, which in the case of a German invasion was tasked to spearhead a Soviet counteroffensive along with the remaining forces of the first echelon. But on 22 June 1941 the first echelon contained 171 divisions, numbering 2.6\u20132.9\u00a0million; and the second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions that were still mobilising, most of which were still understrength. The second echelon was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces encountered them.\nAt the start of the invasion, the manpower of the Soviet military force that had been mobilised was 5.3\u20135.5\u00a0million, and it was still increasing as the Soviet reserve force of 14 million, with at least basic military training, continued to mobilise. The Red Army was dispersed and still preparing when the invasion commenced. Their units were often separated and lacked adequate transportation. While transportation remained insufficient for Red Army forces, when Operation Barbarossa kicked off, they possessed some 33,000 pieces of artillery, a number far greater than the Germans had at their disposal.\nThe Soviet Union had around 23,000 tanks available of which 14,700 were combat-ready. Around 11,000 tanks were in the western military districts that faced the German invasion force. Hitler later declared to some of his generals, \"If I had known about the Russian tank strength in 1941 I would not have attacked\". However, maintenance and readiness standards were very poor; ammunition and radios were in short supply, and many armoured units lacked trucks for supplies. The most advanced Soviet tank models\u2014the KV-1 and T-34\u2014which were superior to all current German tanks, as well as all designs still in development as of the summer 1941, were not available in large numbers at the time the invasion commenced. Furthermore, in the autumn of 1939, the Soviets disbanded their mechanised corps and partly dispersed their tanks to infantry divisions; but following their observation of the German campaign in France, in late 1940 they began to reorganise most of their armoured assets back into mechanised corps with a target strength of 1,031 tanks each. But these large armoured formations were unwieldy, and moreover they were spread out in scattered garrisons, with their subordinate divisions up to apart. The reorganisation was still in progress and incomplete when Barbarossa commenced. Soviet tank units were rarely well equipped, and they lacked training and logistical support. Units were sent into combat with no arrangements in place for refuelling, ammunition resupply, or personnel replacement. Often, after a single engagement, units were destroyed or rendered ineffective. The Soviet numerical advantage in heavy equipment was thoroughly offset by the superior training and organisation of the \"Wehrmacht\".\nThe Soviet Air Force (VVS) held the numerical advantage with a total of approximately 19,533 aircraft, which made it the largest air force in the world in the summer of 1941. About 7,133\u20139,100 of these were deployed in the five western military districts, and an additional 1,445 were under naval control.\nHistorians have debated whether Stalin was planning an invasion of German territory in the summer of 1941. The debate began in the late 1980s when Viktor Suvorov published a journal article and later the book \"Icebreaker\" in which he claimed that Stalin had seen the outbreak of war in Western Europe as an opportunity to spread communist revolutions throughout the continent, and that the Soviet military was being deployed for an imminent attack at the time of the German invasion. This view had also been advanced by former German generals following the war. Suvorov's thesis was fully or partially accepted by a limited number of historians, including Valeri Danilov, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov, and Vladimir Nevezhin, and attracted public attention in Germany, Israel, and Russia. It has been strongly rejected by most historians, and \"Icebreaker\" is generally considered to be an \"anti-Soviet tract\" in Western countries. David Glantz and Gabriel Gorodetsky wrote books to rebut Suvorov's arguments. The majority of historians believe that Stalin was seeking to avoid war in 1941, as he believed that his military was not ready to fight the German forces. The debate on whether Stalin intended to launch an offensive against Germany in 1941 remains inconclusive but has produced an abundance of scholarly literature and helped to expand the understanding of larger themes in Soviet and world history during the interwar period.\nInvasion.\nAt around 01:00 on Sunday, 22 June 1941, the Soviet military districts in the border area were alerted by NKO Directive No. 1, issued late on the night of 21 June. It called on them to \"bring all forces to combat readiness\", but to \"avoid provocative actions of any kind\". It took up to two hours for several of the units subordinate to the Fronts to receive the order of the directive, and the majority did not receive it before the invasion commenced. A German communist deserter, Alfred Liskow, had crossed the lines at 21:00 on 21 June and informed the Soviets that an attack was coming at 04:00. Stalin was informed, but apparently regarded it as disinformation. Liskow was still being interrogated when the attack began.\nOn 21 June, at 13:00 Army Group North received the codeword \"D\u00fcsseldorf\", indicating Barbarossa would commence the next morning, and passed down its own codeword, \"Dortmund\". At around 03:15 on 22 June 1941, the Axis Powers commenced the invasion of the Soviet Union with the bombing of major cities in Soviet-occupied Poland and an artillery barrage on Red Army defences on the entire front. Air-raids were conducted as far as Kronstadt near Leningrad and Sevastopol in the Crimea. At the same time the German declaration of war was presented by Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. Meanwhile, ground troops crossed the border, accompanied in some locales by Lithuanian and Ukrainian partisans. Roughly three million soldiers of the \"Wehrmacht\" went into action and faced slightly fewer Soviet troops at the border. Accompanying the German forces during the initial invasion were Finnish and Romanian units as well.\nAt around noon, the news of the invasion was broadcast to the population by Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov: \"...\u00a0Without a declaration of war, German forces fell on our country, attacked our frontiers in many places\u00a0... The Red Army and the whole nation will wage a victorious Patriotic War for our beloved country, for honour, for liberty\u00a0... Our cause is just. The enemy will be beaten. Victory will be ours!\" By calling upon the population's devotion to their nation rather than the Party, Molotov struck a patriotic chord that helped a stunned people absorb the shattering news. Within the first few days of the invasion, the Soviet High Command and Red Army were extensively reorganised so as to place them on the necessary war footing. Stalin did not address the nation about the German invasion until 3 July, when he also called for a \"Patriotic War... of the entire Soviet people\".\nIn Germany, on the morning of 22 June, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels announced the invasion to the waking nation in a radio broadcast with Hitler's words: \"At this moment a march is taking place that, for its extent, compares with the greatest the world has ever seen. I have decided today to place the fate and future of the Reich and our people in the hands of our soldiers. May God aid us, especially in this fight!\" Later the same morning, Hitler proclaimed to his colleagues, \"Before three months have passed, we shall witness a collapse of Russia, the like of which has never been seen in history\". Hitler also addressed the German people via the radio, presenting himself as a man of peace, who reluctantly had to attack the Soviet Union. Following the invasion, Goebbels instructed that Nazi propaganda use the slogan \"European crusade against Bolshevism\" to describe the war; subsequently thousands of volunteers and conscripts joined the \"Waffen-SS\".\nInitial attacks.\nThe initial momentum of the German ground and air attack completely destroyed the Soviet organisational command and control within the first few hours, paralyzing every level of command from the infantry platoon to the Soviet High Command in Moscow. Moscow failed to grasp the magnitude of the catastrophe that confronted the Soviet forces in the border area, and Stalin's first reaction was disbelief. At around 07:15, Stalin issued NKO Directive No. 2, which announced the invasion to the Soviet Armed Forces, and called on them to attack Axis forces wherever they had violated the borders and launch air strikes into the border regions of German territory. At around 09:15, Stalin issued NKO Directive No. 3, signed by Timoshenko, which now called for a general counteroffensive on the entire front \"without any regards for borders\" that both men hoped would sweep the enemy from Soviet territory. Stalin's order, which Timoshenko authorised, was not based on a realistic appraisal of the military situation at hand, but commanders passed it along for fear of retribution if they failed to obey; several days passed before the Soviet leadership became aware of the enormity of the opening defeat, and before Stalin comprehended the magnitude of the calamity. Significant amounts of Soviet territory were lost along with Red Army forces as a result.\nAir war.\n\"Luftwaffe\" reconnaissance units plotted Soviet troop concentrations, supply dumps and airfields, and marked them down for destruction. Additional \"Luftwaffe\" attacks were carried out against Soviet command and control centres to disrupt the mobilisation and organisation of Soviet forces. In contrast, Soviet artillery observers based at the border area had been under the strictest instructions not to open fire on German aircraft prior to the invasion. One plausible reason given for the Soviet hesitation to return fire was Stalin's initial belief that the assault was launched without Hitler's authorisation. The \"Luftwaffe\" reportedly destroyed 1,489 aircraft on the first day of the invasion and over 3,100 during the first three days. Hermann G\u00f6ring, Minister of Aviation and Commander-in-Chief of the \"Luftwaffe\", distrusted the reports and ordered the figure checked. \"Luftwaffe\" staffs surveyed the wreckage on Soviet airfields, and their original figure proved conservative, as over 2,000 Soviet aircraft were estimated to have been destroyed on the first day of the invasion. In reality, Soviet losses were likely higher; a Soviet archival document recorded the loss of 3,922 Soviet aircraft in the first three days against an estimated loss of 78 German aircraft. The \"Luftwaffe\" reported the loss of only 35 aircraft on the first day of combat. A document from the German Federal Archives puts the \"Luftwaffe\"'s loss at 63 aircraft for the first day.\nBy the end of the first week, the \"Luftwaffe\" had achieved air supremacy over the battlefields of all the army groups, but was unable to extend this air dominance over the vast expanse of the western Soviet Union. According to the war diaries of the German High Command, the \"Luftwaffe\" by 5 July had lost 491 aircraft with 316 more damaged, leaving it with only about 70 percent of the strength it had at the start of the invasion.\nBaltic countries.\nOn 22 June, Army Group North attacked the Soviet Northwestern Front and broke through its 8th and 11th Armies. The Soviets immediately launched a powerful counterattack against the German 4th Panzer Group with the Soviet 3rd and 12th Mechanised Corps, but the Soviet attack was defeated. On 25 June, the 8th and 11th Armies were ordered to withdraw to the Western Dvina River, where it was planned to meet up with the 21st Mechanised Corps and the 22nd and 27th Armies. However, on 26 June, Erich von Manstein's LVI Panzer Corps reached the river first and secured a bridgehead across it. The Northwestern Front was forced to abandon the river defences, and on 29 June Stavka ordered the Front to withdraw to the Stalin Line on the approaches to Leningrad. On 2 July, Army Group North began its attack on the Stalin Line with its 4th Panzer Group, and on 8 July captured Pskov, devastating the defences of the Stalin Line and reaching Leningrad oblast. The 4th Panzer Group had advanced about since the start of the invasion and was now only about from its primary objective Leningrad. On 9 July it began its attack towards the Soviet defences along the Luga River in Leningrad oblast.\nUkraine and Moldavia.\nThe northern section of Army Group South faced the Southwestern Front, which had the largest concentration of Soviet forces, and the southern section faced the Southern Front. In addition, the Pripyat Marshes and the Carpathian Mountains posed a serious challenge to the army group's northern and southern sections respectively. On 22 June, only the northern section of Army Group South attacked, but the terrain impeded their assault, giving the Soviet defenders ample time to react. The German 1st Panzer Group and 6th Army attacked and broke through the Soviet 5th Army. Starting on the night of 23 June, the Soviet 22nd and 15th Mechanised Corps attacked the flanks of the 1st Panzer Group from north and south respectively. Although intended to be concerted, Soviet tank units were sent in piecemeal due to poor coordination. The 22nd Mechanised Corps ran into the 1st Panzer Army's III Motorised Corps and was decimated, and its commander killed. The 1st Panzer Group bypassed much of the 15th Mechanised Corps, which engaged the German 6th Army's 297th Infantry Division, where it was defeated by antitank fire and \"Luftwaffe\" attacks. On 26 June, the Soviets launched another counterattack on the 1st Panzer Group from north and south simultaneously with the 9th, 19th and 8th Mechanised Corps, which altogether fielded 1649 tanks, and supported by the remnants of the 15th Mechanised Corps. The battle lasted for four days, ending in the defeat of the Soviet tank units. On 30 June Stavka ordered the remaining forces of the Southwestern Front to withdraw to the Stalin Line, where it would defend the approaches to Kiev.\nOn 2 July, the southern section of Army Group South\u2014the Romanian 3rd and 4th Armies, alongside the German 11th Army\u2014invaded Soviet Moldavia, which was defended by the Southern Front. Counterattacks by the Front's 2nd Mechanised Corps and 9th Army were defeated, but on 9 July the Axis advance stalled along the defences of the Soviet 18th Army between the Prut and Dniester Rivers.\nBelorussia.\nIn the opening hours of the invasion, the \"Luftwaffe\" destroyed the Western Front's air force on the ground, and with the aid of Abwehr and their supporting anti-communist fifth columns operating in the Soviet rear paralyzed the Front's communication lines, which particularly cut off the Soviet 4th Army headquarters from headquarters above and below it. On the same day, the 2nd Panzer Group crossed the Bug River, broke through the 4th Army, bypassed Brest Fortress, and pressed on towards Minsk, while the 3rd Panzer Group bypassed most of the 3rd Army and pressed on towards Vilnius. Simultaneously, the German 4th and 9th Armies engaged the Western Front forces in the environs of Bia\u0142ystok. On the order of the Western Front commander, Dmitry Pavlov, the 6th and 11th Mechanised Corps and the 6th Cavalry Corps launched a strong counterstrike towards Grodno on 24\u201325 June in hopes of destroying the 3rd Panzer Group. However, the 3rd Panzer Group had already moved on, with its forward units reaching Vilnius on the evening of 23 June, and the Western Front's armoured counterattack instead ran into infantry and antitank fire from the V Army Corps of the German 9th Army, supported by \"Luftwaffe\" air attacks. By the night of 25 June, the Soviet counterattack was defeated, and the commander of the 6th Cavalry Corps was captured. The same night, Pavlov ordered all the remnants of the Western Front to withdraw to Slonim towards Minsk. Subsequent counterattacks to buy time for the withdrawal were launched against the German forces, but all of them failed. On 27 June, the 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups met near Minsk and captured the city the next day, completing the encirclement of almost all of the Western Front in two pockets: one around Bia\u0142ystok and another west of Minsk. The Germans destroyed the Soviet 3rd and 10th Armies while inflicting serious losses on the 4th, 11th and 13th Armies, and reported to have captured 324,000 Soviet troops, 3,300 tanks, 1,800 artillery pieces.\nA Soviet directive was issued on 29 June to combat the mass panic rampant among the civilians and the armed forces personnel. The order stipulated swift, severe measures against anyone inciting panic or displaying cowardice. The NKVD worked with commissars and military commanders to scour possible withdrawal routes of soldiers retreating without military authorisation. Field expedient general courts were established to deal with civilians spreading rumours and military deserters. On 30 June, Stalin relieved Pavlov of his command, and on 22 July tried and executed him along with many members of his staff on charges of \"cowardice\" and \"criminal incompetence\".\nOn 29 June, Hitler, through Brauchitsch, instructed Bock to halt the advance of the panzers of Army Group Centre until the infantry formations liquidating the pockets caught up. But Guderian, with the tacit support of Bock and Halder, ignored the instruction and attacked on eastward towards Bobruisk, albeit reporting the advance as a reconnaissance-in-force. He also personally conducted an aerial inspection of the Minsk-Bia\u0142ystok pocket on 30 June and concluded that his panzer group was not needed to contain it, since Hermann Hoth's 3rd Panzer Group was already involved in the Minsk pocket. On the same day, some of the infantry corps of the 9th and 4th Armies, having sufficiently liquidated the Bia\u0142ystok pocket, resumed their march eastward to catch up with the panzer groups. On 1 July, Bock ordered the panzer groups to resume their full offensive eastward on the morning of 3 July. But Brauchitsch, upholding Hitler's instruction, and Halder, unwillingly going along with it, opposed Bock's order. However, Bock insisted on the order by stating that it would be irresponsible to reverse orders already issued. The panzer groups resumed their offensive on 2 July before the infantry formations had sufficiently caught up.\nNortheast Finland.\nDuring German-Finnish negotiations, Finland had demanded to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into an attack on Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarise the neutral \u00c5land Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centres, including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session on the same day the Finnish parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.\nFinland was divided into two operational zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under the responsibility of the Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Ladoga Karelia as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Viipuri.\nFurther German advances.\nOn 2 July and through the next six days, a rainstorm typical of Belarusian summers slowed the progress of the panzers of Army Group Centre, and Soviet defences stiffened. The delays gave the Soviets time to organise a massive counterattack against Army Group Centre. The army group's ultimate objective was Smolensk, which commanded the road to Moscow. Facing the Germans was an old Soviet defensive line held by six armies. On 6 July, the Soviets launched a massive counter-attack using the V and VII Mechanised Corps of the 20th Army, which collided with the German 39th and 47th Panzer Corps in a battle where the Red Army lost 832 tanks of the 2,000 employed during five days of ferocious fighting. The Germans defeated this counterattack thanks largely to the coincidental presence of the \"Luftwaffe\"'s only squadron of tank-busting aircraft. The 2nd Panzer Group crossed the Dnieper River and closed in on Smolensk from the south while the 3rd Panzer Group, after defeating the Soviet counterattack, closed on Smolensk from the north. Trapped between their pincers were three Soviet armies. The 29th Motorised Division captured Smolensk on 16 July yet a gap remained between Army Group Centre. On 18 July, the panzer groups came to within of closing the gap but the trap did not finally close until 5 August, when upwards of 300,000 Red Army soldiers had been captured and 3,205 Soviet tanks were destroyed. Large numbers of Red Army soldiers escaped to stand between the Germans and Moscow as resistance continued.\nFour weeks into the campaign, the Germans realised they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies, and General Bock quickly came to the conclusion that not only had the Red Army offered stiff opposition, but German difficulties were also due to the logistical problems with reinforcements and provisions. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation. In addition to strained logistics, poor roads made it difficult for wheeled vehicles and foot infantry to keep up with the faster armoured spearheads, and shortages in boots and winter uniforms were becoming apparent. Furthermore, all three army groups had suffered 179,500 casualties by 2 August, and had only received 47,000 replacements.\nHitler by now had lost faith in battles of encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers. He now believed he could defeat the Soviet state by economic means, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial centre of Kharkov, the Donbas and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major centre of military production, in the north.\nHalder, Bock, and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa argued vehemently in favour of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow. Besides the psychological importance of capturing the Soviet capital, the generals pointed out that Moscow was a major centre of arms production, the centre of the Soviet communications system and an important transport hub. Intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of the remaining Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Timoshenko for the defence of the capital. Guderian was sent to Hitler by Bock and Halder to argue their case for continuing the assault against Moscow, but Hitler issued an order through Guderian (bypassing Bock and Halder) to send Army Group Centre's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to Moscow. Convinced by Hitler's argument, Guderian returned to his commanding officers as a convert to the F\u00fchrer's plan, which earned him their disdain.\nNorthern Finland.\nOn 29 June, Germany launched its effort to capture Murmansk in a pincer attack. The northern pincer, conducted by Mountain Corps Norway, approached Murmansk directly by crossing the border at Petsamo. However, in mid-July after securing the neck of the Rybachy Peninsula and advancing to the Litsa River the German advance was stopped by heavy resistance from the Soviet 14th Army. Renewed attacks led to nothing, and this front became a stalemate for the remainder of Barbarossa.\nThe second pincer attack began on 1 July with the German XXXVI Corps and Finnish III Corps slated to recapture the Salla region for Finland and then proceed eastwards to cut the Murmansk railway near Kandalaksha. The German units had great difficulty dealing with the Arctic conditions. After heavy fighting, Salla was taken on 8 July. To keep the momentum the German-Finnish forces advanced eastwards until they were stopped at the town of Kayraly by Soviet resistance. Further south the Finnish III Corps made an independent effort to reach the Murmansk railway through the Arctic terrain. Facing only one division of the Soviet 7th Army it was able to make rapid headway. On 7 August it captured Kestenga while reaching the outskirts of Ukhta. Large Red Army reinforcements then prevented further gains on both fronts, and the German-Finnish force had to go onto the defensive.\nKarelia.\nThe Finnish plan in the south in Karelia was to advance as swiftly as possible to Lake Ladoga, cutting the Soviet forces in half. Then the Finnish territories west of Lake Ladoga were to be recaptured before the advance along the Karelian Isthmus, including the recapture of Viipuri, commenced. The Finnish attack was launched on 10 July. The Army of Karelia held a numerical advantage versus the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army and 23rd Army, so it could advance swiftly. The important road junction at Loimola was captured on 14 July. By 16 July, the first Finnish units reached Lake Ladoga at Koirinoja, achieving the goal of splitting the Soviet forces. During the rest of July, the Army of Karelia advanced further southeast into Karelia, coming to a halt at the former Finnish-Soviet border at Mansila.\nWith the Soviet forces cut in half, the attack on the Karelian Isthmus could commence. The Finnish army attempted to encircle large Soviet formations at Sortavala and Hiitola by advancing to the western shores of Lake Ladoga. By mid-August the encirclement had succeeded and both towns were taken, but many Soviet formations were able to evacuate by sea. Further west, the attack on Viipuri was launched. With Soviet resistance breaking down, the Finns were able to encircle Viipuri by advancing to the Vuoksi River. The city itself was taken on 29 August, along with a broad advance on the rest of the Karelian Isthmus. By the beginning of September, Finland had restored its pre-Winter War borders.\nOffensive towards central Russia.\nBy mid-July, the German forces had advanced within a few kilometers of Kiev below the Pripyat Marshes. The 1st Panzer Group then went south, while the 17th Army struck east and trapped three Soviet armies near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the tanks turned north and crossed the Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, diverted from Army Group Centre, had crossed the river Desna with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two panzer armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others.\nBy August, as the serviceability and the quantity of the \"Luftwaffe\"'s inventory steadily diminished due to combat, demand for air support only increased as the VVS recovered. The \"Luftwaffe\" found itself struggling to maintain local air superiority. With the onset of bad weather in October, the \"Luftwaffe\" was on several occasions forced to halt nearly all aerial operations. The VVS, although faced with the same weather difficulties, had a clear advantage thanks to the prewar experience with cold-weather flying, and the fact that they were operating from intact airbases and airports. By December, the VVS had matched the \"Luftwaffe\" and was even pressing to achieve air superiority over the battlefields.\nLeningrad.\nFor its final attack on Leningrad, the 4th Panzer Group was reinforced by tanks from Army Group Centre. On 8 August, the Panzers broke through the Soviet defences. By the end of August, 4th Panzer Group had penetrated to within of Leningrad. The Finns had pushed southeast on both sides of Lake Ladoga to reach the old Finnish-Soviet frontier.\nThe Germans attacked Leningrad in August 1941; in the following three \"black months\" of 1941, 400,000 residents of the city worked to build the city's fortifications as fighting continued, while 160,000 others joined the ranks of the Red Army. Nowhere was the Soviet spirit stronger in resisting the Germans than at Leningrad where reserve troops and freshly improvised units, consisting of worker battalions and even schoolboy formations, joined in digging trenches as they prepared to defend the city. On 7 September, the German 20th Motorised Division seized Shlisselburg, cutting off all land routes to Leningrad. The Germans severed the railroads to Moscow and captured the railroad to Murmansk with Finnish assistance to inaugurate the start of a siege that would last for over two years.\nAt this stage, Hitler ordered the final destruction of Leningrad with no prisoners taken, and on 9 September, Army Group North began the final push. Within ten days it had advanced within of the city. However, the push over the last proved very slow and casualties mounted, so Hitler ordered that Leningrad should not be stormed, but rather starved into submission. Along these lines, the OKH issued Directive No. la 1601/41 on 22 September 1941, which accorded Hitler's plans. Deprived of its Panzer forces, Army Group Centre remained static and was subjected to numerous Soviet counterattacks, in particular the Yelnya Offensive, in which the Germans suffered their first major tactical defeat since their invasion began; this Red Army victory also provided an important boost to Soviet morale. These attacks prompted Hitler to concentrate his attention back to Army Group Centre and its drive on Moscow. The Germans ordered the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies to break off their Siege of Leningrad and support Army Group Centre in its attack on Moscow.\nKiev.\nBefore an attack on Moscow could begin, operations in Kiev needed to be finished. Half of Army Group Centre had swung to the south in the back of the Kiev position, while Army Group South moved to the north from its Dnieper bridgehead. The encirclement of Soviet forces in Kiev was achieved on 16 September. A battle ensued in which the Soviets were hammered with tanks, artillery, and aerial bombardment. After ten days of vicious fighting, the Germans claimed 665,000 Soviet soldiers captured, although the real figure is probably around 220,000. Soviet losses were 452,720 men, 3,867 artillery pieces and mortars from 43 divisions of the 5th, 21st, 26th, and 37th Soviet Armies. Despite the exhaustion and losses facing some German units (upwards of 75 percent of their men) from the intense fighting, the massive defeat of the Soviets at Kiev and the Red Army losses during the first three months of the assault contributed to the German assumption that Operation Typhoon (the attack on Moscow) could still succeed.\nSea of Azov.\nAfter operations at Kiev were successfully concluded, Army Group South advanced east and south to capture the industrial Donbas region and the Crimea. The Soviet Southern Front launched an attack on 26 September with two armies on the northern shores of the Sea of Azov against elements of the German 11th Army, which was simultaneously advancing into the Crimea. On 1 October, the 1st Panzer Army under Ewald von Kleist swept south to encircle the two attacking Soviet armies. By 7 October, the Soviet 9th and 18th Armies were cut off and four days later they had been destroyed. The Soviet defeat was total; 106,332 men captured, 212 tanks destroyed or captured in the pocket alone as well as 766 artillery pieces of all types. The death or capture of two-thirds of all Southern Front troops in four days unhinged the Front's left flank, allowing the Germans to capture Kharkov on 24 October. Kleist's 1st Panzer Army took the Donbas region that same month.\nCentral and northern Finland.\nIn central Finland, the German-Finnish advance on the Murmansk railway had been resumed at Kayraly. A large encirclement from the north and the south trapped the defending Soviet corps and allowed XXXVI Corps to advance further to the east. In early September it reached the old 1939 Soviet border fortifications. On 6 September the first defence line at the Voyta River was breached, but further attacks against the main line at the Verman River failed. With Army Norway switching its main effort further south, the front stalemated in this sector. Further south, the Finnish III Corps launched a new offensive towards the Murmansk railway on 30 October, bolstered by fresh reinforcements from Army Norway. Against Soviet resistance, it was able to come within of the railway, when the Finnish High Command ordered a stop to all offensive operations in the sector on 17 November. The United States of America applied diplomatic pressure on Finland not to disrupt Allied aid shipments to the Soviet Union, which caused the Finnish government to halt the advance on the Murmansk railway. With the Finnish refusal to conduct further offensive operations and German inability to do so alone, the German-Finnish effort in central and northern Finland came to an end.\nKarelia.\nGermany had pressured Finland to enlarge its offensive activities in Karelia to aid the Germans in their Leningrad operation. Finnish attacks on Leningrad itself remained limited. Finland stopped its advance just short of Leningrad and had no intentions to attack the city. The situation was different in eastern Karelia. The Finnish government agreed to restart its offensive into Soviet Karelia to reach Lake Onega and the Svir River. On 4 September, this new drive was launched on a broad front. Albeit reinforced by fresh reserve troops, heavy losses elsewhere on the front meant that the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army were not able to resist the Finnish advance. Olonets was taken on 5 September. On 7 September, Finnish forward units reached the Svir River. Petrozavodsk, the capital city of the Karelo-Finnish SSR, fell on 1 October. From there the Army of Karelia moved north along the shores of Lake Onega to secure the remaining area west of Lake Onega, while simultaneously establishing a defensive position along the Svir River. Slowed by winter's onset they nevertheless continued to advance slowly during the following weeks. Medvezhyegorsk was captured on 5 December and Povenets fell the next day. On 7 December, Finland halted all offensive operations and went onto the defensive.\nBattle of Moscow.\nAfter Kiev, the Red Army no longer outnumbered the Germans and there were no more trained reserves directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, but no more than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Centre was a series of elaborate defence lines, the first centred on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving their cattle away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny to the Nazi war machine needed supplies and foodstuffs.\nThe first blow took the Soviets completely by surprise when the 2nd Panzer Group, returning from the south, took Oryol, just south of the Soviet first main defence line. Three days later, the Panzers pushed on to Bryansk, while the 2nd Army attacked from the west. The Soviet 3rd and 13th Armies were now encircled. To the north, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies attacked Vyazma, trapping the 19th, 20th, 24th and 32nd Armies. Moscow's first line of defence had been shattered. The pocket eventually yielded over 500,000 Soviet prisoners, bringing the tally since the start of the invasion to three million. The Soviets now had only 90,000 men and 150 tanks left for the defence of Moscow.\nThe German government now publicly predicted the imminent capture of Moscow and convinced foreign correspondents of an impending Soviet collapse. On 13 October, the 3rd Panzer Group penetrated to within of the capital. Martial law was declared in Moscow. Almost from the beginning of Operation Typhoon, however, the weather worsened. Temperatures fell while there was continued rainfall. This turned the unpaved road network into mud and slowed the German advance on Moscow. Additional snows fell which were followed by more rain, creating a glutinous mud that German tanks had difficulty traversing, which the Soviet T-34, with its wider tread, was better suited to navigate. At the same time, the supply situation for the Germans rapidly deteriorated. On 31 October, the German Army High Command ordered a halt to Operation Typhoon while the armies were reorganised. The pause gave the Soviets, far better supplied, time to consolidate their positions and organise formations of newly activated reservists. In little over a month, the Soviets organised eleven new armies that included 30 divisions of Siberian troops. These had been freed from the Soviet Far East after Soviet intelligence assured Stalin that there was no longer a threat from Imperial Japan. During October and November 1941, over 1,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft arrived along with the Siberian forces to assist in defending the city.\nWith the ground hardening due to the cold weather, the Germans resumed the attack on Moscow on 15 November. Although the troops themselves were now able to advance again, there had been no improvement in the supply situation; only 135,000 of the 600,000 trucks that had been available on 22 June 1941 were available by 15 November 1941. Ammunition and fuel supplies were prioritised over food and winter clothing, so many German troops looted supplies from local populations, but could not fill their needs.\nFacing the Germans were the 5th, 16th, 30th, 43rd, 49th, and 50th Soviet Armies. The Germans intended to move the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies across the Moscow Canal and envelop Moscow from the northeast. The 2nd Panzer Group would attack Tula and then close on Moscow from the south. As the Soviets reacted to their flanks, the 4th Army would attack the centre. In two weeks of fighting, lacking sufficient fuel and ammunition, the Germans slowly crept towards Moscow. In the south, the 2nd Panzer Group was being blocked. On 22 November, Soviet Siberian units, augmented by the 49th and 50th Soviet Armies, attacked the 2nd Panzer Group and inflicted a defeat on the Germans. The 4th Panzer Group pushed the Soviet 16th Army back, however, and succeeded in crossing the Moscow Canal in an attempt to encircle Moscow.\nOn 2 December, part of the 258th Infantry Division advanced to within of Moscow. They were so close that German officers claimed they could see the spires of the Kremlin, but by then the first blizzards had begun. A reconnaissance battalion managed to reach the town of Khimki, only about from the Soviet capital. It captured the bridge over the Moscow-Volga Canal as well as the railway station, which marked the easternmost advance of German forces. In spite of the progress made, the \"Wehrmacht\" was not equipped for such severe winter warfare. The Soviet army was better adapted to fighting in winter conditions, but faced production shortages of winter clothing. The German forces fared worse, with deep snow further hindering equipment and mobility. Weather conditions had largely grounded the \"Luftwaffe\", preventing large-scale air operations. Newly created Soviet units near Moscow now numbered over 500,000 men, who despite their inexperience, were able to halt the German offensive by 5 December due to superior defensive fortifications, the presence of skilled and experienced leadership like Zhukov, and the poor German situation. On 5 December, the Soviet defenders launched a massive counterattack as part of the Soviet winter counteroffensive. The offensive halted on 7 January 1942, after having pushed the German armies back from Moscow. The \"Wehrmacht\" had lost the Battle for Moscow, and the invasion had cost the German Army over 830,000 men.\nAftermath.\nWith the failure of the Battle of Moscow, all German plans for a quick defeat of the Soviet Union had to be revised. The Soviet counter-offensives in December 1941 caused heavy casualties on both sides, but ultimately eliminated the German threat to Moscow. Attempting to explain matters, Hitler issued \"F\u00fchrer Directive No. 39\", which cited the early onset of winter and the severe cold as the primary reasons for the failed campaign, whereas the main reasons were German military unpreparedness, poor intelligence of actual Soviet strength, extensive logistical difficulties, high levels of attrition and heavy casualties, and overextension of German forces within the vast Soviet territories. On 22 June 1941, the \"Heer\" as a whole had 209 divisions at its disposal, 163 of which were offensively capable. On 31 March 1942, less than one year after the invasion of the Soviet Union, the army was reduced to fielding 58 offensively capable divisions. The Red Army's tenacity and ability to counter-attack effectively took the Germans as much by surprise as their own initial attack had the Soviets. Spurred on by the successful defence and in an effort to imitate the Germans, Stalin wanted to begin his own counteroffensive, not just against the German forces around Moscow, but against their armies in the north and south. Anger over the failed German offensives caused Hitler to relieve Brauchitsch of command and in his place, Hitler assumed personal control of the German Army on 19 December 1941, a decision that would progressively prove fatal to Germany's war effort and contribute to its eventual defeat.\nThe Soviet Union had suffered heavily from the conflict, losing huge tracts of territory, and vast losses in men and materiel. Nonetheless, the Red Army proved capable of countering the German offensives, particularly as the Germans began experiencing irreplaceable shortages in manpower, armaments, provisions, and fuel.\nSubsequent German offensives.\nDespite the rapid relocation of Red Army armaments production east of the Urals and a dramatic increase of production in 1942, especially of armour, new aircraft types and artillery, the \"Heer\" (German army) was able to mount another large-scale offensive in June 1942, although on a much reduced front than the previous summer. Hitler, having realised that Germany's oil supply was severely depleted, attempted to utilise Army Group South to capture the oil fields of Baku in the new offensive, codenamed Case Blue. Again, the Germans quickly overran great expanses of Soviet territory, but they failed to achieve their ultimate goal of the oil fields of Baku, culminating in their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad in February 1943 and withdrawal from the Caucasus.\nBy 1943, Soviet armaments production was fully operational and increasingly outproducing the German war economy. The final major German offensive in the Eastern theatre of World War II took place during July\u2013August 1943 with the launch of Operation Citadel, an assault on the Kursk salient. Approximately one million German troops confronted a Soviet force over 2.5\u00a0million strong. The Soviets, well aware of the attack in advance and fully prepared for it, prevailed in the Battle of Kursk. Following the German defeat, the Soviets launched Operation Kutuzov, a counter-offensive employing six million men along a front towards the Dnieper River as they drove the Germans westwards.\nEmploying increasingly ambitious and tactically sophisticated offensives, along with making operational improvements in secrecy and deception, by the summer of 1944, the Red Army was eventually able to regain much of the area previously conquered by the Germans. The destruction of Army Group Centre, the outcome of Operation Bagration in 1944, proved to be a decisive success and additional Soviet offensives against the German Army Groups North and South in the autumn of 1944 put the German war machine into further retreat. By January 1945, what had been the Eastern Front was now controlled by the Soviets, whose military might was aimed at the German capital of Berlin. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945 in order to avoid capture by the Soviets, and the war in Europe finally ended with the total defeat and capitulation of Nazi Germany in May 1945.\nWar crimes.\nWhile the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention, Germany had signed the treaty and was thus obligated to offer Soviet POWs humane treatment according to its provisions (as they generally did with other Allied POWs). According to the Soviets, they had not signed the Geneva Conventions in 1929 due to Article 9 which, by imposing racial segregation of POWs into different camps, contravened the Soviet constitution. Article 82 of the convention specified that \"In case, in time of war, one of the belligerents is not a party to the Convention, its provisions shall nevertheless remain in force as between the belligerents who are parties thereto.\" Despite such mandates, Hitler called for the battle against the Soviet Union to be a \"struggle for existence\" and emphasized that the Soviet armies were to be \"annihilated\", a mindset that contributed to war crimes against Soviet prisoners of war. A memorandum from 16 July 1941, recorded by Martin Bormann, quotes Hitler saying, \"The giant [occupied] area must naturally be pacified as quickly as possible; this will happen at best if anyone who just looks funny should be shot\". Conveniently for Germany, the fact that the Soviets failed to sign the convention played into their hands as they justified their behavior accordingly. Even if the Soviets had signed, it is highly unlikely that this would have stopped the Nazis' genocidal policies towards combatants, civilians, and prisoners of war.\nBefore the war, Hitler had issued the notorious Commissar Order, which called for all Soviet political commissars taken prisoner at the front to be shot immediately without trial. German soldiers participated in these mass killings along with members of the , sometimes reluctantly, claiming \"military necessity\". On the eve of the invasion, German soldiers were informed that their battle \"demands ruthless and vigorous measures against Bolshevik inciters, guerrillas, saboteurs, Jews and the complete elimination of all active and passive resistance\". Collective punishment was authorised against partisan attacks; if a perpetrator could not be quickly identified, burning villages and mass executions were considered acceptable reprisals. Although the majority of German soldiers accepted these crimes as justified due to Nazi propaganda, which depicted the Red Army as , a few prominent German officers openly protested against them. An estimated two million Soviet prisoners of war died of starvation during Barbarossa alone. By the end of the war, 58 percent of all Soviet prisoners of war had died in German captivity.\nOrganised crimes against civilians, including women and children, were carried out on a huge scale by the German police and military forces, as well as the local collaborators. Under the command of the Reich Security Main Office, the killing squads conducted large-scale massacres of Jews and communists in conquered Soviet territories. Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg puts the number of Jews murdered by \"mobile killing operations\" at 1,400,000. The original instructions to kill \"Jews in party and state positions\" were broadened to include \"all male Jews of military age\" and then expanded once more to \"all male Jews regardless of age\". By the end of July, the Germans were regularly killing women and children. On 18 December 1941, Himmler and Hitler discussed the \"Jewish question\", and Himmler noted the meeting's result in his appointment book: \"To be annihilated as partisans\". According to Christopher Browning, \"annihilating Jews and solving the so-called 'Jewish question' under the cover of killing partisans was the agreed-upon convention between Hitler and Himmler\". In accordance with Nazi policies against \"inferior\" Asian peoples, Turkmens were also persecuted. According to a post-war report by Prince Veli Kajum Khan, they were imprisoned in concentration camps in terrible conditions, where those deemed to have \"Mongolian\" features were murdered daily. Asians were also targeted by the and were the subjects of lethal medical experiments and murder at a \"pathological institute\" in Kiev. Hitler received reports of the mass killings conducted by the which were first conveyed to the RSHA, where they were aggregated into a summary report by Gestapo Chief Heinrich M\u00fcller.\nBurning houses suspected of being partisan meeting places and poisoning water wells became common practice for soldiers of the German 9th Army. At Kharkov, the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union, food was provided only to the small number of civilians who worked for the Germans, with the rest designated to slowly starve. Thousands of Soviets were deported to Germany for use as slave labour beginning in 1942.\nThe citizens of Leningrad were subjected to heavy bombardment and a siege that would last 872 days and starve more than a million people to death, of whom approximately 400,000 were children below the age of 14. The German-Finnish blockade cut off access to food, fuel and raw materials, and rations reached a low, for the non-working population, of (five thin slices) of bread and a little watery soup per day. Starving Soviet civilians began to eat their domestic animals, along with hair tonic and Vaseline. Some desperate citizens resorted to cannibalism; Soviet records list 2,000 people arrested for \"the use of human meat as food\" during the siege, 886 of them during the first winter of 1941\u201342. The \"Wehrmacht\" planned to seal off Leningrad, starve out the population, and then demolish the city entirely.\nSexual violence.\nRape was a widespread phenomenon in the East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang rape. Historian Hannes Heer relates that in the world of the eastern front, where the German army equated Russia with Communism, everything was \"fair game\"; thus, rape went unreported unless entire units were involved. Such instances of sexual violence proved part of a wider pattern of racial and gendered terror. Jewish women and girls, in particular, were subject to rape and other abuses by Wehrmacht, SS, police units, and occupation authorities. These crimes were rarely punished, creating a permissive environment where sexual violence became a normalized element of genocidal operations. Historian Regina M\u00fchlh\u00e4user's findings underscore the systematic nature of these crimes and the complicity of regular soldiers.\nFrequently in the case of Jewish women, they were murdered immediately after acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorise wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.\nOccupation and resistance.\nPropaganda and the illusion of benevolent occupation.\nIn late 1941 and especially throughout 1942, the German occupation administration ramped up propaganda efforts aimed at Soviet civilians. Promises of land reform, religious freedom, and liberation from Bolshevism were common themes. These efforts were most intense in Ukraine, where German authorities sought to portray themselves as liberators. However, the stark contradiction between propaganda and the reality of forced labor, food requisitions, mass executions, and repression rapidly eroded their credibility.\nLocal collaboration and resistance.\nDuring the Nazi campaign eastward, local collaboration and resistance was ambivalent, dynamic and circumstance contingent. In occupied Soviet territories, collaborators ranged from auxiliary police and administrative staff to military volunteers. However, as German occupation policies became increasingly brutal, some of these individuals and units defected to the Soviet partisans. The shifting nature of loyalty, often driven by pragmatic survival rather than ideology, complicates simplistic narratives of collaboration or resistance. A US Army report from 1951\u2014consisting of information gleaned from German military officers\u2014indicated that Army Group Centre initially established good relations with the population in Belarus. According to the report, local inhabitants were friendly and cooperative, and industrial and agricultural production continued for the benefit of both civilians and the occupying forces. Offences against German personnel, though tried in military courts, were handled in consultation with local authorities. From the winter of 1941, however, Soviet partisan activity became more organized, and under the combined pressure of reprisals and renewed propaganda for \"mother Russia,\" civilian cooperation declined.\nNazi plunder of Eastern Europe.\nAfter the initiation of Operation Barbarossa, Eastern Europe was relentlessly plundered by Nazi German forces. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, of fodder, of potatoes, and of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12\u00a0million pigs and 13\u00a0million sheep were seized by Nazi forces. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4\u00a0billion Reichsmarks. This relatively low number in comparison to the occupied nations of Western Europe can be attributed to the indiscriminate scorched-earth policy pursued by Nazi Germany in the Eastern Front.\nHistorical significance.\nBarbarossa was the largest military operation in history\u2014more men, tanks, guns and aircraft were deployed than in any other offensive. The invasion opened the Eastern Front, the war's largest theatre, which saw clashes of unprecedented violence and destruction for four years and killed over 26 million Soviet people, including about 8.6\u00a0million Red Army soldiers. More died fighting on the Eastern Front than in all other fighting across the globe during World War II. Damage to both the economy and landscape was enormous, as approximately 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages were razed.\nBarbarossa and the subsequent German defeat changed the political landscape of Europe, dividing it into Eastern and Western blocs. The political vacuum left in the eastern half of the continent was filled by the USSR when Stalin secured his territorial prizes of 1944\u20131945 and firmly placed the Red Army in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the eastern half of Germany. Stalin's fear of resurgent German power and his distrust of his erstwhile allies contributed to Soviet pan-Slavic initiatives and a subsequent alliance of Slavic states. The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House assert that Barbarossa influenced not only Stalin but subsequent Soviet leaders, claiming it \"colored\" their strategic mindsets for the \"next four decades\". As a result, the Soviets instigated the creation of \"an elaborate system of buffer and client states, designed to insulate the Soviet Union from any possible future attack\". In the ensuing Cold War, Eastern Europe became a Soviet sphere of influence, and Western Europe aligned itself with the United States.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Outside of the English-speaking world, Oceania is generally considered a continent, while Mainland Australia is regarded as its continental landmass. Spanning the Eastern and Western hemispheres, at the centre of the water hemisphere, Oceania is estimated to have a land area of about and a population of around 46.3 million as of 2024. Oceania is the smallest continent in land area and the second-least populated after Antarctica.\nOceania has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial markets of Australia, French Polynesia, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and New Zealand, which rank high in quality of life and Human Development Index, to the much less developed economies of Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western New Guinea. The largest and most populous country in Oceania is Australia, and the largest city is Sydney. Puncak Jaya in Indonesia is the highest peak in Oceania at .\nThe first settlers of Australia, New Guinea, and the large islands just to the east arrived more than 60,000 years ago. Oceania was first explored by Europeans from the 16th century onward. Portuguese explorers, between 1512 and 1526, reached the Tanimbar Islands, some of the Caroline Islands and west New Guinea. Spanish and Dutch explorers followed, then British and French. On his first voyage in the 18th century, James Cook, who later arrived at the highly developed Hawaiian Islands, went to Tahiti and followed the east coast of Australia for the first time. The arrival of European settlers in subsequent centuries resulted in a significant alteration in the social and political landscape of Oceania. The Pacific theatre saw major action during the First and Second World Wars.\nThe rock art of Aboriginal Australians is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world. Most Oceanian countries are parliamentary democracies, with tourism serving as a large source of income for the Pacific island nations.\nDefinition.\nCharacteristics.\nDefinitions of Oceania vary. The broadest definition encompasses the islands between mainland Asia and the Americas. The island nation of Australia is the only piece of land in the area which is large enough to typically be considered a continent. The culture of the people who lived on these islands was often distinct from that of Asia and pre-Columbian America. Before Europeans arrived in the area, the sea shielded Australia and south central Pacific islands from cultural influences that spread through large continental landmasses and adjacent islands. The islands of the Malay Archipelago, north of Australia, mainly lie on the continental shelf of Asia, and their inhabitants had more exposure to mainland Asian culture as a result of this closer proximity.\nThe geographer Conrad Malte-Brun coined the French expression ('Oceanic lands') c.\u20091804. In 1814 another French cartographer, Adrien-Hubert Bru\u00e9, coined from this expression the shorter , which derives from the Latin word , and this from the Greek word (), 'ocean'. The term \"Oceania\" is used because, unlike the other continental groupings, it is the ocean that links the parts of the region together. John Eperjesi's 2005 book \"The Imperialist Imaginary\" says that Since the mid-19th century, Western cartographers have used the term \"Oceania\" to organize and classify the Pacific region.\nIn the 19th century, many geographers divided Oceania into mostly racially based subdivisions: \"Australasia\", \"Malesia\" (encompassing the Malay Archipelago), \"Melanesia\", \"Micronesia\" and \"Polynesia\". The 2011 book \"Maritime Adaptations of the Pacific\", by Richard W. Casteel and Jean-Claude Passeron, states that, Oceania has traditionally been considered a continent in anthropological studies, similar to Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Bartholomew described Oceania as one of six major world divisions, including Australia and Pacific islands. American author Samuel Griswold Goodrich wrote in his 1854 book \"History of All Nations\" that, some 19th-century geographers classified the Pacific islands as a third continent called Oceania, alongside the New and Old Worlds. In this book, the other two continents were categorized as being the New World (the Americas) and the Old World (Afro-Eurasia). In his 1879 book \"Australasia\", British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace commented that, geographers commonly used \"Oceania\" to refer to the Pacific islands, with Australia as its central landmass. He did not explicitly label Oceania a continent in the book, but did note that it was one of the six major divisions of the world. \"The Oxford Handbook of World History\" (2011) describes the Oceania is often treated as a secondary topic in world history, appearing at the end of global narratives as a marginal region. \nIn most non-English-speaking countries Oceania is treated as a continent in the sense that it is \"one of the parts of the world\", and Australia is only seen as an island nation. In other non-English-speaking countries Australia and Eurasia are thought of as continents, while Asia, Europe, and Oceania are regarded as \"parts of the world\". Nevertheless, various writers from English-speaking countries have described Oceania as a continent over the years. Prior to the 1950s, before the popularization of the theory of plate tectonics, Antarctica, Australia, and Greenland were sometimes described as island continents, but none were usually taught as one of the world's continents in the English-speaking countries. In his 1961 book \"The United States and the Southwest Pacific\", American author Clinton Hartley Grattan commented that, By 1961, the term \"Oceania\" to describe Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands was considered somewhat outdated. Australia is a founding member of the Pacific Islands Forum in 1971, and at times has been interpreted as the largest Pacific island. Some geographers group the Australian tectonic plate with others in the Pacific to form a geological continent. \"National Geographic\" defines Oceania as a continent based on its connection to the Pacific Ocean rather than landmass. Others have labelled it as the \"liquid continent\". The Pacific Ocean itself has been labelled as a \"continent of islands\", and contains approximately 25,000, which is more than all the other major oceans combined. In a 1991 article, American archeologist Toni L. Carrell wrote, The vast size and distances within the Pacific Basin make it challenging to view it as a single geographical unit.\nOceania's subregions of Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia cover two major plates; the Australian Plate (also known as the Indo-Australian Plate) and the Pacific Plate, in addition to two minor plates; the Nazca Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The Australian Plate includes Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and parts of New Zealand. The Pacific Plate covers the Solomon Islands and parts of New Zealand, as well as Micronesia (excluding the westernmost islands near the Philippine Sea Plate) and Polynesia (excluding Easter Island). The Nazca Plate, which includes Easter Island, neighbours the South American Plate, and is still considered to be a separate tectonic plate, despite only containing a handful of islands.\nThe new terms Near Oceania and Remote Oceania were proposed in 1973 by anthropologists Roger Green and Andrew Pawley. By their definition, Near Oceania consists of New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands, with the exception of the Santa Cruz Islands. They are designed to dispel the outdated categories of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia; many scholars now replace those categories with Green's terms since the early 1990s, but the old categories are still used in science, popular culture and general usage.\nBoundaries.\nIslands at the geographic extremes of Oceania are generally considered to be the Bonin Islands, a politically integral part of Japan; Hawaii, a state of the United States; Clipperton Island, a possession of France; Rapa Nui (Easter Island), belonging to Chile; and Macquarie Island, belonging to Australia.\nUnited Nations interpretation.\nThe United Nations (UN) has used its own geopolitical definition of Oceania since its foundation in 1947, which utilizes four of the five subregions from the 19th century: Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. This definition consists of discrete political entities, and so excludes the Bonin Islands, Hawaii, Clipperton Island and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, along with Easter Island \u2014 which was annexed by Chile in 1888. It is used in statistical reports, by the International Olympic Committee, and by many atlases. The UN categorizes Oceania, and by extension the Pacific area, as one of the major continental divisions of the world, along with Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Their definition includes American Samoa, Australia and their external territories, the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Fiji, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna, and the United States Minor Outlying Islands (Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island). The original UN definition of Oceania from 1947 included these same countries and semi-independent territories, which were mostly still colonies at that point. Hawaii had not yet become a U.S. state in 1947, and as such was part of the original UN definition of Oceania. The island states of Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, all located within the bounds of the Pacific or associated marginal seas, are excluded from the UN definition. The states of Hong Kong and Malaysia, located in both mainland Asia and marginal seas of the Pacific, are also excluded, as are Brunei, East Timor and Indonesian New Guinea/Western New Guinea. The CIA World Factbook also categorizes Oceania as one of the major continental divisions of the world, but the name \"Australia and Oceania\" is used. Their definition does not include all of Australia's external territories, but is otherwise the same as the UN's definition, and is also used for statistical purposes. The Pacific Islands Forum expanded during the early 2010s, and areas that were already included in the UN definition of Oceania, such as French Polynesia, gained membership.\nEarly interpretations.\nFrench writer Gustave d'Eichthal remarked in 1844 that, Oceania's boundaries as extending across the entire Pacific Ocean. Conrad Malte-Brun in 1824 defined Oceania as covering Australia, New Zealand, the islands of Polynesia (which then included all the Pacific islands) and the Malay Archipelago. Worcester described Oceania as a collection of numerous Pacific islands, categorizing it as one of the world's five major divisions. He also viewed Oceania as covering Australia, New Zealand, the Malay Archipelago and the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. In 1887, the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland referred to Australia as the area's westernmost land, while in 1870, British Reverend Alexander Mackay identified the Bonin Islands as its northernmost point, and Macquarie Island as its southernmost point. The Bonin Islands at that time were a possession of Britain; Macquarie Island, to the south of Tasmania, is a subantarctic island in the Pacific. It was politically associated with Australia and Tasmania by 1870.\nAlfred Russel Wallace believed in 1879 that Oceania extended to the Aleutian Islands, which are among the northernmost islands of the Pacific. The islands, now politically associated with Alaska, have historically had inhabitants that were related to Indigenous Americans, in addition to having non-tropical biogeography similar to that of Alaska and Siberia. Wallace insisted while the surface area of this wide definition was greater than that of Asia and Europe combined, the land area was only a little greater than that of Europe. American geographer Sophia S. Cornell claimed that the Aleutian Islands were not part of Oceania in 1857. She stated that Oceania was divided up into three groups; Australasia (which included Australia, New Zealand, and the Melanesian islands), Malesia (which included all present-day countries within the Malay Archipelago, not the modern country of Malaysia) and Polynesia (which included both the Polynesian and Micronesian islands in her definition). Aside from mainland Australia, areas that she identified as of high importance were Borneo, Hawaii, Indonesia's Java and Sumatra, New Guinea, New Zealand, the Philippines, French Polynesia's Society Islands, Tasmania, and Tonga.\nAmerican geographer Jesse Olney's 1845 book \"A Practical System of Modern Geography\" defined Oceania as consisting of the many islands of the Pacific located southeast of Asia. Olney divided up Oceania into three groups; Australasia (which included Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand), Malesia and Polynesia (which included the combined islands of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia in his definition). Publication \"Missionary Review of the World\" claimed in 1895 that Oceania was divided up into five groups; Australasia, Malesia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. It did not consider Hawaii to be part of Polynesia, due to its geographic isolation, commenting that Oceania also included, \"isolated groups and islands, such as the Hawaiian and Gal\u00e1pagos.\" In 1876, French geographer \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus described Australia's plant life as highly distinctive and noted that Hawaii and the Gal\u00e1pagos had significant numbers of unique, endemic plant species. Rand McNally &amp; Company, an American publisher of maps and atlases, defined Oceania as including Australia and the Pacific islands while classifying the Malay Archipelago as part of Asia. British linguist Robert Needham Cust argued in 1887 that the Malay Archipelago should be excluded since it had participated in Asian civilization. Cust considered Oceania's four subregions to be Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. New Zealand was categorized by him as being in Polynesia; and the only country in his definition of Australasia was Australia. His definition of Polynesia included both Easter Island and Hawaii, which had not yet been annexed by either Chile or the United States.\nThe \"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society\" stated in 1892 that Australia was a large island within Oceania rather than a small continent. It additionally commented:\nIt is certainly not necessary to consider the Hawaiian Islands and Australia as being in the same part of the world, it is however permissible to unite in one group all the islands which are scattered over the great ocean. It should be remarked that if we take the Malay Archipelago away from Oceania, as do generally the German geographers, the insular world contained in the great ocean is cut in two, and the least populated of the five parts of the world is diminished in order to increase the number of inhabitants of the most densely populated continent.\nRegarding Australia and the Pacific, \"Chambers's New Handy Volume American Encyclop\u00e6dia\" observed in 1885 that, the term \"Oceania\" has been used interchangeably with \"Australasia,\" though often excluding the Malay Archipelago, which some writers referred to as \"Malesia\". It added there was controversy over the exact limits of Oceania, saying that, the encyclopaedia mentioned the lack of agreement among geographers about the exact boundaries of Oceania. British physician and ethnologist James Cowles Prichard stated that the Aleutian and Kuril Islands, along with the coasts of Asia and America, marked the northern boundary of Oceania. However, Prichard argued that these islands were generally not considered part of Oceania because their inhabitants were not connected to the indigenous peoples of the more remote Pacific islands. He added that Hawaii was the most northerly area to be inhabited by races associated with Oceania.\nThe 1926 book \"Modern World History, 1776\u20131926\", by Alexander Clarence Flick, considered Oceania to include all islands in the Pacific, and associated the term with the Malay Archipelago, the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, the Aleutian Islands, Japan's Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan and the Kuril Islands. He further included in his definition Sakhalin, an island which is geologically part of the Japanese Archipelago, but that has been administered by Russia since World War II. Hong Kong, partly located in another marginal sea of the Pacific (the South China Sea) was also included in his definition. Australia and New Zealand were grouped together by Flick as Australasia, and categorized as being in the same area of the world as the islands of Oceania. Flick described the demographic composition of Oceania, stating that the majority of the population consisted of \"brown and yellow races,\" while whites were primarily \"owners and rulers.\" Hutton Webster's 1919 book \"Medieval and Modern History \"also defined Oceania broadly, stating that it encompassed all islands in the Pacific. Webster broke Oceania up into two subdivisions; the continental group, which included Australia, the Japanese archipelago, the Malay Archipelago and Taiwan, and the oceanic group, which included New Zealand and the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia.\nCharles Marion Tyler's 1885 book \"The Island World of the Pacific Ocean\" considered Oceania to ethnographically encompass Australia, New Zealand, the Malay Archipelago, and the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. However, Tyler included other Pacific islands in his book as well, such as the Aleutian Islands, the Bonin Islands, the Japanese archipelago, the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, the Kuril Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, California's Channel Islands and Farallon Islands, Canada's Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Islands (now known as Haida Gwaii), Chile's Chilo\u00e9 Island, Ecuador's Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Mexico's Guadalupe Island, Revillagigedo Islands, San Benito Islands and Tres Mar\u00edas Islands, and Peru's Chincha Islands. Islands in marginal seas of the Pacific were also covered in the book, including Alaska's Pribilof Islands and China's Hainan. Tyler additionally profiled the Anson Archipelago, which during the 19th century was a designation for a widely scattered group of purported islands in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean between Japan and Hawaii. The Anson archipelago included phantom islands such as Ganges Island and Los Jardines which were proven to not exist, as well as real islands such as Marcus Island and Wake Island. Tyler described Australia as \"the leviathan of the island groups of the world\". In his 1857 book \"A Treatise on Physical Geography\", Francis B. Fogg defined Oceania, or \"the Maritime World,\" as being divided into three major subregions: Australasia, Malesia, and Polynesia. Fogg defined Polynesia as covering the combined islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, as well as the Ryukyu Islands. He listed additional significant islands in the Pacific beyond those in the standard subregions of Oceania. Scottish academic John Merry Ross in 1879 considered Polynesia to cover the entire South and Central Pacific area, not just islands ethnographically within Polynesia. He wrote in \"The Globe Encyclopedia of Universal Information\" that, in its broadest sense, Polynesia could include islands spanning from Sumatra to the Gal\u00e1pagos, along with Australia. Ross acknowledged that Oceania had historically been applied to this vast region but noted that, by his time, the Malay Archipelago was often excluded.\nHistorical and contemporary interpretations.\nIn a 1972 article for the \"Music Educators Journal\" titled \"Musics of Oceania\", author Raymond F. Kennedy wrote:\nMany meanings have been given to the word Oceania. The most inclusive\u2013but not always the most useful\u2013embraces about 25,000 land areas between Asia and the Americas. A more popular and practical definition excludes Indonesia, East Malaysia (Borneo), the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and other islands closely related to the Asian mainland, as well as the Aleutians and the small island groups situated near the Americas. Thus, Oceania most commonly refers to the land areas of the South and Central Pacific.\nKennedy defined Oceania as including Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. The U.S. Government Publishing Office's \"Area Handbook for Oceania\" from 1971 states that Australia and New Zealand are the principal large sovereignties of the area. It further states:\nIn its broadest definition Oceania embraces all islands and island groups of the Pacific Ocean that lie between Asia and the two American continents. In popular usage, however, the designation has a more restricted application. The islands of the North Pacific, such as the Aleutians and the Kuriles, usually are excluded. In addition, the series of sovereign island nations fringing Asia (Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, East Malaysia, the Republic of Indonesia) are not ordinarily considered to be part of the area.\nIn 1948, American military journal \"Armed Forces Talk\" broke the islands of the Pacific up into five major subdivisions; Indonesia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia and the non-tropical Islands. The Indonesia subdivision consisted of the islands of the Malay Archipelago, while the non-tropical islands were categorized as being North Pacific islands such as Alaska's Kodiak archipelago, the Aleutian Islands, Japan, the Kuril Islands, and Sakhalin. Japan's Bonin and Ryukyu Islands are also considered to be subtropical islands, with the main Japanese archipelago being non-tropical. The journal associated the term Oceania with the Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian subdivisions, but not with the Indonesian or non-tropical subdivisions. The \"Pacific Islands Handbook\" (1945), by Robert William Robson, stated that, \"Pacific Islands generally are regarded as Pacific islands lying within the tropics. There are a considerable number of Pacific Islands outside the tropics. Most of them have little economic or political importance.\" He noted the political significance of the Aleutian Islands, which were invaded by the Japanese military in World War II, and categorized New Zealand's Antipodes Islands, Auckland Islands, Bounty Islands, Campbell Islands, Chatham Island and Kermadec Islands as being non-tropical islands of the South Pacific, along with Australia's Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. The Kermadec Islands, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island are also considered to be subtropical islands. Other non-tropical areas below the equator, such as Chilo\u00e9 Island, Macquarie Island, Tasmania, and the southern portions of mainland Australia and New Zealand, were not included in this category.\nAccording to the 1998 book \"Encyclopedia of Earth and Physical Sciences\", Oceania refers to Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, and more than 10,000 islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean. It notes that, \"the term [has] also come under scrutiny by many geographers. Some experts insist that Oceania encompasses even the cold Aleutian Islands and the islands of Japan. Disagreement also exists over whether or not Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan should be included in Oceania.\" The Japanese Archipelago, the Malay Archipelago and Taiwan and other islands near China are often deemed as a geological extension of Asia, since they do not have oceanic geology, instead being detached fragments of the Eurasian continent that were once physiographically connected. Certain Japanese islands off the main archipelago are not geologically associated with Asia. The book \"The World and Its Peoples: Australia, New Zealand, Oceania\" (1966) asserts that, \"Japan, Taiwan, the Aleutian Islands, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia [and] the Pacific archipelagos bordering upon the Far East Asian mainland are excluded from Oceania\", and that \"all the islands lying between Australia and the Americas, including Australia, are part of Oceania.\" Furthermore, the book adds that Hawaii is still within Oceania, despite being politically integrated into the U.S., and that the Pacific Ocean \"gives unity to the whole\" since \"all these varied lands emerge from or border upon the Pacific.\"\nThe 1876 book \"The Countries of the World\", by British scientist and explorer Robert Brown, labelled the Malay Archipelago as Northwestern Oceania, but Brown still noted that these islands belonged more to the Asian continent. They are now often referred to as Maritime Southeast Asia, with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore being founding members of the ASEAN regional organization for Southeast Asia in 1967 (Brunei and East Timor did not exist as independent nations at that point). Brown also categorized Japan and Taiwan as being in the same part of the world as the islands of Oceania, and excluded them from \"The Countries of the World: Volume 5\", which covered mainland Asia and Hong Kong. However, Brown did not explicitly associate Japan or Taiwan with the term Oceania. He divided Oceania into two subregions: Eastern Oceania, which included the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, and Southwestern Oceania, which included Australia and New Zealand. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and the Revillagigedo Islands were identified as the easternmost areas of Oceania in the book. Brown wrote, \"they lie nearest the American continent of all oceanic islands, and though rarely associated with Polynesia, and never appearing to have been inhabited by any aboriginal races, are, in many ways, remarkable and interesting.\" Brown went on to add, \"the small islands lying off the continent, like the Queen Charlotte's in the North Pacific, the Farallones off California, and the Chinchas off Peru are\u2014to all intents and purposes, only detached bits of the adjoining shores. But in the case of the Gal\u00e1pagos, at least, this is different.\" The Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and the neighbouring Desventuradas Islands are today seen as the easternmost extension of the Indo-West Pacific biogeographic region. The islands lie on the Nazca Plate with Easter Island and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, and have a significant south central Pacific component to their marine fauna. According to scientific journal \"PLOS One\", the Humboldt Current helps create a biogeographic barrier between the marine fauna of these islands and South America. Chile's government have occasionally considered them to be within Oceania along with Easter Island. Chile's government also categorize Easter Island, the Desventuradas Islands and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands as being part of a region titled Insular Chile. They further include in this region Salas y G\u00f3mez, a small uninhabited island to the east of Easter Island. \"PLOS One\" describe Insular Chile as having \"cultural and ecological connections to the broader insular Pacific.\"\nIn her 1997 book \"Australia and Oceania\", Australian historian Kate Darian-Smith defined the area as covering Australia, New Zealand and the islands of the Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. She excluded Hawaii from her definition, but not Easter Island. The International Union for Conservation of Nature stated in a 1986 report that they include Easter Island in their definition of Oceania \"on the basis of its Polynesian and biogeographic affinities even though it is politically apart\", further noting that other oceanic islands administered by Latin American countries had been included in definitions of Oceania. In 1987, \"The Journal of Australasian Cave Research\" described Oceania as being \"the region from Irian Jaya (Western New Guinea, a province of New Guinea) in the west to Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (Equador) and Easter Island (Chile) in the east.\" In a 1980 report on venereal diseases in the South Pacific, the \"British Journal of Venereal Diseases\" categorized the Desventuradas Islands, Easter Island, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands as being in an eastern region of the South Pacific, along with areas such as Pitcairn Islands and French Polynesia, but noted that the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were not a member of the South Pacific Commission, like other islands in the South Pacific. The South Pacific Commission is a developmental organization formed in 1947 and is currently known as the Pacific Community; its members include Australia and other Pacific Islands Forum members. In a 1947 article on the formation of the South Pacific Commission for the \"Pacific Affairs\" journal, author Roy E. James stated the organization's scope encompassed all non-self governing islands below the equator to the east of Papua New Guinea (which itself was included in the scope and then known as Dutch New Guinea). Easter Island and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were defined by James as falling within the organization's geographical parameters. The 2007 book \"Asia in the Pacific Islands: Replacing the West\", by New Zealand Pacific scholar Ron Crocombe, defined the term \"Pacific Islands\" as being islands in the South Pacific Commission, and stated that such a definition \"does not include Gal\u00e1pagos and other [oceanic] islands off the Pacific coast of the Americas; these were uninhabited when Europeans arrived, then integrated with a South American country and have almost no contact with other Pacific Islands.\" He adds, \"Easter Island still participates in some Pacific Island affairs because its people are Polynesian.\"\nThomas Sebeok's two volume 1971 book \"Linguistics in Oceania\" defines Easter Island, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, Costa Rica's Cocos Island and Colombia's Malpelo Island (all oceanic) as making up a Spanish language segment of Oceania. Cocos Island and Malpelo Island are the only landmasses located on the Cocos Plate, which is to the north of the Nazca Plate. The book observed that a native Polynesian language was still understood on Easter Island, unlike with the other islands, which were uninhabited when discovered by Europeans and mostly being used as prisons for convicts. Additionally, the book includes Taiwan and the entire Malay Archipelago as part of Oceania. While not oceanic in nature, Taiwan and Malay Archipelago countries like Indonesia and the Philippines share Austronesian ethnolinguistic origins with Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, hence their inclusion in the book. Hainan, which neighbours Taiwan, also has Austronesian ethnolinguistic origins, although it was not included in the book. The book defined Oceania's major subregions as being Australia, Indonesia (which included all areas associated with the Malay Archipelago), Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. In 2010, Australian historian Bronwen Douglas claimed in \"The Journal of Pacific History\" that \"a strong case could be made for extending Oceania to at least Taiwan, the homeland of the Austronesian language family whose speakers colonized significant parts of the region about 6,000 years ago.\" For political reasons, Taiwan was a member of the Oceania Football Confederation during the 1970s and 1980s, rather than the Asian Football Confederation.\nIan Todd's 1974 book \"Island Realm: A Pacific Panorama\" also defines oceanic Latin American islands as making up a Spanish language segment of Oceania, and included the Desventuradas Islands, Easter Island, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Guadalupe Island, the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, the Revillagigedo Islands and Salas y G\u00f3mez. Cocos Island and Malpelo Island were not explicitly referenced in the book, despite being areas which would fall within this range. All other islands associated with Latin American countries were excluded, as they are continental in nature, unlike Guadalupe Island and the Revillagigedo Islands (both situated on the Pacific Plate) and the oceanic islands situated on the Cocos Plate and Nazca Plate. Todd defined the oceanic Bonin Islands as making up a Japanese language segment of Oceania, and excluded the main Japanese archipelago. Todd further included the Aleutian Islands in his definition of Oceania. The island chain borders both the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and is geologically a partially submerged volcanic extension of the Aleutian Range on the Alaskan mainland. He did not include the volcanic Kuril Islands and Ryukyu Islands, which similarly border both the Eurasian Plate and the Pacific Plate, nor did he include the neighbouring Kodiak archipelago in the North Pacific Ocean, which is firmly situated on the North American Plate. \"The Stockholm Journal of East Asian Studies\" stated in 1996 that Oceania was defined as Australia and an ensemble of various Pacific Islands, \"particularly those in the central and south Pacific [but] never those in the extreme north, for example the Aleutian chain.\" In the \"Pacific Ocean Handbook\" (1945), author Eliot Grinnell Mears claimed, \"it is customary to exclude the Aleutians of the North Pacific, the American coastal islands and the Netherlands East Indies\", and that he included Australia and New Zealand in Oceania for \"scientific reasons; Australia's fauna is largely continental in character, New Zealand's are clearly insular; and neither Commonwealth realm has close ties with Asia.\" In his 2002 book \"Oceania: An Introduction to the Cultures and Identities of Pacific Islanders\", Andrew Strathern excluded Okinawa and the rest of the Ryukyu Islands from his definition of Oceania, but noted that the islands and their indigenous inhabitants \"show many parallels with Pacific island societies.\"\nIn the 2006 book \"Extinction and Biogeography of Tropical Pacific Birds\", American paleontologist David Steadman wrote, \"no place on earth is as perplexing as the 25,000 islands that make Oceania.\" Steadman viewed Oceania as encompassing Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia (including Easter Island and Hawaii). He excluded from his definition the larger islands of New Guinea and New Zealand, and argued that Cocos Island, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, the Revillagigedo Islands and other oceanic islands nearing the Americas were not part of Oceania, due to their biogeographical affinities with that area and lack of prehistoric indigenous populations. In his 2018 book \"Regionalism in South Pacific\", Chinese author Yu Changsen wrote that some \"stress a narrow vision of the Pacific as those Pacific Islands excluding Australia and even sometimes New Zealand\", adding that the term Oceania \"promotes a broader concept that has room for Australia and New Zealand.\"\nAmerican marine geologist Anthony A. P. Koppers wrote in the 2009 book \"Encyclopedia of Islands\" that, \"as a whole, the islands of the Pacific Region are referred to as Oceania, the tenth continent on earth. Inherent to their remoteness and because of the wide variety of island types, the Pacific Islands have developed unique social, biological and geological characteristics.\" Koppers considered Oceania to encompass the entire 25,000 islands of the Pacific Ocean. In this book, he included the Aleutian Islands, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, the Japanese archipelago, the Kuril Islands and continental islands off the coast of the Americas such as the Channel Islands, the Farallon Islands and Vancouver Island; all of these islands lie in or close to the Pacific Ring of Fire, as is the case with New Guinea and New Zealand, which were also included. In the 2013 book \"The Environments of the Poor in Southeast Asia, East Asia and the Pacific\", Paul Bullen critiqued the definition of Oceania in \"Encyclopedia of Islands\", and wrote that since Koppers included areas such as Vancouver Island, it is \"not clear what the referents of 'Pacific Region', 'Oceania' or 'Pacific Islands' are.\" Bullen added that, \"Asia, Europe and the Maritime Continent are not literal geographic continents. The 'Asia\u2013Pacific region' would comprise two quasi-continents. 'The Pacific' would not refer to the Pacific Ocean and everything in it e.g., the Philippines.\" \"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names\" (2017), by John Everett-Heath, states that Oceania is \"a collective name for more than 10,000 islands in the Pacific Ocean\" and that \"it is generally accepted that Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the islands north of Japan (the Kurils and Aleutians) are excluded.\" In his 1993 book \"A New Oceania: Rediscovering Our Sea of Islands\", New Guinea-born Fijian scholar Epeli Hau\u02bbofa wrote that, \"Pacific Ocean islands from Japan, through the Philippines and Indonesia, which are adjacent to the Asian mainland, do not have oceanic cultures, and are therefore not part of Oceania.\"\n\"The Oxford Handbook of Prehistoric Oceania\" (2018) defined Oceania as only covering Austronesian-speaking islands in Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, with this definition including New Guinea and New Zealand. Other Austronesian areas such as Indonesia and the Philippines were not included, due to their closer cultural proximity to mainland Asia. Australia was also not included, as it was settled several thousands of years before the arrival of Austronesian-speaking peoples in Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. The book stated, \"this definition of Oceania might seem too restrictive: Why not include Australia, for example, or even too broad, for what does Highland New Guinea have to do with Hawai\u02bbi?\", further noting that, \"a few other islands in the Pacific such as those of Japan or the Channel Islands off the southern California coast are not typically considered Oceania as the indigenous populations of these places do not share a common ancestry with Oceanic groups, except for a time far before humans sailed Pacific waters.\" It has been theorized that the indigenous J\u014dmon people of the Japanese archipelago are related to Austronesians, along with the indigenous inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands. Some also theorize that Indigenous Australians are related to the Ainu people, who are the original inhabitants of Japan's Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin. In their 2019 book \"Women and Violence: Global Lives in Focus\", Kathleen Nadeau and Sangita Rayamajhi wrote:\nthe Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and most of Indonesia are not usually considered to be part of the region of Oceania as it is understood today. These regions are usually considered to be part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Although these regions, as well as the large East Asian islands of Taiwan, Hainan and the Japanese archipelago, have varying degrees of cultural connections.\nIn \"Reptiles and Amphibians of the Pacific Islands: A Comprehensive Guide\" (2013), George R. Zug claimed that \"a standard definition of Oceania includes Australia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, and New Zealand and the oceanic islands of Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia.\" He went on to write that his preferred definition of Oceania emphasizes islands with oceanic geology, stating that oceanic islands are, \"islands with no past connections to a continental landmass\" and that, \"these boundaries encompass the Hawaiian and Bonin Islands in the north and Easter Island in the south, and the Palau Islands in the west to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the east.\" Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand and New Caledonia (which is geologically associated with New Zealand) were all excluded, as these areas are descendants of the ancient Pangaea supercontinent, along with landmasses such as the Americas and Afro-Eurasia. Volcanic islands which are geologically associated with continental landmasses, such as the Aleutian Islands, Japan's Izu Islands, the Kuril Islands, the Ryukyu Islands and most of the Solomon Islands, were also excluded from his definition. Unlike the United Nations, the World Factbook defines the still-uninhabited Clipperton Island as being a discrete political entity, and they categorize it as part of North America, presumably due to its relative proximity (situated 1,200 kilometres off Mexico on the Pacific Plate). Clipperton is not politically associated with the Americas, as is the case with other oceanic islands nearing the Americas, having had almost no interaction with the continent throughout its history. From the early 20th century to 2007, the island was administratively part of French Polynesia, which itself was known as French Oceania up until 1957. In terms of marine fauna, Clipperton shares similarities with areas of the Pacific which are much farther removed from the Americas. Scottish author Robert Hope Moncrieff considered Clipperton to be the easternmost point of Oceania in 1907, while Ian Todd also included it in his definition of Oceania in \"Island Realm: A Pacific Panorama\".\nOther uninhabited Pacific Ocean landmasses have been explicitly associated with Oceania, including the highly remote Baker Island and Wake Island (now administered by the U.S. military). This is due to their location in the centre of the Pacific, their biogeography and their oceanic geology. Less isolated oceanic islands that were once uninhabited, such as the Bonin Islands, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, have since been sparsely populated by citizens of their political administrators. Archaeological evidence suggests that Micronesians may have lived on the Bonin Islands c.\u20092,000 years ago, but they were uninhabited at the time of European discovery in the 16th century.\nBoundaries between subregions.\nDepending on the definition, New Zealand could be part of Polynesia, or part of Australasia with Australia. New Zealand was originally settled by the Polynesian M\u0101ori, and has long maintained a political influence over the subregion. Through immigration and high M\u0101ori birth rates, New Zealand has attained the largest population of Polynesians in the world, while Australia has the third largest Polynesian population (consisting entirely of immigrants). Modern-day Indigenous Australians are loosely related to Melanesians, and Australia maintains political influence over Melanesia, which is mostly located on the same tectonic plate. Despite this, Australia is rarely seen as a part of the subregion. As with Australia and New Zealand, Melanesia's New Caledonia has a significant non-indigenous European population, numbering around 71,000. Conversely, New Caledonia has still had a similar history to the rest of Melanesia, and their French-speaking Europeans make up only 27% of the total population. As such, it is not also culturally considered a part of the predominantly English-speaking Australasia. Some cultural and political definitions of Australasia include most or all of Melanesia, due to its geographical proximity to Australia and New Zealand, but these are rare. Australia, New Zealand and the islands of Melanesia are more commonly grouped together as part of the Australasian biogeographical realm. Papua New Guinea is geographically the closest country to Australia, and is often geologically associated with Australia as it was once physiologically connected. Australia's Indian Ocean external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are situated within the bounds of the Australian Plate and have been geographically associated with Southeast Asia, due to their proximity to western Indonesia. Both were uninhabited when discovered by Europeans during the 17th century. Approximately half of the population on these islands are European Australian mainlanders (with smaller numbers being European New Zealanders), while the other half are immigrants from China or the nearby Malay Archipelago. Australia's Indian Ocean external territory Heard Island and McDonald Islands lie on the Antarctic Plate and are also thought of as being in Antarctica or no region at all, due to their extreme geographical isolation. The World Factbook define Heard Island and McDonald Islands as part of Antarctica, while placing Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands as the westernmost extent of Oceania.\nNorfolk Island, an external territory of Australia, was inhabited in prehistoric times by either Melanesians or Polynesians, and is geographically adjacent to the islands of Melanesia. The current inhabitants are mostly European Australians, and the UN categorize it as being in the Australasia subregion. The 1982 edition of the \"South Pacific Handbook\", by David Stanley, groups Australia, New Zealand, Norfolk Island, and Hawai\u02bbi together under an \"Anglonesia\" category. This is in spite of the geographical distance separating these areas from Hawai\u02bbi, which technically lies in the North Pacific. The 1985 edition of the \"South Pacific Handbook\" also groups the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands as being in Polynesia, while noting that they are not culturally a part of the subregion. The islands are typically grouped with others in the southeastern Pacific that were never inhabited by Polynesians.\nThe Bonin Islands are in the same biogeographical realm as the geographically adjacent Micronesia, and are often grouped in with the subregion because of this.\nHistory.\nColonisation of Oceania.\nAustralia.\nIndigenous Australians are the original inhabitants of the Australian continent and nearby islands who migrated from Africa to Asia c. 70,000 years ago and arrived in Australia c. 50,000 years ago. They are believed to be among the earliest human migrations out of Africa. Although they likely migrated to Australia through Southeast Asia, they are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or Polynesian population. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the Austronesian peoples of modern-day New Guinea and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage.\nThey reached Tasmania c. 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last ice age. It is believed that the first early human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the Sahul continent, connected to the island of New Guinea via a land bridge. The Torres Strait Islanders are indigenous to the Torres Strait Islands, which are at the northernmost tip of Queensland near Papua New Guinea. The earliest definite human remains found in Australia are that of Mungo Man, which have been dated at c. 40,000 years old.\nIt is estimated that 4% to 6% of the genome in Melanesians (e.g. Papua New Guinean and Bougainville Islander) derives from the Denisova hominin, an ancient human species discovered in 2010, while no Eurasians or Africans displayed contributions of the Denisovan genes.\nMelanesia.\nThe original inhabitants of the group of islands now named Melanesia were likely the ancestors of the present-day Papuan-speaking people. Migrating from Southeast Asia, they appear to have occupied these islands as far east as the main islands in the Solomon Islands archipelago, including Makira and possibly the smaller islands farther to the east.\nParticularly along the north coast of New Guinea and in the islands north and east of New Guinea, the Austronesian people, who had migrated into the area somewhat more than 3,000 years ago, came into contact with these pre-existing populations of Papuan-speaking peoples. In the late 20th century, some scholars theorized a long period of interaction, which resulted in many complex changes in genetics, languages, and culture among the peoples.\nMicronesia.\nMicronesia began to be settled several millennia ago, although there are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first settlers. There are numerous difficulties with conducting archaeological excavations in the islands, due to their size, settlement patterns and storm damage. As a result, much evidence is based on linguistic analysis.\nThe earliest archaeological traces of civilization have been found on the island of Saipan, dated to 1500 BCE or slightly before. The ancestors of the Micronesians settled there over 4,000 years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centred on Yap and Pohnpei. The prehistories of many Micronesian islands such as Yap are not known very well.\nThe first people of the Northern Mariana Islands navigated to the islands and discovered it at some period between 4000 BCE to 2000 BCE from Southeast Asia. They became known as the Chamorros. Their language was named after them. The ancient Chamorro left a number of megalithic ruins, including Latte stone. The Refaluwasch or Carolinian people came to the Marianas in the 1800s from the Caroline Islands. Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands during the 2nd millennium BCE, with inter-island navigation made possible using traditional stick charts.\nPolynesia.\nThe Polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic, archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea-migrating Austronesian people and tracing Polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins in the Malay Archipelago, and ultimately, in Taiwan. Between c. 3000 and 1000 BCE, speakers of Austronesian languages began spreading from Taiwan into Island Southeast Asia, as tribes whose natives were thought to have arrived through South China c. 8,000 years ago to the edges of western Micronesia and on into Melanesia.\nIn the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with some certainty. It is thought that by roughly 1400 BCE, \"Lapita Peoples\", so-named after their pottery tradition, appeared in the Bismarck Archipelago of north-west Melanesia.\nEaster Islanders claimed that a chief Hotu Matu\ua78ca discovered the island in one or two large canoes with his wife and extended family. They are believed to have been Polynesian. Around 1200, Tahitian explorers discovered and began settling the area. This date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities. Moreover, a recent study which included radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material suggests that the island was discovered and settled as recently as 1200.\nEuropean exploration.\nOceania was first explored by Europeans from the 16th century onwards. Portuguese navigators, between 1512 and 1526, reached the Maluku Islands (by Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu and Francisco Serr\u00e3o in 1512), Timor, the Aru Islands (Martim A. Melo Coutinho), the Tanimbar Islands, some of the Caroline Islands (by Gomes de Sequeira in 1525), and west Papua New Guinea (by Jorge de Menezes in 1526). In 1519, a Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan sailed down the east coast of South America, found and sailed through the strait that bears his name and on 28 November 1520 entered the ocean which he named \"Pacific\". The three remaining ships, led by Magellan and his captains Duarte Barbosa and Jo\u00e3o Serr\u00e3o, then sailed north and caught the trade winds which carried them across the Pacific to the Philippines where Magellan was killed. One surviving ship led by Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano returned west across the Indian Ocean and the other went north in the hope of finding the westerlies and reaching Mexico. Unable to find the right winds, it was forced to return to the East Indies. The Magellan-Elcano expedition achieved the first circumnavigation of the world and reached the Philippines, the Mariana Islands, and other islands of Oceania.\nFrom 1527 to 1595, a number of other large Spanish expeditions crossed the Pacific Ocean, leading to the arrival in Marshall Islands and Palau in the North Pacific, as well as Tuvalu, the Marquesas Islands, the Solomon Islands archipelago, the Cook Islands, and the Admiralty Islands in the South Pacific.\nIn the quest for Terra Australis, Spanish explorations in the 17th century, such as the expedition led by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s, sailed to Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos, and sailed the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, named after navigator Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres. Willem Janszoon, made the first completely documented European landing in Australia (1606), in Cape York Peninsula. Abel Tasman circumnavigated and landed on parts of the Australian continental coast and discovered Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), New Zealand in 1642, and Fiji. He was the first known European explorer to reach these islands.\nOn 23 April 1770, British explorer James Cook made his first recorded direct observation of Aboriginal Australians at Brush Island near Bawley Point. On 29 April, Cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the Kurnell Peninsula. It is here that James Cook made first contact with an aboriginal tribe known as the Gweagal. His expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline of Australia.\nEuropean settlement and colonisation.\nIn 1789, the mutiny on the Bounty against William Bligh led to several of the mutineers escaping the Royal Navy and settling on Pitcairn Islands, which later became a British colony. Britain also established colonies in Australia in 1788, New Zealand in 1840 and Fiji in 1872, with much of Oceania becoming part of the British Empire. The Gilbert Islands (now known as Kiribati) and the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu) came under Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century.\nFrench Catholic missionaries arrived on Tahiti in 1834; their expulsion in 1836 caused France to send a gunboat in 1838. In 1842, Tahiti and Tahuata were declared a French protectorate, to allow Catholic missionaries to work undisturbed. On 24 September 1853, under orders from Napoleon III, Admiral Febvrier Despointes took formal possession of New Caledonia.\nThe Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar landed in the Marshall Islands in 1529. They were named by Krusenstern, after English explorer John Marshall, who visited them together with Thomas Gilbert in 1788, en route from Botany Bay to Canton (two ships of the First Fleet). In 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \"Territory of Papua\"); and in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. The Marshall Islands were claimed by Spain in 1874. Germany established colonies in New Guinea in 1884, and Samoa in 1900. The United States also expanded into the Pacific, beginning with Baker Island and Howland Island in 1857, and with Hawai\u02bbi becoming a US territory in 1898. Disagreements between the US, the UK, and Germany over Samoa led to the Tripartite Convention of 1899.\nModern history.\nOne of the first land offensives in Oceania was the Occupation of German Samoa in August 1914 by New Zealand forces. The campaign to take Samoa ended without bloodshed after over 1,000 New Zealanders landed on the German colony. Australian forces attacked German New Guinea in September 1914. A company of Australians and a British warship besieged the Germans and their colonial subjects, ending with a German surrender.\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the morning of 7 December 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese subsequently invaded New Guinea, Solomon Islands and other Pacific islands. The Japanese were turned back at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Kokoda Track campaign before they were finally defeated in 1945. Some of the most prominent Oceanic battlegrounds were the Battle of Bita Paka, the Solomon Islands campaign, the Air raids on Darwin, the Kokoda Track, and the Borneo campaign. The United States fought the Battle of Guam from 21 July to 10 August 1944, to recapture the island from Japanese military occupation.\nAustralia and New Zealand became dominions in the 20th century, adopting the Statute of Westminster Act in 1942 and 1947 respectively. In 1946, Polynesians were granted French citizenship and the islands' status was changed to an overseas territory; the islands' name was changed in 1957 to \"Polyn\u00e9sie Fran\u00e7aise\" (French Polynesia). Hawaii became a U.S. state in 1959. Fiji and Tonga became independent in 1970. On 1 May 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the Marshall Islands, the United States recognised the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The South Pacific Forum was founded in 1971, which became the Pacific Islands Forum in 2000.\nGeography.\nUnder a four subregion model, the islands of Oceania extend to New Guinea in the west, the Bonin Islands in the northwest, the Hawaiian Islands in the northeast, Easter Island and Sala y G\u00f3mez Island in the east, and Macquarie Island in the south. Excluded under most definitions of Oceania are the Pacific landmasses of Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Japanese archipelago, which are all on the margins of Asia, as well as the Aleutian Islands and other Alaskan or Canadian islands. In its periphery, Oceania's islands would sprawl 28 degrees north to the Bonin Islands in the Northern Hemisphere, and 55 degrees south to Macquarie Island in the Southern Hemisphere.\nOceanian islands are of four basic types: continental islands, high islands, coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms. High islands are of volcanic origin, and many contain active volcanoes. Among these are Bougainville, Hawai\u02bbi, and Solomon Islands.\nOceania is one of eight terrestrial biogeographic realms, which constitute the major ecological regions of the planet. Related to these concepts are Near Oceania, that part of western Island Melanesia which has been inhabited for tens of millennia, and Remote Oceania which is more recently settled. Although the majority of the Oceanian islands lie in the South Pacific, a few of them are not restricted to the Pacific Ocean \u2013 Kangaroo Island and Ashmore and Cartier Islands, for instance, are situated in the Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean, respectively, and Tasmania's west coast faces the Southern Ocean.\nThe coral reefs of the South Pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean's surface. One of the most dramatic is the Great Barrier Reef off northeastern Australia with chains of reef patches. A second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform, which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands. Examples include Banaba (formerly Ocean Island) and Makatea in the Tuamotu group of French Polynesia.\nRegions.\nMicronesia, which lies north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, includes the Mariana Islands in the northwest, the Caroline Islands in the centre, the Marshall Islands to the west and the islands of Kiribati in the southeast.\nMelanesia, to the southwest, includes New Guinea, the world's second largest island after Greenland and by far the largest of the Pacific islands. The other main Melanesian groups from north to south are the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, the Santa Cruz Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia.\nPolynesia, stretching from Hawaii in the north to New Zealand in the south, also encompasses Tuvalu, Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga, and the Kermadec Islands to the west, the Cook Islands, Society Islands and Austral Islands in the centre, and the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotus, Mangareva Islands, and Easter Island to the east.\nAustralasia comprises Australia, New Zealand, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Along with India most of Australasia lies on the Indo-Australian Plate with the latter occupying the Southern area. It is flanked by the Indian Ocean to the west and the Southern Ocean to the south.\nGeology.\nThe Pacific Plate, which makes up most of Oceania, is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. At , it is the largest tectonic plate. The plate contains an interior hot spot forming the Hawaiian Islands. It is almost entirely oceanic crust. The oldest member disappearing by way of the plate tectonics cycle is early-Cretaceous (145 to 137 million years ago).\nAustralia became part of the Indo-Australian Plate 45 to 40 million years ago and this is in the process of separating again with the Australian Plate being relevant to Oceania. It is the lowest, flattest, and oldest landmass on Earth and it has had a relatively stable geological history. Geological forces such as tectonic uplift of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of Gondwana. Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, has occasional middle-sized earthquakes, and currently has no active volcanism (but some volcanoes in southeast Australia erupted within the last 10,000 years).\nThe geology of New Zealand is noted for its volcanic activity, earthquakes, and geothermal areas because of its position on the boundary of the Australian Plate and Pacific Plates. Much of the basement rock of New Zealand was once part of the super-continent of Gondwana, along with South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Antarctica and Australia. The rocks that now form the continent of Zealandia were nestled between Eastern Australia and Western Antarctica.\nThe Australia-New Zealand continental fragment of Gondwana split from the rest of Gondwana in the late Cretaceous time (95\u201390 Ma). By 75 Ma, Zealandia was essentially separate from Australia and Antarctica, although only shallow seas might have separated Zealandia and Australia in the north. The Tasman Sea, and part of Zealandia then locked together with Australia to form the Australian Plate (40 Ma), and a new plate boundary was created between the Australian Plate and Pacific Plate.\nMost islands in the Pacific are high islands (volcanic islands), such as, Easter Island, American Samoa and Fiji, among others, having peaks up to 1300 m rising abruptly from the shore. The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were formed c. 7 to 30 million years ago, as shield volcanoes over the same volcanic hotspot that formed the Emperor Seamounts to the north and the Main Hawaiian Islands to the south. Hawaii's tallest mountain Mauna Kea is above mean sea level.\nFlora.\nThe most diverse country of Oceania when it comes to the environment is Australia, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre. Desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land. The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland. The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested Cape York Peninsula.\nProminent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to aridity and fire which include scleromorphy and serotiny. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families Proteaceae (\"Banksia\"), Myrtaceae (\"Eucalyptus\" \u2013 gum trees), and Fabaceae (\"Acacia\" \u2013 wattle). The flora of Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia is tropical dry forest, with tropical vegetation that includes palm trees, \"Premna protrusa\", \"Psydrax odorata\", \"Gyrocarpus americanus\", and \"Derris trifoliata\".\nNew Zealand's landscape ranges from the fjord-like sounds of the southwest to the tropical beaches of the far north. South Island is dominated by the Southern Alps. There are 18 peaks of more than 3000 metres (9800\u00a0ft) in the South Island. All summits over 2,900 m are within the Southern Alps, a chain that forms the backbone of the South Island; the highest peak of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook, at . Earthquakes are common, though usually not severe, averaging 3,000 per year. There is a wide variety of native trees, adapted to all the various micro-climates in New Zealand.\nIn Hawaii, one endemic plant, \"Brighamia\", now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct. The two species of \"Brighamia\"\u00a0\u2013 \"B. rockii\" and \"B. insignis\"\u00a0\u2013 are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants. To ensure these plants set seed, biologists rappel down cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas.\nFauna.\nThe aptly named Pacific kingfisher is found in the Pacific Islands, as is the Red-vented bulbul, Polynesian starling, Brown goshawk, Pacific Swallow and the Cardinal myzomela, among others. Birds breeding on Pitcairn include the fairy tern, common noddy, and red-tailed tropicbird. The Pitcairn reed warbler, endemic to Pitcairn Island, was added to the endangered species list in 2008.\nNative to Hawaii is the Hawaiian crow, which has been extinct in the wild since 2002. The brown tree snake is native to northern and eastern coasts of Australia, Papua New Guinea, Guam and Solomon Islands. Native to Australia, New Guinea and proximate islands are birds of paradise, honeyeaters, Australasian treecreeper, Australasian robin, kingfishers, butcherbirds, and bowerbirds.\nA unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals, and dominance of the marsupials \u2013 a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums, and dasyuromorphs. The passerines of Australia, also known as songbirds or perching birds, include wrens, the magpie group, thornbills, corvids, pardalotes, lyrebirds. Predominant bird species in the country include the Australian magpie, Australian raven, the pied currawong, crested pigeons and the laughing kookaburra. The koala, emu, platypus and kangaroo are national animals of Australia, and the Tasmanian devil is also one of the well-known animals in the country. The goanna is a predatory lizard native to the Australian mainland.\nThe birds of New Zealand evolved into an avifauna that included a large number of endemic species. As an island archipelago New Zealand accumulated bird diversity and when Captain James Cook arrived in the 1770s he noted that the bird song was deafening. The mix includes species with unusual biology such as the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d which is the world's only flightless, nocturnal, lek-breeding parrot, but also many species that are similar to neighbouring land areas. Some of the more well known and distinctive bird species in New Zealand are the kiwi, kea, takah\u0113, K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, mohua, t\u016b\u012b, and the bellbird. The tuatara is a notable reptile endemic to New Zealand.\nAustralia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Wallacea, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean collectively possess 42% of the world's parrot species, including half of all Critically Endangered parrots, many of which are endemic to the region.\nClimate.\nThe Pacific Islands are ruled by a tropical rainforest and tropical savanna climate. In the tropical and subtropical Pacific, the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects weather conditions. In the tropical western Pacific, the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the Asian landmass. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active.\nTo the southwest of the region, in the Australian landmass, the climate is mostly desert or semi-arid, with the southern coastal corners having a temperate climate, such as oceanic and humid subtropical climate in the east coast and Mediterranean climate in the west. The northern parts of the country have a tropical climate. Snow falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast, in the states of Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and in the Australian Capital Territory.\nMost regions of New Zealand belong to the temperate zone with a maritime climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb) characterised by four distinct seasons. Conditions vary from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to almost semi-arid in Central Otago and subtropical in Northland. Snow falls in New Zealand's South Island and at higher altitudes in the North Island. It is extremely rare at sea level in the North Island.\nHawaii, although being in the tropics, experiences many different climates, depending on latitude and its geography. The island of Hawaii for example hosts 4 (out of 5 in total) climate groups on a surface as small as according to the K\u00f6ppen climate types: tropical, arid, temperate and polar. The Hawaiian Islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months (October to April). A few islands in the northwest, such as Guam, are susceptible to typhoons in the wet season.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Oceania occurred in Oodnadatta, South Australia (2 January 1960), where the temperature reached . The lowest temperature ever recorded in Oceania was , at Ranfurly in Otago in 1903, with a more recent temperature of recorded in 1995 in nearby Ophir. Pohnpei of the Senyavin Islands in Micronesia is the wettest settlement in Oceania, and one of the wettest places on earth, with annual recorded rainfall exceeding each year in certain mountainous locations. The Big Bog on the island of Maui is the wettest place, receiving an average each year.\nPolitics.\nAustralia.\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy with Charles III at its apex as the King of Australia, a role that is distinct from his position as monarch of the other Commonwealth realms. The King is represented in Australia by the Governor-General at the federal level and by the Governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of his ministers. There are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party. Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left. The Australian Defence Force is by far the largest military force in Oceania.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Charles III is the King of New Zealand and the head of state. The King is represented by the Governor-General, whom he appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the King and the House of Representatives. A parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election. New Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and well-governed states, with high government transparency and among the lowest perceived levels of corruption.\nPacific Islands.\nIn Samoan politics, the Prime Minister of Samoa is the head of government. The 1960 constitution, which formally came into force with independence from New Zealand in 1962, builds on the British pattern of parliamentary democracy, modified to take account of Samoan customs. The national government (\"malo\") generally controls the legislative assembly. Politics of Tonga takes place in a framework of a constitutional monarchy, whereby the King of Tonga is the Head of State.\nFiji has a multiparty system with the Prime Minister of Fiji as head of government. The executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Parliament of Fiji. Fiji's Head of State is the President.\nIn the politics of Papua New Guinea the Prime Minister is the head of government, and the head of state is the monarch of the United Kingdom, represented by a Governor-General. In Kiribati, a Parliamentary regime, the President of Kiribati is the head of state and government, and of a multi-party system.\nNew Caledonia remains an integral part of the French Republic. Inhabitants of New Caledonia are French citizens. New Caledonia sends two representatives to the French National Assembly and two senators to the French Senate.\nHawaii is dominated by the Democratic Party. As codified in the Hawaiian Constitution, there are three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The governor is elected statewide.\nEconomy.\nThe linked map below shows the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the islands of Oceania and neighbouring areas, as a guide to the following table (there are few land boundaries that can be drawn on a map of the Pacific at this scale). \nAustralia \nNewZealand \nChatham \nHawaii \nWake \nFederated States&lt;br&gt;of Micronesia \nPalau \nPapua NewGuinea \nEasterIsland \nFrenchPolynesia \nCookIslands \nNew&lt;br&gt;Caledonia \nFiji \nTuvalu \nKiribati \nPhoenix \nLine \nSolomonIslands \nTokelau \nMarshallIslands \nNauru \nVanuatu \nTonga \nPitcairn \nGuam \nNorfolk \nNorthernMarianas \nSamoa \nAS \nWF \nNiue \nCocos \nChristmas \nRyukyu&lt;br&gt;Islands \nIzu \nBonin \nVolcano \nOkinotori&lt;br&gt;shima \nMinamitori&lt;br&gt;shima \nMidway \nJohnston \nClipperton \nSocorro \nHowland \nBaker \nKingman \nPalmyra \nJarvis \nCoral Sea \nLord&lt;br&gt;Howe \nKermadec \nBounties \nThree Kings \nAntipodes \nAucklands \nSolander \nSnares \nCampbell \nAshmore&lt;br&gt;&amp; Cartier \nMacquarie \nIndonesia \nPhilippines \nSarawak \nBN \nSabah \nMaluku \nPapua \nEast&lt;br&gt;Timor \nParacels \nSpratlys \nAustralia.\nAustralia and New Zealand are the only highly developed independent nations in the region, although the economy of Australia is by far the largest and most dominant economy in the region and one of the largest in the world. New Caledonia, Hawai\u02bbi, and French Polynesia are highly developed too but are not sovereign states. Australia's per-capita GDP is higher than that of the UK, Canada, Germany, and France in terms of purchasing power parity. New Zealand is also one of the most globalised economies and depends greatly on international trade.\nThe Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney is the largest stock exchange in Australia and in the South Pacific. In 2012, Australia was the 12th largest national economy by nominal GDP and the 19th-largest measured by PPP-adjusted GDP.\nMercer Quality of Living Survey ranks Sydney tenth in the world in terms of quality of living, making it one of the most livable cities. It is classified as an Alpha World City by GaWC. Melbourne also ranked highly in the world's most liveable city list, and is a leading financial centre in the Asia\u2013Pacific region.\nThe majority of people living in Australia work in health care, retail and education sectors. Australia boasts the largest amount of manufacturing in the region, producing cars, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand's economy is the 53rd-largest in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and 68th-largest in the world measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). A major economic and cultural powerhouse of the Southern Hemisphere, Auckland is ranked as a Beta+ world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Auckland and Wellington are frequently ranked among the world's most liveable cities, with Auckland being ranked first in the world according to the Global Liveability Ranking.\nNew Zealand has a large GDP for its population of 5.2 million, and sources of revenue are spread throughout the large island nation. The country has one of the most globalised economies and depends greatly on international trade \u2013 mainly with Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. New Zealand's 1983 Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia means that the economy aligns closely with that of Australia. In 2005, the World Bank praised New Zealand as the most business-friendly country in the world. The economy diversified and by 2008, tourism had become the single biggest generator of foreign exchange. The New Zealand dollar is the 10th-most traded currency in the world.\nPacific Islands.\nThe overwhelming majority of people living in the Pacific islands work in the service industry which includes tourism, education and financial services. Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States and South Korea. The smallest Pacific nations rely on trade with Australia, New Zealand and the United States for exporting goods and for accessing other products. Australia and New Zealand's trading arrangements are known as Closer Economic Relations. Australia and New Zealand, along with other countries, are members of Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the East Asia Summit (EAS), which may become trade blocs in the future particularly EAS.\nThe main produce from the Pacific is copra or coconut, but timber, beef, palm oil, cocoa, sugar, and ginger are also commonly grown across the tropics of the Pacific. Fishing provides a major industry for many of the smaller nations in the Pacific, although many fishing areas are exploited by other larger countries, namely Japan. Natural Resources, such as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold, are mined in Australia and Solomon Islands. Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States, India, South Korea and the European Union.\nEndowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, Fiji is one of the most developed of the Pacific island economies, though it remains a developing country with a large subsistence agriculture sector. Agriculture accounts for 18% of gross domestic product, although it employed some 70% of the workforce as of 2001. Sugar exports and the growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign exchange. Sugar cane processing makes up one-third of industrial activity. Coconuts, ginger, and copra are also significant.\nThe history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries; sandalwood, whaling, sugarcane, pineapple, the military, tourism and education. Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey. As of 2015[ [update]], Honolulu was ranked high on world livability rankings, and was also ranked as the 2nd safest city in the U.S.\nTourism.\nTourists mostly come from Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Fiji currently attracts almost half a million tourists each year, more than a quarter of whom come from Australia. This has contributed $1 billion or more to Fiji's economy since 1995, but the Government of Fiji likely underestimates these figures due to the invisible economy inside the tourism industry.\nVanuatu is widely recognised as one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the South Pacific region. Tourism has been promoted, in part, by Vanuatu being the site of several reality-TV shows. The ninth season of the reality TV series \"Survivor\" was filmed on Vanuatu, entitled \"\u00a0\u2013 Islands of Fire\". Two years later, Australia's \"Celebrity Survivor\" was filmed at the same location used by the U.S. version.\nTourism in Australia is an important component of the Australian economy. In the financial year 2014/15, tourism represented 3% of Australia's GDP contributing A$47.5 billion to the national economy. In 2015, there were 7.4 million visitor arrivals. Popular Australian destinations include the Sydney Harbour (Sydney Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, Royal Botanic Garden, etc.), Gold Coast (theme parks such as Warner Bros. Movie World, Dreamworld and Sea World), Walls of Jerusalem National Park and Mount Field National Park in Tasmania, Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, The Twelve Apostles in Victoria, Uluru (Ayers Rock) and the Australian outback.\nTourism in New Zealand contributes NZ$7.3 billion (or 4%) of the country's GDP in 2013, as well as directly supporting 110,800 full-time equivalent jobs (nearly 6% of New Zealand's workforce). International tourist spending accounted for 16% of New Zealand's export earnings (nearly NZ$10 billion). International and domestic tourism contributes, in total, NZ$24 billion to New Zealand's economy every year. Tourism New Zealand, the country's official tourism agency, is actively promoting the country as a destination worldwide. Milford Sound in South Island is acclaimed as New Zealand's most famous tourist destination.\nIn 2003 alone, according to state government data, there were over 6.4 million visitors to the Hawaiian Islands with expenditures of over $10.6 billion. Due to the mild year-round weather, tourist travel is popular throughout the year. In 2011, Hawai\u02bbi saw increasing arrivals and share of foreign tourists from Canada, Australia, and China increasing 13%, 24% and 21% respectively from 2010.\nDemographics.\nThe demographic table below shows the subregions and countries of geopolitical Oceania. The countries and territories in this table are categorised according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the United Nations. The information shown follows sources in cross-referenced articles; where sources differ, provisos have been clearly indicated. These territories and regions are subject to various additional categorisations, depending on the source and purpose of each description.\nReligion.\nThe predominant religion in Oceania is Christianity (73%). A 2011 survey found that 92% in Melanesia, 93% in Micronesia and 96% in Polynesia described themselves as Christians. Traditional religions are often animist, and prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in spirits (\"masalai\" in Tok Pisin) representing natural forces. In the 2018 census, 37% of New Zealanders affiliated themselves with Christianity and 48% declared no religion. In the 2016 Census, 52% of the Australian population declared some variety of Christianity and 30% stated \"no religion\".\nIn recent Australian and New Zealand censuses, large proportions of the population say they belong to \"no religion\" (which includes atheism, agnosticism, deism, and secular humanism). In Tonga, everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Christian faith. The Ahmadiyya mosque in Marshall Islands is the only mosque in Micronesia. Another one in Tuvalu belongs to the same sect. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship in Tiapapata, Samoa, is one of seven designations administered in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nHinduism is a minority faith in Oceania. Fiji has the highest percentage of Hindus in Oceania at 29.7% In absolute numbers, Australia has the largest population of Hindus in Oceania constituting 2.7% of the country's population. In New Zealand, Hindus form 2.65% of the population of. Samoa also has a significant Hindu population.\nOther religions in the region include Islam and Buddhism, which are prominent minority religions in Australia and New Zealand. Judaism, Sikhism and Jainism are also present. Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian-born Governor General of Australia and was the first Jewish vice-regal representative in the British Empire. Prince Philip Movement is followed around Yaohnanen village on the southern island of Tanna in Vanuatu.\nLanguages.\nNative languages of Oceania fall into three major geographic groups:\nImmigrants brought their own languages to the region. Common non-indigenous languages include English in Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and many other territories; French in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna; Japanese in the Bonin Islands; and Spanish on Easter Island and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. There are also Creoles formed from the interaction of Malay or the colonial languages with indigenous languages, such as Tok Pisin, Bislama, Chavacano, various Malay trade and creole languages, Hawaiian Pidgin, Norfuk, and Pitkern. Contact between Austronesian and Papuan resulted in several instances in mixed languages such as Maisin.\nImmigration.\nThe most multicultural areas in Oceania, which have a high degree of immigration, are Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. Since 1945, more than 7 million people have settled in Australia. From the late 1970s, there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries, making Australia a multicultural country.\nSydney is the most multicultural city in Oceania, having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40% of residents speaking a language other than English at home. Furthermore, 36 percent of the population reported having been born overseas, with top countries being Italy, Lebanon, Vietnam and Iraq, among others. Melbourne is also fairly multicultural, having the largest Greek-speaking population outside of Europe, and the second largest Asian population in Australia after Sydney.\nEuropean migration to New Zealand provided a major influx following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Subsequent immigration has been chiefly from the British Isles, but also from continental Europe, the Pacific, The Americas and Asia. Auckland is home to over half (51.6 percent) of New Zealand's overseas born population, including 72 percent of the country's Pacific Island-born population, 64 percent of its Asian-born population, and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African born population.\nHawaii is a majority-minority state. Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789. In 1820, the first American missionaries arrived to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways. As of 2015[ [update]], a large proportion of Hawaii's population have Asian ancestry\u00a0\u2013 especially Filipino, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugarcane plantations in the mid-to-late 19th century. Almost 13,000 Portuguese immigrants had arrived by 1899; they also worked on the sugarcane plantations. Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began in 1899 when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes, causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from Hawaii.\nBetween 2001 and 2007 Australia's Pacific Solution policy transferred asylum seekers to several Pacific nations, including the Nauru detention centre. Australia, New Zealand, and other nations took part in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands between 2003 and 2017 after a request for aid.\nArchaeogenetics.\nArchaeology, linguistics, and existing genetic studies indicate that Oceania was settled by two major waves of migration. The first migration of Australo-Melanesians took place c. 40 to 80 thousand years ago, and these migrants, Papuans, colonised much of Near Oceania. Approximately 3.5 thousand years ago, a second expansion of Austronesian speakers arrived in Near Oceania, and the descendants of these people spread to the far corners of the Pacific, colonising Remote Oceania.\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies quantify the magnitude of the Austronesian expansion and demonstrate the homogenising effect of this expansion. With regards to Papuan influence, autochthonous haplogroups support the hypothesis of a long history in Near Oceania, with some lineages suggesting a time depth of 60 thousand years. Santa Cruz, a population located in Remote Oceania, is an anomaly with extreme frequencies of autochthonous haplogroups of Near Oceanian origin.\nLarge areas of New Guinea are unexplored by scientists and anthropologists due to extensive forestation and mountainous terrain. Known indigenous tribes in Papua New Guinea have very little contact with local authorities aside from the authorities knowing who they are. Many remain preliterate and, at the national or international level, the names of tribes and information about them is extremely hard to obtain. The Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua on the island of New Guinea are home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.\nCulture.\nAustralia.\nSince 1788, the primary influence behind Australian culture has been Anglo-Celtic Western culture, with some Indigenous influences. The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture. Since the mid-20th century, American popular culture has strongly influenced Australia, particularly through television and cinema. Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries, and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations. \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906), the world's first feature length film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era. The Australian Museum in Sydney and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne are the oldest and largest museums in Oceania. The city's New Year's Eve celebrations are the largest in Oceania.\nAustralia is also known for its cafe and coffee culture in urban centres. Australia and New Zealand were responsible for the flat white coffee. Most Indigenous Australian tribal groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker. The first settlers introduced British food to the continent, much of which is now considered typical Australian food, such as the Sunday roast. Multicultural immigration transformed Australian cuisine; post-World War II European migrants, particularly from the Mediterranean, helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture, and the influence of Asian cultures has led to Australian variants of their staple foods, such as the Chinese-inspired dim sim and Chiko Roll.\nHawaii.\nThe music of Hawaii includes traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern rock and hip hop. Hawaii's musical contributions to the music of the United States are out of proportion to the state's small size. Styles such as slack-key guitar are well known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks. Hawaii also made a major contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar. The Hawaiian religion is polytheistic and animistic, with a belief in many deities and spirits, including the belief that spirits are found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky.\nThe cuisine of Hawaii is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and native Hawaiians, and American, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Polynesian, and Portuguese origins. Native Hawaiian musician and Hawaiian sovereignty activist Israel Kamakawiwo\u02bbole, famous for his medley of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\", was named \"The Voice of Hawaii\" by NPR in 2010 in its 50 great voices series.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand as a culture is a Western culture, which is influenced by the cultural input of the indigenous M\u0101ori and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration which followed the British colonisation of New Zealand. The M\u0101ori people constitute one of the major cultures of Polynesia. The country has been broadened by globalisation and immigration specifically from Oceania, Europe, and Asia. New Zealand marks two national days of remembrance, Waitangi Day and ANZAC Day, and also celebrates many holidays such as the King's Birthday, Labour Day, and Christmas Day, as well as public anniversaries of the founding dates of most regions. The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States. Some artists release M\u0101ori language songs and the M\u0101ori tradition-based art of \"kapa haka\" (song and dance) has made a resurgence. The country's diverse scenery and compact size, plus government incentives, have encouraged some producers to film big budget movies in New Zealand, including \"Avatar\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\", \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", \"King Kong\" and \"The Last Samurai\".\nThe national cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, incorporating the native M\u0101ori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia and Asia. New Zealand yields produce from land and sea\u00a0\u2013 most crops and livestock, such as maize, potatoes and pigs, were gradually introduced by the early European settlers. Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb; salmon; koura (crayfish); whitebait; shellfish including dredge oysters, p\u0101ua, mussels, scallops, pipi and tuatua; kumara (sweet potato); kiwifruit; tamarillo; and pavlova (considered a national dish).\nSamoa.\nThe fa'a Samoa, or traditional Samoan way, remains a strong force in Samoan life and politics. Despite centuries of European influence, Samoa maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and language. Cultural customs such as the Samoa 'ava ceremony are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of \"matai\" chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven \"'ie toga\".\nThe Samoan word for dance is \"siva\", which consists of unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and which tell a story. Samoan male dances can be more snappy. The \"sasa\" is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid synchronised movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums \"(pate)\" or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the \"fa'ataupati\" or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. As with other Polynesian cultures (Hawaiian, Tahitian and M\u0101ori) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos.\nArts.\nThe artistic creations of native Oceanians varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions. The subject matter typically carries themes of fertility or the supernatural. Petroglyphs, tattooing, painting, wood carving, stone carving, and textile work are other common art forms. Art of Oceania properly encompasses the artistic traditions of the people indigenous to Australia and the Pacific Islands. These early peoples lacked a writing system, and made works on perishable materials, so few records of them exist from this time.\nIndigenous Australian rock art is the oldest and richest unbroken tradition of art in the world, dating as far back as 60,000 years and spread across hundreds of thousands of sites. These rock paintings served several functions. Some were used in magic, others to increase animal populations for hunting, while some were simply for amusement. Sculpture in Oceania first appears on New Guinea as a series of stone figures found throughout the island, but mostly in mountainous highlands. Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to c. 1500 BCE.\nBy 1500 BCE the Lapita culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. Beginning c. 1100 CE, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 moai (large stone statues). At c. 1200 CE, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building Nan Madol, a city of artificial islands and a system of canals. Hawaiian art includes wood carvings, feather work, petroglyphs, bark cloth (called kapa in Hawaiian and tapa elsewhere in the Pacific), and tattoos. Native Hawaiians had neither metal nor woven cloth.\nSport.\nRugby union is one of the region's most prominent sports, and is the national sport of New Zealand, Samoa, Fiji and Tonga. The most popular overall sport in Australia is cricket, with their national team having won the Cricket World Cup a record five times. The most popular sport among Australian women is netball, while Australian rules football garners the highest spectatorship numbers and television ratings. Rugby union is the most popular sport among New Zealanders, and they are tied with South Africa for the most Rugby World Cup titles, having won the tournament three times. Australia's team the Wallabies have won the World Cup twice, despite Rugby union being less popular among Australians. In Papua New Guinea, the most popular sport is Rugby league. Fiji's sevens team is one of the most successful in the world, as is New Zealand's.\nAustralian rules football is the national sport in Nauru. It has a large following in Papua New Guinea, where it is the second most popular sport after Rugby League. Additionally, it attracts significant attention across New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. The highest level of the sport is the Australian Football League (AFL), which was the fourth best attended sporting league in the world during the 2010s.\nVanuatu is the only country in Oceania to call association football its national sport. However, it is also the most popular sport in Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, and has a significant (and growing) popularity in Australia. In 2006 Australia left the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), and their men's team the Socceroos have qualified for every subsequent FIFA World Cup as an Asian entrant. The sole Micronesian country with membership in the OFC is Kiribati, although they are not recognised by FIFA like the other OFC members. Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru and Palau all have no presence, primarily due to lack of infrastructure and logistical difficulties related to Micronesia's remoteness. Like Australia, the Micronesian dependent territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands currently compete in the AFC instead of the OFC. The OFC was dominated by Australia for many years, and became known for one-sided results.\nAustralians view sport as an important part of their cultural identity, and the country performs well on the international stage, despite having a relatively small population. They have hosted two Summer Olympics: Melbourne 1956 and Sydney 2000, and the city of Brisbane is also set to host the 2032 edition. Australia has hosted five editions of the Commonwealth Games and New Zealand three times. The Pacific Games (formerly known as the South Pacific Games) is a multi-sport event, much like the Olympics on a much smaller scale, with participation exclusively from countries around the Pacific; Australia and New Zealand competed in the games for the first time in 2015.\nMelbourne hosts the Australian Open every year, considered one of the four Grand Slam tournaments in tennis.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "22623", "revid": "50706023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22623", "title": "Combined oral contraceptive pill", "text": "Birth control method taken orally\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth control pill or colloquially as \"the pill\", is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally by women. It is the oral form of combined hormonal contraception. The pill contains two important hormones: a progestin (a synthetic form of the hormone progestogen/progesterone) and estrogen (usually ethinylestradiol or 17\u03b2 estradiol). When taken correctly, it alters the menstrual cycle to eliminate ovulation and prevent pregnancy.\nCombined oral contraceptive pills were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and remain a very popular form of birth control. They are used by more than 100 million women worldwide including about 9 million women in the United States. From 2015 to 2017, 12.6% of women aged 15\u201349 in the US reported using combined oral contraceptive pills, making it the second most common method of contraception in this age range (female sterilization is the most common method). Use of combined oral contraceptive pills, however, varies widely by country, age, education, and marital status. For example, one third of women aged 16\u201349 in the United Kingdom use either the combined pill or progestogen-only pill (POP), compared with less than 3% of women in Japan (as of 1950\u20132014).\nCombined oral contraceptives are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The pill was a catalyst for the sexual revolution.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nOral contraceptives.\nHormonal oral contraceptives are preventive medications taken orally by females to avoid pregnancy by manipulating their sex hormones. The first oral contraceptive was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sold to the market in 1960. There are two types of hormonal oral contraceptives, namely Combined Oral Contraceptives and Progesterone Only Pills. Oral contraceptives, be it combined or progesterone-only, can effectively prevent pregnancy by regulating hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle, inhibiting ovulation, and altering cervical mucus to impede sperm mobility; combined pills have extra effects in menstrual cycle regulation and menstrual pain relief. Common off-label uses include menstrual suppression and acne relief, with Combined Oral Contraceptives having additional benefits in relieving menstrual migraine.\nVariants.\nProgesterone-only pills (POPs) utilise progestin, the synthetic form of progesterone, as the only active pharmaceutical ingredient in the formulation. In the US, drospirenone and norethindrone are the most commonly used compounds in formulations.\nCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) are commonly classified into generations, referring to their order of development in history. This discussion may also help identify some key features in a variety of products. According to EMA, the first generation of combined oral contraceptives, which made use of a high concentration of oestrogen only, were those invented in the 1960s. In the second generation of products, progestogens were introduced into the formulation while the concentration of oestrogen was reduced. Starting from the 1990s, the progression in the development of combined oral contraceptives has been directed towards varying the type of progestogen incorporated. These products are referred as the third and fourth generation.\nOestrogen ingredients: estradiol, ethinylestradiol, estetrol.\n1st generation progestin: norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, lynestrenol, norethynodrel.\n2nd generation progestin: levonorgestrel, dl-norgestrel.\n3rd generation progestin: norgestimate, gestodene, desogestrel.\nThe menstrual cycle.\nHormonal oral contraceptives (HOCs) interact with hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle in females to prevent ovulation, and hence achieve contraception. In a 28-day menstrual cycle, there are the proliferative phase, ovulation, and then the secretory phase.\nMenstruation marks the beginning of proliferative phase in day 1-14. In this period, the pituitary gland located near the brain secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) into the bloodstream to signal the development of follicle in ovary in the female reproductive system. While follicle serves as the chamber of ovum development, it secretes Oestrogen, a hormone that not only triggers the thickening of uterine lining in preparation for implantation, but also inhibits the secretion of FSH in pituitary via a negative feedback mechanism.\nSpecifically in ovulation, transient positive feedback by Oestrogen on FSH and Luteinising Hormone (LH) secretion from pituitary is permitted so that the release of mature ovum from follicle is triggered.\nIn secretory phase on day 14-28, this follicle then transforms into corpus luteum and continues releasing Oestrogen with Progesterone into bloodstream. While Oestrogen and Progesterone primarily aid the maintenance of thickness in uterine lining, the negative feedback in pituitary allows them to inhibit FSH and LH secretion. In the absence of LH, corpus luteum degenerates and ultimately causes blood Oestrogen and Progesterone levels to decline. Without these thickness maintaining agents, uterine lining breaks down and hence the presentation of menstruation.\nMechanism of action.\nProgesterone and Oestrogen, either in combination or with Progesterone-only, are the active pharmaceutical ingredients found in a hormonal oral contraceptive formulation. These medications are orally administered for systemic absorption to exert their effects. An artificially enhanced level of Progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle inhibits the pituitary secretion of FSH and LH such that their actions in stimulating follicular development and ovulation are prevented. Similarly, a boosted Oestrogen level activates the negative feedback mechanism in reducing FSH secretion from pituitary and therefore prevents follicular development. In the absence of a developed follicle, ovulation cannot occur so that fertilisation is made impossible and contraception is achieved. In comparison, Progesterone is more efficacious than Oestrogen not only because of its additional action in impeding LH, but also its ability to modulate the cervical mucus into sperm-repellent.\nCombined oral contraceptive pills were developed to prevent ovulation by suppressing the release of gonadotropins. Combined hormonal contraceptives, including combined oral contraceptive pills, inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.\nUnder normal circumstances, luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates the theca cells of the ovarian follicle to produce androstenedione. The granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle then convert this androstenedione to estradiol. This conversion process is catalyzed by aromatase, an enzyme produced as a result of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation. In individuals using oral contraceptives, progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the secretion of FSH and greatly decreases the secretion of LH by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen positive feedback on LH secretion prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of an LH surge prevent ovulation.\nEstrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the secretion of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.\nAnother primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of sperm penetration through the cervix into the upper genital tract (uterus and fallopian tubes) by decreasing the water content and increasing the viscosity of the cervical mucus.\nThe estrogen and progestogen in combined oral contraceptive pills have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:\nInsufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined oral contraceptive pill use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills.\nFormulations.\nOral contraceptives come in a variety of formulations, some containing both estrogen and progestins, and some only containing progestin. Doses of component hormones also vary among products, and some pills are monophasic (delivering the same dose of hormones each day) while others are multiphasic (doses vary each day). combined oral contraceptive pills can also be divided into two groups, those with progestins that possess androgen activity (norethisterone acetate, etynodiol diacetate, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestimate, desogestrel, gestodene) or antiandrogen activity (cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, drospirenone, dienogest, nomegestrol acetate).\nCombined oral contraceptive pills have been somewhat inconsistently grouped into \"generations\" in the medical literature based on when they were introduced.\nMedical use.\nContraceptive use.\nCombined oral contraceptive pills are a type of oral medication that were originally designed to be taken every day at the same time of day in order to prevent pregnancy. There are many different formulations or brands, but the average pack is designed to be taken over a 28-day period (also known as a cycle). For the first 21 days of the cycle, users take a daily pill that contains two hormones, estrogen and progestogen. During the last 7 days of the cycle, users take daily placebo (biologically inactive) pills and these days are considered hormone-free days. Although these are hormone-free days, users are still protected from pregnancy during this time.\nSome combined oral contraceptive pill packs only contain 21 pills and users are advised to take no pills for the last 7 days of the cycle. Other combined oral contraceptive pill formulations contain 91 pills, consisting of 84 days of active hormones followed by 7 days of placebo (Seasonale). Combined oral contraceptive pill formulations can contain 24 days of active hormone pills followed by 4 days of placebo pills (e.g. Yaz 28 and Loestrin 24 Fe) as a means to decrease the severity of placebo effects. These combined oral contraceptive pills containing active hormones and a placebo/hormone-free period are called cyclic combined oral contraceptive pills. Once a pack of cyclical combined oral contraceptive pill treatment is completed, users start a new pack and new cycle.\nMost monophasic combined oral contraceptive pills can be used continuously such that patients can skip placebo days and continuously take hormone active pills from a combined oral contraceptive pill pack. One of the most common reasons users do this is to avoid or diminish withdrawal bleeding. The majority of women on cyclic combined oral contraceptive pills have regularly scheduled withdrawal bleeding, which is vaginal bleeding mimicking users' menstrual cycles with the exception of lighter menstrual bleeding compared to bleeding patterns prior to combined oral contraceptive pill commencement. As such, a study reported that out of 1003 women taking combined oral contraceptive pills approximately 90% reported regularly scheduled withdrawal bleeds over a 90-day standard reference period. Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs during the placebo, hormone-free days. Therefore, avoiding placebo days can diminish withdrawal bleeding among other placebo effects.\nRegimen.\nThis section demonstrates the overall rationalisation of dosing route and intervals of hormonal oral contraceptives, please seek advice and follow instructions from healthcare professionals in administering specific hormonal oral contraceptives. Considering the menstrual cycle as a 28-day cycle, hormonal oral contraceptives are available in packages of 21, 28, or 91 tablets.\u00a0 These pills have typically undergone unit dose optimisation so that they follow the administration pattern of once daily, every day or almost every day on a regular basis. Since they are formulated into daily doses, it is recommended that the medication should be taken at the same time every day to maximise efficacy.\nFor 21-tablet packs, the general instruction is to take one tablet daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day blank interval without taking hormonal oral contraceptives before initiating another 21-tablet pack. For 28-tablet packs, the 1st tablet from a new pack should be taken on the next day when the 28th tablet from an old pack was finished. While the 7-day blank period does not apply to 28-tablet packs, they will likely include tablets in distinctive colours indicating that they have an alternate amount of active ingredients, otherwise inactive ingredient or folate supplement only. The instruction for 91-tablet pack follows that of 28-tablet packs with some colour-distinguishable tablets which contain different amounts of medicine or supplement.\nTo acquire immediate contraceptive effects, the initiation of hormonal oral contraceptive dosing is recommended within the 1st-5th day from menstruation in order to discard other means of contraception. Specific to Progesterone only pills, even if dosing is initiated within five days, backup contraception is suggested in the first 48 hours since the first pill. In the case of dosing initiated after the 5th day from menstruation, effects usually take place after seven days and other contraceptive methods should remain in place until then.\nEffectiveness.\nIf used exactly as instructed, the estimated risk of getting pregnant is 0.3% which means that about 3 in 1000 women on combined oral contraceptive pills will become pregnant within one year. However, typical use of combined oral contraceptive pills by users often consists of timing errors, forgotten pills, or unwanted side effects. With typical use, the estimated risk of getting pregnant is about 9% which means that about 9 in 100 women on combined oral contraceptive pills will become pregnant in one year. The perfect use failure rate is based on a review of pregnancy rates in clinical trials, and the typical use failure rate is based on a weighted average of estimates from the 1995 and 2002 US National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG), corrected for underreporting of abortions.\nSeveral factors account for typical use effectiveness being lower than perfect use effectiveness:\nFor instance, someone using combined oral contraceptive pills might have received incorrect information by a health care provider about medication frequency, forgotten to take the pill one day or not gone to the pharmacy in time to renew a combined oral contraceptive pill prescription.\nCombined oral contraceptive pills provide effective contraception from the very first pill if started within five days of the beginning of the menstrual cycle (within five days of the first day of menstruation). If started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, combined oral contraceptive pills provide effective contraception only after 7 consecutive days of use of active pills, so a backup method of contraception (e.g. condoms) must be used in the interim.\nThe effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills appears to be similar whether the active pills are taken continuously or if they are taken cyclically. Contraceptive efficacy, however, could be impaired by numerous means. Factors that may contribute to a decrease in effectiveness:\nIn any of these instances, a backup contraceptive method should be used until hormone active pills have been consistently taken for 7 consecutive days or drug-drug interactions or underlying illnesses have been discontinued or resolved. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, a pill is considered \"late\" if a user takes the pill after the user's normal medication time, but no longer than 24 hours after this normal time. If 24 hours or more have passed since the time the user was supposed to take the pill, then the pill is considered \"missed\". CDC guidelines discuss potential next steps for users who missed their pill or took it late.\nRole of placebo pills.\nThe role of the placebo pills is two-fold: to allow the user to continue the routine of taking a pill every day and to simulate the average menstrual cycle. By continuing to take a pill every day, users remain in the daily habit even during the week without hormones. Failure to take pills during the placebo week does not impact the effectiveness of the pill, provided that daily ingestion of active pills is resumed at the end of the week.\nThe placebo, or hormone-free, week in the 28-day pill package simulates an average menstrual cycle, though the hormonal events during a pill cycle are significantly different from those of a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. Because the pill suppresses ovulation (to be discussed more in the Mechanism of action section), birth control users do not have true menstrual periods. Instead, it is the lack of hormones for a week that causes a withdrawal bleed. The withdrawal bleeding that occurs during the break from active pills has been thought to be reassuring, a physical confirmation of not being pregnant. The withdrawal bleeding is also predictable. Unexpected breakthrough bleeding can be a possible side effect of longer term active regimens.\nSince it is not uncommon for menstruating women to become anemic, some placebo pills may contain an iron supplement. This replenishes iron stores that may become depleted during menstruation. As well, birth control pills, such as combined oral contraceptive pills, are sometimes fortified with folic acid as it is recommended to take folic acid supplementation in the months prior to pregnancy to decrease the likelihood of neural tube defect in infants.\nNo or less frequent placebos.\nIf the pill formulation is monophasic, meaning each hormonal pill contains a fixed dose of hormones, it is possible to skip withdrawal bleeding and still remain protected against conception by skipping the placebo pills altogether and starting directly with the next packet. Attempting this with bi- or tri-phasic pill formulations carries an increased risk of breakthrough bleeding and may be undesirable. It will not, however, increase the risk of getting pregnant.\nStarting in 2003, women have also been able to use a three-month version of the pill. Similar to the effect of using a constant-dosage formulation and skipping the placebo weeks for three months, Seasonale gives the benefit of less frequent periods, at the potential drawback of breakthrough bleeding. Seasonique is another version in which the placebo week every three months is replaced with a week of low-dose estrogen.\nA version of the combined pill has also been packaged to eliminate placebo pills and withdrawal bleeds. Marketed as Anya or Lybrel, studies have shown that after seven months, 71% of users no longer had any breakthrough bleeding, the most common side effect of going longer periods of time without breaks from active pills.\nWhile more research needs to be done to assess the long term safety of using combined oral contraceptive pills continuously, studies have shown there may be no difference in short term adverse effects when comparing continuous use versus cyclic use of birth control pills.\nNon-contraceptive use.\nThe hormones in the pill have also been used to treat other medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, adenomyosis, acne, hirsutism, amenorrhea, menstrual cramps, menstrual migraines, menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), menstruation-related or fibroid-related anemia and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation). Besides acne, no oral contraceptives have been approved by the US FDA for the previously mentioned uses despite extensive use for these conditions.\nPCOS.\nThe cause of PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome, is multifactorial and not well-understood. Women with PCOS often have higher than normal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and androgens that impact the normal function of the ovaries. While multiple small follicles develop in the ovary, none are able to grow in size enough to become the dominant follicle and trigger ovulation. This leads to an imbalance of LH, follicle stimulating hormone, estrogen, and progesterone. Without ovulation, unopposed estrogen can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, or overgrowth of tissue in the uterus. This endometrial overgrowth is more likely to become cancerous than normal endometrial tissue. Thus, although the data varies, it is generally agreed upon by most gynecological societies that due to the unopposed estrogen, women with PCOS are at higher risk for endometrial cancer.\nTo reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, it is often recommended that women with PCOS who do not desire pregnancy take hormonal contraceptives to prevent the effects of unopposed estrogen. Both combined oral contraceptive pills and progestin-only methods are recommended. It is the progestin component of combined oral contraceptive pills that protects the endometrium from hyperplasia, and thus reduces a woman with PCOS's endometrial cancer risk. Combined oral contraceptive pills are preferred to progestin-only methods in women who also have uncontrolled acne, symptoms of hirsutism, and androgenic alopecia, because combined oral contraceptive pills can help treat these symptoms.\nAcne and hirsutism.\nCombined oral contraceptive pills are sometimes prescribed to treat symptoms of androgenization, including acne and hirsutism. The estrogen component of combined oral contraceptive pills appears to suppress androgen production in the ovaries. Estrogen also leads to increased synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin, which causes a decrease in the levels of free testosterone.\nUltimately, the drop in the level of free androgens leads to a decrease in the production of sebum, which is a major contributor to development of acne. Four different oral contraceptives have been approved by the US FDA to treat moderate acne if the patient is at least 14 or 15 years old, has already begun menstruating, and needs contraception. These include Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Estrostep, Beyaz, and YAZ.\nHirsutism is the growth of coarse, dark hair where women typically grow only fine hair or no hair at all. This hair growth on the face, chest, and abdomen is also mediated by higher levels or action of androgens. Therefore, combined oral contraceptive pills also work to treat these symptoms by lowering the levels of free circulating androgens.\nStudies have shown that combined oral contraceptives are effective in reducing both inflammatory and non-inflammatory facial acne lesions. However, comparisons between different combined oral contraceptives have not been studied to understand if any brand is superior than the others. Oestrogen decreases sebum production by shrinking the sebaceous gland, increasing Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production to reduce unbound testosterone, and regulating LH and FSH levels. Studies have not shown that POPs are effective against acne lesions.\nEndometriosis.\nFor pelvic pain associated with endometriosis, combined oral contraceptive pills are considered a first-line medical treatment, along with NSAIDs, GnRH agonists, and aromatase inhibitors. Combined oral contraceptive pills work to suppress the growth of the extra-uterine endometrial tissue. This works to lessen its inflammatory effects. Combined oral contraceptive pills, along with the other medical treatments listed above, do not eliminate the extra-uterine tissue growth, they just reduce the symptoms. Surgery is the only definitive treatment. Studies looking at rates of pelvic pain recurrence after surgery have shown that continuous use of combined oral contraceptive pills is more effective at reducing the recurrence of pain than cyclic use.\nAdenomyosis.\nSimilar to endometriosis, adenomyosis is often treated with combined oral contraceptive pills to suppress the growth the endometrial tissue that has grown into the myometrium. Unlike endometriosis however, levonorgestrel containing IUDs are more effective at reducing pelvic pain in adenomyosis than combined oral contraceptive pills.\nMenorrhagia.\nIn the average menstrual cycle, a woman typically loses 35 to 40 milliliters of blood. However, up to 20% of women experience much heavier bleeding, or menorrhagia. This excess blood loss can lead to anemia, with symptoms of fatigue and weakness, as well as disruption in their normal life activities. Combined oral contraceptive pills contain progestin, which causes the lining of the uterus to be thinner, resulting in lighter bleeding episodes for those with heavy menstrual bleeding.\nAmenorrhea.\nAlthough the pill is sometimes prescribed to induce menstruation on a regular schedule for women bothered by irregular menstrual cycles, it actually suppresses the normal menstrual cycle and then mimics a regular 28-day monthly cycle.\nWomen who are experiencing menstrual dysfunction due to female athlete triad are sometimes prescribed oral contraceptives as pills that can create menstrual bleeding cycles. However, the condition's underlying cause is energy deficiency and should be treated by correcting the imbalance between calories eaten and calories burned by exercise. Oral contraceptives should not be used as an initial treatment for female athlete triad.\nMenstrual suppression.\nMenstrual bleeding is not necessary in women who do not wish to conceive, therefore menstrual suppression may be implemented in women who do not want to have menstrual bleeding for convenience, gynecologic disorders, bleeding disorders or other medical conditions.\nIn the two types of hormonal oral contraceptives, only combined oral contraceptives can achieve amenorrhea, while POPs can only reduce the amount of blood. The method of using combined oral contraceptives for menstrual suppression is to skip the 7 placebo pills and continue taking active pills after the 21 active pills. This can be used in extended method or continuous method. For extended method, patients who take active pills for 3, 4, or 6 months and then take placebo pills for a period of time will more likely experience withdrawal bleeding. The interval can be decided by the patients according to their own preferences. For continuous method, people can take combined oral contraceptives for a year continuously without any placebo pills. In the first few months of extended or continuous use of combined oral contraceptives, unscheduled bleeding or spotting may occur. However, the bleeding or spotting is expected to resolve after a few months of use.\nMenstrual suppression is commonly used for convenience especially when women go on vacation. It is also used for gynecologic disorders such as dysmenorrhea (commonly known as menstrual pain), symptoms related to premenstrual hormone change and excessive bleeding related to uterine fibroids. Patients can also benefit from menstrual suppression for bleeding disorders or chronic anemia.\nMenstrual migraine.\nPatients with menstrual Oestrogen-related migraine, but without aura and additional risk factors to stroke, can be benefited from combined oral contraceptives. However, older women and those with a strong family history of problematic headaches may find that using hormonal oral contraceptives worsens their headache.\nBenefits.\nThe distinctive feature of hormonal oral contraceptives when compared to other contraceptive methods is that they are less invasive and do not interfere with sex. Conclusive data suggest that the failure rate of contraception in using hormonal oral contraceptives for the first year is 9% in typical use which allows missed doses, and &lt;1% in perfect use. The efficacy of hormonal oral contraceptives in preventing pregnancy is high overall. Furthermore, the regular use of hormonal oral contraceptive tends to not only ease premenstrual syndrome, but also allow lighter and less painful menstruation. In addition, the association between a suppressed risk of developing ovarian cancer and hormonal oral contraceptive use is proven.\nContraindications.\nWhile combined oral contraceptives are generally considered to be a relatively safe medication, they are contraindicated for those with certain medical conditions. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publish guidance, called medical eligibility criteria, on the safety of birth control in the context of medical conditions.\nIn terms of protection in sexual intercourse, a sole reliance on hormonal oral contraceptives does not defend one from sexually transmitted infections such as HPV. Additionally, breakthrough bleeding and spotting are exceptionally prevalent in the early stage of using hormonal oral contraceptives. Although most reported side effects including nausea, headache, or mood swings will disappear as the therapy progresses or upon switching formulation, elevated blood pressure or blood clots in patients with cardiovascular conditions are documented side effects that requires medical attention if not termination of hormonal oral contraceptives. It is because combined oral contraceptives uses have been found to be related to an increased risk of ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction, especially in combined oral contraceptives with &gt;50 \u03bcg Oestrogen.\nBesides, some ongoing studies giving evidence on the association between hormonal oral contraceptive use and escalated breast cancer risks cannot be neglected.\nAccording to WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 2015, Category 3 implies that the use of such contraception is usually not recommended, unless other more appropriate methods are neither available nor acceptable and with good resources of clinical judgment; Category 4 implies that the contraceptive method should not be used even with good resources of clinical judgment. Both categories suggest that the contraceptive method should not be used with limited resources for clinical judgment. The tables below summarise conditions of category 3 and 4 from World Health Organization Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 2015.\nHypercoagulability.\nEstrogen in high doses can increase risk of blood clots. All combined oral contraceptive pill users have a small increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism compared with non-users; this risk is greatest within the first year of combined oral contraceptive pill use. Individuals with any pre-existing medical condition that also increases their risk for blood clots have a more significant increase in risk of thrombotic events with combined oral contraceptive pill use. These conditions include but are not limited to high blood pressure, pre-existing cardiovascular disease (such as valvular heart disease or ischemic heart disease), history of thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, and a familial tendency to form blood clots (such as familial factor V Leiden). There are conditions that, when associated with combined oral contraceptive pill use, increase risk of adverse effects other than thrombosis. For example, women with a history of migraine with aura have an increased risk of stroke when using combined oral contraceptive pills, and women who smoke over age 35 and use combined oral contraceptive pills are at higher risk of myocardial infarction.\nPregnancy and postpartum.\nWomen who are known to be pregnant should not take combined oral contraceptive pills. Those in the postpartum period who are breastfeeding are also advised not to start combined oral contraceptive pills until 4 weeks after birth due to increased risk of blood clots. While studies have demonstrated conflicting results about the effects of combined oral contraceptive pills on lactation duration and milk volume, there exist concerns about the transient risk of combined oral contraceptive pills on breast milk production when breastfeeding is being established early postpartum. Due to the stated risks and additional concerns on lactation, women who are breastfeeding are not advised to start combined oral contraceptive pills until at least six weeks postpartum, while women who are not breastfeeding and have no other risks factors for blood clots may start combined oral contraceptive pills after 21 days postpartum.\nBreast cancer.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend the use of combined oral contraceptive pills in women with breast cancer. Since combined oral contraceptive pills contain both estrogen and progestin, they are not recommended to be used in those with hormonally-sensitive cancers, including some types of breast cancer. Non-hormonal contraceptive methods, such as the Copper IUD or condoms, should be the first-line contraceptive choice for these patients instead of combined oral contraceptive pills.\nOther.\nWomen with known or suspected endometrial cancer or unexplained uterine bleeding should also not take combined oral contraceptive pills to avoid health risks. Combined oral contraceptive pills are also contraindicated for people with advanced diabetes, liver tumors, hepatic adenoma or severe cirrhosis of the liver. Combined oral contraceptive pills are metabolized in the liver and thus liver disease can lead to reduced elimination of the medication. Additionally, severe hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia are also contraindications, but the evidence showing that combined oral contraceptive pills lead to worse outcomes in this population is weak. Obesity is not considered to be a contraindication to taking combined oral contraceptive pills.\nSide effects.\nIt is generally accepted that the health risks of oral contraceptives are lower than those from pregnancy and birth, and \"the health benefits of any method of contraception are far greater than any risks from the method\". Some organizations have argued that comparing a contraceptive method to no method (pregnancy) is not relevant\u2014instead, the comparison of safety should be among available methods of contraception.\nCommon.\nDifferent sources note different incidence of side effects. The most common side effect is breakthrough bleeding. Combined oral contraceptive pills can improve conditions such as dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, and acne, reduce symptoms of endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, and decrease the risk of anemia. Use of oral contraceptives also reduces lifetime risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer.\nNausea, vomiting, headache, bloating, breast tenderness, swelling of the ankles/feet (fluid retention), or weight change may occur. Vaginal bleeding between periods (spotting) or missed/irregular periods may occur, especially during the first few months of use.\nHeart and blood vessels.\nCombined oral contraceptives are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).\nWhile lower doses of estrogen in combined oral contraceptive pills may have a lower risk of stroke and myocardial infarction compared to higher estrogen dose pills (50 \u03bcg/day), users of low estrogen dose combined oral contraceptive pills still have an increased risk compared to non-users. These risks are greatest in women with additional risk factors, such as smoking (which increases risk substantially) and long-continued use of the pill, especially in women over 35 years of age.\nThe overall absolute risk of venous thrombosis per 100,000 woman-years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared with 30 in non-users. The risk of thromboembolism varies with different types of birth control pills; compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with norethisterone is 0.98, with norgestimate 1.19, with desogestrel (DSG) 1.82, with gestodene 1.86, with drospirenone (DRSP) 1.64, and with cyproterone acetate 1.88. In comparison, venous thromboembolism occurs in 100\u2013200 per 100.000 pregnant women every year.\nOne study showed more than a 600% increased risk of blood clots for women taking combined oral contraceptive pills with drospirenone compared with non-users, compared with 360% higher for women taking birth control pills containing levonorgestrel. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated studies evaluating the health of more than 800,000 women taking combined oral contraceptive pills and found that the risk of VTE was 93% higher for women who had been taking drospirenone combined oral contraceptive pills for 3 months or less and 290% higher for women taking drospirenone combined oral contraceptive pills for 7\u201312 months, compared with women taking other types of oral contraceptives.\nBased on these studies, in 2012, the FDA updated the label for drospirenone combined oral contraceptive pills to include a warning that contraceptives with drospirenone may have a higher risk of dangerous blood clots.\nA 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found that combined birth control pills were associated with 7.6-fold higher risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare form of stroke in which blood clotting occurs in the cerebral venous sinuses.\nCancer.\nDecreased risk of ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancers.\nUsage of combined oral contraception decreased the risk of ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and colorectal cancer. Two large cohort studies published in 2010 both found a significant reduction in adjusted relative risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer mortality in ever-users of OCs compared with never-users. The use of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) for five years or more decreases the risk of ovarian cancer in later life by 50%. Combined oral contraceptive use reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 40% and the risk of endometrial cancer by 50% compared with never users. The risk reduction increases with duration of use, with an 80% reduction in risk for both ovarian and endometrial cancer with use for more than 10 years. The risk reduction for both ovarian and endometrial cancer persists for at least 20 years.\nIncreased risk of Breast, cervical, and liver cancers.\nCombined oral contraception is a IARC group 1 Carcinogen meaning there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans.\nAn association between use of birth control pills and liver cancer has been suspected, but subsequent large population research has failed to confirm such an association. \nIncreased risk of breast cancer was reported in women who take combined oral contraception. The relative risk of breast cancer in the current combined oral contraception users was 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15\u20131.33), and this increased risk disappeared 10 years after discontinuation. There was also a higher risk of premature deaths due to breast cancer in the population who used COCP (\"P\" &lt; 0.0001) for longer duration. 24 observational studies showed a higher risk of cervical cancer in women who use COCP, especially with an increased duration of COCP use.\nA 2013 meta-analysis concluded that every use of birth control pills is associated with a modest increase in the risk of breast cancer (relative risk 1.08) and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (relative risk 0.86) and endometrial cancer (relative risk 0.57). Cervical cancer risk in those infected with HPV is increased. A similar small increase in breast cancer risk was observed in other meta analyses. A study of 1.8 million Danish women of reproductive age followed for 11 years found that the risk of breast cancer was 20% higher among those who currently or recently used hormonal contraceptives than among women who had never used hormonal contraceptives. This risk increased with duration of use, with a 38% increase in risk after more than 10 years of use.\nWeight.\nA 2016 systematic review found low quality evidence that studies of combination hormonal contraceptives showed no large difference in weight when compared with placebo or no intervention groups. The evidence was not strong enough to be certain that contraceptive methods do not cause some weight change, but no major effect was found. This review also found \"that women did not stop using the pill or patch because of weight change\".\nSexual function and risk aversion.\nSexual desire.\nSome researchers question a causal link between combined oral contraceptive pill use and decreased libido; a 2007 study of 1700 women found combined oral contraceptive pill users experienced no change in sexual satisfaction. A 2005 laboratory study of genital arousal tested fourteen women before and after they began taking combined oral contraceptive pills. The study found that women experienced a significantly wider range of arousal responses after beginning pill use; decreases and increases in measures of arousal were equally common.\nIn 2012, \"The Journal of Sexual Medicine\" published a review of research studying the effects of hormonal contraceptives on female sexual function that concluded that the sexual side effects of hormonal contraceptives are not well-studied and especially in regards to impacts on libido, with research establishing only mixed effects where only small percentages of women report experiencing an increase or decrease and majorities report being unaffected. In 2013, \"The European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care\" published a review of 36 studies including 8,422 female subjects in total taking combined oral contraceptive pills that found that 5,358 subjects (or 63.6 percent) reported no change in libido, 1,826 subjects (or 21.7 percent) reported an increase, and 1,238 subjects (or 14.7 percent) reported a decrease. In 2019, \"Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews\" published a meta-analysis of 22 published and 4 unpublished studies (with 7,529 female subjects in total) that evaluated whether women expose themselves to greater health risks at different points in the menstrual cycle including by sexual activity with partners and found that subjects in the last third of the follicular phase and at ovulation (when levels of endogenous estradiol and luteinizing hormones are heightened) experienced increased sexual activity with partners as compared with the luteal phase and during menstruation.\nA 2006 study of 124 premenopausal women measured sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), including before and after discontinuation of the oral contraceptive pill. Women continuing use of oral contraceptives had SHBG levels four times higher than those who never used it, and levels remained elevated even in the group that had discontinued its use. Theoretically, an increase in SHBG may be a physiologic response to increased hormone levels, but may decrease the free levels of other hormones, such as androgens, because of the unspecificity of its sex hormone binding. In 2020, \"The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology\" published a cross-sectional study of 588 premenopausal female subjects aged 18 to 39 years from the Australian states of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria with regular menstrual cycles whose SHBG levels were measured by immunoassay that found that after controlling for age, body mass index, cycle stage, smoking, parity, partner status, and psychoactive medication, SHBG was inversely correlated with sexual desire.\nSexual attractiveness and function.\nCombined oral contraceptive pills may increase natural vaginal lubrication, while some women experience decreased lubrication.\nIn 2004, the \"\" published a study where pairs of digital photographs of the faces of 48 women at Newcastle University and Charles University between the ages 19 and 33 who were not taking hormonal contraceptives during the study were photographed in the late follicular and early mid-luteal phases of their menstrual cycles and the photographs were then rated by 261 blinded subjects (130 male and 131 female) at their respective universities who compared the facial attractiveness of each photographed woman in their photograph pairs, and found that the subjects perceived the late follicular phase images of the photographed women as being more attractive than the luteal phase images by more than expected by random chance.\nIn 2007, \"Evolution and Human Behavior\" published a study where 18 professional lap dancers recorded their menstrual cycles, work shifts, and tip earnings at gentlemen's clubs for 60 days that found by a mixed model analysis of 296 work shifts (or approximately 5,300 lap dances) that the 11 dancers with normal menstrual cycles earned US$335 per 5-hour shift during the late follicular phase and at ovulation, US$260 per shift during the luteal phase, and US$185 per shift during menstruation, while the 7 dancers using hormonal contraceptives showed no earnings peak during the late follicular phase and at ovulation. In 2008, \"Evolution and Human Behavior\" published a study where the voices of 51 female students at the State University of New York at Albany were recorded with the women counting from 1 to 10 at four different points in their menstrual cycles were rated by blinded subjects who listened to the recordings to be more attractive at the points of the menstrual cycle with higher probabilities of conception, while the ratings of the voices of the women who were taking hormonal contraceptives showed no variation over the menstrual cycle in attractiveness.\nRisk-taking behaviour.\nIn 1998, \"Evolution and Human Behavior\" published a study of 300 female undergraduate students at the State University of New York at Albany between the ages of 18 and 54 (with a mean age of 21.9 years) that surveyed the subjects engagement in 18 different behaviors over the 24 hours prior to filling out the study's questionnaire that varied in their risk of potential rape or sexual assault and the first day of their last menstruations, and found that subjects at ovulation showed statistically significant decreased engagement in behaviors that risked rape and sexual assault while subjects taking birth control pills showed no variation over their menstrual cycles in the same behaviors (suggesting a psychologically adaptive function of the hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle in causing avoidance of behaviors that risk rape and sexual assault). In 2003, \"Evolution and Human Behavior\" published a conceptual replication study of the 1998 survey that confirmed its findings.\nIn 2006, a study presented at the annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society surveyed 176 female undergraduate students at Michigan State University (with a mean age of 19.9 years) in a decision-making experiment where the subjects chose between an option with a guaranteed outcome or an option involving risk and indicated the first day of their last menstruations, and found that the subjects risk aversion preferences varied over the menstrual cycle (with none of the subjects at ovulation preferring the risky option) and only subjects not taking hormonal contraceptives showed the menstrual cycle effect on risk aversion. In the 2019 \"Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews\" meta-analysis, the research reviewed also evaluated whether the 7,529 female subjects across the 26 studies showed greater risk recognition and avoidance of potentially threatening people and dangerous situations at different phases of the menstrual cycle and found that the subjects displayed better risk accuracy recognition during the late follicular phase and at ovulation as compared to the luteal phase.\nDepression.\nLow levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain, have been linked to depression. High levels of estrogen, as in first-generation combined oral contraceptive pills, and progestin, as in some progestin-only contraceptives, have been shown to lower the brain serotonin levels by increasing the concentration of a brain enzyme that reduces serotonin.\nCurrent medical reference textbooks on contraception and major organizations such as the American ACOG, the WHO, and the United Kingdom's RCOG agree that current evidence indicates low-dose combined oral contraceptives are unlikely to increase the risk of depression, and unlikely to worsen the condition in women that are depressed.\nHypertension.\nBradykinin lowers blood pressure by causing blood vessel dilation. Certain enzymes are capable of breaking down bradykinin (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Aminopeptidase P). Progesterone can increase the levels of Aminopeptidase P (AP-P), thereby increasing the breakdown of bradykinin, which increases the risk of developing hypertension.\nThyroid.\nEstrogen in oral contraceptives may increase thyroid binding globulin and decrease free T4. Thus, longer history of oral contraceptives use may be strongly associated with hypothyroidism, especially for more than 10 years. Also, a higher dose of thyroxine may be needed with oral contraceptives.\nOther effects.\nOther side effects associated with low-dose combined oral contraceptive pills are leukorrhea (increased vaginal secretions), reductions in menstrual flow, mastalgia (breast tenderness), and decrease in acne. Side effects associated with older high-dose combined oral contraceptive pills include nausea, vomiting, increases in blood pressure, and melasma (facial skin discoloration); these effects are not strongly associated with low-dose formulations.\nExcess estrogen, such as from birth control pills, appears to increase cholesterol levels in bile and decrease gallbladder movement, which can lead to gallstones. Progestins found in certain formulations of oral contraceptive pills can limit the effectiveness of weight training to increase muscle mass. This effect is caused by the ability of some progestins to inhibit androgen receptors. One study claims that the pill may affect what male body odors a woman prefers, which may in turn influence her selection of partner. Use of combined oral contraceptives is associated with a reduced risk of endometriosis, giving a relative risk of endometriosis of 0.63 during active use, yet with limited quality of evidence according to a systematic review.\nCombined oral contraception decreases total testosterone levels by approximately 0.5 nmol/L, free testosterone by approximately 60%, and increases the amount of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by approximately 100 nmol/L. Contraceptives containing second generation progestins and/or estrogen doses of around 20 \u201325\u00a0mg EE were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations. Combined oral contraception may also reduce bone density.\nDrug interactions.\nSome drugs reduce the effect of the pill and can cause breakthrough bleeding, or increased chance of pregnancy. These include drugs such as rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin and carbamazepine. In addition cautions are given about broad spectrum antibiotics, such as ampicillin and doxycycline, which may cause problems \"by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel\" (BNF 2003).\nThe traditional medicinal herb St John's Wort has also been implicated due to its upregulation of the P450 system in the liver which could increase the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and progestin components of some combined oral contraception.\nAccessibility.\nThe availability of pharmaceutical products to the public is determined by the local governing body. In the US, the responsible organisation is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to a press announcement in July 2023, a daily hormonal oral contraceptive was first made accessible to the public without a prescription. Although this drug class was approved for prescription use as early as in 1973, it took an additional 50 years to de-escalate its legal status. Such allowance is made plausible thanks to the demonstration of its safe and effective use by the general public, not needing any guidance from healthcare professionals. Ultimately, the governing body should act accordingly to applicants' evidence and update the local legislation.\nHistory.\nBy the 1930s, scientists had isolated and determined the structure of the steroid hormones and found that high doses of androgens, estrogens or progesterone inhibited ovulation,\nbut obtaining these hormones, which were produced from animal extracts, from European pharmaceutical companies was extraordinarily expensive.\nIn 1939, Russell Marker, a professor of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (\"Dioscorea mexicana\" and \"Dioscorea composita\") found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and the period of the heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.\nMidway through the 20th century, the stage was set for the development of a hormonal contraceptive, but pharmaceutical companies, universities and governments showed no interest in pursuing research.\nProgesterone to prevent ovulation.\nProgesterone, given by injections, was first shown to inhibit ovulation in animals in 1937 by Makepeace and colleagues.\nIn 1951, reproductive physiologist Gregory Pincus, a leader in hormone research and co-founder of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology (WFEB) in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, first met American birth control movement founder Margaret Sanger at a Manhattan dinner hosted by Abraham Stone, medical director and vice president of Planned Parenthood (PPFA), who helped Pincus obtain a small grant from PPFA to begin hormonal contraceptive research. Research started in April 1951, with reproductive physiologist Min Chueh Chang repeating and extending the 1937 experiments of Makepeace et al. that was published in 1953 and showed that injections of progesterone suppressed ovulation in rabbits. In October 1951, G. D. Searle &amp; Company refused Pincus' request to fund his hormonal contraceptive research, but retained him as a consultant and continued to provide chemical compounds to evaluate.\nIn March 1952, Sanger wrote a brief note mentioning Pincus' research to her longtime friend and supporter, suffragist and philanthropist Katharine Dexter McCormick, who visited the WFEB and its co-founder and old friend Hudson Hoagland in June 1952 to learn about contraceptive research there. Frustrated when research stalled from PPFA's lack of interest and meager funding, McCormick arranged a meeting at the WFEB in June 1953, with Sanger and Hoagland, where she first met Pincus who committed to dramatically expand and accelerate research with McCormick providing fifty times PPFA's previous funding.\nPincus and McCormick enlisted Harvard clinical professor of gynecology John Rock, chief of gynecology at the Free Hospital for Women and an expert in the treatment of infertility, to lead clinical research with women. At a scientific conference in 1952, Pincus and Rock, who had known each other for many years, discovered they were using similar approaches to achieve opposite goals. In 1952, Rock induced a three-month anovulatory \"pseudopregnancy\" state in eighty of his infertility patients with continuous gradually increasing oral doses of an estrogen (5 to 30\u00a0mg/day diethylstilbestrol) and progesterone (50 to 300\u00a0mg/day), and within the following four months 15% of the women became pregnant.\nIn 1953, at Pincus' suggestion, Rock induced a three-month anovulatory \"pseudopregnancy\" state in twenty-seven of his infertility patients with an oral 300\u00a0mg/day progesterone-only regimen for 20 days from cycle days 5\u201324 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding. This produced the same 15% pregnancy rate during the following four months without the amenorrhea of the previous continuous estrogen and progesterone regimen. But 20% of the women experienced breakthrough bleeding and in the first cycle ovulation was suppressed in only 85% of the women, indicating that even higher and more expensive oral doses of progesterone would be needed to initially consistently suppress ovulation. Similarly, Ishikawa and colleagues found that ovulation inhibition occurred in only a \"proportion\" of cases with 300\u00a0mg/day oral progesterone. Despite the incomplete inhibition of ovulation by oral progesterone, no pregnancies occurred in the two studies, although this could have simply been due to chance. However, Ishikawa et al. reported that the cervical mucus in women taking oral progesterone became impenetrable to sperm, and this may have accounted for the absence of pregnancies.\nProgesterone was abandoned as an oral ovulation inhibitor following these clinical studies due to the high and expensive doses required, incomplete inhibition of ovulation, and the frequent incidence of breakthrough bleeding. Instead, researchers would turn to much more potent synthetic progestogens for use in oral contraception in the future.\nProgestins to prevent ovulation.\nIn October 1951, Chemist Luis Miramontes, working under the supervision of Carl Djerassi, and the direction of George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City, synthesized the first oral contraceptive, which was based on highly active progestin norethisterone. Frank B. Colton at Searle in Skokie, Illinois synthesized the orally highly active progestins noretynodrel (an isomer of norethisterone) in 1952 and norethandrolone in 1953.\nPincus asked his contacts at pharmaceutical companies to send him chemical compounds with progestogenic activity. Chang screened nearly 200 chemical compounds in animals and found the three most promising were Syntex's norethisterone and Searle's noretynodrel and norethandrolone.\nIn December 1954, Rock began the first studies of the ovulation-suppressing potential of 5\u201350\u00a0mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle\u2014days 5\u201325 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his patients with infertility in Brookline, Massachusetts. Norethisterone or noretynodrel 5\u00a0mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10\u00a0mg and higher doses of norethisterone or noretynodrel suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding and led to a 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's noretynodrel for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's norethisterone very slight androgenicity in animal tests.\nCombined oral contraceptive.\nNoretynodrel (and norethisterone) were subsequently discovered to be contaminated with a small percentage of the estrogen mestranol (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the noretynodrel in Rock's 1954\u20135 study containing 4\u20137% mestranol. When further purifying noretynodrel to contain less than 1% mestranol led to breakthrough bleeding, it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with breakthrough bleeding, in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1954. The noretynodrel and mestranol combination was given the proprietary name Enovid.\nThe first contraceptive trial of Enovid led by Celso-Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda and Edris Rice-Wray began in April 1956 in R\u00edo Piedras, Puerto Rico. A second contraceptive trial of Enovid (and norethisterone) led by Edward T. Tyler began in June 1956 in Los Angeles. In January 1957, Searle held a symposium reviewing gynecologic and contraceptive research on Enovid through 1956 and concluded Enovid's estrogen content could be reduced by 33% to lower the incidence of estrogenic gastrointestinal side effects without significantly increasing the incidence of breakthrough bleeding.\nWhile these large-scale trials contributed to the initial understanding of the pill formulation's clinical effects, the ethical implications of the trials generated significant controversy. Of note is the apparent lack of both autonomy and informed consent among participants in the Puerto Rican cohort prior to the trials. Many of these participants hailed from impoverished, working-class backgrounds.\nPublic availability.\nThe availability of oral contraceptives varies widely by country, and in many countries there are differences between the \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" availability. According to a 2013 study, using data collected in 2011-2012 for 147 countries, oral contraceptives were informally available without prescription in 38% of countries, legally available without prescription (no screening by a health professional required) in 24% of countries, legally available without prescription (screening required) in 8% of countries, and available only by prescription in 31% of countries.\nUnited States.\nIn June 1957, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Enovid 10\u00a0mg (9.85\u00a0mg noretynodrel and 150\u00a0\u03bcg mestranol) for menstrual disorders, based on data from its use by more than 600 women. Numerous additional contraceptive trials showed Enovid at 10, 5, and 2.5\u00a0mg doses to be highly effective. In July 1959, Searle filed a supplemental application to add contraception as an approved indication for 10, 5, and 2.5\u00a0mg doses of Enovid. The FDA refused to consider the application until Searle agreed to withdraw the lower dosage forms from the application. In May 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10\u00a0mg for contraceptive use, and did so in June 1960. At that point, Enovid 10\u00a0mg had been in general use for three years and, by conservative estimate, at least half a million women had used it.\nAlthough FDA-approved for contraceptive use, Searle never marketed Enovid 10\u00a0mg as a contraceptive. Eight months later, in February 1961, the FDA approved Enovid 5\u00a0mg for contraceptive use. In July 1961, Searle finally began marketing Enovid 5\u00a0mg (5\u00a0mg noretynodrel and 75\u00a0\u03bcg mestranol) to physicians as a contraceptive.\nAlthough the FDA approved the first oral contraceptive in 1960, contraceptives were not available to married women in all states until \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" in 1965, and were not available to unmarried women in all states until \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\" in 1972.\nThe first published case report of a blood clot and pulmonary embolism in a woman using Enavid (Enovid 10\u00a0mg in the US) at a dose of 20\u00a0mg/day did not appear until November 1961, four years after its approval, by which time it had been used by over one million women. It would take almost a decade of epidemiological studies to conclusively establish an increased risk of venous thrombosis in oral contraceptive users and an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users who smoke or have high blood pressure or other cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factors. These risks of oral contraceptives were dramatized in the 1969 book \"The Doctors' Case Against the Pill\" by feminist journalist Barbara Seaman who helped arrange the 1970 Nelson Pill Hearings called by Senator Gaylord Nelson. The hearings were conducted by senators who were all men and the witnesses in the first round of hearings were all men, leading Alice Wolfson and other feminists to protest the hearings and generate media attention. Their work led to mandating the inclusion of patient package inserts with oral contraceptives to explain their possible side effects and risks to help facilitate informed consent. Today's standard dose oral contraceptives contain an estrogen dose that is one third lower than the first marketed oral contraceptive and contain lower doses of different, more potent progestins in a variety of formulations.\nBeginning in 2015, certain states passed legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe oral contraceptives. Such legislation was considered to address physician shortages and decrease barriers to birth control for women. Pharmacists in Oregon, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maryland, and New Mexico have authority to prescribe birth control after receiving specialized training and certification from their respective state Board of Pharmacy. As of \u00a02024[ [update]], pharmacists in 29 states can prescribe oral contraceptives.\nA progestin-based birth control pill (Opill) was approved by the FDA in 2023 and is available over the counter. Estrogen-based pills still require prescriptions as of 2024.\nAustralia.\nThe first oral contraceptive introduced outside the United States was Schering's Anovlar (norethisterone acetate 4\u00a0mg + ethinylestradiol 50\u00a0\u03bcg) in January 1961, in Australia.\nGermany.\nThe first oral contraceptive introduced in Europe was Schering's Anovlar in June 1961, in West Germany. The lower hormonal dose, still in use, was studied by the Belgian Gynaecologist Ferdinand Peeters.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBefore the mid-1960s, the United Kingdom did not require pre-marketing approval of drugs. The British Family Planning Association (FPA) through its clinics was then the primary provider of family planning services in the UK and provided only contraceptives that were on its Approved List of Contraceptives (established in 1934). In 1957, Searle began marketing Enavid (Enovid 10\u00a0mg in the US) for menstrual disorders. Also in 1957, the FPA established a Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control (CIFC) to test and monitor oral contraceptives which began animal testing of oral contraceptives and in 1960 and 1961 began three large clinical trials in Birmingham, Slough, and London.\nIn March 1960, the Birmingham FPA began trials of noretynodrel 2.5\u00a0mg + mestranol 50\u00a0\u03bcg, but a high pregnancy rate initially occurred when the pills accidentally contained only 36\u00a0\u03bcg of mestranol\u2014the trials were continued with noretynodrel 5\u00a0mg + mestranol 75\u00a0\u03bcg (Conovid in the UK, Enovid 5\u00a0mg in the US).\nIn August 1960, the Slough FPA began trials of noretynodrel 2.5\u00a0mg + mestranol 100\u00a0\u03bcg (Conovid-E in the UK, Enovid-E in the US).\nIn May 1961, the London FPA began trials of Schering's Anovlar.\nIn October 1961, at the recommendation of the Medical Advisory Council of its CIFC, the FPA added Searle's Conovid to its Approved List of Contraceptives.\nIn December 1961, Enoch Powell, then Minister of Health, announced that the oral contraceptive pill Conovid could be prescribed through the NHS at a subsidized price of 2s per month.\nIn 1962, Schering's Anovlar and Searle's Conovid-E were added to the FPA's Approved List of Contraceptives.\nFrance.\nIn December 1967, the Neuwirth Law legalized contraception in France, including the pill. The pill is the most popular form of contraception in France, especially among young women. It accounts for 60% of the birth control used in France. The abortion rate has remained stable since the introduction of the pill.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, lobbying from the Japan Medical Association prevented the pill from being approved for general use for nearly 40 years. The higher dose \"second generation\" pill was approved for use in cases of gynecological problems, but not for birth control. Two main objections raised by the association were safety concerns over long-term use of the pill, and concerns that pill use would lead to decreased use of condoms and thereby potentially increase sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates.\nHowever, when the Ministry of Health and Welfare approved Viagra's use in Japan after only six months of the application's submission, while still claiming that the pill required more data before approval, women's groups cried foul. The pill was subsequently approved for use in June 1999, when Japan became the last UN member country to do so. However, the pill has not become popular in Japan. According to estimates, only 1.3 percent of 28\u00a0million Japanese females of childbearing age use the pill, compared with 15.6 percent in the United States. The pill prescription guidelines the government has endorsed require pill users to visit a doctor every three months for pelvic examinations and undergo tests for sexually transmitted diseases and uterine cancer. In the United States and Europe, in contrast, an annual or bi-annual clinic visit is standard for pill users. However, beginning as far back as 2007, many Japanese OBGYNs have required only a yearly visit for pill users, with multiple checks a year recommended only for those who are older or at increased risk of side effects. As of 2004, condoms accounted for 80% of birth control use in Japan, and this may explain Japan's comparatively low rates of AIDS.\nSociety and culture.\nThe pill was approved by the US FDA in the early 1960s; its use spread rapidly in the late part of that decade, generating an enormous social impact. \"Time\" magazine placed the pill on its cover in April 1967. In the first place, it was more effective than most previous reversible methods of birth control, giving women unprecedented control over their fertility. Its use was separate from intercourse, requiring no special preparations at the time of sexual activity that might interfere with spontaneity or sensation, and the choice to take the pill was a private one. This combination of factors served to make the pill immensely popular within a few years of its introduction.\nClaudia Goldin, among others, argue that this new contraceptive technology was a key player in forming women's modern economic role, in that it prolonged the age at which women first married allowing them to invest in education and other forms of human capital as well as generally become more career-oriented. Soon after the birth control pill was legalized, there was a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women. From an economic point of view, the birth control pill reduced the cost of staying in school. The ability to control fertility without sacrificing sexual relationships allowed women to make long term educational and career plans.\nBecause the pill was so effective, and soon so widespread, it also heightened the debate about the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical \"Humanae vitae\". The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.\nThe United States Senate began hearings on the pill in 1970 and where different viewpoints were heard from medical professionals. Dr. Michael Newton, President of the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The evidence is not yet clear that these still do in fact cause cancer or related to it. The FDA Advisory Committee made comments about this, that if there wasn't enough evidence to indicate whether or not these pills were related to the development of cancer, and I think that's still thin; you have to be cautious about them, but I don't think there is clear evidence, either one way or the other, that they do or don't cause cancer.\nAnother physician, Dr. Roy Hertz of the Population Council, said that anyone who takes this should know of \"our knowledge and ignorance in these matters\" and that all women should be made aware of this so they can decide to take the pill or not.\nThe Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare at the time, Robert Finch, announced the federal government had accepted a compromise warning statement which would accompany all sales of birth control pills.\nResult on popular culture.\nThe introduction of the birth control pill in 1960 allowed more women to find employment opportunities and further their education. As a result of women getting more jobs and an education, their husbands had to start taking over household tasks like cooking. Wanting to stop the change that was occurring in terms of gender norms in an American household, many films, television shows, and other popular culture items portrayed what an ideal American family should be. Below are listed some examples:\nEnvironmental impact.\nA woman using combined oral contraceptive pills excretes in her urine and feces natural estrogens, estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), and synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2).\nThese hormones can pass through water treatment plants and into rivers. Other forms of contraception, such as the contraceptive patch, use the same synthetic estrogen (EE2) that is found in combined oral contraceptive pills, and can add to the hormonal concentration in the water when flushed down the toilet. This excretion is shown to play a role in causing endocrine disruption, which affects the sexual development and reproduction of wild fish populations in segments of streams contaminated by treated sewage effluents.\nA study done in British rivers supported the hypothesis that the incidence and the severity of intersex wild fish populations were significantly correlated with the concentrations of the E1, E2, and EE2 in the rivers.\nA review of activated sludge plant performance found estrogen removal rates varied considerably but averaged 78% for estrone, 91% for estradiol, and 76% for ethinylestradiol (estriol effluent concentrations are between those of estrone and estradiol, but estriol is a much less potent endocrine disruptor to fish).\nSeveral studies have suggested that reducing human population growth through increased access to contraception, including birth control pills, can be an effective strategy for climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. According to Thomas Wire, contraception is the 'greenest technology' because of its cost-effectiveness in combating global warming \u2014 each $7 spent on contraceptives would reduce global carbon emissions by 1 tonne over four decades, while achieving the same result with low-carbon technologies would require $32.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
