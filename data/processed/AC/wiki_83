{"id": "28355", "revid": "1318415641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28355", "title": "Square (video game company)", "text": "Japanese video game company\n also known under its international brand name SquareSoft, was a Japanese video game developer and publisher. It was founded in 1986 by Masafumi Miyamoto, who spun off the computer game software division of Den-Yu-Sha, a power line construction company owned by his father. Among its early employees were designers Hironobu Sakaguchi, Hiromichi Tanaka, Akitoshi Kawazu, Koichi Ishii, artist Kazuko Shibuya, programmer Nasir Gebelli, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. Initially focusing on action games, the team saw popular success with the role-playing video game \"Final Fantasy\" in 1987, which would lead to the franchise of the same name being one of its flagship franchises. Later notable staff included directors Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita, designer and writer Yasumi Matsuno, artists Tetsuya Nomura and Yusuke Naora, and composers Yoko Shimomura and Masashi Hamauzu.\nInitially developing for PCs, then exclusively for Nintendo systems, Square cut ties with Nintendo in the 1990s to develop for Sony Computer Entertainment's upcoming console PlayStation. Their first major project for the console, \"Final Fantasy VII\", was a worldwide critical and commercial success and was credited with boosting the popularity of role-playing video games and the PlayStation outside Japan. Alongside the \"Final Fantasy\" series, the company developed and published several other notable series, including \"SaGa\", \"Mana\", \"Front Mission\", \"Chrono\" and \"Kingdom Hearts\". Over the years, many staff left to found studios such as the still active Monolith Soft and Mistwalker, and the now defunct Sacnoth and AlphaDream.\nIn 2001, the company saw financial troubles due to the commercial failure of the feature film \"\", which ultimately led Sakaguchi to leave the company in 2003. The film's failure disrupted merger discussions with Enix, publisher of the \"Dragon Quest\" series. Following the success of \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Kingdom Hearts\", negotiations resumed and the merger went ahead on April 1, 2003, forming Square Enix.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nSquare was initially established in September 1983 as a software subsidiary of Den-Yu-Sha, an electric power conglomerate led by Kuniichi Miyamoto. His son Masafumi Miyamoto, then a part-time employee of the Science and Technology Department at Keio University, had little interest in following his father into the electricity business. Miyamoto instead became a software developer at the Yokohama branch of Den-Yu-Sha in Hiyoshi, with a focus on the emerging video game market. Their original offices were based in a former hairdresser's salon. The company's name referred to a golfing term, and represented its aim to face challenges head-on. It also referenced a town square, emphasizing a production environment based on cooperation.\nAt the time, video games in Japan were usually created by a single programmer. Miyamoto, on the other hand, believed that graphic designers, programmers, and professional story writers would be needed to keep up with advances in computing and video game development. During these early years, the group was compared to a family business; one of the early hires, Shinichiro Kajitani, joined because he was a friend of Miyamoto, and later compared the company at that time to a \"college club\". To recruit for this new organizational structure, Miyamoto organized a salon in Yokohama and offered jobs to those who demonstrated exceptional programming skills. This led to the part-time hiring of university students Hironobu Sakaguchi and Hiromichi Tanaka, as well as Hisashi Suzuki, who would go on to become Square's CEO. Miyamoto's initial plan was to recruit from Keio University, but this never materialized.\n1985\u20131987: First games, \"Final Fantasy\".\nSquare's first attempt at a game was an adaptation of the television game show \"Torin-ingen\". As Miyamoto had not secured the license to adapt it, the show's producers forced Square to cancel the game, prompting its team to be reshuffled. Square's first completed game was \"The Death Trap\" (1984) for NEC PC-8801, a text adventure set in a war-torn African nation. \"The Death Trap\" was the first game published under the Square brand. Its sequel, \"Will: The Death Trap II\", was released the following year to commercial success. Many of Square's early titles were produced for PC devices, and focused on the action genre.\nIn 1985, the company negotiated a licensing agreement with Nintendo to develop titles for the Family Computer. The company shifted to developing for the Famicom to benefit from its stable hardware, compared to the constantly changing components of PCs. Square's first Famicom release was a port of the run and gun game \"Thexder\" (1985), and its first original game was the scrolling shooter \"King's Knight\" (1986). During this period, the team also hired new developers Akitoshi Kawazu and Koichi Ishii, artist Kazuko Shibuya, Iranian-American programmer Nasir Gebelli, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. Yusuke Hirata joined that year as sales manager, and later became the company's publicity manager.\nIn April 1986, Square moved into new offices based in Ginza, noted as one of the most expensive areas for companies to operate; Sakaguchi later speculated Miyamoto was hoping to attract business by appearing affluent. Square was re-established as an independent developer in September of that year with capital of \u00a510 million, buying the original Square gaming division from Den-Yu-Sha in December. Sakaguchi was appointed as a Director of Planning and Development, and Hisashi Suzuki became one of the company's directors. Due to the high cost of Ginza rents, the company was forced to move into smaller offices in Okachimachi, Tait\u014d. Square began struggling financially following multiple commercial failures for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. Miyamoto asked the company's four directors for game proposals, with plans to have their staff vote on the best idea. Sakaguchi proposed making a role-playing video game (RPG), believing it to be a viable project after the success of Enix's \"Dragon Quest\" (1986).\nWhile skeptical, Miyamoto allowed production of the RPG on the condition it only had a five-person team. Sakaguchi led development, bringing in Gebelli, Kawazu, Ishii, and Uematsu. Production of the game, eventually called \"Final Fantasy\", proceeded in \"fits and starts\". Sakaguchi eventually received help from the other team at Square led by Tanaka, which included Shibuya and newcomer debugger Hiroyuki Ito. Production on the game lasted roughly ten months. While shipments of 200,000 units were planned, Sakaguchi persuaded Square to double that number. \"Final Fantasy\" was released in 1987 to commercial success, selling over 400,000 copies in Japan. It saw greater sales success in North American when it was released in 1989, selling 700,000 copies. Two other Japanese successes from 1987 were \"Rad Racer\" and \"The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner\".\n1987\u20131995: Expansion and notable staff.\nThe success of \"Final Fantasy\" prompted development of \"Final Fantasy II\" (1988), which established many of the series recurring elements. This and four more \"Final Fantasy\" titles would appear on the Famicom and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Famicom), culminating in \"Final Fantasy VI\" (1994). These were among a string of projects that Square produced exclusively for Nintendo consoles, including the portable Game Boy. In 1990, Square moved its offices to the Akasaka district, and then to Ebisu, Shibuya in 1992. In April 1991, Square merged with an identically named dormant company in order to change its share prices. As a result of the merger, Square's foundation was backdated to the other company's July 1966 founding date.\nAt that time, Square drew some of its development funding from loans from Shikoku Bank. Due to increasing development costs, the bank sent Tomoyuki Takechi on secondment to be their office manager in 1990. Takechi's secondment lasted until 1994, by which time Square had annual sales worth \u00a516 million per year. In August of that year, Square registered with the Japan Securities Dealers Association to offer shares for public purchase. Sakaguchi was by now a prominent figure within the company, and was promoted to Executive President in 1991. His increasing corporate involvement lessened his creative input, prompting him to give greater influence to other staff. Gebelli left Square in 1993, retiring on royalties from the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Miyamoto stepped down as Square's President in 1991 while remaining a major shareholder, and was replaced by Tetsuo Mizuno. In 1991, Suzuki became Vice President.\nAs \"Final Fantasy\" became a featured property for the company, Square produced additional projects that became successful series of their own. The Japan-exclusive real-time strategy series \"Hanjuku Hero\", which began in 1988, parodied conventions of the RPG genre. Kawazu helmed an RPG project for the Game Boy. Released in 1989, \"Makai Toushi SaGa\" (\"The Final Fantasy Legend\") spawned the \"SaGa\" series, which Kawazu would continue to be involved over the years. After the release of \"Final Fantasy III\" (1990), Ishii was offered the chance to create his own game, leading to the production of \"Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden\" (\"Final Fantasy Adventure\") for the Game Boy in 1991. Ishii went on to develop additional \"Seiken Densetsu\" titles, released outside of Japan as the \"Mana\" series. A famous game from the period was \"Chrono Trigger\", born from a collaboration between Sakaguchi, \"Dragon Quest\" creator Yuji Horii, and \"Dragon Ball\" artist Akira Toriyama. Among other standalone titles were the Western-exclusive \"Secret of Evermore\", and the \"Mario\"-themed \"Super Mario RPG\" co-produced with Nintendo. Reflecting on this period, Sakaguchi noted that \"Final Fantasy\" was the company's most recognized property, while celebrating the fact that the company would still be profitable on the merits of their other successful game series.\nAdditional staff joined Square by the early 1990s, inspired by the successful \"Final Fantasy\" series, with several first working on \"Final Fantasy IV\" (1991), Yoshinori Kitase acted as a writer and later director, artist Tetsuya Nomura began as a graphic designer, and Tetsuya Takahashi and Kaori Tanaka were both artists and writers. Takashi Tokita became a full-time employee at the company, and Hiroyuki Ito began his work as a game designer. Chihiro Fujioka worked on several projects including co-directing \"Super Mario RPG\". Kenichi Nishi worked in minor roles on \"Chrono Trigger\" and \"Super Mario RPG\". Masato Kato, who joined in 1993, became scenario writer for \"Chrono Trigger\". Artist Yusuke Naora first worked on \"Final Fantasy VI\". Kazushige Nojima, known for his work on the \"Glory of Heracles\" series, joined as a scenario writer. Future director Motomu Toriyama, who had no experience with game development, began as a scenario writer.\nSquare also hired additional music staff. Kenji Ito contributed to both the \"SaGa\" and \"Mana\" series. Hiroki Kikuta worked on the \"Mana\" series and standalone projects. Yasunori Mitsuda started as a sound designer and was lauded for his work on the \"Chrono\" series. Yoko Shimomura, formerly a Capcom composer, did her first work on \"Live A Live\" (1994). In 1995, Square moved its headquarters to the Shimomeguro district in Meguro. \n1995\u20131999: Move to PlayStation.\nFollowing the release of \"Final Fantasy VI\" and \"Chrono Trigger\", Square staff began planning the next entry in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, and entered the emerging 3D gaming market. With the production of \"Final Fantasy VII\", Square decided to shift their projects to Sony Computer Entertainment's new PlayStation console, prompted by the affordability of CD-ROM distribution, compared to Nintendo's continued use of expensive cartridges. This shift caused a long-standing rift between Square and Nintendo; one Square employee recalled Nintendo telling the company to \"never come back\". In 1996, Square's final project with Nintendo was Sting Entertainment's \"Treasure Hunter G\" for the Super Famicom, while the company debuted DreamFactory's \"Tobal No. 1\" for the PlayStation that same year. Soon after, the company signed a licensing agreement with Sony, who gained the exclusive right to publish Square's next six games in the West.\nSquare continued work on \"Final Fantasy VII\", with Kitase as director, Naora as art director, Nomura as lead artist, and Nojima as scenario writer. Released worldwide in 1997, \"Final Fantasy VII\" was a worldwide commercial and critical success, bringing Square international fame. Also in 1997, at Square's invitation, Takechi returned and took Mizuno's place as President. Three new hires during the period were Shinji Hashimoto, Yasumi Matsuno, and Masashi Hamauzu. Hashimoto joined in 1995 as promotions producer for \"Final Fantasy VII\". Matsuno, along with a number of other developers, had left Quest Corporation following the release of \"Tactics Ogre\" (1995), and worked with Sakaguchi on \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" (1997). Hamauzu joined in 1996, and worked on \"Final Fantasy\" spin-off titles and the \"SaGa\" series. Sakaguchi, working on other projects, took on the role of executive producer for the series beginning with \"Final Fantasy VIII\", and Hashimoto stepped in as producer. Hirata went from an administrative position to lead producer, focusing on diversifying Square's library into new game genres.\nSeveral properties were introduced during this period. These included \"Parasite Eve\", based on a novel of the same name by Hideaki Sena; \"Front Mission\", which began on the Super Famicom but was transferred to the PlayStation beginning with its second entry; and the \"Final Fantasy\" spin-off series \"Chocobo\", starring an incarnation of the titular mascot character. As Square was estranged from Nintendo at the time, the company supported other platforms including the WonderSwan and Windows. Late in the PlayStation's lifecycle, Square continued to support the console with multiple releases, such as \"Threads of Fate\" (1999) and \"Vagrant Story\" (2000). The company also began work on PlayOnline, a digital storefront and a platform for online game services and web content.\nDuring the late 1990s, Square launched an initiative to give teams of younger staff members a chance to create experimental titles on smaller budgets. Among such titles were \"Xenogears\", \"Soukaigi\", and \"Another Mind\". Around this time, several staff members departed Square due to creative differences or a desire to work on their own projects. These included Takahashi and Tanaka, Fujioka, Nishi, Kikuta, Mitsuda, and \"Mana\" artist Shinichi Kameoka. In April 2000, Suzuki was appointed Square's new President, while Takechi became a company chairman. Also at this time, two outside directors were appointed, Kenichi Ohmae of Ohmae &amp; Associates and Makoto Naruke of Microsoft. The corporate reshuffle was intended to strengthen Square's overseas connections and bring in technical and administrative support for future digital and online content. Alongside this, Yoichi Wada joined the company as a company director and eventually COO. In August 2000, Square was listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, which includes the largest companies on the exchange.\n2000\u20132003: \"The Spirits Within\", final years.\nIn addition to leading production on \"Final Fantasy IX\" (2000), Sakaguchi also worked at the 1997-established Square Pictures studio on a \"Final Fantasy\" feature film. Titled \"\", it was planned as Sakaguchi's first push towards cross-media storytelling; however, the project ran over budget and ended up costing Square and co-producer Columbia Pictures US$137 million. Upon its release in 2001, \"The Spirits Within\" was met with mixed critical reception, and grossed only $85 million. Labeled as a box-office bomb, the film damaged Square's finances, and led to the closure of Square Pictures.\nFollowing both the failure of \"The Spirits Within\" and a delay of \"Final Fantasy X\" (2001) for the PlayStation 2, Square suffered a financial loss for the first time, prompting Sakaguchi, Takechi, and director Masatsugu Hiramatsu to resign from their positions. Sakaguchi was kept on as executive producer for \"Final Fantasy\", while Takechi and Hiramatsu were retained as external consultants. This period left Sakaguchi in a state of low morale. In late 2001, Suzuki stepped down as President, and was replaced by Wada. Yosuke Matsuda became Senior Vice President. Kenji Ito also left during this period to work as a freelance composer. Prior to the film's release, rival company Enix was proposing merging with another game company to alleviate development costs, opening serious discussions with Square in 2000. Square's financial losses with \"The Spirits Within\" prompted Enix to halt discussions.\nUnder Wada, the company underwent restructuring with the intent of streamlining production and resources, and cutting development costs to increase profits. After evaluation of its financial position, and with changes to the console war due to Microsoft's Xbox, Square opened talks with Nintendo for the first time since their breakup in the 1990s. The talks were successful, with \"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\" beginning development for the GameCube in late 2001. Square also began production on \"Final Fantasy X-2\", the first direct sequel to a \"Final Fantasy\" game. \"Final Fantasy X-2\" was Sakaguchi's last credited project at Square, and he left the company in 2003. Around this time, Square also began development on \"Kingdom Hearts\" (2002), with Nomura making his directorial debut. The game was a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company, blending Disney characters with \"Final Fantasy\" elements in an original story. \"Kingdom Hearts\" was Shimomura's last project as an in-house composer before going freelance in 2002. Also released in 2002 was the Japanese version of \"Final Fantasy XI\", the company's first MMORPG. Conceived by Sakaguchi, it was developed by the \"Chrono\" team and led by Ishii. \"Final Fantasy XI\" and its first expansion was Kato's last work for Square before leaving in 2002 to go freelance.\nFollowing the commercial success of \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Kingdom Hearts\", Square and Enix resumed talks and agreed to merge their two companies. Wada described it as a merger of two companies \"at their height\". Despite this, the merger had its skeptics, particularly Miyamoto who did not want to see his controlling stake diluted in a merged company. Miyamoto's issue was resolved by altering the exchange ratio to one Square share for 0.81 Enix shares, and the merger was greenlit. Square Enix was formed on April 1, 2003, with Enix as the surviving corporate entity and Square dissolving its departments and subsidiaries into the new company. Around 80% of Square's staff transitioned into Square Enix. Square's final release was the Japanese version of \"X-2\".\nStructure.\nDevelopment structure.\nDuring reports on the merger with Enix, Takashi Oya of Deutsche Securities contrasted Enix's tradition of outsourcing development versus Square's approach to developing \"everything by itself\". When Square was founded in the early 1980s, there was no set development structure, with the ten-person staff freely shifting between roles and projects. This eventually evolved into two loosely defined production groups, led by Sakaguchi and Tanaka, respectively. Following the release of \"Final Fantasy IV\", Sakaguchi divided the production team, assigning different staff members to the \"Final Fantasy\", \"SaGa\" and \"Mana\" series. A secondary studio was founded in Osaka in 1990, with \"Final Fantasy Legend III\" (1991) as their first project.\nBy 1997, the company was divided into eight development divisions, with two based in Osaka. In 1998, the old development divisions were restructured into Production Departments, and the Osaka branch was closed down. The system was reshuffled again in 2002 to promote \"greater understanding\", and allow for reassignment between divisions. Among the heads of divisions at this time were Kitase, Kawazu, Tanaka, Matsuno and Hirata. Following the merger with Enix, the eight divisions were incorporated into the new company, with two additional divisions brought in from Enix.\nPublishing and localization.\nSquare self-published the majority of its games in Japan, and sporadically acted as a publisher for third-party developers. By contrast, their Western presence during the 80s and early 90s was small. RPGs were not popular in the North American market at that time, and Square's presence in Europe was limited. The original \"Final Fantasy\" was published in North America in 1990 by Nintendo of America close to the launch of the Super Nintendo, resulting in its two sequels being passed over for localization at that time. One of their third-party North American releases was the original \"Breath of Fire\" by Capcom, who were busy enough to outsource publishing and localization to Square. The Redmond office later closed, with some localization staff choosing not to relocate to California.\nSquare initially did not have an internal localization department, instead outsourcing to a number of translators. Following the release of \"Final Fantasy VII\", which saw criticism for its localization, Square created a new internal department to encourage higher quality. Initially having only two employees, it grew steadily over the years. Individual games still ran into difficulties due to their large text sizes, difficulties translating some culture-specific elements, potential censorship, and the introduction of voice acting with games including \"Final Fantasy X\". Notable localization staff included Kaoru Moriyama, Ted Woolsey, Michael Basket, Richard Honeywood, and Alexander O. Smith.\nMany Square titles remained exclusive to Japan, for reasons including design complexities, low graphical quality, and technical difficulties. In the 1990s, Square's first six PlayStation releases were published by Sony as part of a contract between the two companies. Eidos Interactive notably handled the Windows ports of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Final Fantasy VIII\". In Europe, Square's local branch self-published a number of games including mainline \"Final Fantasy\" titles. It also partnered with third-party companies including Eidos, Crave Entertainment, and Infogrames for either publishing or distribution of different titles.\nSubsidiaries.\nIn 1989, Square established Square Soft in Redmond, Washington, to provide development and publishing support in the West. After opening their North American offices, Square began publishing selected titles under the \"SquareSoft\" brand. As Square moved its projects to PlayStation in 1994, a second Western R&amp;D subsidiary called Square LA was founded in August 1995 in Marina del Rey, California, renamed Square USA in October 1996. Square Soft itself would notably develop \"Secret of Evermore\" in 1995 for the Super Nintendo and later moved to Costa Mesa, California near Square USA. In 1997, a second Square USA branch was opened in Honolulu, Hawaii to focus on new interactive entertainment research, going on to help with CGI development on \"Parasite Eve\" and \"Final Fantasy IX\". Square Europe was founded in 1998 in London, England, focusing on publishing in Europe. \nA publishing brand called Aques was established by Square in 1996. The name was an anagram of Square's name, as well as an acronym for \"Advanced QUality Entertainment and Sports\", representing the company's diversification outside of role-playing games. That same year, Square established a distribution company called DigiCube, with convenience stores as their main strategy. The subdidiary expanded into book publishing, stocked games from other companies, and at one point published games under its own brand. DigiCube survived the Square Enix merger, though it declared bankruptcy in 2004 after years of declining sales.\nIn 1999, Square created a number of subsidiaries with dedicated roles: Square Visual Works to focus on producing CGI animation, Square Sounds for music and sound effects, Squartz for quality control and user support, and Square Next to support smaller game projects. Following the success of \"Final Fantasy VII\" in 1997, Sakaguchi founded a dedicated CGI film studio called Square Pictures in Hawaii; his aim was to both develop \"The Spirits Within\" and help with further development of Square's CGI technology. By the end of 2001, Square Pictures was dissolved and merged into Visual Works. Square USA's Hawaiian branch developed the CGI short \"Final Flight of the Osiris\" that later formed part of the 2003 anthology film \"The Animatrix\". The branch was shut down in 2002 following a failed attempt to find a film studio partner.\nIn 2002, Square Next was rebranded as The Game Designer Studio, with ownership between Square's Product Development Division 2 and Kawazu. The aim was to allow for development of games for Nintendo consoles without impacting production on Sony platform games. The Game Designers Studio was absorbed back into Square Enix after the completion of \"Crystal Chronicles\", first renamed to SQEX Corporation and eventually dissolved entirely in 2010. Square Sounds was dissolved into the main company in March 2002 as an internal division, a move attributed to cost cutting. The Square Soft subsidiary established in 1989 was rebranded as Square Enix Inc. when its parent company merged with Enix in 2003. All the other subsidiaries were folded into Square Enix during the merger, with Visual Works becoming its own dedicated department.\nOn May 1, 1998, Square formed a joint-venture partnership with Electronic Arts; Square Electronic Arts published Square titles in North America, while Electronic Arts Square published Electronic Arts titles in Japan. The partnership emerged the year following Electronic Arts winding down a similar partnership with Victor in December 1997. Shares were distributed between the two on a 70/30 basis relating to their role; Square Electronic Arts had Square owning 70%, while Electronic Arts owned 30%. Electronic Arts Square would also develop the PlayStation 2 launch title \"X-Squad\". In March 31, 2003, coinciding with the Square Enix merger, both ventures were dissolved, with each partner buying the other's shares. In its February press release, Square described the joint-venture as a success.\nAffiliates and acquisitions.\nBetween 1986 and 1988, Square led a collective of game developers dedicated to the production of games for the Famicom Disk System. The Square-owned label, called Disk Original Group (DOG), included Square, HummingBirdSoft, System Sacom, Microcabin, Carry Lab, Thinking Rabbit, and Xtalsoft. This coalition was able to pool financial resources, allowing them to overcome the prohibitive costs of acting individually. The Famicom Disk System was rendered defunct by 1988 due to increased storage capacity in standard Famicom ROM cartridges. In January 1994, Square acquired developer Cobra Team, turning it into a subsidiary called Solid and focusing their work on cooperating with external developers. In 1995, Square established DreamFactory as an affiliate studio, which developed fighting-based titles for the PlayStation and PS2. DreamFactory became an independent company in 2001 after Square transferred their shares. Square later founded subsidiary Escape in March 1998 with DreamFactory staff. It only produced \"Driving Emotion Type-S\" (2000) before being liquidated in 2003.\nThe company held a stake in \"Bushido Blade\" developer Lightweight, founded in 1995. It sold that stake to software company Forside in 1999. \"Front Mission\" developers G-Craft were initially independent, developing the original \"Front Mission\" with Square collaborating through their Solid subsidiary and acting as publisher. Square bought out G-Craft and incorporated it in 1997 during production of \"Front Mission 2\". Other affiliates associated with Square between the early 1990s to 2000 were font company Kusanagi, and developers Positron and Luciola. In 2002, \"Ogre Battle\" developer Quest Corporation withdrew from game development and was bought by Square. Absorbed and repurposed into a production division, their first project was \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" (2003).\nRelated studios.\nMany Square employees went on to found notable development studios and other ventures. Nishi founded Love-de-Lic in 1995, producing three games including \"\". Love-de-Lic staff went on to found other small studios including Skip Ltd. (\"Chibi-Robo!\"), and Punchline (\"Rule of Rose\"). Frustrated with Square's rigid hierarchy, Kikuta founded Sacnoth in 1997, which would become known for the \"Shadow Hearts\" series; he left Sacnoth in 1999 following the release of his project \"Koudelka\" and founded the music label Nostrilia. Several \"Xenogears\" developers, including Takahashi and Tanaka, founded Monolith Soft in 1999 in order to pursue projects outside the \"Final Fantasy\" series, developing more games using the \"Xeno\" prefix.\nKameoka and other developers who worked on \"Legend of Mana\" (1999) founded Brownie Brown in 2000. Brownie Brown later worked with Square Enix on \"Sword of Mana\" (2003), a remake of \"Final Fantasy Adventure\". Also in 2000, Mizuno founded AlphaDream, engaging Fujioka and going on to develop the \"Mario &amp; Luigi\" series. Staff members from Square Pictures, including \"The Spirits Within\" co-director Motonori Sakakibara, established Sprite Animation Studios in 2002. After his resignation from Square, Takechi founded music label Dreamusic in 2001 with Kazunaga Nitta. Mitsuda founded the music studio Procyon in 2001 so he could work while maintaining his health. After stepping down as president in 2001, Sakaguchi experienced a period of low morale before returning to game development, founding Mistwalker in 2004. The studio became known for the \"Blue Dragon\" and \"Terra Wars\" series, as well as multiple stand-alone projects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The study of symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology. Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds. For example, in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, which provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifold's cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system.\nMotivation.\nSymplectic manifolds arise from classical mechanics; in particular, they are a generalization of the phase space of a closed system. In the same way the Hamilton equations allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of differential equations, the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a vector field describing the flow of the system from the differential formula_3 of a Hamiltonian function formula_4. So we require a linear map formula_5 from the tangent manifold formula_6 to the cotangent manifold formula_7, or equivalently, an element of formula_8. Letting formula_9 denote a section of formula_10, the requirement that formula_9 be non-degenerate ensures that for every differential formula_3 there is a unique corresponding vector field formula_13 such that formula_14. Since one desires the Hamiltonian to be constant along flow lines, one should have formula_15, which implies that formula_9 is alternating and hence a 2-form. Finally, one makes the requirement that formula_9 should not change under flow lines, i.e. that the Lie derivative of formula_9 along formula_13 vanishes. Applying Cartan's formula, this amounts to (here formula_20 is the interior product): \nformula_21\nso that, on repeating this argument for different smooth functions formula_4 such that the corresponding formula_13 span the tangent space at each point the argument is applied at, we see that the requirement for the vanishing Lie derivative along flows of formula_13 corresponding to arbitrary smooth formula_4 is equivalent to the requirement that \"\u03c9\" should be closed.\nDefinition.\nLet formula_1 be a smooth manifold. A symplectic form on a is a closed non-degenerate differential 2-form formula_2. Here, non-degenerate means that for every point formula_28, the skew-symmetric pairing on the tangent space formula_29 defined by formula_2 is non-degenerate. That is to say, if there exists an formula_31 such that formula_32 for all formula_33, then formula_34. The closed condition means that the exterior derivative of formula_2 vanishes.\nA symplectic manifold is a pair formula_36 where formula_1 is a smooth manifold and formula_2 is a symplectic form. Assigning a symplectic form to formula_1 is referred to as giving formula_1 a symplectic structure. Since in odd dimensions, skew-symmetric matrices are always singular, nondegeneracy implies that formula_41 is even.\nBy nondegeneracy, formula_2 can be used to define a pair of musical isomorphisms formula_43, such that formula_44 for any two vector fields formula_45, and formula_46.\nA symplectic manifold formula_47 is exact iff the symplectic form formula_9 is exact, i.e. equal to formula_49 for some 1-form formula_50. The area 2-form on the 2-sphere is an inexact symplectic form, by the hairy ball theorem.\nBy Darboux's theorem, around any point formula_51 there exists a local coordinate system, in which formula_52, where d denotes the exterior derivative and \u2227 denotes the exterior product. This form is called the Poincar\u00e9 two-form or the canonical two-form. Thus, we can locally think of \"M\" as being the cotangent bundle formula_53 and generated by the corresponding tautological 1-form formula_54.\nA (local) Liouville form is any (locally defined) formula_55 such that formula_56. A vector field formula_57 is (locally) Liouville iff formula_58. By Cartan's magic formula, this is equivalent to formula_59. A Liouville vector field can thus be interpreted as a way to recover a (local) Liouville form. By Darboux's theorem, around any point there exists a local Liouville form, though it might not exist globally.\nGiven any smooth function formula_60, its Hamiltonian vector field is the unique vector field formula_61 satisfying formula_62. The set of all Hamiltonian vector fields make up a Lie algebra, and is written as formula_63 where formula_64 is the Lie bracket.\nGiven any two smooth functions formula_65, their Poisson bracket is defined by formula_66. This makes any symplectic manifold into a Poisson manifold. The Poisson bivector is a bivector field formula_67 defined by formula_68, or equivalently, by formula_69. The Poisson bracket and Lie bracket are related by formula_70.\nSubmanifolds.\nThere are several natural geometric notions of submanifold of a symplectic manifold formula_36. Let formula_72 be a submanifold. It is\nThe conditions can also be defined by differential algebra using Poisson brackets. Let formula_83 be the differential ideal of functions vanishing on formula_84, then formula_74 is isotropic iff formula_86, coisotropic iff formula_87, Lagrangian iff the induced Poisson bracket on the quotient algebra formula_88 is zero, and symplectic iff the induced Poisson bracket on the quotient algebra formula_88 is nondegenerate.\nLagrangian submanifolds.\nLagrangian submanifolds are the most important submanifolds. Weinstein proposed the \"symplectic creed\": \"Everything is a Lagrangian submanifold.\" By that, he means that everything in symplectic geometry is most naturally expressed in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds.\nA Lagrangian fibration of a symplectic manifold \"M\" is a fibration where all of the fibers are Lagrangian submanifolds.\nGiven a submanifold formula_72 of codimension 1, the characteristic line distribution on it is the duals to its tangent spaces: formula_91. If there also exists a Liouville vector field formula_92 in a neighborhood of it that is transverse to it. In this case, let formula_93, then formula_94 is a contact manifold, and we say it is a contact type submanifold. In this case, the Reeb vector field is tangent to the characteristic line distribution.\nAn \"n\"-submanifold is locally specified by a smooth function formula_95. It is a Lagrangian submanifold if formula_96 for all formula_97. If locally there is a canonical coordinate system formula_98, then the condition is equivalent to formula_99where formula_100 is the Lagrange bracket in this coordinate system.\nGiven any differentiable function formula_101, its differential formula_102 has a graph in formula_103. The graph is a Lagrangian submanifold. Conversely, if a Lagrangian submanifold formula_104 projects down to formula_105 diffeomorphically (i.e. the projection map formula_106, when restricted to the submanifold, is a diffeomorphism), then it is the graph of some formula_102 for some formula_101. In such a case, formula_109 is the generating function of a Lagrangian manifold.\nThis example shows that Lagrangian submanifolds satisfy an \"h\"-principle, exist in great abundance, and are not rigid. The classification of symplectic manifolds is done via Floer homology\u2014this is an application of Morse theory to the action functional for maps between Lagrangian submanifolds. In physics, the action describes the time evolution of a physical system; here, it can be taken as the description of the dynamics of branes.\nLagrangian mapping.\nLet \"L\" be a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold (\"K\",\u03c9) given by an immersion \"i\" : \"L\" \u21aa \"K\" (\"i\" is called a Lagrangian immersion). Let \"\u03c0\" : \"K\" \u21a0 \"B\" give a Lagrangian fibration of \"K\". The composite (\"\u03c0\" \u2218 \"i\") : \"L\" \u21aa \"K\" \u21a0 \"B\" is a Lagrangian mapping. The critical value set of \"\u03c0\" \u2218 \"i\" is called a caustic.\nTwo Lagrangian maps (\"\u03c0\"1 \u2218 \"i\"1) : \"L\"1 \u21aa \"K\"1 \u21a0 \"B\"1 and (\"\u03c0\"2 \u2218 \"i\"2) : \"L\"2 \u21aa \"K\"2 \u21a0 \"B\"2 are called Lagrangian equivalent if there exist diffeomorphisms \"\u03c3\", \"\u03c4\" and \"\u03bd\" such that both sides of the diagram given on the right commute, and \"\u03c4\" preserves the symplectic form. Symbolically:\n formula_110\nwhere \"\u03c4\"\u2217\"\u03c9\"2 denotes the pull back of \"\u03c9\"2 by \"\u03c4\".\nSymmetries.\nA map formula_111 between symplectic manifolds is a symplectomorphism when it preserves the symplectic structure, i.e. the pullback is the same formula_112. The most important symplectomorphisms are symplectic flows, i.e. ones generated by integrating a vector field on formula_47.\nGiven a vector field formula_92 on formula_47, it generates a symplectic flow iff formula_116. Such vector fields are called symplectic. Any Hamiltonian vector field is symplectic, and conversely, any symplectic vector field is \"locally\" Hamiltonian.\nA property that is preserved under all symplectomorphisms is a symplectic invariant. In the spirit of Erlangen program, symplectic geometry is the study of symplectic invariants.\nExamples.\nThe standard symplectic structure.\nLet formula_117 be a basis for formula_118 We define our symplectic form formula_9 on this basis as follows:\nformula_120\nIn this case the symplectic form reduces to a simple quadratic form. If formula_121 denotes the formula_122 identity matrix then the matrix, formula_123, of this quadratic form is given by the formula_124 block matrix:\nformula_125\nThat is,\nformula_126 \nIt has a fibration by Lagrangian submanifolds with fixed value of formula_127, i.e. formula_128.\nA Liouville form for this is formula_129 and formula_130, the Liouville vector field isformula_131the radial field. Another Liouville form is formula_132, with Liouville vector field formula_133.\nCotangent bundles.\nLet formula_134 be a smooth manifold of dimension formula_135. Then the total space of the cotangent bundle formula_136 has a natural symplectic form, called the Poincar\u00e9 two-form or the canonical symplectic form\nformula_137\nHere formula_138 are any local coordinates on formula_134 and formula_140 are fibrewise coordinates with respect to the cotangent vectors formula_141. Cotangent bundles are the natural phase spaces of classical mechanics. The point of distinguishing upper and lower indexes is driven by the case of the manifold having a metric tensor, as is the case for Riemannian manifolds. Upper and lower indexes transform contra and covariantly under a change of coordinate frames. The phrase \"fibrewise coordinates with respect to the cotangent vectors\" is meant to convey that the momenta formula_142 are \"soldered\" to the velocities formula_143. The soldering is an expression of the idea that velocity and momentum are colinear, in that both move in the same direction, and differ by a scale factor.\nThe tautological 1-form formula_144 has Liouville vector field formula_145, the fiberwise radial field. Its flow dilates covectors: formula_146.\nThe zero section of the cotangent bundle is Lagrangian. For example, let\nformula_147\nThen, we can present formula_148 as\nformula_149\nwhere we are treating the symbols formula_150 as coordinates of formula_151. We can consider the subset where the coordinates formula_152 and formula_153, giving us the zero section. This example can be repeated for any manifold defined by the vanishing locus of smooth functions formula_154 and their differentials formula_155.\nK\u00e4hler manifolds.\nA K\u00e4hler manifold is a symplectic manifold equipped with a compatible integrable complex structure. They form a particular class of complex manifolds. A large class of examples come from complex algebraic geometry. Any smooth complex projective variety formula_156 has a symplectic form which is the restriction of the Fubini\u2014Study form on the projective space formula_157.\nA symplectic manifold endowed with a metric that is compatible with the symplectic form is an almost K\u00e4hler manifold in the sense that the tangent bundle has an almost complex structure, but this need not be integrable.\nAlmost-complex manifolds.\nRiemannian manifolds with an formula_9-compatible almost complex structure are termed almost-complex manifolds. They generalize K\u00e4hler manifolds, in that they need not be integrable. That is, they do not necessarily arise from a complex structure on the manifold.\nSpecial Lagrangian submanifolds.\nThe graph of a symplectomorphism in the product symplectic manifold (\"M\" \u00d7 \"M\", \"\u03c9\" \u00d7 \u2212\"\u03c9\") is Lagrangian. Their intersections display rigidity properties not possessed by smooth manifolds; the Arnold conjecture gives the sum of the submanifold's Betti numbers as a lower bound for the number of self intersections of a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, rather than the Euler characteristic in the smooth case.\nIn the case of K\u00e4hler manifolds (or Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds) we can make a choice formula_159 on formula_105 as a holomorphic n-form, where formula_161 is the real part and formula_162 imaginary. A Lagrangian submanifold formula_163 is called special if in addition to the above Lagrangian condition the restriction formula_162 to formula_163 is vanishing. In other words, the real part formula_161 restricted on formula_163 leads the volume form on formula_163. The following examples are known as special Lagrangian submanifolds,\nIn Morse theory, given a Morse function formula_169 and for a small enough formula_170 one can construct a Lagrangian submanifold given by the vanishing locus formula_171. For a generic Morse function we have a Lagrangian intersection given by formula_172. \nThe SYZ conjecture deals with the study of special Lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry; see . \nThe Thomas\u2013Yau conjecture predicts that the existence of a special Lagrangian submanifolds on Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds in Hamiltonian isotopy classes of Lagrangians is equivalent to stability with respect to a stability condition on the Fukaya category of the manifold.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Noted for his distinctive laugh, he was best known for numerous roles in the \"Carry On\" film series.\nBorn to a middle-class Jewish family in South Africa, James started his career in his native country before finding his greatest success in the UK. Beginning his screen career playing bit parts in films from 1947, he was cast in numerous small and supporting roles into the 1950s. He appeared in the film \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" in 1951, starring Alec Guinness.\nHis profile was raised as Tony Hancock's co-star in \"Hancock's Half Hour\", firstly in the radio series and later when it was adapted for television and ran from 1954 to 1960. After this he became known as a regular performer in the \"Carry On\" films, appearing in 19 films of the series, top-billed in all but two.\nHis leading roles in television sitcoms continued. He starred in the 1970s sitcom \"Bless This House\" until his death in 1976.\nEarly life.\nJames, born Solomon Joel Cohen on 8 May 1913 in South Africa, was the second son of London-born Jewish vaudeville performers Reina (n\u00e9e Solomon; 1892\u20131965) and Lazarus Joel \"Laurie\" Cohen (1884\u20131948). His elder brother, Maurice, was born in 1911. Known affectionately as \"Sollie\" in childhood, he later changed his name to Sidney James following confusion with a similarly-named cousin at his school, taking his new surname from his parents' stage names.\nThe family lived at the home of his maternal grandmother, Flora Solomon, on Hancock Street in Hillbrow, Johannesburg. In 1919, the Cohens left their sons in the care of Laurie's brother and sister-in-law, Abraham and Esther Cohen, in Newcastle, Natal after being offered a tour of Australia with their vaudeville act. By the time the tour ended in 1921 they were beginning divorce proceedings. Laurie remained in Australia with relatives, while Reina returned to her mother's new home in Joubert Park, Johannesburg with their sons.\nJames claimed various previous occupations, including diamond cutter, dance tutor and boxer, but his main employment had been as a hairdresser at the salon owned by his mother and her siblings, where he had trained. It was at a hairdressing salon in Kroonstad, Orange Free State, that he met his first wife. His father-in-law, Johannesburg businessman Joseph Delmont, bought James a hairdressing salon in the basement of the prestigious Carlton Hotel, but within a year James announced that he wanted to become an actor and joined the Johannesburg Repertory Players. Through this group he gained work with the South African Broadcasting Corporation.\nDuring World War II he served as a lieutenant in the Union Defence Force Entertainment Unit in South Africa's army, and subsequently took up acting as a career. He moved to the United Kingdom in December 1946, financed by his service gratuity. Initially he worked in repertory, before being spotted for the nascent British post-war film industry.\nCareer.\nFrom 1947 to 1960.\nJames made his first credited film appearances in \"Night Beat\" and \"Black Memory\" in 1947, both crime dramas. He played the alcoholic hero's barman in Powell and Pressburger's \"The Small Back Room\" in 1949. \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" in 1951 was his first comedy film, ranked 17th out of the 100 best British films by the British Film Institute: with Alfie Bass, he made up the bullion robbery gang headed by Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway. He also appeared in \"Lady Godiva Rides Again\" and \"The Galloping Major\", both films were released in 1951, and as Harry Hawkins in \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\" (1953), and also had a lead role in \"The Wedding of Lilli Marlene\". He featured in another Alec Guinness film, \"Father Brown\" (US: \"The Detective\", 1954) and in \"Trapeze\" (1956) as Harry the snake charmer, a circus film which was one of the most successful films of its year, and he played Master Henry in \"Outlaw Money\" (also 1956), an episode of \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\".\nJames had a supporting part as a TV advertisement producer in Charlie Chaplin's \"A King in New York\", a non-comic supporting role as a journalist in the science-fiction film \"Quatermass 2\", and he performed in \"Hell Drivers\" (all 1957), a film with Stanley Baker. This was one of many appearances James made for the Rank Organisation.\nThe next year, James starred with Miriam Karlin in \"East End, West End\" by Wolf Mankowitz, a half-hour comedy series for the ITV company Associated Rediffusion. Set within the Jewish community of London's East End, the series of six episodes was transmitted in February and March 1958, but plans for further episodes were abandoned after a disappointing response. For a while though, it had looked as if his commitment elsewhere might end his work with Tony Hancock, one of the most popular television comedians of the time.\nHe had begun working with Tony Hancock in 1954, in his BBC Radio series \"Hancock's Half Hour\". Having seen him in \"The Lavender Hill Mob\", it was the idea of Hancock's writers, Galton and Simpson, to cast James. He played a character called Sid James (but having the invented middle name Balmoral) who was a petty criminal and would usually manage to con Hancock in some way, although the character eventually ceased to be Hancock's adversary. With the exception of James, the other regular cast members of the radio series were dropped when the series made the transition to television. His part in the show now greatly increased, and many viewers came to think of Hancock and James as a double act.\nFeeling the format had become exhausted, Hancock decided to end his professional relationship with James at the end of the sixth television series in 1960. Although the two men remained friends, James was upset at his colleague's decision. The experience led to a shift away from the kind of roles for which he had become best known. He remained the lovable rogue but was keen to steer clear of criminal characters; in 1960 he turned down the part of Fagin in the original West End staging of \"Oliver!\" for that very reason.\n\"Carry On\" films.\nJames became a leading member of the \"Carry On\" films team, originally to replace Ted Ray, who had appeared in \"Carry On Teacher\" (1959). It had been intended that Ray would become a recurring presence in the \"Carry On\" series, but he was dropped after just one film because of contractual problems. James ultimately made 19 \"Carry On\" films, receiving top billing in 17, making him one of the most featured performers of the regular cast.\nThe characters he portrayed in the films were usually very similar to the wise-cracking, sly, lecherous Cockney he was famed for playing on television, and in most cases they bore the name Sid or Sidney, for example, Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in \"Carry On Up the Khyber\" and Sid Boggle in \"Carry On Camping\". His distinctive laugh was often used and became, along with a world-weary \"Cor, blimey!\", his catchphrase.\nThere were \"Carry On\" films in which James played characters who were not called Sid or Sidney: \"Carry On Constable\" (1960), in which he played Sergeant Frank Wilkins; \"Carry On Henry\" (1971), a parody of the TV series \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\"; \"Carry On Abroad\" (1972), in which James's character was named Vic Flange; and \"Carry On Dick\" (1974), a parody version of the legend of the highwayman Dick Turpin. In \"Henry\" and \"Dick\", James played the title roles, while in \"Carry On Cleo\" he played Mark Antony. In \"Carry On Cowboy\" (1965), he adopted an American accent for his part as \"The Rumpo Kid\". James had previously used American accents in the films \"Give Us This Day\" (1949), \"Orders Are Orders\" (1954), \"A Yank in Ermine\" (1955), \"Wicked as They Come\" (1956), Chaplin's \"A King in New York\" (1957), \"The Man Inside\" (1958), and \"Another Time, Another Place\" (1958).\nFollowing James and Hancock's professional split, Galton and Simpson continued to write for them individually. The Sidney Balmoral James character resurfaced in \"Citizen James\" (1960\u20131962), by which point Sid James was now consistently taking the lead role in his television work. \"Taxi!\" (1963\u201364) was his next series. A comedy-drama rather than a sitcom, it was created by Ted Willis, but although it ran to two series, the programme was not particularly successful.\nIn 1964, he made his first of two appearances on \"The Eamonn Andrews Show\". The first few moments of the opening credits of one of them can be heard and seen in the television show \"Undermind\", Episode 6, \"Intent to Destroy\", broadcast on 12 June 1965. His name is heard announced, and the show is seen on a television camera seconds later.\nLater career.\nIn 1967, James was intending to play Sergeant Nocker in \"Follow That Camel\", but was already committed to recording the TV series \"George and the Dragon\" (1966\u20131968) for ATV, then one of the ITV contractors. James was replaced in \"Follow That Camel\" by the American comic actor Phil Silvers. On 13 May 1967, two weeks after the filming began of what eventually became an entry in the \"Carry On\" series, James suffered a severe heart attack. In the same year in \"Carry On Doctor\", James was shown mainly lying in a hospital bed, owing to his real-life health problems. After his heart attack, James gave up his heavy cigarette habit and instead smoked a pipe or an occasional cigar; he lost weight, ate only one main meal a day, and limited himself to two or three alcoholic drinks per evening.\nIn 1968, James, Val Doonican and Arthur Askey were filmed playing golf in the village of Cockington near Torquay (British Path\u00e9 archives, film reference 457.1), for their production \"Viva Torbay: Travelling to the British Seaside\".\nHis success in TV situation comedy continued with the programmes \"Two in Clover\" (1969\u201370) and \"Bless This House\" (1971\u20131976); the latter led to a film version in 1972.\nPersonal life.\nJames married three times:\nGoodwin claims that James fathered two illegitimate children during his marriage to Toots Delmont, to separate women, that were born in Rhodesia after his father-in-law paid them off. A third child, born to a stylist from James' salon and conceived before the divorce, was born in Cape Town in 1941. Goodwin also claims that James once struck Delmont when she revealed she was pregnant.\nDuring his marriage to Assan he had a well-publicised three year affair with his \"Carry On\" co-star Barbara Windsor. The affair was dramatised in the 1998 stage play \"Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick\" and its 2000 television adaptation \"Cor, Blimey!\". James's obsession with Windsor was such that it was rumoured that her then husband, Ronnie Knight, had all of James's furniture rearranged at home as a subtle threat and, on another occasion, put an axe in James's floor, but close friends of the time, including Vince Powell and William G. Stewart, dismissed the suggestions.\nJames was an inveterate and largely unsuccessful gambler, having been introduced to the pastime by his uncle, Louis Cohen. James lost tens of thousands of pounds over his lifetime. His gambling addiction was such that he had an agreement with his agent, Michael Sullivan, under which his wife was not told how much he was being paid, so that a portion could be set aside for gambling.\nDeath.\nOn 26 April 1976, four days after the end of the sixth series of \"Bless This House\", James was on tour in a revival of a comedy, \"The Mating Season\", when he suffered a heart attack on stage at the Sunderland Empire Theatre. Actresses Olga Lowe and Audrey Jeans thought that he was playing a practical joke at first when he failed to reply to their dialogue. When they ad-libbed to him and he still failed to respond, they moved towards the wings to seek help. The technical manager, Melvyn James (no relation), called for the curtain to close and requested a doctor, while the audience\u00a0\u2013 who were unaware of what was happening\u00a0\u2013 laughed, believing the events to be part of the show. An ambulance was called, and he was pronounced dead on arrival at Sunderland General Hospital. He was 62.\nAt the time of his death, negotiations were being held for a seventh and eighth series of \"Bless This House\", as well as another film adaptation, to be produced along with an hour-long television variety special featuring James, but those plans were scrapped due to his death. Bruce Forsyth ultimately replaced him in the leading role of the 1976 TV version of \"The Mating Season\" that went out on ITV in December of the same year. James was cremated and his ashes were scattered at Golders Green Crematorium.\nLegacy.\nJames has been the subject of at least five tribute shows: Channel 4's \"With Out Walls, Seriously Seeking Sid\" in the late 1980s; a 1996 one-off tribute, \"The Very Best of Sid James\"; a 2000 episode of the series \"The Unforgettable\"; a 2002 episode of \"Heroes of Comedy\"; and in 2013, the BBC's \"The Many Faces Of Sid James\".\nJames was played by Geoffrey Hutchings in Terry Johnson's play \"Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick\", which premiered at the National Theatre in 1998. Hutchings reprised the role in the subsequent film adaptation, \"Cor, Blimey!\".\nIn the 2006 BBC television film \"\", James was played by Ged McKenna.\nIn August 2018, it was announced that a radio interview which James had recorded for BBC Radio Solent on 22 March 1976 had been re-discovered during research for a forthcoming BBC radio documentary celebrating the \"Carry On\" film series. The recording had been kept by BBC presenter Jeff Link, who had carried out the original interview. In the interview, James discusses his attempts to keep fit by skipping, his preference for working in films, his genuine affection for the \"Carry On\" films, and other topics. The interview is notable for its relaxed, humorous style. The producer of the forthcoming BBC \"Carry On\" documentary, Richard Latto, contacted James's surviving daughters after confirming the recording's authenticity. Reina James commented: \"To hear him talking just before he's about to die... there's something hugely moving about that.\" Sue James called the interview \"lovely and sympathetic\".\nA Heritage Foundation commemorative blue plaque to James was installed at the former Teddington Studios on Broom Road, Teddington, Greater London where every episode of \"Bless This House\" was recorded, until 30 June 2015 \u2013 at which time it was stolen, just before the building was demolished to make way for housing. A further blue plaque, placed by the British Comedy Society, commemorates his time living at 35 Gunnersbury Avenue (A406), from 1956 to 1963. The first plaque here was also stolen; the second \"was placed much higher up the wall.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term shipping originally referred to transport by sea but in American English, it has been extended to refer to transport by land or air (International English: \"carriage\") as well. \"Logistics\", a term borrowed from the military environment, is also used in the same sense.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric Era.\nInitial human civilization relied heavily on domesticated animals, such as horses, camels, and donkeys, to transport their goods. The invention of the wheel in Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C.E improved this efficiency by allowing for carts and carriages to be created, which animals could pull.\nClassical Era.\nRomans.\nThe Romans built a vast network of roads, which facilitated trade across the numerous cities in its empire.\nSilk Road.\nTransport along the silk road, a land-based route, was generally done through caravans, equipped with camels that would carry goods. It was uncommon for traders to traverse the entirety of the silk road - they would pass on their goods to other traders along different legs of the journey.\nModern Period.\nIndustrial Revolution.\nFreight transport in the UK was shaped significantly by the industrial revolution. The midlands of England saw a sophisticated canal system, which allowed freight to be transported easily through long distances. Additionally, railway systems were popularized, initially consisting of horse-drawn carts, but switched to steam powered trains later on.\nAviation.\nAfter the invention of the plane by the Wright Brothers, the first air freight shipment was delivered in 1910. While the industry and demand for air freight delivery remained low throughout much of the 20th century, the creation of FedEx in 1973 revolutionised the industry by introducing specialised cargo flights, rather than aggregating passenger and cargo flights in one trip.\nAutonomous Transportation.\nPresently, autonomous vehicles have been trialled by many companies as a method of transportation, intending to reduce labour costs. Additionally, robots designed to automate the 'last-mile delivery' stage have also been considered by businesses.\nModes of shipment.\nIn 2015, 108 trillion tonne-kilometers were transported worldwide (anticipated to grow by 3.4% per year until 2050 (128 Trillion in 2020)): 70% by sea, 18% by road, 9% by rail, 2% by inland waterways and less than 0.25% by air.\nGrounds.\nLand or \"ground\" shipping can be made by train or by truck (British English: lorry). Ground transport is typically more affordable than air, but more expensive than sea, especially in developing countries, where inland infrastructure may not be efficient. In air and sea shipments, ground transport is required to take the cargo from its place of origin to the airport or seaport and then to its destination because it is not always possible to establish a production facility near ports due to the limited coastlines of countries.\nShip.\nMuch freight transport is done by cargo ships. An individual nation's fleet and the people that crew it are referred to as its merchant navy or merchant marine. According to a 2018 report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), merchant shipping (or seaborne trade) carries 80\u201390% of international trade and 60\u201370% by value. On rivers and canals, barges are often used to carry bulk cargo.\nAir.\nCargo is transported by air in specialized cargo aircraft and in the luggage compartments of passenger aircraft. Air freight is typically the fastest mode for long-distance freight transport, but it is also the most expensive.\nMultimodal.\nCargo is exchanged between different modes of transportation via transport hubs, also known as transport interchanges or Nodes (e.g. train stations, airports, etc.). Cargo is shipped under a single contract but performed using at least two different modes of transport (e.g. ground and air). Cargo may not be containerized.\nIntermodal.\nMultimodal transport featuring containerized cargo (or intermodal container) that is easily transferred between ship, rail, plane and truck.\nFor example, a shipper works together with both ground and air transportation to ship an item overseas. Intermodal freight transport is used to plan the route and carry out the shipping service from the manufacturer to the door of the recipient.\nTerms of shipment.\nThe Incoterms (or International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of the most commonly used terms in international trade. Common terms include:\nThe term \"best way\" generally implies that the shipper will choose the carrier that offers the lowest rate (to the shipper) for the shipment. In some cases, however, other factors, such as better insurance or faster transit time, will cause the shipper to choose an option other than the lowest bidder.\nDoor-to-door shipping.\nDoor-to-door (DTD or D2D) shipping refers to the domestic or international shipment of cargo from the point of origin (POI) to the destination while generally remaining on the same piece of equipment and avoiding multiple transactions, trans-loading, and cross-docking without interim storage.\nInternational DTD is a service provided by many international shipping companies and may feature intermodal freight transport using containerized cargo. The quoted price of this service includes all shipping, handling, import and customs duties, making it a hassle-free option for customers to import goods from one jurisdiction to another. This is compared to standard shipping, the price of which typically includes only the expenses incurred by the shipping company in transferring the object from one place to another. Customs fees, import taxes and other tariffs may contribute substantially to this base price before the item ever arrives.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located on the Mediterranean coast in the South Governorate, of which it is the capital. Tyre, to the south, and the Lebanese capital of Beirut, to the north, are each about away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within the city limits, while its metropolitan area has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.\nEtymology.\nThe Phoenician name (, \u1e62DN) probably meant \"fishery\" or \"fishing town\". It is mentioned in Papyrus Anastasi I as \"\u1e0fjdwn\ua723\". It appears in Biblical Hebrew as () and in Syriac as (). This was Hellenised as (), which was Latinised as and entered English in this form. The name appears in Classical Arabic as () and in Modern Arabic as ().\nAs a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and given the formal name to honour its imperial sponsor.\nDuring the crusades, Sidon was known in Latin as and in Old French as , or .\nIn the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, making Sidon a great-grandson of Noah.\nHistory.\nIn antiquity, Sidon held prominence as a significant Phoenician city. It was nestled on a mainland promontory and boasted two harbors. Throughout ancient history, Sidon had many conquerors: Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and finally Romans. Under Persian rule, it eclipsed Tyre to become the paramount city in Phoenicia. In the New Testament era, Herod the Great visited Sidon. Both Jesus and Saint Paul are said to have visited it, too (see \"Biblical Sidon\" below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\nPrehistory.\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a lithic assemblage dating to the Acheulean, whilst finds at Sidon III include a Heavy Neolithic assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of pottery.\nMiddle Bronze.\nMiddle Bronze IIA.\nIn late MB IIA, Sidon Level 4 became an important port trading with Egypt (late 12th and early 13th dynasties).\nLate Bronze.\nLate Bronze II.\nAmarna period. Around 1350 BC, Sidon was part of the Egyptian Empire and ruled by Zimredda of Sidon. During the Amarna Period, Egypt went into decline, leading to uprising and turmoil in the Levant. There was rivalry between Lebanese coastal city-states fighting for dominance, with Abimilku of Tyre in the south, and Rib-Hadda of Byblos in the north. Byblos became significantly weakened as the dominant city on the Lebanese coast. Further north, the Akkar Plain rebelled and became the kingdom of Amurru with Hittite support. The Mitanni Empire, an ally of the Egyptians, had dominated Syria but now fell apart due to the military campaigns of Suppiluliuma I of Hatti. Tutankhamun and his general Horemheb scrambled to keep Egyptian control over southern Levant, as the Hittites became overlords in the north.\nThe oldest testimony documenting words in the Phoenician language of Sidon, is also from this period. The Book of Deuteronomy (3, 9) reads: \"the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion\". In other words: Mount Hermon was called \"Sirion\", in (the Phoenician language of) Sidon.\nIron Age.\nSidon was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of Phoenicia.\nDuring the Phoenician era, Sidon thrived on two pivotal industries: glass manufacturing and purple dye production. The city's glass production operated on an extensive scale, while the manufacturing of purple dye held nearly equal importance. The magnitude of Sidon's purple dye production was evident through a considerable mound of discarded \"Murex trunculus\" shells discovered near the southern harbor. These shells were broken to extract the precious pigment, so rare that it became synonymous with royalty.\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King Eshmun\u2019azar II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of \u2018Ashtart, \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\" In this inscription the gods Eshmun and Ba\u2018al Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. \u2018Ashtart is entitled \"\u2018Ashtart-Shem-Ba\u2018al,\" '\u2018Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an Ugaritic text.\nNebuchadnezzar II subjugated the city to be part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Sidon's navy played a significant role in the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, aligning with the Persian fleet against the Greeks. From the mid-fifth century BC onward, warships became a prominent feature on the city's coinage. At the end of the Persian era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by Artaxerxes III.\nPersian and Hellenistic periods.\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors, first by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC, ending with its occupation by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, and the start of the Hellenistic period of Sidon's history. The Persian influence seems to have been profound, as is observed in the change of the architectural style of the city. \nIn exchange for supporting his conquest of Egypt, King Cambyses II of Persia awarded Sidon with the territories of Dor, Joppa, and the Plain of Sharon.\nUnder the Diadochi or successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organised games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Hellenistic period necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the Alexander Sarcophagus (likely the tomb of King Abdalonymus rather than Alexander), the Lycian tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.\nRoman period.\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The city was embellished by Herod, king of Judaea, who built there a theatre. By the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, Sidon sheltered enough Jews that local pagans hesitated to attack them during the broader massacre of Jews in Greco-Syrian towns in 66 CE, as documented by Josephus.\nThe Romans built a theater and other major monuments in the city, and an underground Mithraeum was discovered. In the reign of Elagabalus, a Roman colony was established there. The \"Philogelos\", a Greek-language joke book written circa the 4th century AD, features a series of jokes about Sidonians, who are stereotyped as unintelligent and literal-minded. During the Byzantine Empire, when the great earthquake of AD 551 destroyed most of the cities of Phoenice, the law school of Berytus took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636.\nCrusader-Ayyubid period.\nOn 4 December 1110, Sidon was captured after the siege of Sidon, a decade after the First Crusade, by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and King Sigurd I of Norway. It then became the center of the Lordship of Sidon, an important vassal-state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the Crusade of 1197. It remained an important Crusader stronghold until it was destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1249. In 1260, it was again destroyed by the Mongols led by Kitbuqa. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\nDuring the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela noted the presence of approximately twenty Jews, possibly Jewish families, in Sidon, which he described as a \"large city.\"\nOttoman period.\nAfter Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance. In 1521, Moses Basola encountered twenty families of Musta'rabi Jews during his visit to Sidon.\nDuring the 18th century, the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.\nDuring the Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War, Sidon, like much of Ottoman Syria, was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with a column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named .\nThe 19th century brought significant changes to the Jewish community of Sidon. By 1830, the community, comprising around twenty-five families of primarily Arabic-speaking merchants, had customs akin to those of Judean Jews. Starting in 1850, the community witnessed growth as Maghrebi Jews, initially settled in the Chouf Mountains above Beirut, migrated to Sidon and Beirut amidst escalating Druze-Maronite tensions and the ensuing 1860 war. With roots in mountain traditions, they introduced citrus cultivation on the outskirts of Sidon, leading to the construction of a new synagogue in 1860 to meet the needs of the expanding community.\nFrom 1887 the Royal necropolis of Sidon was extensively excavated by the Ottomans, and its treasures transferred to Istanbul (like the Alexander sarcophagus). Sidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900.\nAfter World War I.\nAfter World War I it became part of the French Mandate of Lebanon. During World War II the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was captured by British forces fighting against the Vichy French, and following the war it became a major city of independent Lebanon. Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, Palestinian refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\nOn Easter Sunday, 19 April 1981, at least sixteen people were killed in Sidon after the (South Lebanon Army) SLA's long-range artillery indiscriminately shelled the city centre. It was reported that it was in response to a request from Bashir Gemayel in connection with ongoing Syrian attacks on Phalangist positions around Zahle. Israel denied involvement. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Sidon was occupied by the Israeli army for almost two and a half years.\nOn 18 August 1997, following a roadside bomb near Jezzine which killed two teenage members of a SLA leader's family, SLA artillery shelled Sidon killing seven civilians and wounding thirty-five. Hizbollah responded the following day by firing 60\u201380 rockets into the security zone and northern Israel. According to UNIFIL observers the missiles appeared to be targeted at uninhabited areas. The attack on Sidon is credited with leading to a truce between Hizbollah and Amal and increased cooperation between the two groups and the Lebanese Army. This was evident in the Ansariya ambush the following month.\nOn 8 June 1999, two gunmen entered the Palais de Justice, Sidon's main courthouse, and shot dead three magistrates and a chief prosecutor. The attackers escaped. No group claimed responsibility but suspicion focused on Osbat al-Ansar whose leader had been sentenced to death \"in absentia\" for the murder of the head of the Sufi Al-Ahbash movement and the attempted assassination of the mufti of Tripoli. He was believed to be in hiding in the Ain al-Hilwa refugee camp.\nStudies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels (see \"Old City\" and the \"Architecture and landscape\" sections below).\nSaida Municipal Stadium was inaugurated in 2000 for the Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000.\nPolitics.\nThis sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the Lebanese Civil War, when armed clashes erupted between Sunni Muslims and Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and Christians were forced to move to east Beirut. After the war ended in 1990, some Christians gradually returned to their hometowns but in 2000 many fled to Israel. The local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the El-Bizri and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of Nasser in Lebanon).\nThe local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament.\nThe El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Takieddine el-Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, father of Tamam Salam, Prime Minister 2014\u20132016. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service.\nThe Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. The Saads remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family began to rise to prominence and became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and until the present today.\nMaarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the mid-1990s, following modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes.\nImpact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment.\nAccording to a 2013 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\" In another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century. With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital outpaced Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992\u20131998), was centered around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\nThe former \"Makab\" (waste dump) and the treatment plant.\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the \"Makab\"; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with medical waste and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the \"Makab\" crisis\u2014which has endangered residents' health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the city's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.\nLocal government.\nThe city of Sidon is administered by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administered by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the Governorate of South Lebanon, and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old Ottoman Saray that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections \u2013 and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law \u2013 the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.\nDemographics.\nIn 2014, Muslims made up 92.99% and Christians made up 6.49% of registered voters in Sidon. 82.16% of the voters were Sunni Muslims and 10.83% were Shiite Muslims.\nThe overwhelming majority of Sidon's population belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, with a small number of Shiites and Christians. Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and Deir el Qamar, and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history. Sidon also hosts the seat of the Shiite Ayatollah of South Lebanon.\nIn the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in Beirut, however by the end of 1990s most of the Jewish population had emigrated leaving their cemetery and other sites in a state of abandonment.\nEducation.\nSidon is home to numerous educational facilities ranging from public elementary schools to private universities. According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools. Sidon also contains 10 universities, 5 of which are private universities.\nArchaeology.\nThe following archaeological sites in the area indicate settlements from the earliest prehistorical times.\nSidon I, II and III are prehistoric sites, while Sidon I is the tell of ancient Sidon starting from the Early Bronze Age.\nSidon I is an archaeological site located to the east of the city, south of the road to Jezzine. An assemblage of flint tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow axes or chisels that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous. The collection appears to have gone missing from the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut.\nSidon II is said to be \"near the church\" at approximately fifty meters above sea level. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the Acheulean.\nSidon III was found by E. Passemard in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the National Museum of Beirut marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large flint and chert bifacials that may be of Heavy Neolithic origin.\nSidon IV is the tell mound of ancient Sidon with Early Bronze Age (c.\u20093200 BC) deposits, now located underneath the ruined Saint Louis Castle and what are also thought to be the ruins of a Roman theater.\nBronze Age city and kingdom.\nCity of Sidon (Sidon IV site).\nIn the area of this ruined Crusader castle, recent excavations uncovered a late Early Bronze Age I (EB I) settlement on bedrock. Here, an uninterrupted sequence from EB I to EB III was found. A modest third-millennium BC settlement consisting of domestic installations and tombs was also uncovered. Yet the following history of Sidon was not clarified. Very little has been known about the location, extent, and significance of Middle Bronze Age (MBA) Sidon until recently.\nTell el-Burak MBA settlement.\nSince the early 21st century, Tell el-Burak excavations have helped significantly in this area, because it was an active settlement during MBA, and quite well preserved. Tell el-Burak is located along the coast 9\u00a0km south from Sidon. Previously, there was a big gap in the history of this whole coastal area from the end of the Early Bronze Age until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, when Sidon is first mentioned in the historical texts.\nMBA kingdom of Sidon.\nArchaeologists determined that Sidon was clearly the big power centre during MBA, controlling significant territory. So there appears to have been the \"Kingdom of Sidon\" that controlled el-Burak, and many other surrounding areas.\nExcavation history.\nThe area around Sidon contains a number of important necropoli (below in order of age, and noting their principal excavators):\nIn indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar Ernest Renan was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: \"Mission de Ph\u00e9nicie\" (1864\u20131874; \"Phoenician Expedition\").\nThe St. Louis castle grounds were excavated in 1914\u20131920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognize the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with Byblos, even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\nDuring the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the archaeological sites at Sidon to safeguard them from damage.\nIn the Bible.\nHebrew Bible/Old Testament.\nThe Hebrew Bible describes Sidon (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05df\u200e) in several passages:\nNotable people.\nIn antiquity and the pre-modern era.\nChronological list.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was introduced in the United States in 1937 and gained popularity worldwide after its use during World War II. As of 2003[ [update]], Spam was sold in 41 countries, and trademarked in more than 100 countries, on 6 continents.\nSpam's main ingredient is pork, with salt, water, modified potato starch (as a binder), sugar, and sodium nitrite (as a preservative). Natural gelatin is formed during cooking in its cans on the production line. It is available in different flavors, some using different meats, as well as in \"lite\" and lower-sodium versions. Spam is precooked, making it safe to consume straight from the can, but it is often cooked further for taste.\nConcerns about Spam's nutritional attributes have been raised because it contains twice as much of the daily dietary recommendation of fat as it does of protein, and about the health effects of salt and preservatives.\nSpam has become part of popular culture, including a Monty Python sketch, which repeated the name many times, leading to its name being borrowed to describe unsolicited electronic messages, especially email. It is occasionally celebrated at festivals such as Spamarama in Austin, Texas.\nHistory.\nHormel introduced Spam on July 5, 1937. \"The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America\" states that the product was intended to increase the sale of pork shoulder, a cut which did not sell well. Ken Daigneau, the brother of a company executive, won a $100 prize that year in a competition to name the new item. Hormel states that the meaning of the name \"is known by only a small circle of former Hormel Foods executives\", but a popular belief is that the name is a contraction of \"spiced ham\". It has also been speculated to be an acronym for \"shoulder of pork and ham\".\nThe difficulty of delivering fresh meat to the front during World War II saw Spam become a ubiquitous part of the U.S. soldier's diet. It became variously referred to as \"ham that didn't pass its physical\", \"meatloaf without basic training\", and \"SPecial Army Meat\". Over of Spam were received by the military before the war's end. However, several troops grew tired of the product. They expressed their frustrations in written letters to Jay Hormel, the president of the company, about the presence of Spam at every meal. Despite this disparagement, throughout the war, countries ravaged by the conflict and faced with strict food rations came to appreciate Spam.\nDuring World War II and the occupations that followed, Spam was introduced into Guam, Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and other islands in the Pacific. Immediately absorbed into native diets, it has become a unique part of the history and effects of U.S. influence in the Pacific islands. As a consequence of World War II rationing and the Lend-Lease Act, Spam was sold in the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher later referred to it as a \"wartime delicacy\". In addition to increasing production for the U.K., Hormel expanded Spam output as part of Allied aid to the Soviet Union. In his memoir \"Khrushchev Remembers\", Nikita Khrushchev declared: \"Without Spam, we wouldn't have been able to feed our army.\"\nThe billionth can of Spam was sold in 1959, and the eight billionth can was sold in 2012.\nInternational usage.\nUnited States and territories.\nDomestically, Spam's chief advantages were affordability, accessibility, and extended shelf life. Statistics from the 1990s say that 3.8 cans of Spam were consumed every second in the United States, totaling nearly 122\u00a0million cans annually. It became part of the diet of almost 30% of American households, perceived differently in various regions of the country. It is also sometimes associated with economic hardship because of its relatively low cost.\nAfter World War II, Spam changed roles in the U.S. from being the main protein source to being a side dish or ingredient used in items like sandwiches and eggs.\nSpam that is sold in North America, South America, and Australia is produced in Austin, Minnesota (also known as \"Spam Town USA\"), and in Dubuque, Iowa. Austin, Minnesota also had a restaurant with a menu devoted exclusively to Spam called \"Johnny's SPAMarama Menu\".\nHawaii.\nResidents of the state of Hawaii have the highest per capita consumption in the United States, bringing in sales of 7\u00a0million cans of Spam per year. Its perception there is very different from that on the mainland. Hawaiians sometimes call it \"Portagee Steak\".\nA local dish in Hawaii is Spam musubi, in which cooked Spam is placed on top of rice and wrapped in a band of nori, a form of \"onigiri\" or riceball. Varieties of Spam are found in Hawaii and Saipan that are unavailable in other markets, including Honey Spam, and Hot and Spicy Spam.\nHawaiian Burger King restaurants began serving Spam in 2007 to compete with the local McDonald's chains (which also serve Spam). In Hawaii, Spam is so popular that it is sometimes referred to as \"The Hawaiian Steak\". There is even an annual Spam-themed festival on the island of Oahu each spring, known as the \"Waikiki Spam Jam\". Local chefs and restaurants compete to create new Spam-themed dishes, which are then sold in a massive street fair on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki.\nIn 2017, Hawaii was plagued by a rash of thefts of Spam. Spam had long been a target of thieves in Hawaii, but the magnitude of the thefts ramped up, with incidents in which multiple cases of Spam were stolen at once. Local retailers believe organized crime was involved. This came alongside increases in thefts of some other retail goods, such as corned beef and liquor. The president of the retail merchants of Hawaii attributed the rise in retail thefts to a recent change in criminal law, which raised the threshold at which a theft would lead to felony charges by approximately $400.\nGuam and the Northern Marianas.\nIn Guam, the average per capita consumption is 16 tins (cans) per year. It is also found on McDonald's menus there. The \"Spam Games\" also occur in Guam, where locals sample and honor the best original, homemade Spam recipes.\nIn the Northern Mariana Islands, lawyers from Hormel have threatened to sue the local press for publishing articles alleging ill effects of high Spam consumption on the health of the local population.\nPuerto Rico.\nSandwich de Mezcla is a party staple in Puerto Rico containing Spam, Velveeta, and pimientos (made into a spread) between two slices of sandwich bread.\nEurope.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAfter World War II, Newforge Foods, part of the Fitch Lovell group, was awarded the license to produce the product in the U.K. at its Belle Vale factory, Liverpool, where it stayed until production switched to the Danish Crown Group (owners of the Tulip Food Company) in 1998.\nThe United Kingdom has adapted Spam into various recipes, for example, sliced, battered and deep-fried into Spam fritters.\nIsrael.\n\"Loof\", a canned corned beef product often featured in Israeli Defense Forces rations, was popularly known as \"kosher Spam\", because it contains no pork.\nAsia.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, Spam (currently distributed by the Purefoods-Hormel Company Inc.) is a popular food item seen as a cultural symbol. Spam reached the islands similarly as it did other former US colonies such as Hawaii and Guam: as a result of World War II rationing. Spam is commonly eaten with rice (usually garlic fried rice) and a sunny-side-up egg for breakfast. It is prepared and used in a variety of ways, including being fried, caramelized, served with condiments, or in sandwiches. It has also been featured in numerous Filipino fusion cuisine dishes, including Spam burgers, Spam spaghetti, and Spam nuggets.\nThe popularity of Spam in the Philippines transcends economic class, and the canned product is even given during holidays. There are at least ten different varieties of Spam currently available in the country, and an estimated 1.25\u00a0million kilos of the meat is sold every year in the Philippines. Its popularity among Filipinos has led to the creation of a version with sugar and annatto\u2014Tocino-flavor Spam, made for the overseas Filipino market in the US and Canada. During the rescue efforts after Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) in 2009, Hormel Foods donated over 30,000\u00a0pounds of Spam to the Philippine National Red Cross.\nChina.\nIn mainland China, Hormel decided to adopt a different strategy to market Spam (), promoting it as a foreign, premium food product and changing the Spam formula to be meatier to accommodate local Chinese tastes. Spam-like canned pork products are also produced by other food companies in China as \"luncheon meat\" ().\nHong Kong.\nAfter World War II, meat was scarce and expensive in Hong Kong, so Spam was an accessible, affordable alternative. The luncheon meat has been incorporated into dishes such as macaroni with fried egg and Spam in chicken soup, egg and Spam sandwiches, and instant ramen. Nowadays, Spam remains a staple in Hong Kong\u2019s low to middle-income families.\nSouth Korea.\nSpam was exported to Korea post-World War II, whose population was on the brink of starvation. Spam returned to South Korea and was widely consumed during the Korean War. US soldiers deployed to South Korea used Spam as a means of trading for items, services, or information around their bases. Spam and other meats were smuggled out of US military installations for the local population. Its popularity led to the creation of the Spam \"kimbap\" (rice and vegetable filled seaweed roll) in Korean cuisine. Because of a scarcity of fish and other traditional kimbap products such as kimchi or fermented cabbage, Spam was added to a rice roll with kimchi and cucumber and wrapped in seaweed. Spam is also an original ingredient in \"budae jjigae\" (; lit.\u2009'army base stew'), a spicy stew with different types of preserved meat or kimchi.\nIn South Korea, Spam (Korean:\u00a0; RR:\u00a0, licensed from Hormel by CJ CheilJedang) is popular with a majority of the population. As of 2004[ [update]], South Korea produced and consumed more Spam than any other country except the United States. It is considered something of a luxury dish and is a common gift for Korean New Year combined with cooking oil and seasoning.\nJapan.\nIn Okinawa, Japan, the product is added into \"onigiri\" alongside eggs and used as a staple ingredient in the traditional Okinawan dish \"chanpur\u016b\", and a Spam burger is sold by local fast food chain Jef. For the 70th anniversary of Spam in 2007, cans with special designs were sold in Japan due to its popularity, primarily in Okinawa.\nFollowing the March 2011 earthquake, Spam sales in Japan declined, and Hormel shifted its focus to China, although Hormel did pledge to donate $100,000 along with cans of Spam for relief efforts.\nIn the summer of 2011, Burger King introduced its own version of a burger made of Spam, called 'BK Shot' Spam Burgers. These small burgers are filled with slices of the canned meat and were an attempt by Burger King to capitalize on Spam's popularity in Japan. In early 2014, Burger King also introduced the Spam and Cheese burger as a breakfast menu item.\nIn popular culture.\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Spam sponsored George Burns and Gracie Allen on their radio program.\nDuring World War II, Spam was not only eaten but was also incorporated into many other aspects of the war (grease for guns, cans for scrap metal, etc.); it was so prominent that Uncle Sam was nicknamed \"Uncle Spam\". Other terms influenced by the product's name include the European invasion fleet or the \"Spam Fleet\". Furthermore, the United Service Organizations (USO) toured the \"Spam Circuit\". In 1943, comedian Suzette Tarri appeared as the harassed waitress character \"Mrs Spam\" in the British film \"Somewhere in Civvies\".\nIn the United States in the aftermath of World War II, a troupe of former servicewomen was assembled by Hormel Foods to promote Spam from coast to coast. The group was known as the Hormel Girls and associated the food with patriotism. In 1948, two years after its formation, the troupe had grown to 60 women, with 16 forming an orchestra. The show became a radio program where the main selling point was Spam. The Hormel Girls were disbanded in 1953.\nSpam has long had a somewhat dubious reputation in the United States and (to a lesser degree) in the United Kingdom as a poverty food. The image of Spam as a low-cost meat product gave rise to the Scottish colloquial term \"Spam valley\" to describe certain affluent housing areas where residents have an outward appearance of wealth but, in private, may be living at poverty levels.\nMonty Python sketch and email spam.\nSpam was featured in an iconic 1970 Monty Python sketch titled \"Spam\", the concluding sketch of episode 12 of series 2 of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". Set in a greasy-spoon caf\u00e9, every dish on the menu contains Spam, such as \"egg and Spam\", \"egg bacon and Spam\", and \"Spam egg sausage and Spam\", but many dishes contain mostly Spam, such as \"Spam egg Spam Spam bacon and Spam\". A modified audio version of the sketch appeared on Monty Python's 1972 LP \"Another Monty Python Record\", and was also released as a 7\" single.\nThe sketch concluded with a chorus of Vikings boisterously singing a song \u2013 \"Lovely Spam, Wonderful Spam\", which, by the 1990s, led to \"Spam\" being adopted as a term for unsolicited electronic messages, especially spam email, because in the song, the repeated singing of the word \"Spam\" drowns out all other communication.\nBecause Spam was mentioned in a song in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", \"We dine well here in Camelot/We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot\", the title of the musical version of the film became \"Spamalot\".\nContinued cultural presence.\nSpam is the subject of the \"Weird Al\" Yankovic song \"Spam\", which is a parody of the R.E.M. song \"Stand\". Other offshoots of Spam in popular culture include a book of haikus about Spam titled \"Spam-Ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf\". There is also a mock Church of Spam and a Spam Cam, which is a webcam trained on a can of decaying Spam.\nIn 2017 the SPAM\u00ae brand team launched the boy band ALL4SPAM in the Philippines as part of a new advertisement campaign in the region.\nSpam is referred to in \"Island of the Sequined Love Nun\" by Christopher Moore, where SPAM is explained as \"Shaped Pork Approximating Man\", which was used to explain its popularity amongst Pacific island cannibals. In \"\", James May took a can of Spam to the magnetic North Pole and Jeremy Clarkson destroyed it with a shotgun.\nIntroduced in 2008's \"Fallout 3\" and seen in later entries to the franchise, a common foodstuff item called \"Cram\", a can of processed meat that serves as a parody of Spam, is used as a health regenerative item. The Pumpkin Spice Spam, introduced in September 2019, has gained the attention of the media and the public.\nSpam celebrations.\nSpam is celebrated in Austin, Minnesota, home to the Spam Museum. The museum tells the history of the Hormel company, the origin of Spam, and its place in world culture.\nAustin is also the location of the final judging in the national Spam recipe competition. Competing recipes are collected from winning submissions at the top 40 state fairs in the nation. The Spamettes are a quartet from Austin that only sing about Spam in parodies of popular songs. They first performed at the first Spam Jam in 1990 and continue to perform at various events.\nHawaii holds an annual Spam Jam in Waikiki during the last week of April. The small town of Shady Cove, Oregon, is home to the annual Spam Parade and Festival, with the city allocating US$1,500 for it.\nSpamarama was a yearly festival from 1978 to 2007 in Austin, Texas, which had a peak attendance of 14,000. The themed events included a Spam cook-off (to contrast with Texas chili cook-offs) and the Spamalymplics, including a \"Spam toss\" and a Spamburger (a 12-ounce portion on a bun) eating contest. The event returned in 2019.\nOn August 8, 2021, L&amp;L Hawaiian Barbecue established \"National SPAM Musubi Day\" to celebrate the iconic snack from Hawaii. The celebration also happened on August 8, 2022, and has since become an annual celebration.\nNutritional data.\nThe ingredients of Spam vary according to variety and market; those of variety \"Spam Classic\" are pork with ham, salt, water, modified potato starch, sugar, and sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrite is a common preservative used in highly processed meat products. Excessive consumption has been linked to many health issues.\nVarieties.\nThe official Spam website lists numerous different flavors of Spam products. Some varieties are permanent, but some others are limited time only. In addition to the variety of flavors, Spam is sold in tins smaller than the standard twelve-ounce (340 g) size. Spam Singles are also available, which are single sandwich-sized slices of Spam Classic or Lite, sealed in retort pouches.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28368", "revid": "22604547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28368", "title": "Spamming", "text": "Unsolicited electronic messages, especially advertisements\nSpamming is the use of messaging systems to send multiple unsolicited messages (spam) to large numbers of recipients for the purpose of commercial advertising, non-commercial proselytizing, or any prohibited purpose (especially phishing), or simply repeatedly sending the same message to the same user. While the most widely recognized form of spam is email spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs, wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, junk fax transmissions, social spam, spam mobile apps, television advertising and file sharing spam. It is named after Spam, a luncheon meat, by way of a Monty Python sketch about a restaurant that has Spam in almost every dish in which Vikings annoyingly sing \"Spam\" repeatedly.\nSpamming remains economically viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have added extra capacity to cope with the volume. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.\nA person who creates spam is called a \"spammer\".\nEtymology.\nThe term \"spam\" is derived from the 1970 \"Spam\" sketch of the BBC sketch comedy television series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". The sketch, set in a cafe, has a waitress reading out a menu where every item but one includes the Spam canned luncheon meat. As the waitress recites the Spam-filled menu, a chorus of Viking patrons drown out all conversations with a song, repeating \"Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam\u2026 Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!\".\nIn the 1980s the term was adopted to describe certain abusive users who frequented BBSs and MUDs, who would repeat \"Spam\" a huge number of times to scroll other users' text off the screen. In early chat-room services like PeopleLink and the early days of Online America (later known as America Online or AOL), they actually flooded the screen with quotes from the Monty Python sketch. This was used as a tactic by insiders of a group that wanted to drive newcomers out of the room so the usual conversation could continue. It was also used to prevent members of rival groups from chatting\u2014for instance, \"Star Wars\" fans often invaded \"Star Trek\" chat rooms, filling the space with blocks of text until the \"Star Trek\" fans left.\nIt later came to be used on Usenet to mean excessive multiple posting\u2014the repeated posting of the same message. The unwanted message would appear in many, if not all newsgroups, just as Spam appeared in all the menu items in the Monty Python sketch. One of the earliest people to use \"spam\" in this sense was Joel Furr. This use had also become established\u2014to \"spam\" Usenet was to flood newsgroups with junk messages. The word was also attributed to the flood of \"Make Money Fast\" messages that clogged many newsgroups during the 1990s. In 1998, the New Oxford Dictionary of English, which had previously only defined \"spam\" in relation to the trademarked food product, added a second definition to its entry for \"spam\": \"Irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent on the Internet to a large number of newsgroups or users.\"\nThere was also an effort to differentiate between types of newsgroup spam. Messages that were crossposted to too many newsgroups at once, as opposed to those that were posted too frequently, were called \"velveeta\" (after a cheese product), but this term did not persist.\nHistory.\nPre-Internet.\nIn the late 19th century, Western Union allowed telegraphic messages on its network to be sent to multiple destinations. The first recorded instance of a mass unsolicited commercial telegram is from May 1864, when some British politicians received an unsolicited telegram advertising a dentist.\nHistory.\nThe earliest documented spam (although the term had not yet been coined) was a message advertising the availability of a new model of Digital Equipment Corporation computers sent by Gary Thuerk to 393 recipients on ARPANET on May 3, 1978. Rather than send a separate message to each person, which was the standard practice at the time, he had an assistant, Carl Gartley, write a single mass email. Reaction from the net community was fiercely negative, but the spam did generate some sales.\nSpamming had been practiced as a prank by participants in multi-user dungeon games, to fill their rivals' accounts with unwanted electronic junk.\nThe first major commercial spam incident started on March 5, 1994, when a husband and wife team of lawyers, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, began using bulk Usenet posting to advertise immigration law services. The incident was commonly termed the \"Green Card spam\", after the subject line of the postings. Defiant in the face of widespread condemnation, the attorneys claimed their detractors were hypocrites or \"zealots\", claimed they had a free speech right to send unwanted commercial messages, and labeled their opponents \"anti-commerce radicals\". The couple wrote a controversial book entitled \"How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway\".\nAn early example of nonprofit fundraising bulk posting via Usenet also occurred in 1994 on behalf of CitiHope, an NGO attempting to raise funds to rescue children at risk during the Bosnian War. However, as it was a violation of their terms of service, the ISP Panix deleted all of the bulk posts from Usenet, only missing https://.\nWithin a few years, the focus of spamming (and anti-spam efforts) moved chiefly to email, where it remains today. By 1999, Khan C. Smith, a well known hacker at the time, had begun to commercialize the bulk email industry and rallied thousands into the business by building more friendly bulk email software and providing internet access illegally hacked from major ISPs such as Earthlink and Botnets.\nBy 2009 the majority of spam sent around the World was in the English language; spammers began using automatic translation services to send spam in other languages.\nIn different media.\nEmail.\nEmail spam, also known as unsolicited bulk email (UBE), or junk mail, is the practice of sending unwanted email messages, frequently with commercial content, in large quantities. Spam in email started to become a problem when the Internet was opened for commercial use in the mid-1990s. It grew exponentially over the following years, and by 2007 it constituted about 80% to 85% of all e-mail, by a conservative estimate. Pressure to make email spam illegal has resulted in legislation in some jurisdictions, but less so in others. The efforts taken by governing bodies, security systems and email service providers seem to be helping to reduce the volume of email spam. According to \"2014 Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 19\" published by Symantec Corporation, spam volume dropped to 66% of all email traffic.\nAn industry of email address harvesting is dedicated to collecting email addresses and selling compiled databases. Some of these address-harvesting approaches rely on users not reading the fine print of agreements, resulting in their agreeing to send messages indiscriminately to their contacts. This is a common approach in social networking spam such as that generated by the social networking site Quechup.\nInstant messaging.\nInstant messaging spam makes use of instant messaging systems. Although less prevalent than its e-mail counterpart, according to a report from Ferris Research, 500 million spam IMs were sent in 2003, twice the level of 2002.\nNewsgroup and forum.\nNewsgroup spam is a type of spam where the targets are Usenet newsgroups. Spamming of Usenet newsgroups actually pre-dates e-mail spam. Usenet convention defines spamming as excessive multiple posting, that is, the repeated posting of a message (or substantially similar messages). The prevalence of Usenet spam led to the development of the Breidbart Index as an objective measure of a message's \"spamminess\".\nForum spam is the creation of advertising messages on Internet forums. It is generally done by automated spambots. Most forum spam consists of links to external sites, with the dual goals of increasing search engine visibility in highly competitive areas such as weight loss, pharmaceuticals, gambling, pornography, real estate or loans, and generating more traffic for these commercial websites. Some of these links contain code to track the spambot's identity; if a sale goes through, the spammer behind the spambot earns a commission.\nMobile phone.\nMobile phone spam is directed at the text messaging service of a mobile phone. This can be especially irritating to customers not only for the inconvenience, but also because of the fee they may be charged per text message received in some markets.\nTo comply with CAN-SPAM regulations in the US, SMS messages now must provide options of HELP and STOP, the latter to end communication with the advertiser via SMS altogether.\nDespite the high number of phone users, there has not been so much phone spam, because there is a charge for sending SMS. Recently, there are also observations of mobile phone spam delivered via browser push notifications. These can be a result of allowing websites which are malicious or delivering malicious ads to send a user notifications.\nSocial networking spam.\nFacebook and Twitter are not immune to messages containing spam links. Spammers hack into accounts and send false links under the guise of a user's trusted contacts such as friends and family. As for Twitter, spammers gain credibility by following verified accounts such as that of Lady Gaga; when that account owner follows the spammer back, it legitimizes the spammer.\nTwitter has studied what interest structures allow their users to receive interesting tweets and avoid spam, despite the site using the broadcast model, in which all tweets from a user are broadcast to all followers of the user. Spammers, out of malicious intent, post either unwanted (or irrelevant) information or spread misinformation on social media platforms.\nSocial spam.\nSpreading beyond the centrally managed social networking platforms, user-generated content increasingly appears on business, government, and nonprofit websites worldwide. Fake accounts and comments planted by computers programmed to issue social spam can infiltrate these websites.\nBlog, wiki, and guestbook.\nBlog spam is spamming on weblogs. In 2003, this type of spam took advantage of the open nature of comments in the blogging software Movable Type by repeatedly placing comments to various blog posts that provided nothing more than a link to the spammer's commercial web site.\nSimilar attacks are often performed against wikis and guestbooks, both of which accept user contributions.\nAnother possible form of spam in blogs is the spamming of a certain tag on websites such as Tumblr.\nSpam targeting video sharing sites.\nIn actual video spam, the uploaded video is given a name and description with a popular figure or event that is likely to draw attention, or within the video a certain image is timed to come up as the video's thumbnail image to mislead the viewer, such as a still image from a feature film, purporting to be a part-by-part piece of a movie being pirated, e.g. \"Big Buck Bunny Full Movie Online - Part 1/10 HD\", a link to a supposed keygen, trainer, ISO file for a video game, or something similar. The actual content of the video ends up being totally unrelated, a Rickroll, offensive, or simply on-screen text of a link to the site being promoted. In some cases, the link in question may lead to an online survey site, a password-protected archive file with instructions leading to the aforementioned survey (though the survey, and the archive file itself, is worthless and does not contain the file in question at all), or in extreme cases, malware. Others may upload videos presented in an infomercial-like format selling their product which feature actors and paid testimonials, though the promoted product or service is of dubious quality and would likely not pass the scrutiny of a standards and practices department at a television station or cable network.\nVoIP spam.\nVoIP spam is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) spam, usually using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). This is nearly identical to telemarketing calls over traditional phone lines. When the user chooses to receive the spam call, a pre-recorded spam message or advertisement is usually played back. This is generally easier for the spammer as VoIP services are cheap and easy to anonymize over the Internet, and there are many options for sending mass number of calls from a single location. Accounts or IP addresses being used for VoIP spam can usually be identified by a large number of outgoing calls, low call completion and short call length.\nAcademic search.\nAcademic search engines enable researchers to find academic literature and are used to obtain citation data for calculating author-level metrics. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and OvGU demonstrated that most (web-based) academic search engines, especially Google Scholar are not capable of identifying spam attacks. The researchers manipulated the citation counts of articles, and managed to make Google Scholar index complete fake articles, some containing advertising.\nMobile apps.\nSpamming in mobile app stores include (i) apps that were automatically generated and as a result do not have any specific functionality or a meaningful description; (ii) multiple instances of the same app being published to obtain increased visibility in the app market; and (iii) apps that make excessive use of unrelated keywords to attract users through unintended searches.\nBluetooth.\nBluespam, or the action of sending spam to Bluetooth-enabled devices, is another form of spam that has developed in recent years.\nNoncommercial forms.\nE-mail and other forms of spamming have been used for purposes other than advertisements. Many early Usenet spams were religious or political. Serdar Argic, for instance, spammed Usenet with historical revisionist screeds. A number of evangelists have spammed Usenet and e-mail media with preaching messages. A growing number of criminals are also using spam to perpetrate various sorts of fraud.\nGeographical origins.\nIn 2011 the origins of spam were analyzed by Cisco Systems. They provided a report that shows spam volume originating from countries worldwide.\nTrademark issues.\nHormel Foods Corporation, the maker of SPAM luncheon meat, does not object to the Internet use of the term \"spamming\". However, they did ask that the capitalized word \"Spam\" be reserved to refer to their product and trademark.\nCost\u2013benefit analyses.\nThe European Union's Internal Market Commission estimated in 2001 that \"junk email\" cost Internet users \u20ac10 billion per year worldwide. The California legislature found that spam cost United States organizations alone more than $13 billion in 2007, including lost productivity and the additional equipment, software, and manpower needed to combat the problem. Spam's direct effects include the consumption of computer and network resources, and the cost in human time and attention of dismissing unwanted messages. Large companies who are frequent spam targets utilize numerous techniques to detect and prevent spam.\nThe cost to providers of search engines is significant: \"The secondary consequence of spamming is that search engine indexes are inundated with useless pages, increasing the cost of each processed query\". The costs of spam also include the collateral costs of the struggle between spammers and the administrators and users of the media threatened by spamming.\nEmail spam exemplifies a tragedy of the commons: spammers use resources (both physical and human), without bearing the entire cost of those resources. In fact, spammers commonly do not bear the cost at all. This raises the costs for everyone. In some ways spam is even a potential threat to the entire email system, as operated in the past. Since email is so cheap to send, a tiny number of spammers can saturate the Internet with junk mail. Although only a tiny percentage of their targets are motivated to purchase their products (or fall victim to their scams), the low cost may provide a sufficient conversion rate to keep the spamming alive. Furthermore, even though spam appears not to be economically viable as a way for a reputable company to do business, it suffices for professional spammers to convince a tiny proportion of gullible advertisers that it is viable for those spammers to stay in business. Finally, new spammers go into business every day, and the low costs allow a single spammer to do a lot of harm before finally realizing that the business is not profitable.\nSome companies and groups \"rank\" spammers; spammers who make the news are sometimes referred to by these rankings.\nGeneral costs.\nIn all cases listed above, including both commercial and non-commercial, \"spam happens\" because of a positive cost\u2013benefit analysis result; if the cost to recipients is excluded as an externality the spammer can avoid paying.\nCost is the combination of:\nBenefit is the total expected profit from spam, which may include any combination of the commercial and non-commercial reasons listed above. It is normally linear, based on the incremental benefit of reaching each additional spam recipient, combined with the conversion rate. The conversion rate for botnet-generated spam has recently been measured to be around one in 12,000,000 for pharmaceutical spam and one in 200,000 for infection sites as used by the Storm botnet. The authors of the study calculating those conversion rates noted, \"After 26 days, and almost 350 million e-mail messages, only 28 sales resulted.\"\nIn crime.\nSpam can be used to spread computer viruses, trojan horses, or other malicious software. The objective may be identity theft, or worse (e.g., advance fee fraud). Some spam attempts to capitalize on human greed, while some attempts to take advantage of the victims' inexperience with computer technology to trick them (e.g., phishing).\nOne of the world's most prolific spammers, Robert Alan Soloway, was arrested by US authorities on May 31, 2007. Described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, Soloway was charged with 35 criminal counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. Prosecutors allege that Soloway used millions of \"zombie\" computers to distribute spam during 2003. This is the first case in which US prosecutors used identity theft laws to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name.\nIn an attempt to assess potential legal and technical strategies for stopping illegal spam, a study cataloged three months of online spam data and researched website naming and hosting infrastructures. The study concluded that: 1) half of all spam programs have their domains and servers distributed over just eight percent or fewer of the total available hosting registrars and autonomous systems, with 80 percent of spam programs overall being distributed over just 20 percent of all registrars and autonomous systems; 2) of the 76 purchases for which the researchers received transaction information, there were only 13 distinct banks acting as credit card acquirers and only three banks provided the payment servicing for 95 percent of the spam-advertised goods in the study; and, 3) a \"financial blacklist\" of banking entities that do business with spammers would dramatically reduce monetization of unwanted e-mails. Moreover, this blacklist could be updated far more rapidly than spammers could acquire new banking resources, an asymmetry favoring anti-spam efforts.\nPolitical issues.\nAn ongoing concern expressed by parties such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union has to do with so-called \"stealth blocking\", a term for ISPs employing aggressive spam blocking without their users' knowledge. These groups' concern is that ISPs or technicians seeking to reduce spam-related costs may select tools that (either through error or design) also block non-spam e-mail from sites seen as \"spam-friendly\". Few object to the existence of these tools; it is their use in filtering the mail of users who are not informed of their use that draws fire.\nEven though it is possible in some jurisdictions to treat some spam as unlawful merely by applying existing laws against trespass and conversion, some laws specifically targeting spam have been proposed. In 2004, United States passed the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 that provided ISPs with tools to combat spam. This act allowed Yahoo! to successfully sue Eric Head who settled the lawsuit for several thousand U.S. dollars in June 2004. But the law is criticized by many for not being effective enough. Indeed, the law was supported by some spammers and organizations that support spamming, and opposed by many in the anti-spam community.\nCourt cases.\nUnited States.\nEarthlink won a $25 million judgment against one of the most notorious and active \"spammers\" Khan C. Smith in 2001 for his role in founding the modern spam industry which dealt billions in economic damage and established thousands of spammers into the industry. His email efforts were said to make up more than a third of all Internet email being sent from 1999 until 2002.\nSanford Wallace and Cyber Promotions were the target of a string of lawsuits, many of which were settled out of court, up through a 1998 Earthlink settlement that put Cyber Promotions out of business. Attorney Laurence Canter was disbarred by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1997 for sending prodigious amounts of spam advertising his immigration law practice. In 2005, Jason Smathers, a former America Online employee, pleaded guilty to charges of violating the CAN-SPAM Act. In 2003, he sold a list of approximately 93 million AOL subscriber e-mail addresses to Sean Dunaway who sold the list to spammers.\nIn 2007, Robert Soloway lost a case in a federal court against the operator of a small Oklahoma-based Internet service provider who accused him of spamming. U.S. Judge Ralph G. Thompson granted a motion by plaintiff Robert Braver for a default judgment and permanent injunction against him. The judgment includes a statutory damages award of about $10 million under Oklahoma law.\nIn June 2007, two men were convicted of eight counts stemming from sending millions of e-mail spam messages that included hardcore pornographic images. Jeffrey A. Kilbride, 41, of Venice, California was sentenced to six years in prison, and James R. Schaffer, 41, of Paradise Valley, Arizona, was sentenced to 63 months. In addition, the two were fined $100,000, ordered to pay $77,500 in restitution to AOL, and ordered to forfeit more than $1.1 million, the amount of illegal proceeds from their spamming operation. The charges included conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, and transportation of obscene materials. The trial, which began on June 5, was the first to include charges under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, according to a release from the Department of Justice. The specific law that prosecutors used under the CAN-Spam Act was designed to crack down on the transmission of pornography in spam.\nIn 2005, Scott J. Filary and Donald E. Townsend of Tampa, Florida were sued by Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist for violating the Florida Electronic Mail Communications Act. The two spammers were required to pay $50,000 USD to cover the costs of investigation by the state of Florida, and a $1.1 million penalty if spamming were to continue, the $50,000 was not paid, or the financial statements provided were found to be inaccurate. The spamming operation was successfully shut down.\nEdna Fiedler of Olympia, Washington, on June 25, 2008, pleaded guilty in a Tacoma court and was sentenced to two years imprisonment and five years of supervised release or probation in an Internet $1 million \"Nigerian check scam.\" She conspired to commit bank, wire and mail fraud, against US citizens, specifically using Internet by having had an accomplice who shipped counterfeit checks and money orders to her from Lagos, Nigeria, the previous November. Fiedler shipped out $609,000 fake check and money orders when arrested and prepared to send additional $1.1 million counterfeit materials. Also, the U.S. Postal Service recently intercepted counterfeit checks, lottery tickets and eBay overpayment schemes with a value of $2.1 billion.\nIn a 2009 opinion, \"Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc.\", 575 F.3d 1040, the Ninth Circuit assessed the standing requirements necessary for a private plaintiff to bring a civil cause of action against spam senders under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as well as the scope of the CAN-SPAM Act's federal preemption clause.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the first successful case of its kind, Nigel Roberts from the Channel Islands won \u00a3270 against Media Logistics UK who sent junk e-mails to his personal account.\nIn January 2007, a Sheriff Court in Scotland awarded Mr. Gordon Dick \u00a3750 (the then maximum sum that could be awarded in a Small Claim action) plus expenses of \u00a3618.66, a total of \u00a31368.66 against Transcom Internet Services Ltd. for breaching anti-spam laws. Transcom had been legally represented at earlier hearings, but were not represented at the proof, so Gordon Dick got his decree by default. It is the largest amount awarded in compensation in the United Kingdom since Roberts v Media Logistics case in 2005.\nDespite the statutory tort that is created by the Regulations implementing the EC Directive, few other people have followed their example. As the Courts engage in active case management, such cases would probably now be expected to be settled by mediation and payment of nominal damages.\nNew Zealand.\nIn October 2008, an international internet spam operation run from New Zealand was cited by American authorities as one of the world's largest, and for a time responsible for up to a third of all unwanted e-mails. In a statement the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) named Christchurch's Lance Atkinson as one of the principals of the operation. New Zealand's Internal Affairs announced it had lodged a $200,000 claim in the High Court against Atkinson and his brother Shane Atkinson and courier Roland Smits, after raids in Christchurch. This marked the first prosecution since the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act (UEMA) was passed in September 2007.\nThe FTC said it had received more than three million complaints about spam messages connected to this operation, and estimated that it may be responsible for sending billions of illegal spam messages. The US District Court froze the defendants' assets to preserve them for consumer redress pending trial.\nU.S. co-defendant Jody Smith forfeited more than $800,000 and faces up to five years in prison for charges to which he pleaded guilty.\nBulgaria.\nBulgaria permits unsolicited commercial messages (spam) provided that the messages are clearly marked as such, in accordance with the Bulgarian E-Commerce Act (ECA). Spam messages may not be sent to recipients who have opted out. When a user opts out, their email address is added to a public registry. Companies that send spam to addresses listed in this registry are subject to fines. In addition, the ECA prohibits sending spam from invalid addresses or when the sender's identity is concealed.\nThe legal framework has enabled the possibility of lawsuits against Bulgarian Internet service providers (ISPs) and public email services that implement anti-spam policies, as such policies may be interpreted as obstructing legitimate commercial activity, potentially violating Bulgarian antitrust legislation. Although no lawsuits had been filed as of the last update, several cases involving alleged interference with the delivery of commercial messages were reportedly under review by the Bulgarian Antitrust Commission (\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430).\nThe law also includes controversial provisions, such as the creation of a nationwide public electronic register of email addresses belonging to entities that do not wish to receive unsolicited messages. Critics have raised concerns that the register is susceptible to abuse, particularly as a source for e-mail address harvesting, since submitting false or inaccurate information to the register constitutes a criminal offense under Bulgarian law.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28370", "revid": "28804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28370", "title": "Siddur", "text": "Jewish prayerbook\nA siddur ( \"s\u012bdd\u016br\", ; plural siddurim ) is a Jewish prayer book containing a set order of daily prayers. The word comes from the Hebrew root &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e1\u05be\u05d3\u05be\u05e8\u200e, meaning 'order.'\nOther terms for prayer books are \"tefillot\" () among Sephardi Jews, \"tefillah\" among German Jews, and \"tikl\u0101l\" () among Yemenite Jews.\nHistory.\nThe earliest parts of Jewish prayer books are the \"Shema Yisrael\" (\"Hear O Israel\") (Deuteronomy 6:4 \"et seq\") and the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), which are in the Torah. A set of eighteen (currently nineteen) blessings called the \"Shemoneh Esreh\" or the \"Amidah\" (Hebrew, \"standing [prayer]\"), is traditionally ascribed to the Great Assembly in the time of Ezra, at the end of the biblical period.\nThe name \"Shemoneh Esreh\", literally \"eighteen\", is a historical anachronism, since it now contains nineteen blessings. It was only near the end of the Second Temple period that the eighteen prayers of the weekday Amidah became standardized. Even at that time their precise wording and order was not yet fixed, and varied from locale to locale. Many modern scholars believe that parts of the Amidah came from the Hebrew apocryphal work Ben Sira.\nAccording to the Talmud, soon after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem a formal version of the Amidah was adopted at a rabbinical council in Yavne, under the leadership of Gamaliel II and his colleagues. However, the precise wording was still left open. The order, general ideas, opening and closing lines were fixed. Most of the wording was left to the individual reader. It was not until several centuries later that the prayers began to be formally fixed. By the Middle Ages the texts of the prayers were nearly fixed, and in the form in which they are still used today, albe\u00eft with significant variations across communities.\nThe Siddur was printed by Soncino in Italy as early as 1486, though a Siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865. The Siddur began appearing in the vernacular as early as 1538. The first English translation was published in London in 1738 by an author writing under the pseudonym Gamaliel ben Pedahzur; a different translation was released in the United States in 1837.\nCreation.\nReadings from the Torah (five books of Moses) and the Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") form part of the prayer services. To this framework various Jewish sages added, from time to time, various prayers, and, for festivals especially, numerous hymns.\nThe earliest existing codification of the prayerbook was drawn up by Amram ben Sheshna of Sura Academy in Sawad, the Abbasid Caliphate, an area known as \"Babylonia\" in Jewish texts, about 850 CE (\"Seder Rav \u02bfAmram\"). Half a century later, Saadia Gaon, also of Sura, composed a siddur (see Siddur of Saadia Gaon), in which the rubrical matter is in Judeo-Arabic. These were the basis of Simhah ben Samuel of Vitry's 11th century \"Machzor Vitry\", which was based on the ideas of his teacher, Rashi. Another formulation of the prayers was that appended by Maimonides to the Book of Love in his \"Mishneh Torah\": this forms the basis of the Yemenite liturgy, and has had some influence on other rites. From this point forward all Jewish prayerbooks had the same basic order and contents.\nTwo authoritative versions of the Ashkenazi siddur were those of Shabbetai Sofer in the 16th century and Seligman Baer in the 19th century; siddurim have also been published reflecting the views of Jacob Emden and the Vilna Gaon.\nDifferent Jewish rites.\nThere are differences among, amongst others, the Sephardic (including Spanish and Portuguese and Mizrachim), Teimani (Yemenite), Hasidic, Ashkenazic (divided into German, Polish and other European and eastern-European rites), Ben\u00e9 Roma or Italkim, Romaniote (Greek, once extending to Turkey, Crimea and the southern Italian peninsula) and also Persian, Kurdish, Bukharian, Georgian, Mountain Jewish, Ethiopian and Cochin-Jewish liturgies. Most of these are slight differences in the wording of the prayers; for instance, Oriental Sephardic and some Hasidic prayer books state \"\u05d7\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d0\u05ea\u05da \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\", \"Graciously bestow upon us from You wisdom (\"\u1e25ochmah\"), understanding (\"binah\") and knowledge (\"daat\")\", in allusion to the Kabbalistic sefirot of those names, while the Nusach Ashkenaz, as well as Western Sephardic and other Hasidic versions retain the older wording \"\u05d7\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d0\u05ea\u05da \u05d3\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e9\u05db\u05dc\", \"Graciously bestow upon us from You knowledge, understanding, and reason\". In some cases, however, the order of the preparation for the Amidah is drastically different, reflecting the different halakhic and kabbalistic formulae that the various scholars relied on in assembling their prayer books, as well as the minhagim, or customs, or their locales.\nSome forms of the Sephardic rite are considered to be very overtly kabbalistic, depending on how far they reflect the ritual of Isaac Luria (see Lurianic Kabbalah). This is partly because the Tetragrammaton frequently appears with varying vowel points beneath the letters (unpronounced, but to be meditated upon) and different Names of God appear in small print within the final hei (\u05d4) of the Tetragrammaton. In some editions, there is a Psalm in the preparations for the Amidah that is printed in the outline of a menorah, and the worshipper meditates on this shape as he recites the psalm.\nWhile the Ashkenazic rite does contain some kabbalistic elements, such as acrostics and allusions to the sefirot (\"To You, God, is the greatness [gedullah], and the might [gevurah], and the glory [tiferet], longevity [netzach]...\" etc.), these are not easily seen unless the reader is already initiated. It is notable that although many other traditions avoid using the poem Anim Zemiroth on the Sabbath, for fear that its holiness would be less appreciated due to the frequency of the Sabbath, the poem is usually sung by Ashkenazi congregations before concluding the Sabbath Musaf service with the daily psalm. The ark is opened for the duration of the song.\nHasidim, though usually ethnically Ashkenazi, usually use liturgies with varying degrees of Sephardic influence, such as Nusach Sefard and Nusach Ari, in order to follow the order of the prayers set by Rabbi Isaac Luria, often called \"Ari HaKadosh\", or \"The Holy Lion\". Although the Ari himself was born Ashkenazi, he borrowed many elements from Sephardi and other traditions, since he felt that they followed Kabbalah and Halacha more faithfully. The Ari did not publish any siddur, but orally transmitted his particular usages to his students with interpretations and certain meditations. Many siddurim containing some form of the Sephardic rite together with the usages of the Ari were published, both by actual Sephardic communities and for the use of Hasidim and other Ashkenazim interested in Kabbalah. In 1803, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi compiled an authoritative siddur from the sixty siddurim that he checked for compliance with Hebrew grammar, Jewish law, and Kabbalah: some call this siddur \"Nusach Ari\", and is used by Lubavitch Hasidim. Those that use Nusach HaAri claim that it is an all-encompassing nusach that is valid for any Jew, no matter what his ancestral tribe or identity, a view attributed to the Maggid of Mezeritch.\nThe Mahzor of each rite is distinguished by hymns (\"piyyutim\"). The most important writers are Jose ben Jose, probably in the 4th-5th century CE, chiefly known for his compositions for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; Yannai; Eleazar Kalir, the founder of the payyetanic style, perhaps in the 7th century; Saadia Gaon; the Spanish school, consisting of Joseph ibn Abitur (died in 970), ibn Gabirol, Isaac Gayyath, Moses ibn Ezra, Abraham ibn Ezra and Judah ha-Levi, Moses ben Nahman (Nahmanides) and Isaac Luria; and the Ashkenazic and French schools including Shimon bar Yitzchak, Meir bar Yitzchak and many others.\nThe Ari recited only early piyyutim, such as those by Eleazar Kalir, but did not like the Sephardic piyyutim. Therefore, on holidays he would daven (recite the prescribed liturgical prayers) with Ashkenazim\u2014as opposed to his practice the rest of the year to daven with Sephardim\u2014in order to recite their piyyutim, which include many more earlier piyyutim. For this reason, many Hasidim (such Belz and Viznitz) recite many piyyutim on Yom Tov and the sabbaths of the four special portions preceding Passover in accordance with the practice of the Ari. However, in Sephardic communities which accepted most of the practices of the Ari, they never accepted the Ashkenazic piyyutim.\nComplete and weekday siddurim.\nSome siddurim have only prayers for weekdays; others have prayers for weekdays and Shabbat. Many have prayers for weekdays, Shabbat, and the three Biblical festivals, Sukkot (the feast of Tabernacles), Shavuot (the feast of weeks) and Pesach (Passover). The latter are referred to as a \"Siddur Shalem\" (\"complete siddur\").\nPopular siddurim.\nBelow are listed many popular siddurim used by religious Jews. This list mostly excludes prayer books specifically for the High Holidays; see Machzor (Popular versions).\nSephardic.\nIsrael and diaspora.\nIsraeli, following Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.\nThese siddurim follow the halakha of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (1920\u20132013) a Talmudic scholar, and authority on Jewish religious law, and spiritual leader of Israel's ultra-orthodox Shas party. Yosef believed that the Sephardic halakhic tradition favoured leniency, and these principles are reflected in his siddurim.\nplease note, these siddurim are also for the Edot Ha-mizrach communities.\nSephardic Women's Siddur.\nSome notable editions are:\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews.\n\"(Characterised by relative absence of Kabbalistic elements:)\"\nGreek, Turkish and Balkan Sephardim.\n\"(Usually characterised by presence of Kabbalistic elements:)\"\nNorth African Jews.\n\"(Usually characterised by presence of Kabbalistic elements, except for the Moroccan siddurim which generally contain fewer Kabbalistic elements:)\"\nMiddle Eastern Mizrachim (Sephardim).\n\"(Usually characterised by presence of Kabbalistic elements:)\"\nYemenite Jews (Teimanim).\nBaladi.\nThe Baladi Jews (from Arabic \"balad\", country) follow the legal rulings of the \"Rambam\" (Maimonides) as codified in his work the \"Mishneh Torah\". Rabbi Yi\u1e25ye Tsala\u1e25 (Maharits) revised this liturgy to end friction between traditionalists (who followed Rambam's rulings and the siddur as it developed in Yemen) and Kabbalists who followed the innovations of the Ari. This prayer book makes very few additions or changes and substantially follows the older Yemenite tradition as it had existed prior to this conflict.\nShami.\nThe Shami Jews (from Arabic \"ash-Sham\", the north, referring to Palestine or Damascus) represent those who accepted the Sephardic rite, after being exposed to new inexpensive, typeset prayer books brought from Israel and the Sephardic diaspora by envoys and merchants in the late 17th century and 18th century. The \"local rabbinic leadership resisted the new versions...Nevertheless, the new prayer books were widely accepted.\" As part of that process, the Shami modified their rites to accommodate the usages of the Ari to the maximum extent. The text of the Shami siddur now largely follows the Sephardic tradition, though the pronunciation, chant and customs are still Yemenite in flavour.\nProgressive and Reform Judaism.\nAll of the following are published by the Central Conference of American Rabbis:\nReconstructionist Judaism.\nPrayer books edited by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan and others:\nKol Haneshamah Prayerbook series, ed. David Teutsch:\nFeminist siddurim.\n\"Siddur Nashim\", by Margaret Wenig and Naomi Janowitz in 1976, was the first Jewish prayer book to refer to God using female pronouns and imagery.\nReconstructionist Rabbi Rebecca Alpert (\"Reform Judaism\", Winter 1991) commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The experience of praying with \"Siddur Nashim\"... transformed my relationship with God. For the first time, I understood what it meant to be made in God's image. To think of God as a woman like myself, to see Her as both powerful and nurturing, to see Her imaged with a woman's body, with womb, with breasts \u2013 this was an experience of ultimate significance. Was this the relationship that men have had with God for all these millennia? How wonderful to gain access to those feelings and perceptions.\nFollowing in the footsteps of feminist prayerbooks, liberal prayerbooks tend increasingly to avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the UK Liberal movement's \"Siddur Lev Chadash\" (1995) does so, as does the UK Reform Movement's \"Forms of Prayer\" (2008). In Mishkan T'filah, the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as \"He\" have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah).\nHumanistic and atheist siddurim.\nYoreh writes about his work: \"I think prayer is communal and private expression of hopes, fears, an appreciation of aesthetic beauty, good attributes. But that has nothing to do with God.\"\nOther siddurim.\nThere are also some Karaite, Samaritan and Sabbatean prayer books.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago formed by the Santorini caldera. It is the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately and a 2021 census population of 15,480. The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi, Anydros, and Christiana. The total land area is . Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit.\nSantorini is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. The volcanic arc is approximately long and wide. The region first became volcanically active around 3\u20134 million years ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri. One of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history struck the island about 3,600 years ago, leaving a large water-filled caldera surrounded by deep volcanic ash deposits.\nNames.\nThe name \"Santorini\" is a contraction of Saint Irene, after an old church in the village of Perissa. \nOf Venetian influence, the island bore the name Santorini since at least the middle of the twelfth century, the first mention being made by the geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi c.\u20091154;\nDuring antiquity it was known as \"Th\u0113ra\" and before then, according to ancient writers, as \"Kall\u00edst\u0113\" (, \"the most beautiful one\"), and \u2014 according to a modern tradition \u2014 as \"Strong\u00fdl\u0113\" (, \"the circular one\"). The ancient name \"Thera\", for Theras, the leader of the Spartans who colonized and gave his name to the island, was revived in the nineteenth century as the official name of the island and its main city, but the colloquial \"Santorini\" is still in popular use.\nHistory.\nMinoan Akrotiri.\nThe island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan eruption, sometimes called the Thera eruption, which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization. The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep. It has been suggested that the colossal Santorini volcanic eruption is the source of the legend of the lost civilisation of Atlantis. The eruption lasted for weeks and caused massive tsunami waves.\nThe region first became volcanically active around 3\u20134 million years ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri.\nExcavations starting in 1967 at the Akrotiri site under Spyridon Marinatos have made Thera (not known by this name at the time) the best-known Minoan site outside Crete, homeland of the culture. Only the southern tip of a large town has been uncovered, yet it has revealed complexes of multi-level buildings, streets, and squares with remains of walls standing as high as eight metres, all entombed in the solidified ash of the famous eruption of Thera. The site was not a palace-complex as found in Crete nor was it a conglomeration of merchant warehousing. Its excellent masonry and fine wall-paintings reveal a complex community. A loom-workshop suggests organized textile weaving for export. This Bronze Age civilization thrived between 3000 and 2000\u00a0BC, reaching its peak in the period between 2000 and 1630\u00a0BC.\nMany of the houses in Akrotiri are major structures, some of them three storeys high. Its streets, squares, and walls, sometimes as tall as eight metres, indicated that this was a major town; much is preserved in the layers of ejecta. The houses contain huge ceramic storage jars (pithoi), mills, and pottery, and many stone staircases are still intact. Noted archaeological remains found in Akrotiri are wall paintings or frescoes that have kept their original colour well, as they were preserved under many metres of volcanic ash. Judging from the fine artwork, its people were sophisticated and relatively wealthy. Among more complete frescoes found in one house are two antelopes painted with a confident calligraphic line, a man holding fish strung by their gills, a flotilla of pleasure boats that are accompanied by leaping dolphins, and a scene of women sitting in the shade of light canopies. Fragmentary wall-paintings found at one site are Minoan frescoes that depict \"saffron-gatherers\" offering crocus-stamens to a seated woman, perhaps a goddess important to the Akrotiri culture. The themes of the Akrotiri frescoes show no relationship to the typical content of the Classical Greek d\u00e9cor of 510 BC to 323 BC that depicts the Greek pantheon deities.\nThe town also had a highly developed drainage system. Pipes with running water and water closets found at Akrotiri are the oldest such utilities discovered. The pipes run in twin systems, indicating that Therans used both hot and cold water supplies. The origin of the hot water they circulated in the town probably was geothermal, given the volcano's proximity.\nThe well preserved ruins of the ancient town are often compared to the spectacular ruins at Pompeii in Italy. The canopy covering the ruins collapsed in September 2005, killing one tourist and injuring seven; the site was closed until April 2012 while a new canopy was built.\nThe oldest signs of human settlement are Late Neolithic (4th millennium BC or earlier), but c. 2000\u20131650\u00a0BC Akrotiri developed into one of the Aegean's major Bronze Age ports, with recovered objects that came not just from Crete, but also from Anatolia, Cyprus, Syria, and Egypt, as well as from the Dodecanese and the Greek mainland.\nDating of the Bronze Age eruption.\nThe Minoan eruption provides a fixed point for the chronology of the second millennium BC in the Aegean, because evidence of the eruption occurs throughout the region and the site itself contains material culture from outside. The eruption occurred during the \"Late Minoan\u00a0IA\" period of Minoan chronology at Crete and the \"Late Cycladic\u00a0I\" period in the surrounding islands.\nArchaeological evidence, based on an established chronology of Bronze Age Mediterranean cultures, dated the eruption to around 1500\u00a0BC. These dates, however, conflict with radiocarbon dating which indicated that the eruption occurred between 1645\u20131600\u00a0BC, and tree ring data which yielded a date of 1628 BC. For those, and other reasons, the previous culturally based chronology has generally been questioned.\nIn \"The Parting of the Sea: How Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Plagues Shaped the Exodus Story\", geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen theorizes a causal link between this eruption and the plagues of the Exodus.\nAncient period.\nSantorini remained unoccupied throughout the rest of the Bronze Age, during which time the Greeks took over Crete. At Knossos, in a LMIIIA context (14th century BC), seven Linear B texts while calling upon \"all the deities\" make sure to grant primacy to an elsewhere-unattested entity called \"qe-ra-si-ja\" and, once, \"qe-ra-si-jo\". If the endings \"-ia[s]\" and \"-ios\" represent an ethnic suffix, then this means \"The One From Qeras[os]\". If the initial consonant were aspirated, then *Qhera- would have become \"Thera-\" in later Greek. \"Therasia\" and its ethnikon \"Therasios\" are both attested in later Greek; and, since \"-sos\" was itself a genitive suffix in the Aegean Sprachbund, *Qeras[os] could also shrink to *Qera. If \"qe-ra-si-ja\" was an ethnikon first, then in following the entity the Cretans also feared whence it came.\nProbably after what is called the Bronze Age collapse, Phoenicians founded a site on Thera. Herodotus reports that they called the island Callista and lived on it for eight generations. In the ninth century BC, Dorians founded the main Hellenic city on Mesa Vouno, above sea level. This group later claimed that they had named the city and the island after their leader, Theras. Today, that city is referred to as Ancient Thera.\nIn his \"Argonautica\", written in Hellenistic Egypt in the third century BC, Apollonius Rhodius includes an origin and sovereignty myth of Thera being given by Triton in Libya to the Greek Argonaut Euphemus, son of Poseidon, in the form of a clod of dirt. After carrying the dirt next to his heart for several days, Euphemus dreamt that he nursed the dirt with milk from his breast, and that the dirt turned into a beautiful woman with whom he had sex. The woman then told him that she was a daughter of Triton named Calliste, and that when he threw the dirt into the sea it would grow into an island for his descendants to live on. The poem goes on to claim that the island was named Thera after Euphemus' descendant Theras, son of Autesion, the leader of a group of refugee settlers from Lemnos.\nThe Dorians have left a number of inscriptions incised in stone, in the vicinity of the temple of Apollo, attesting to pederastic relations between the authors and their lovers (eromenoi). These inscriptions, found by , have been thought by some archaeologists to be of a ritual, celebratory nature, because of their large size, careful construction and\u00a0\u2013 in some cases\u00a0\u2013 execution by craftsmen other than the authors. According to Herodotus, following a drought of seven years, Thera sent out colonists who founded a number of cities in northern Africa, including Cyrene. In the fifth century BC, Dorian Thera did not join the Delian League with Athens; and during the Peloponnesian War, Thera sided with Dorian Sparta, against Athens. The Athenians took the island during the war, but lost it again after the Battle of Aegospotami. During the Hellenistic period, the island was a major naval base for Ptolemaic Egypt.\nMedieval and Ottoman period.\nAs with other Greek territories, Thera then was ruled by the Romans. When the Roman Empire was divided, the island passed to the eastern side of the Empire which today is known as the Byzantine Empire. According to George Cedrenus, the volcano erupted again in the summer of 727, the tenth year of the reign of Leo III the Isaurian. He writes: \"In the same year, in the summer, a vapour like an oven's fire boiled up for days out of the middle of the islands of Thera and Therasia from the depths of the sea, and the whole place burned like fire, little by little thickening and turning to stone, and the air seemed to be a fiery torch.\" This terrifying explosion was interpreted as a divine omen against the worship of religious icons and gave the emperor Leo III the Isaurian the justification he needed to begin implementing his Iconoclasm policy.\nThe name \"Santorini\" first appears c.\u20091153\u20131154 in the work of the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi, as \"Santurin\", from the island's patron saint, Saint Irene of Thessalonica. After the Fourth Crusade, it was occupied by the Duchy of Naxos which held it up to circa 1280 when it was reconquered by Licario (the claims of earlier historians that the island had been held by Jacopo I Barozzi and his son as a fief have been refuted in the second half of the twentieth century); it was again reconquered from the Byzantines circa 1301 by Iacopo II Barozzi, a member of the Cretan branch of the Venetian Barozzi family, whose descendant held it until it was annexed to Venice in c.\u20091335 by Niccolo Sanudo after various legal and military conflicts. In 1318\u20131331 and 1345\u20131360 it was raided by the Turkish principalities of Menteshe and Ayd\u0131n, but did not suffer much damage. Because of the Venetians the island became home to a sizable Catholic community and is still the seat of a Catholic bishopric.\nFrom the 15th century on, the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice over the island was recognized in a series of treaties by the Ottoman Empire, but this did not stop Ottoman raids, until it was captured by the Ottoman admiral Piyale Pasha in 1576, as part of a process of annexation of most remaining Latin possessions in the Aegean. It became part of the semi-autonomous domain of the sultan's Jewish favourite, Joseph Nasi. Santorini retained its privileged position in the 17th century, but suffered in turn from Venetian raids during the frequent Ottoman\u2013Venetian wars of the period, even though there were no Muslims on the island.\nSantorini was captured briefly by the Russians under Alexey Orlov during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774, but returned to Ottoman control after.\n19th century.\nIn 1807, the islanders were forced by the Sublime Porte to send 50 sailors to Mykonos to serve in the Ottoman navy.\nIn 1810, Santorini with 32 ships possessed the seventh largest of the Greek fleet after Kefallinia (118), Hydra (120), Psara (60), Ithaca (38) Spetsai (60) and Skopelos (35).\nDuring the last years of Ottoman rule, the majority of residents were farmers and seafarers who exported their abundant produce, while the level of education was improving on the island, with the Monastery of Profitis Ilias being one of the most important monastic centres in the Cyclades.\nIn 1821, the island was home to 13,235 inhabitants, which within a year had risen to 15,428.\nGreek War of Independence.\nAs part of its plans to foment a revolt against the Ottoman Empire and gain Greek Independence, Alexandros Ypsilantis, the head of the Filiki Eteria in early 1821, dispatched Dimitrios Themelis from Patmos and Evangelis Matzarakis ( \u20131824), a sea captain from Kefalonia who had Santorini connections to establish a network of supporters in the Cyclades. As his authority, Matzarakis had a letter from Ypsilantis (dated 29 December 1820) addressed to the notables of Santorini and the Orthodox metropolitan bishop Zacharias Kyriakos (served 1814\u20131842). At the time, the population of Santorini was divided between those who supported independence, and (particularly among the Catholics and non-Orthodox) those who were ambivalent or distrustful of a revolt being directed by Hydra and Spetses or were fearful of the sultan's revenge. While the island didn't come out in direct support of the revolt, 71 sailors, a priest and the presbyter Nikolaos Dekazas, to serve on the Spetsiote fleet.\nBecause of the lack of majority support for direct participation in the revolt, it was necessary for Matzarakis to enlist the aid of Kefalonians living in Santorini to, on 5 May 1821 (the feast day of the patron saint of the island), raise the flag of the revolution and then expel the Ottoman officials from the island. The Provisional Administration of Greece organized the Aegean islands into six provinces, one of which was Santorini and appointed Matzarakis its governor in April 1822. While he was able to raise a large amount of money (double that collected on Naxos), he was soon found to lack the diplomatic skills needed to convince the islanders who had enjoyed considerable autonomy to now accept direction from a central authority and contribute tax revenue to it. He claimed to his superiors that the islanders needed \"political re-education\" as they did not understand why they had to pay higher taxes than those levied under the Ottomans in order to support the struggle for independence. The hostility against the taxes caused many of the tax collectors to resign.\nThings were also not helped by the governor's authoritarian character, arbitrariness and arrests of prominent islanders losing him the support of Zacharias Kyriakos, who had initially supported Matzarakis. In retaliation Matzarakis accused him of being a \"Turkophile\" and had the archbishop imprisoned and then exiled him. The abbots of the monasteries, the priests and the prelates, complained to Demetrios Ypsilantis, president of the National Assembly.\nMatzarakis soon had to hire bodyguards as the island descended into open revolt against him. Fearful for his life Matzarakis later fled the island, and was dismissed from his governorship by Demetrios Ypsilantis. Mazarakis however later represented Santorini in the National Assembly and following his death was succeeded in that position in November 1824 by Pantoleon Augerino.\nOnce they heard of massacres of the Greek population of Chios in April 1822, many islanders became fearful of Ottoman reprisals, with two villages stating they were prepared to surrender, though sixteen monks from the Monastery of Profitis Ilias, led by their abbot Gerasimos Mavrommatis declared in writing their support for the revolt. Four commissioners for the Aegean islands (among them, Benjamin of Lesvos and Konstantinos Metaxas) appointed by the Provisional Administration of Greece arrived in July 1822 to investigate the issues on Santorini. The commissioners were uncompromising in their support for Matzarakis. With news from Chios fresh in their minds the island's notables eventually arrested Metaxas, with the intention of handing him over to the Ottomans in order to prove their loyalty. He was rescued by his Ionian guards.\nMatters became so heated that Antonios Barbarigos ( \u20131824) who had been serving in the First National Assembly at Epidaurus since 20 January 1820 was seriously wounded in the head by a knife attack on Santorini in October 1822 during a dispute between the factions. In early 1823, the Second National Assembly at Astros, imposed a contribution of 90,000 grosis on Santorini to fund the fight for independence, while in 1836 they also had to contribute in 1826 to the obligatory loan of 190,000 grosis imposed on the Cyclades.\nIn decree 573 issued by the National Assembly 17 May 1823, Santorini was recognized as one of 15 provinces in the Greek controlled Aegean (nine in the Cyclades and six in the Sporades).\nThe island became part of the fledgling Greek state under the London Protocol of 3 February 1830, rebelled against the government of Ioannis Kapodistrias in 1831, and became definitively part of the independent Kingdom of Greece in 1832, with the Treaty of Constantinople.\nSantorini joined an insurrection that had broken out in Nafplio on 1 February 1862 against the rule of King Otto of Greece. However, the royal authorities was able to quickly restore control and the revolt had been suppressed by 20 March of that year. However, the unrest arose again later in the year which lead to the 23 October 1862 Revolution and the overthrow of King Otto.\nWorld War II.\nDuring the Second World War, Santorini was occupied in 1941 by Italian forces and then by the Germans following the Italian armistice in 1943. In 1944, the German garrison on Santorini was raided by a group of British Special Boat Service Commandos, killing most of its men. Five locals were later shot in reprisal, including the mayor.\nPost-war.\nIn general, the island's economy continued to decline following World War II, with a number of factories closing as a lot of industrial activity relocated to Athens. In an attempt to improve the local economy, the Union of Santorini Cooperatives was established 1947 to process, export and promote the islands agriculture products, in particular its wine. In 1952, they constructed near the village of Monolithos what is today the island's only remaining tomato processing factory. The island's tourism in the early 1950s generally took the form of small numbers of wealthy tourists on yacht cruises though the Aegean. The island's children would present arriving passengers with flowers and bid them happy sailing by lighting small lanterns along the steps from Fira down to the port, offering them a beautiful farewell spectacle. Once such visitor was the actress Olivia de Havilland, who visited the island in September 1955 at the invitation of Petros Nomikos.\nIn the early 1950s, the shipping magnate Evangelos P. Nomikos and his wife Loula decided to support their birthplace and so asked residents to choose whether they wanted the couple to pay for the construction of either a hotel or a hospital, to which local authorities replied that they would prefer a hotel. \nIn 1954, Santorini had approximately 12,000 inhabitants and very few visitors. The only modes of transport on the island were a jeep, a small bus and the island's traditional donkeys and mules.\n1956 earthquake.\nAt 05:11 local time (CEST, 03:11 UTC) on 9 July 1956, the 1956 Amorgos earthquake (magnitude\u00a0\u2013 depending on the particular study\u00a0\u2013 of 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 or 7.8) struck south of the island of Amorgos, about from Santorini. It was the largest earthquake of the 20th century in Greece and also had a devastating impact on Santorini. It was followed by aftershocks, the most significant being the first occurring at 05:24, 13 minutes after the main shock, which had a 7.2 magnitude. This aftershock which originated close to the island of Anafi is believed to have been responsible for most of the damage and casualties on Santorini. The earthquake was accompanied by a tsunami which, while much higher at other islands, is estimated to have reached 3 metres at Perissa and 2 metres at Vlichada on Santorini.\nImmediately following the earthquake, the Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis declared Santorini a state of \"large-scale local disaster\" and visited the island to inspect the situation on 14 July.\nMany countries had offered to send relief efforts, though Greece refused to accept the offer of the United Kingdom to send warships to help from Cyprus where they were involved in the Cyprus Emergency.\nAs there was no airport, the Greek military made air drops of food, tents and supplies and camps for homeless people were established on the outskirts of Fira.\nOn Santorini, the earthquakes killed 53 people and injured another 100. 35% of the island's houses collapsed and 45% suffered major or minor damage. In total, 529 houses were destroyed, 1,482 were severely damaged and 1,750 lightly damaged. Almost all public buildings were completely destroyed. One of the largest buildings that survived unscathed was the newly built Hotel Atlantis, which allowed it to be used as a temporary hospital and to house public services. The greatest damage was experienced on the Western side along the edge of the caldera, especially at Oia, with parts of the ground collapsing into the sea. The damage from the earthquake reduced most of the population to extreme poverty and caused many to leave the island in search of better opportunities, with most settling in Athens.\n2025 earthquakes.\nSantorini experienced a major earthquake swarm in February 2025. Hundreds of tremors occurred in the Aegean Sea, to the north-east of the island, some measuring up to magnitude 5. The earthquake sequence began on about 27th January, and intensified after 1 February 2025. As the earthquakes continued, there was a precautionary evacuation of Santorini by sea and by air.\nDuring the weekend of 1 and 2 February, more than 200 undersea tremors were detected. The epicenters were primarily in a growing cluster between the islands of Santorini, Anafi, Amorgos, Ios and the uninhabited islet of Anydros. Many of the earthquakes registered magnitudes above 4.5 on the Moment magnitude scale. The strongest earthquake of the swarm occurred on 10 February, and measured . At the time of the crisis, experts explained that they considered the earthquakes to be tectonic rather than volcanic in nature, but the pattern and frequency of seismic activity prompted significant concern among scientists and authorities. Seismologist Manolis Skordylis indicated on public radio that a seismic fault line had been activated with potential to cause an earthquake exceeding magnitude 6.0.\nGreek authorities implemented several emergency measures, which included the deployment of emergency crews and a 26-member rescue team with a rescue dog to the region. Schools were closed on Santorini, Anafi, Amorgos, and Ios. Access to areas near cliffs was restricted due to increased risk of landslides. In Fira, several gathering points for evacuation were established. Access to shorelines and certain ports, including Santorini's old port, was restricted due to tsunami risk, with residents instructed to move inland.\nGreece's Minister of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Vasilis Kikilias emphasized the precautionary nature of the response. Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who spoke while in Brussels, called for calm while acknowledging the intensity of the earthquake swarm. Hotels were told to drain their swimming pools to minimize potential earthquake damage to structures. Aegean Airlines doubled its flight frequency between Athens and Santorini for a two-day period to carry out evacuations. Ferry companies increased their service frequency in response to surging demand, resulting in long queues forming at evacuation ports. Around 6,000 residents left the island by ferry beginning on 2 February, while up to 2,700 left by air from 3 to 4 February. The South Aegean Regional Fire Department was placed on general alert. A state of emergency was declared in Santorini by the Greek government on 6 February. \nIn Turkey, the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) and the Mineral Research and Exploration General Directorate (MTA) warned that the earthquakes could lead to volcanic activity around the Kolumbo submarine volcano off Santorini.\nThe earthquakes began to decline in intensity and number after mid-February, and the seismic crisis ended in late February. The state of emergency was lifted on 3rd March. Later analysis of the observations of earthquakes and ground deformation by scientists pointed to the potential involvement of a deep intrusion of magma in causing the events.\nTourism.\nThe expansion of tourism in recent years has resulted in the growth of the economy and population.&lt;ref name=\"FE 2024/07/22\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Santorini was ranked the world's top island by many magazines and travel sites, including the \"Travel+Leisure Magazine\", the \"BBC\", as well as the \"US News\". An estimated 2 million tourists visit annually. Santorini has been emphasising sustainable development and the promotion of special forms of tourism, the organization of major events such as conferences and sport activities.\nThe island's pumice quarries have been closed since 1986, in order to preserve the caldera. In 2007, the cruise ship \"MS Sea Diamond\" ran aground and sank inside the caldera. As of 2019, Santorini is popular with Asian couples who come to the island to have pre-wedding photos taken against the backdrop of the landscape.\nGeography.\nGeological setting.\nThe Cyclades are part of a metamorphic complex that is known as the Cycladic Massif. The complex formed during the Miocene and was folded and metamorphosed during the Alpine orogeny around 60 million years ago. Thera is built upon a small non-volcanic basement that represents the former non-volcanic island, which was approximately . The basement rock is primarily composed of metamorphosed limestone and schist, which date from the Alpine Orogeny. These non-volcanic rocks are exposed at Mikros Profititis Ilias, Mesa Vouno, the Gavrillos ridge, Pyrgos, Monolithos, and the inner side of the caldera wall between Cape Plaka and Athinios.\nThe metamorphic grade is a blueschist facies, which results from tectonic deformation by the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate. Subduction occurred between the Oligocene and the Miocene, and the metamorphic grade represents the southernmost extent of the Cycladic blueschist belt.\nVolcanism.\nVolcanism on Santorini is due to the Hellenic subduction zone southwest of Crete. The oceanic crust of the northern margin of the African Plate is being subducted under Greece and the Aegean Sea, which is thinned continental crust. The subduction compels the formation of the Hellenic arc, which includes Santorini and other volcanic centres, such as Methana, Milos, and Kos.\nThe island is the result of repeated sequences of shield volcano construction followed by caldera collapse. The inner coast around the caldera is a sheer precipice of more than drop at its highest, and exhibits the various layers of solidified lava on top of each other, and the main towns perched on the crest. The ground then slopes outwards and downwards towards the outer perimeter, and the outer beaches are smooth and shallow. Beach sand colour depends on which geological layer is exposed; there are beaches with sand or pebbles made of solidified lava of various colours: such as the Red Beach, the Black Beach and the White Beach. The water at the darker coloured beaches is significantly warmer because the lava acts as a heat absorber.\nThe area of Santorini incorporates a group of islands created by volcanoes, spanning across Thera, Thirasia, Aspronisi, Palea, and Nea Kameni.\nSantorini has erupted many times, with varying degrees of explosivity. There have been at least twelve large explosive eruptions, of which at least four were caldera-forming. The most famous eruption is the Minoan eruption, detailed below. Eruptive products range from basalt all the way to rhyolite, and the rhyolitic products are associated with the most explosive eruptions.\nThe earliest eruptions, many of which were submarine, were on the Akrotiri Peninsula, and active between 650,000 and 550,000 years ago. These are geochemically distinct from the later volcanism, as they contain amphiboles.\nOver the past 360,000 years there have been two major cycles, each culminating with two caldera-forming eruptions. The cycles end when the magma evolves to a rhyolitic composition, causing the most explosive eruptions. In between the caldera-forming eruptions are a series of sub-cycles. Lava flows and small explosive eruptions build up cones, which are thought to impede the flow of magma to the surface. This allows the formation of large magma chambers, in which the magma can evolve to more silicic compositions. Once this happens, a large explosive eruption destroys the cone. The Kameni islands in the centre of the lagoon are the most recent example of a cone built by this volcano, with much of them hidden beneath the water.\nMinoan eruption.\nDuring the Bronze Age, Santorini was the site of the Minoan eruption, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history. It was centred on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the caldera; the caldera itself was formed several hundred thousand years ago by the collapse of the centre of a circular island, caused by the emptying of the magma chamber during an eruption. It has been filled several times by ignimbrite since then, and the process repeated itself, most recently 21,000 years ago. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcano, then collapsed once more during the Minoan eruption. Before the Minoan eruption, the caldera formed a nearly continuous ring with the only entrance between the islet of Aspronisi and Thera; the eruption destroyed the sections of the ring between Aspronisi and Therasia, and between Therasia and Thera, creating two new channels.\nOn Santorini, a deposit of white tephra thrown from the eruption is up to thick, overlying the soil marking the ground level before the eruption, and forming a layer divided into three fairly distinct bands indicating different phases of the eruption. Archaeological discoveries in 2006 by a team of international scientists revealed that the Santorini event was much more massive than previously thought; it expelled of magma and rock into the Earth's atmosphere, compared to previous estimates of only in 1991, producing an estimated of tephra. Only the Mount Tambora volcanic eruption of 1815, the 181 AD eruption of the Taupo Volcano, and possibly Baekdu Mountain's 946 AD eruption have released more material into the atmosphere during the past 5,000 years.\nThe Minoan eruption has been considered as possible inspiration for ancient stories including Atlantis and the Exodus. The content of the stories is not supported by current archaeological research, but remain popular in pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology.\nPost-Minoan volcanism.\nPost-Minoan eruptive activity is concentrated on the Kameni islands, in the centre of the lagoon. They have been formed since the Minoan eruption, and the first of them broke the surface of the sea in 197\u00a0BC. Nine subaerial eruptions are recorded in the historical record since that time, with the most recent ending in 1950.\nIn 1707, an undersea volcano breached the sea surface, forming the current centre of activity at Nea Kameni in the centre of the lagoon, and eruptions centred on it continue \u2013 the twentieth century saw three such, the last in 1950. Santorini was also struck by a devastating earthquake in 1956. Although the volcano is dormant at the present time, at the current active crater (there are several former craters on Nea Kameni), steam and carbon dioxide are emitted.\nSmall tremors and reports of strange gaseous odours over the course of 2011 and 2012 prompted satellite radar technological analyses and these revealed the source of the symptoms; the magma chamber under the volcano was swollen by a rush of molten rock by 10 to 20 million cubic metres between January 2011 and April 2012, which also caused parts of the island's surface to rise out of the water by a reported 8 to 14 centimetres. Scientists say that the injection of molten rock was equivalent to 20 years' worth of regular activity.\nAt the beginning of February 2025, there were hundreds of minor earthquakes up to magnitude 5 near Santorini, mostly in an area around the tiny islet of Anydros, north-east of Santorini. About 9,000 people left the island out of a population of 15,500 in the face of seismic activity that could last weeks. The tremors were attributed to tectonic plate movements rather than volcanic activity.\nClimate.\nAccording to the National Observatory of Athens Santorini has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"BSh\") with Mediterranean (\"Csa\") characteristics, such as the dry summers and the relatively wetter winters. It has an average annual precipitation of around and an average annual temperature of around .\nEconomy.\nSantorini's primary industry is tourism, particularly in the summer months. Agriculture also forms part of its economy, and the island sustains a wine industry. The economic life of Santorini before 1960, when the flow of foreign visitors to the island for tourist purposes gradually began, was based on crops and trade.\nAgriculture.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Santorini had great commercial activity with foreign countries and especially with Russia, where it exported all of its wine production. Because of its unique ecology and climate \u2013 and especially its volcanic ash soil \u2013 Santorini is home to unique and prized produce such as the Santorini cherry tomato.\nViticulture, whose history goes back to prehistoric times, could not remain unaffected by the rapid increase in tourism, where there was a gradual decrease. Viticulture is the most important sector of agricultural production in Santorini.\nWine industry.\nThe island remains the home of a small wine industry, based on the indigenous Assyrtiko grape variety, with auxiliary cultivations of Aegean white varieties such as \"Athiri\" and \"Aidani\" and the red varieties such as Mavrotragano and Mandilaria. The vines are extremely old and resistant to phylloxera (attributed by local winemakers to the well-drained volcanic soil and its chemistry), so the vines needed no replacement during the great phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century. In their adaptation to their habitat, such vines are planted far apart, as their principal source of moisture is dew, and they often are trained in the shape of low-spiralling baskets, with the grapes hanging inside to protect them from the winds.\nThe viticultural pride of the island is the sweet and strong \"Vinsanto\" (), a dessert wine made from the best sun-dried \"Assyrtiko\", \"Athiri\", and \"Aidani\" grapes, and undergoing long barrel aging (up to twenty or twenty-five years for the top \"cuv\u00e9es\"). It matures to a sweet, dark, amber-orange unctuous dessert wine that has achieved worldwide fame, possessing the standard Assyrtiko aromas of citrus and minerals, layered with overtones of nuts, raisins, figs, honey, and tea.\nWhite wines from the island are extremely dry with a strong citrus scent and mineral and iodide salt aromas contributed by the ashy volcanic soil, whereas barrel aging gives to some of the white wines a slight frankincense aroma, much like Vinsanto. It is not easy to be a winegrower in Santorini; the hot and dry conditions give the soil a very low productivity. The yield per hectare is only 10 to 20% of the yields that are common in France or California. The island's wines are standardised and protected by the \"Vinsanto\" and \"Santorini\" OPAP designations of origin.\nBrewing.\nA brewery, the Santorini Brewing Company, began operating out of Santorini in 2011, based in the island's wine region.\nGovernance.\nThe present municipality of Thera (officially: \"Thira\", ), which covers all settlements on the islands of Santorini and Therasia, was formed at the 2011 local government reform, by the merger of the former Oia and Thera municipalities.\nOia is now called a (community), within the municipality of Thera, and it consists of the local subdivisions () of Therasia and Oia.\nThe municipality of Thera includes an additional 12 local subdivisions on Santorini island: Akrotiri, Emporio, Episkopis Gonia, Exo Gonia, Imerovigli, Karterados, Megalohori, Mesaria, Pyrgos Kallistis, Thera (the seat of the municipality), Vothon, and Vourvoulos.\nTowns and villages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAttractions.\nArchitecture.\nThe traditional architecture of Santorini is similar to that of the other Cyclades, with low-lying cubical houses, made of local stone and whitewashed or limewashed with various volcanic ashes used as colours. These colours, in recent years, tend to replace white in the colour of house fa\u00e7ades, according to the traditional architecture of the island as it was developed until the great earthquake of 1956. The unique characteristic is the common use of the \"hyp\u00f3skapha\": extensions of houses dug sideways or downwards into the surrounding pumice. These rooms are prized because of the high insulation provided by the air-filled pumice, and are used as living quarters of unique coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter. These are premium storage space for produce, especially for wine cellaring: the \"K\u00e1nava\" wineries of Santorini.\nWhen strong earthquakes struck the island in 1956, half the buildings were completely destroyed and a large number suffered repairable damage. The underground dwellings along the ridge overlooking the caldera, where the instability of the soil was responsible for the great extent of the damage, needed to be evacuated. Most of the population of Santorini had to emigrate to Piraeus and Athens.\nFortifications.\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, the Cyclades were under threat from pirates who plundered the harvests, enslaved men and women and sold them in the slave markets. The small bays of the island were also ideal as hideouts. In response the islanders built their settlements at the highest, most inaccessible points, and very close to, or on top of, each other; while their external walls, devoid of openings, formed a protective perimeter around the village. In addition the following additional types of fortifications were built throughout the island to protect the island's inhabitants.\nInfrastructure.\nElectricity.\nElectricity for both Santorini and Therasia is principally supplied from the Thira Autonomous Power Station which is located at Monolithos in the eastern part of Santorini. Owned by Public Power Corporation (PPC) it has generators powered by diesel engines and gas turbines. The two islands have a total installed capacity of 75.09 MW of thermal generation and 0.25 MW of renewable generation. There is a programme underway at a cost of \u20ac124 million as part of the Cyclades Interconnection Project to connect the island via a submarine cable to Naxos and hence by extension to the mainland system by 2023.\nA fire at the power station in Monolithos on 13 August 2018 put it out of service, resulting in a total loss of electricity supply across the two islands. Within four days electricity had been restored to all but 10% of the islands' consumers. Vessels were dispatched to carry two power generators to assist in supporting the restoration of the electricity supply.\nElectricity is distributed around the island by The Hellenic Electricity Distribution System Operator (HEDNO S.A. or DEDDIE S.A.) which is a 100% owned subsidiary of PPC. A cable connects the Thirasia and Santorini electrical distribution systems.\nTransportation.\nThe central bus station is in Fira, the capital of the island, where buses depart very frequently. They cover routes to almost all places around the island and to most tourist spots.\nApart from its connection with other Cyclades islands, Santorini is also connected by ferry with Piraeus on a daily basis all year long, with up to 5 direct crossings during summer.\nAirport.\nSantorini is one of the few Cyclades Islands with a major airport, which lies about southeast of downtown Thera. The main asphalt runway (16L-34R) is in length, and the parallel taxiway was built to runway specification (16R-34L). It can accommodate Boeing 757, Boeing 737, Airbus A320 series, Avro RJ, Fokker 70, and ATR 72 aircraft. Scheduled airlines include the new Olympic Air, Aegean Airlines, Ryanair, and Sky Express, with flights chartered from other airlines during the summer, and with transport to and from the air terminal available through buses, taxis, hotel car-pickups, and hire cars.\nLand.\nBus services link Fira to most parts of the island.\nPorts.\nSantorini has two ports: Athinios (Ferry Port) and Skala (Old Port). Cruise ships anchor off Skala and passengers are transferred by local boatmen to shore at Skala where Fira is accessed by cable car, on foot or by donkeys and mules. The use of donkeys for tourist transportation has attracted significant criticism from animal rights organisations for animal abuse and neglect, including failure to provide the donkeys with sufficient water or rest. Tour boats depart from Skala for Nea Kameni and other Santorini destinations. \nWater and sewerage.\nAs the island lies in a rain shadow between the mountains of Crete and the Peloponnese water seems to have been scarce at least from post-eruption times. This, combined with the small size of the island, the lack of rivers, and the nature of the soil, which is largely composed of volcanic ash, as well as the high summer temperatures meant that there was very little surface water. With only one spring (Zoodochos Pigi \u2013 the Life-giving Spring) this encouraged the practice of diverting any rain that fell on roofs and courtyards to elaborate underground cisterns, supplemented in the 20th century with water imported from other areas of Greece. Owing to the lack of water islanders developed non-irrigated crops such as vines and olives that could survive on only the scant moisture provided by the common early-morning fog condensing on the ground as dew.\nMany cisterns ceased to be used following the 1956 earthquake. As tourism increased, the existing rainwater harvesting methods proved incapable of supplying the increased demand. As a result, it has become necessary to construct desalination plants which now provide running but non-potable water to most residents. This has led to many of the historic cisterns falling into disrepair.\nThe first desalination plant was built at Oia following a donation in 1992 by the Oia-born businessman Aristeidis Alafouzos. By 2003 the plant had expanded to house three desalination units (of which two had been donated by Alafouzos). As of 2020 the plant has six desalination units with a total capacity of per day.\nIn addition to Oia there are currently desalination plants at Aghia Paraskevi, located on the southwest side of the airport with a capacity of per day which supplies Kamari, Vothonas, Messaria, Exo Gonia, Mesa Gonia, Agia Paraskevi, and Monolithos; Fira with a capacity of per day; Akrotiri (also known as the Cape) which has two units with a total capacity of per day; Exo Gialos which has two units with a total capacity of per day which supplies Fira, Imerovigli, Karteradou, Pyrgos, Megalochori and Vourvoulou; and Therasia which has two TEMAK units with a total capacity of per day.\nThere are also a number of small autonomous drinking water production units with a capacity of per day located at Kamari, Emporio, Messaria and Thirasia Island.\nThe provision of water supply and sewage treatment and disposal on both Santorini and Therasia Islands is undertaken by the municipally owned DEYA Thiras. It was founded in May 2011, after the merging of the Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Thera (DEYA Thera) and the Community Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Oia (). Known as DEYATH it is responsible for the planning, construction, management, operation and maintenance of the water supply system (desalination plants and pumping wells), irrigation, drainage, and the wastewater collection networks and treatment plants for the islands of Thira (Santorini) and Therasia. The Loulas and Evangelos Nomikos Foundation has funded a number of projects aimed at improving the water supply and sewage systems on the islands.\nIn popular culture.\nThe movie \"Summer Lovers\" (1982) was filmed on location here.\nThe island was a featured filming location in the 2005 film \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" and its sequel.\nSantorini inspired French pop singer-songwriter Nolwenn Leroy for her song \"Myst\u00e8re\", released on her 2005 album \"Histoires Naturelles\" (\"Aux criques de Santorin\").\nAustralian Singer-songwriter Donny Ben\u00e9t wrote a single called \"Santorini\", released as part of his 2018 album \"The Don\".\nThe Santorini Film Festival is held annually at the open-air cinema, Cinema Kamari, in Santorini.\nAmerican hip hop musician Rick Ross has a song titled \"Santorini Greece\", and its 2017 music video was shot on the island.\nSantorini appears in 2014's \"Call of Duty Advanced Warfare\" during the mission Manhunt. The player tracks down a target before chasing that target through the streets.\nThe 2018 video game \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey\" features a DLC extra entitled \"Fate of Atlantis\", in which a gateway to the mythical lost city of Atlantis is located in a temple beneath the island of Thera.\nThe board game \"Santorini\", inspired by the architecture of the island's cliffside villages, was published in 2004 by Gordon Hamilton.\nThe K-Pop girl group ARTMS had an official photoshoot in Santorini for their 2024 Season's greetings. \nIn the film \"The Parting of the Sea: How Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Plagues Shaped the Exodus Story\", geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen seeks to establish a link between the eruption of Santorini (c. 1600 BC) and the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt in the Bible.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was headquartered in New York City, and had offices in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Atlanta. The firm also operated a mortgage finance company and registered investment adviser based in Memphis.\nOverview.\nSandler O'Neill provided investment banking services to financial institutions and their investors. Its services include merger and acquisition advisory, capital markets, fixed income sales and trading, and equity sales and trading, equity research, balance sheet management, mortgage finance, and consulting services. The firm publishes research on about 300 financial institutions across the United States. \nDespite shifts in the way similar Wall Street firms are run, Sandler O'Neill retained its private partnership structure and was the largest private investment bank dedicated to the financial sector. It ranked among the top advisers on bank and thrift mergers as well as in capital raising.\nIn 2019, the company was acquired by Piper Jaffray and renamed Piper Sandler Companies. The combined company is headquartered in Minneapolis.\nHistory.\nSandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. was founded in 1988 by Herman S. Sandler, Thomas O\u2019Neill and four other executives from the firm Bear Stearns. Though today it serves companies of all sizes, the firm was founded with an emphasis on community and mid-size banks, as its founders saw that smaller financial institutions were underserved by the existing advisement system.\nSix months after the foundation of the firm, Christopher Quackenbush left Merrill Lynch to build Sandler's investment banking group. \nTwo years after Sandler's establishment it formed Sandler O'Neill Mortgage Finance, an affiliate of Sandler O'Neill + Partners. The affiliate is currently headquartered in Memphis but maintains an office in New York City separate from the firm's headquarters.\nIn 1993, the company moved to Two World Trade Center (South Tower) from Two Wall Street. The same year, Sandler O'Neill opened an equity sales and trading division. The following year, the firm began publishing equity research, focusing on community banks and other financial institutions.\nSandler O'Neill had four satellite offices in addition to its main office in New York City. The first was opened in Boston in 1998. Offices in Atlanta and San Francisco were opened in 2003. A final satellite office was opened in 2004 in Chicago.\nThe firm ranked among the best performing investment banking firms, advising financial firms on strategic and financial initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions and capital raising. It is one of the last privately held investment banks on Wall Street, after other firms went public, including Goldman Sachs in the early 2000s. In 2010, the firm sold a substantial minority to two private equity firms: the Carlyle Group and Kelso &amp; Company. The firm was led by James J. Dunne III, who left Bear Stearns in 1988 to help found Sandler, and Jonathan Doyle, who joined the firm in 1990. Both served as senior managing principals of the firm. Sandler O'Neill celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013.\nIn 2019, the company was acquired by Piper Jaffray, forming Piper Sandler Companies.\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nOn September 11, 2001, the firm, which was headquartered on the 104th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center, lost 68 of its 171 employees, 40 percent of its overall workforce. One third of the firm's partners, almost the entire equity desk, the entire syndicate desk, and all of the firm's bond traders died during the attack. Among those lost were Herman Sandler and Christopher Quackenbush, two of the three senior executives who managed the firm. Welles Crowther, an equities trader for the firm now known as \"The Man in the Red Bandana,\" also died during the attack. In addition to personnel, the company lost its entire computer system and nearly all of its records in the destruction.\nOn September 19, three days after the U.S. financial markets reopened, Dunne said on CNBC that Sandler O'Neill was open for business, having restarted operations as early as September 12. After the attacks, the firm operated temporarily out of the Solow Building, in space provided by Bank of America. In early 2002, Sandler O'Neill moved from the Solow Building to 919 Third Avenue. The firm remained in that building until another move in 2012.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, he was a pioneer in the theory and practice of montage. He is noted in particular for his silent films \"Strike\" (1925), \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) and \"\" (1928), as well as the historical epics \"Alexander Nevsky\" (1938) and \"Ivan the Terrible\" (1945/1958). In its decennial poll, the magazine \"Sight and Sound\" named his \"Battleship Potemkin\" the 54th-greatest film of all time.\nEarly life.\nSergei Eisenstein was born on 22 January\u00a0[O.S. 10 January]\u00a01898 in Riga, in the Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire (present-day Latvia), to a middle-class family. His family moved frequently in his early years, as Eisenstein continued to do throughout his life. His father, the architect Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein, was born in the Kiev Governorate, to a Jewish merchant father, Osip, and a Swedish mother.\nSergei Eisenstein's father had converted to the Russian Orthodox Church, while his mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, came from a Russian Orthodox family. She was the daughter of a prosperous merchant. Julia left Riga in the year of the 1905 Russian Revolution, taking Sergei with her to Saint Petersburg. Her son would return at times to see his father, who joined them around 1910. Divorce followed, and Julia left the family to live in France. Eisenstein was raised as an Orthodox Christian but later became an atheist. Among the films that influenced Eisenstein as a child was \"The Consequences of Feminism\" (1906) by the first female filmmaker Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9.\nEducation.\nAt the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering, Eisenstein studied architecture and engineering, the profession of his father. In 1918, he left school and joined the Red Army to participate in the Russian Civil War, although his father Mikhail supported the opposite side. This brought his father to Germany after the defeat of the anti-Bolshevik forces, and Sergei to Petrograd, Vologda, and Dvinsk. In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in Minsk, after success in providing propaganda for the October Revolution. At this time, he was exposed to Kabuki theatre and studied Japanese, learning some 300 kanji characters, which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development.\nCareer.\nFrom theatre to cinema.\nEisenstein moved to Moscow in 1920 and began his career in theatre working for Proletkult, an experimental Soviet artistic institution which aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms and create a revolutionary working-class aesthetic. His productions there were entitled \"Gas Masks\", \"Listen Moscow\", and \"Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man\". He worked as a designer for Vsevolod Meyerhold. Eisenstein began his career as a theorist in 1923 by writing \"The Montage of Attractions\" for art journal \"LEF\". His first film, \"Glumov's Diary\" (for the theatre production \"Wise Man\"), was also made in that same year with Dziga Vertov hired initially as an instructor.\n\"Strike\" ( Stachka, 1925) was Eisenstein's first full-length feature film. \"Battleship Potemkin\" (also 1925) was critically acclaimed worldwide. Mostly owing to this international renown, he was then able to direct \"\", as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917. While critics outside Soviet Russia praised his work, Eisenstein's focus in the films on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements, and montage brought him and like-minded others such as Vsevolod Pudovkin and Alexander Dovzhenko under fire from the Soviet film community. Eisenstein, however, once again could not refrain his ironic humour. This forced him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of socialist realism.\nTravels to western Europe.\nIn the autumn of 1928, with \"October\" still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. Officially, the trip was supposed to allow the three to learn about sound motion pictures and to present themselves as Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Z\u00fcrich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Tisse, entitled \"Frauennot \u2013 Frauengl\u00fcck\".\nAmerican projects.\nIn late April 1930, film producer Jesse L. Lasky, on behalf of Paramount Pictures, offered Eisenstein the opportunity to make a film in the United States. He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 ($1,500,000 in 2017 dollars) and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930, along with Aleksandrov and Tisse. Eisenstein proposed a biography of arms dealer Basil Zaharoff and a film version of \"Arms and the Man\" by George Bernard Shaw, and more fully developed plans for a film of \"Sutter's Gold\" by Blaise Cendrars, but on all accounts failed to impress the studio's producers. Paramount proposed a film version of Theodore Dreiser's \"An American Tragedy\". This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930, but Paramount disliked it and, additionally, they found themselves attacked by Major Pease, president of the Hollywood Technical Director's Institute. Pease, a strident anti-communist, mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, by \"mutual consent\", Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void, and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramount's expense.\nEisenstein was faced with being seen a failure in the USSR. The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him; in addition, his films, techniques and theories, such as his formalist film theory, were becoming increasingly attacked as \"ideological failures\". Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as \"Eisenstein on Disney\", have surfaced decades later.\nEisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with Charlie Chaplin, who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor, the American socialist author Upton Sinclair. Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR and were known to Eisenstein. The two admired each other, and between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisenstein's absences from the USSR and permission for him to travel to Mexico. Eisenstein had long been fascinated by Mexico and had wanted to make a film about the country. As a result of their discussions with Eisenstein and his colleagues, Sinclair, his wife Mary, and three other investors organized as the \"Mexican Film Trust\" to contract the three Russians to make a film about Mexico of Eisenstein's design.\nMexican odyssey.\nOn 24 November 1930, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust \"upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity.\" The contract stipulated that the film would be \"non-political\", that immediately available funding came from Mary Sinclair in an amount of \"not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars\", that the shooting schedule amounted to \"a period of from three to four months\", and most importantly that: \"Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair...\" A codicil to the contract allowed that the \"Soviet Government may have the [finished] film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R.\" Reportedly, it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour's duration.\nBy 4 December, Eisenstein was traveling to Mexico by train, accompanied by Aleksandrov and Tisse, and also by Mrs. Sinclair's brother, Hunter Kimbrough, a banker with no prior experience in motion picture work, who was to serve as production supervisor. At their departure Eisenstein had not yet determined a direction or subject for his film, and only several months later produced a brief outline of a six-part film; this, he promised, would be developed, in one form or another, into a final plan he would settle on for his project. The title for the project, , was decided on some time later still. While in Mexico, he mixed socially with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera; Eisenstein admired these artists and Mexican culture in general, and they inspired him to call his films \"moving frescoes\". The left-wing U.S. film community eagerly followed his progress within Mexico, as is chronicled within Chris Robe's book \"Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture\".\nFilming was not accomplished in the 3\u20134 months agreed to in Eisenstein's contract, however, and the Trust was running out of money; and his prolonged absence from the USSR led Joseph Stalin to send a telegram to Sinclair expressing the concern that Eisenstein had become a deserter. Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along to act as a line producer, for the film's problems. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin so that Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. Unable to raise further funds, and under pressure from both the Soviet government and the majority of the Trust, Sinclair shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot; estimates of the extent of this range from 170,000 lineal feet with \"Soldadera\" unfilmed, to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet. For the unfinished filming of the \"novel\" of \"Soldadera\", without incurring any cost, Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army.\nWhen Kimbrough arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings by Eisenstein of Jesus caricatures amongst other lewd pornographic material, which Eisenstein had added to his luggage without Kimbrough's knowledge. His re-entry visa had expired, and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Aleksandrov, and Tisse were allowed, after a month's stay at the U.S.-Mexico border outside Laredo, Texas, a 30-day \"pass\" to get from Texas to New York and thence depart for Moscow, while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film.\nEisenstein toured the American South instead of going directly to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of Sol Lesser, who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative \u2014 at the Trust's expense \u2014 and distribute any resulting product. Two short feature films and a short subject\u2014\"Thunder Over Mexico,\" based on the \"Maguey\" footage; \"Eisenstein in Mexico;\" and \"Death Day,\" respectively\u2014were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934. Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer, Marie Seton, called \"Time in the Sun\", released in 1940. He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project. In 1978, Gregori Aleksandrov released \u2013 with the same name in contravention to the copyright \u2013 his own version, which was awarded the Honorable Golden Prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979. Later, in 1998, Oleg Kovalov edited a free version of the film, calling it \"Mexican Fantasy\".\nReturn to the Soviet Union.\nEisenstein's failure in Mexico took a toll on his mental health. He spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933, ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage. He was subsequently assigned a teaching position at the State Institute of Cinematography where he had taught earlier, and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing the curriculum.\nIn 1935, Eisenstein was assigned another project, \"Bezhin Meadow\", but it appears the film was afflicted with many of the same problems as \"\u00a1Que viva M\u00e9xico!\". Eisenstein unilaterally decided to film two versions of the scenario, one for adult viewers and one for children; failed to define a clear shooting schedule; and shot film prodigiously, resulting in cost overruns and missed deadlines. Boris Shumyatsky, the \"de facto\" head of the Soviet film industry, called a halt to the filming and cancelled further production. What appeared to save Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the \"Bezhin Meadow\" catastrophe, along with several other problems facing the industry at that point, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him. Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of Shumyatsky, who in early 1938 was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot.\nComeback.\nEisenstein was able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for 'one more chance', and he chose, from two offerings, the assignment of a biopic of \"Alexander Nevsky\" and his victory at the Battle of the Ice, with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev. This time, he was assigned a co-scenarist, Pyotr Pavlenko, to bring in a completed script; professional actors to play the roles; and an assistant director, Dmitri Vasilyev, to expedite shooting.\nThe result was a film critically well received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It was an allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany. The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian proverbs, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions. This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented Eisenstein's first film in nearly a decade and his first sound film.\nEisenstein returned to teaching, and was assigned to direct Richard Wagner's \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" at the Bolshoi Theatre. After the outbreak of war with Germany in 1941, \"Alexander Nevsky\" was re-released with a wide distribution and earned international success. With the war approaching Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma-Ata, where he first considered the idea of making a film about Tsar Ivan IV. Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma-Ata, and was joined by him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed the score for Eisenstein's film \"Ivan the Terrible\" and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of \"War and Peace\" that Prokofiev was developing.\nIvan trilogy.\nEisenstein's film \"Ivan the Terrible, Part I\", presenting Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero, won Stalin's approval (and a Stalin Prize), but the sequel, \"Ivan the Terrible, Part II\", was criticized by various authorities and went unreleased until 1958. All footage from \"Ivan the Terrible, Part III\" was confiscated by the Soviet authorities whilst the film was still incomplete, and most of it was destroyed, though several filmed scenes exist.\nPersonal life.\nThere have been debates about Eisenstein's sexuality, with a film covering Eisenstein's homosexuality running into difficulties in Russia.\nAlmost all of his contemporaries believed that Eisenstein was gay. During a 1925 interview, Aleksandrov witnessed Eisenstein tell the Polish journalist Wac\u0142aw Solski, \"I'm not interested in girls\" and burst out laughing, then quickly stopped and turned red with embarrassment. Recalling the incident, Solski wrote \"Not until later, when I learned what everyone in Moscow knew, did Aleksandrov's odd behaviour become understandable.\" Upton Sinclair came to the same conclusion after the discovery of Eisenstein's pornographic drawings by customs officials. He later told Marie Seton: \"All his associates were Trotskyites, and all homos ... Men of that sort stick together.\"\nSeven months after homosexuality became a criminal offence once more, Eisenstein married filmmaker and screenwriter Pera Attacheva (Pera Atasheva, \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0442\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430, born Pearl Moiseyevna Fogelman; 1900 \u2013 24 September 1965). Aleksandrov married Orlova during that same year.\nEisenstein denied his homosexuality to his close friend Marie Seton: \"Those who say that I am homosexual are wrong. I have never noticed and do not notice this. If I was homosexual I would say so, directly. But the whole point is that I have never experienced a homosexual attraction, even towards Grisha, despite the fact I have some bisexual tendency in the intellectual dimension like, for example, Balzac or Zola.\"\nDeath.\nEisenstein suffered a heart attack on 2 February 1946, and spent much of the following year recovering. He died of a second heart attack on 11 February 1948, at the age of 50. His body lay in state in the Hall of the Cinema Workers before being cremated on 13 February, and his ashes were buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\nFilm theorist.\nEisenstein was among the earliest film theorists. He briefly attended the film school established by Lev Kuleshov and the two were both fascinated with the power of editing to generate meaning and elicit emotion. Their individual writings and films are the foundations upon which Soviet montage theory was built, but they differed markedly in their understanding of its fundamental principles. Eisenstein's articles and books\u2014particularly \"Film Form\" and \"The Film Sense\"\u2014explain the significance of montage in detail.\nHis writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment, through a \"linkage\" of related images\u2014as Kuleshov maintained. Eisenstein felt the \"collision\" of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors. He believed that an idea should be derived from the juxtaposition of two independent shots, bringing an element of collage into film. He developed what he called \"methods of montage\":\nWith his cross-disciplinary approach, he defined the montage as the constructing act par excellence at the base of every work of art: \"the principle of segmentation of the object into different camera cuts\"\u00a0 and the unification in a generalized or complete image is what we can call the peculiarity of montage as constructive process, which \"leaves the event intact (the caught reality) and at the same time interprets it differently.\"\nEisenstein taught film-making during his career at VGIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors' course; his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhni\u012d's \"Lessons with Eisenstein\". Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot.\" Another hypothetical was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's \"The Black Consul\", influenced as well by John Vandercook's \"Black Majesty\".\nLessons from this scenario delved into the character of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, replaying his movements, actions, and the drama surrounding him. Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content, Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing, photography, and editing, while encouraging his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity. Eisenstein's pedagogy, like his films, was politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin interwoven with his teaching.\nIn his initial films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues, especially class conflict. He used groups as characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes; he avoided casting stars. Like many Bolshevik artists, Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists, freeing them from the confines of capitalism, leaving them absolutely free to create, but due to the material conditions at the time, budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world.\nDrawings.\nEisenstein kept sketchbooks throughout his life. After his death, his widow, , gave most of them to the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI) \u2013 but withheld over 500 erotic drawings from the donation.

{"id": "28381", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28381", "title": "Superman", "text": "DC Comics superhero\nSuperman is a superhero created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, first appearing in issue #1 of \"Action Comics\", published in the United States on April 18, 1938. Superman has been regularly published in American comic books since then, and has been adapted to other media including radio serials, novels, films, television shows, theater, and video games. Superman is the archetypal superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, and fights evil and averts disasters with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition, it was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up until the 1980s; it is also the best-selling comic book series in the world with 600 million copies sold.\nSuperman was born Kal-El, on the fictional planet Krypton. As a baby, his parents Jor-El and Lara sent him to Earth in a small spaceship shortly before Krypton was destroyed in an apocalyptic cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside near the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, where he was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. The Kents quickly realized he was superhuman; due to the Earth's yellow sun, all of his physical and sensory abilities are far beyond those of a human, and he is nearly impervious to harm and capable of unassisted flight. His adoptive parents having instilled him with strong morals, he chooses to use his powers to benefit humanity, and to fight crime as a vigilante. To protect his personal life, he changes into a primary-colored costume and uses the alias \"Superman\" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the \"Daily Planet\" alongside supporting characters including his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, photographer Jimmy Olsen, and editor-in-chief Perry White. His enemies include Brainiac, General Zod, and archenemy Lex Luthor.\nSince 1939, Superman has been featured in both \"Action Comics\" and his own \"Superman\" comic. He exists within the DC Universe, where he interacts with other heroes including fellow Justice League members like Wonder Woman and Batman, and appears in various titles based on the team. Different versions of the character exist in alternative universes; the Superman from the Golden Age of comic books has been labeled as the Earth-Two version while the version appearing in Silver Age and Bronze Age comics is labeled the Earth One Superman. His persona has also inspired legacy characters such as Supergirl, Superboy and Krypto the Superdog.\nSuperman has been adapted outside of comics. The radio series \"The Adventures of Superman\" ran from 1940 to 1951 and would feature Bud Collyer as the voice of Superman. Collyer would also voice the character in a series of animated shorts produced by Fleischer/Famous Studios and released between 1941 and 1943. Superman also appeared in film serials in 1948 and 1950, played by Kirk Alyn. Christopher Reeve would portray Superman in the 1978 film and its sequels, and define the character in cinema for generations. Superman would continue to appear in feature films, including a series starring Henry Cavill and a 2025 film starring David Corenswet. The character has also appeared in numerous television series, including \"Adventures of Superman\", played by George Reeves, and \"\", voiced by Tim Daly.\nDevelopment.\nJerry Siegel and Joe Shuster met in 1932 while attending Glenville High School in Cleveland and bonded over their admiration of fiction. Siegel aspired to become a writer and Shuster aspired to become an illustrator. Siegel wrote amateur science fiction stories, which he self-published as a magazine called \"Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization\". His friend Shuster often provided illustrations for his work. In January 1933, Siegel published a short story in his magazine titled \"The Reign of the Superman\". The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug. The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, mind-control, and clairvoyance. He uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement, but then the drug wears off, leaving him a powerless vagrant again. Shuster provided illustrations, depicting Dunn as a bald man.\nSiegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, with a focus on adventure and comedy. They wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors, so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors. However, the newspaper editors were not impressed, and told them that if they wanted to make a successful comic strip, it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market. This prompted Siegel to revisit Superman as a comic strip character. Siegel modified Superman's powers to make him even more sensational. Like Bill Dunn, the second prototype of Superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist, but instead of psychic abilities, he acquires superhuman strength and bullet-proof skin. Additionally, this new Superman was a crime-fighting hero instead of a villain, because Siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful. In later years, Siegel once recalled that this Superman wore a \"bat-like\" cape in some panels, but typically he and Shuster agreed there was no costume yet, and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork.\nSiegel and Shuster showed this second concept of Superman to Consolidated Book Publishers, based in Chicago. In May 1933, Consolidated had published a comic book titled \"Detective Dan: Secret Operative 48\". It contained all-original stories as opposed to reprints of newspaper strips, which was a novelty at the time. Siegel and Shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called \"The Superman\". A delegation from Consolidated visited Cleveland that summer on a business trip and Siegel and Shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person. Although Consolidated expressed interest, they later pulled out of the comics business without ever offering a book deal because the sales of \"Detective Dan\" were disappointing.\nSiegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster. When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover. They continued collaborating on other projects, but for the time being Shuster was through with Superman.\nSiegel wrote to numerous artists. The first response came in July 1933 from Leo O'Mealia, who drew the \"Fu Manchu\" strip for the Bell Syndicate. In the script that Siegel sent to O'Mealia, Superman's origin story changes: He is a \"scientist-adventurer\" from the far future when humanity has naturally evolved \"superpowers\". Just before the Earth explodes, he escapes in a time-machine to the modern era, whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime. O'Mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate, but they were rejected. O'Mealia did not send to Siegel any copies of his strips, and they have been lost.\nIn June 1934, Siegel found another partner, an artist in Chicago named Russell Keaton. Keaton drew the \"Buck Rogers\" and \"Skyroads\" comic strips. In the script that Siegel sent Keaton in June, Superman's origin story further evolved: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to \"giant cataclysms\", the last surviving man sends his three-year-old son back in time to the year 1935. The time-machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists Sam and Molly Kent. They leave the boy in an orphanage, but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin. The Kents adopt the boy and name him Clark, and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity. In November, Siegel sent Keaton an extension of his script: an adventure where Superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star football player. The extended script mentions that Clark puts on a special \"uniform\" when assuming the identity of Superman, but it is not described. Keaton produced two weeks' worth of strips based on Siegel's script. In November, Keaton showed his strips to a newspaper syndicate, but they too were rejected, and he abandoned the project.\nSiegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman together. The character became an alien from the planet Krypton. Shuster designed the now-familiar costume: tights with an \"S\" on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape. They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and conceived his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman but does not realize that he and Kent are the same person.\nIn June 1935 Siegel and Shuster finally found work with National Allied Publications, a comic magazine publishing company in New York owned by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson. Wheeler-Nicholson published two of their strips in \"New Fun Comics\" #6 (1935): \"Henri Duval\" and \"Doctor Occult\". Siegel and Shuster also showed him Superman and asked him to market Superman to the newspapers on their behalf. In October, Wheeler-Nicholson offered to publish Superman in one of his own magazines. Siegel and Shuster refused his offer because Wheeler-Nicholson had demonstrated himself to be an irresponsible businessman. He had been slow to respond to their letters and had not paid them for their work in \"New Fun Comics\" #6. They chose to keep marketing Superman to newspaper syndicates themselves. Despite the erratic pay, Siegel and Shuster kept working for Wheeler-Nicholson because he was the only publisher who was buying their work, and over the years they produced other adventure strips for his magazines.\nWheeler-Nicholson's financial difficulties continued to mount. In 1936, he formed a joint corporation with Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz called Detective Comics, Inc. in order to release his third magazine, which was titled \"Detective Comics\". Siegel and Shuster produced stories for \"Detective Comics\" too, such as \"Slam Bradley\". Wheeler-Nicholson fell into deep debt to Donenfeld and Liebowitz, and in early January 1938, Donenfeld and Liebowitz petitioned Wheeler-Nicholson's company into bankruptcy and seized it.\nIn early December 1937, Siegel visited Liebowitz in New York, and Liebowitz asked Siegel to produce some comics for an upcoming comic anthology magazine called \"Action Comics\". Siegel proposed some new stories, but not Superman. Siegel and Shuster were, at the time, negotiating a deal with the McClure Newspaper Syndicate for Superman. In early January 1938, Siegel had a three-way telephone conversation with Liebowitz and an employee of McClure named Max Gaines. Gaines informed Siegel that McClure had rejected Superman, and asked if he could forward their Superman strips to Liebowitz so that Liebowitz could consider them for \"Action Comics\". Siegel agreed. Liebowitz and his colleagues were impressed by the strips, and they asked Siegel and Shuster to develop the strips into 13 pages for \"Action Comics\". Having grown tired of rejections, Siegel and Shuster accepted the offer. At least now they would see Superman published. Siegel and Shuster submitted their work in late February and were paid US$ for their work ($10 per page). In early March they signed a contract at Liebowitz's request in which they gave away the copyright for Superman to Detective Comics, Inc. This was normal practice in the business, and Siegel and Shuster had given away the copyrights to their previous works as well.\nThe duo's revised version of Superman appeared in the first issue of \"Action Comics\", which was published on April 18, 1938. The issue was a huge success thanks to Superman's feature.\nInfluences.\nSiegel and Shuster read pulp science-fiction and adventure magazines, and many stories featured characters with fantastical abilities such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and superhuman strength. One character in particular was John Carter of Mars from the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. John Carter is a human who is transported to Mars, where the lower gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances. Another influence was Philip Wylie's 1930 novel \"Gladiator\", featuring a protagonist named Hugo Danner who had similar powers.\nSuperman's stance and devil-may-care attitude were influenced by the characters of Douglas Fairbanks, who starred in adventure films such as \"The Mark of Zorro\" and \"Robin Hood\". The name of Superman's home city, Metropolis, was taken from the 1927 film of the same name. Popeye cartoons were also an influence.\nClark Kent's harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as Don Diego de la Vega in \"The Mark of Zorro\" and Sir Percy Blakeney in \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\". Siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor. Another inspiration was slapstick comedian Harold Lloyd. The archetypal Lloyd character was a mild-mannered man who finds himself abused by bullies but later in the story snaps and fights back furiously.\nKent is a journalist because Siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school. The love triangle between Lois Lane, Clark, and Superman was inspired by Siegel's own awkwardness with girls.\nThe pair collected comic strips in their youth, with a favorite being Winsor McCay's fantastical \"Little Nemo\". Shuster remarked on the artists who played an important part in the development of his own style: \"Alex Raymond and Burne Hogarth were my idols\u00a0\u2013 also Milt Caniff, Hal Foster, and Roy Crane.\" Shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected.\nAs a boy, Shuster was interested in fitness culture and a fan of strongmen such as Siegmund Breitbart and Joseph Greenstein. He collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art.\nThe visual design of Superman came from multiple influences. The tight-fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers, boxers, and strongmen. In early concept art, Shuster gave Superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes, but these were eventually changed to red boots. The costumes of Douglas Fairbanks were also an influence. The emblem on his chest was inspired by heraldic crests. Many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes. Superman's face was based on Johnny Weissmuller with touches derived from the comic-strip character Dick Tracy and from the work of cartoonist Roy Crane.\nThe word \"superman\" was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability, most often athletes and politicians. It occasionally appeared in pulp fiction stories as well, such as \"The Superman of Dr. Jukes\". It is unclear whether Siegel and Shuster were influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the \"\u00dcbermensch\"; they never acknowledged as much.\nComics.\nComic books.\nSince 1938, Superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by DC Comics. The first and oldest of these is \"Action Comics\", which began in April 1938. \"Action Comics\" was initially an anthology magazine, but it eventually became dedicated to Superman stories. The second oldest periodical is \"Superman\", which began in June 1939. \"Action Comics\" and \"Superman\" have been published without interruption (ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme). Several other shorter-lived Superman periodicals have been published over the years. Superman is part of the DC Universe, which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by DC Comics, and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman, and others.\nMore Superman comic books have been sold in publication history than any other American superhero character. Exact sales figures for the early decades of Superman comic books are hard to find because, like most publishers at the time, DC Comics concealed this data from its competitors and thereby the general public, but given the general market trends at the time, sales of \"Action Comics\" and \"Superman\" probably peaked in the mid-1940s and thereafter steadily declined. Sales data first became public in 1960, and showed that Superman was the best-selling comic book character of the 1960s and 1970s. Sales rose again starting in 1987. \"Superman\" #75 (Nov 1992) had over 23 million copies sold, making it the best-selling issue of a comic book of all time, due to a media sensation over the death of Superman in that issue. Sales declined from that point on. In March 2018, \"Action Comics\" sold just 51,534 copies, although such low figures are normal for superhero comic books in general (for comparison, \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #797 sold only 128,189 copies). The comic books have become a niche aspect of the \"Superman\" franchise due to low readership, though they remain influential as creative engines for the movies and television shows. Comic book stories can be produced quickly and cheaply, and are thus an ideal medium for experimentation.\nWhereas comic books in the 1950s were read by children, since the 1990s the average reader has been an adult. A major reason for this shift was DC Comics' decision in the 1970s to sell its comic books to specialty stores instead of traditional magazine retailers (supermarkets, newsstands, etc.) \u2014 a model called \"direct distribution\". This made comic books less accessible to children.\nNewspaper strips.\nBeginning in January 1939, a \"Superman\" daily comic strip appeared in newspapers, syndicated through the McClure Syndicate. A color Sunday version was added that November. Jerry Siegel wrote most of the strips until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943. The Sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips, possibly because Siegel had to delegate the Sunday strips to ghostwriters. By 1941, the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million. Joe Shuster drew the early strips, then passed the job to Wayne Boring. From 1949 to 1956, the newspaper strips were drawn by Win Mortimer. The strip ended in May 1966, but was revived from 1977 to 1983 to coincide with a series of movies released by Warner Bros.\nEditors.\nInitially, Jerry Siegel was allowed to write Superman more or less as he saw fit because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise. But soon Siegel and Shuster's work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors. Siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories. Editor Whitney Ellsworth, hired in 1940, dictated that Superman not kill. Sexuality was banned, and colorfully outlandish villains such as Ultra-Humanite and Toyman were favored over gangsters as they were thought to be less frightening to young readers.\nMort Weisinger was the editor on Superman comics from 1941 to 1970, his tenure briefly interrupted by military service. Siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology, but as the number of Superman titles and the pool of writers grew, Weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach. Weisinger assigned story ideas, and the logic of Superman's powers, his origin, the locales, and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned. Elements such as Bizarro, his cousin Supergirl, the Phantom Zone, the Fortress of Solitude, alternate varieties of kryptonite, robot doppelgangers, and Krypto were introduced during this era. The complicated universe built under Weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals. Weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama, and avoided sensitive subjects such as the Vietnam War and the American civil rights movement because he feared his right-wing views would alienate his left-leaning writers and readers. Weisinger also introduced letters columns in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers.\nWeisinger retired in 1970 and Julius Schwartz took over. By his own admission, Weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers. Starting with The Sandman Saga, Schwartz updated Superman by making Clark Kent a television anchor, and he retired overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers. Schwartz also scaled Superman's powers down to a level closer to Siegel's depiction. These changes would eventually be reversed by later writers. Schwartz allowed stories with serious drama such as \"For the Man Who Has Everything\" (\"Superman Annual\" #11), in which the villain Mongul torments Superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living Krypton.\nSchwartz retired from DC Comics in 1986 and was succeeded by Mike Carlin as an editor on Superman comics. His retirement coincided with DC Comics' decision to reboot the DC Universe with the companywide-crossover storyline \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". In The Man of Steel, renowned artist and writer John Byrne rewrote the Superman mythos; again reducing Superman's powers, which writers had slowly re-strengthened, and revised many supporting characters, such as making Lex Luthor a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist, and making Supergirl an artificial shapeshifting organism because DC wanted Superman to be the sole surviving Kryptonian.\nCarlin was promoted to Executive Editor for the DC Universe books in 1996, a position he held until 2002. K.C. Carlson took his place as editor of the Superman comics.\nAesthetic style.\nIn the earlier decades of Superman comics, artists were expected to conform to a certain \"house style\". Joe Shuster defined the aesthetic style of Superman in the 1940s. After Shuster left National, Wayne Boring succeeded him as the principal artist on Superman comic books. He redrew Superman taller and more detailed. Around 1955, Curt Swan in turn succeeded Boring. The 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single \"house style\" in Superman comics.\nCopyright issues.\nJerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\nIn a contract dated March 1, 1938, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster gave away the copyright to Superman to their employer, DC Comics (then known as Detective Comics, Inc.) prior to Superman's first publication in April. Contrary to popular perception, the $130 that DC Comics paid them was for their first Superman story, not the copyright to the character \u2014 that, they gave away for free. This was normal practice in the comic magazine industry and they had done the same with their previous published works (Slam Bradley, Doctor Occult, etc.), but Superman became far more popular and valuable than they anticipated and they much regretted giving him away. DC Comics retained Siegel and Shuster, and they were paid well because they were popular with the readers. Between 1938 and 1947, DC Comics paid them together at least $401,194.85 (equivalent to $ in 2024).\nSiegel wrote most of the magazine and daily newspaper stories until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943, whereupon the task was passed to ghostwriters. While Siegel was serving in Hawaii, DC Comics published a story featuring a child version of Superman called \"Superboy\", which was based on a script Siegel had submitted several years before. Siegel was furious because DC Comics did this without having bought the character.\nAfter Siegel's discharge from the Army, he and Shuster sued DC Comics in 1947 for the rights to Superman and Superboy. The judge ruled that Superman belonged to DC Comics, but that Superboy was a separate entity that belonged to Siegel. Siegel and Shuster settled out-of-court with DC Comics, which paid the pair $94,013.16 () in exchange for the full rights to both Superman and Superboy. DC Comics then fired Siegel and Shuster.\nDC Comics rehired Jerry Siegel as a writer in 1959.\nIn 1965, Siegel and Shuster attempted to regain rights to Superman using the renewal option in the Copyright Act of 1909, but the court ruled Siegel and Shuster had transferred the renewal rights to DC Comics in 1938. Siegel and Shuster appealed, but the appeals court upheld this decision. DC Comics fired Siegel once again, when he filed this second lawsuit.\nIn 1975, Siegel and several other comic book writers and artists launched a public campaign for better compensation and treatment of comic creators. Warner Brothers agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, full medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman productions in exchange for never contesting ownership of Superman. Siegel and Shuster upheld this bargain.\nShuster died in 1992. DC Comics offered Shuster's heirs a stipend in exchange for never challenging ownership of Superman, which they accepted for some years.\nSiegel died in 1996. His heirs attempted to take the rights to Superman using the termination provision of the Copyright Act of 1976. DC Comics negotiated an agreement wherein it would pay the Siegel heirs several million dollars and a yearly stipend of $500,000 in exchange for permanently granting DC the rights to Superman. DC Comics also agreed to insert the line \"By Special Arrangement with the Jerry Siegel Family\" in all future Superman productions. The Siegels accepted DC's offer in an October 2001 letter.\nCopyright lawyer and movie producer Marc Toberoff then struck a deal with the heirs of both Siegel and Shuster to help them get the rights to Superman in exchange for signing the rights over to his production company, Pacific Pictures. Both groups accepted. The Siegel heirs called off their deal with DC Comics and in 2004 sued DC for the rights to Superman and Superboy. In 2008, the judge ruled in favor of the Siegels. DC Comics appealed the decision, and the appeals court ruled in favor of DC, arguing that the October 2001 letter was binding. In 2003, the Shuster heirs served a termination notice for Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman. DC Comics sued the Shuster heirs in 2010, and the court ruled in DC's favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the Shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant.\nUnder current US copyright law, Superman's first appearance in \"Action Comics\" #1 is due to enter the US public domain on January 1, 2034. However, this will only apply (at first) to the character as he is depicted in 1938. In addition DC Comics retains trademarks on Superman's name, image and 'S' logo, and unlike copyrights, trademarks do not expire unless they cease to be used.\nCaptain Marvel.\nSuperman's success immediately begat a wave of imitations. The most successful from this period was Captain Marvel, first published by Fawcett Comics in December 1939. Captain Marvel had many similarities to Superman: Herculean strength, invulnerability, the ability to fly, a cape, a secret identity, and a job as a journalist. DC Comics filed a lawsuit against Fawcett Comics for copyright infringement.\nThe trial began in March 1948 after seven years of discovery. The judge ruled that Fawcett had indeed infringed on Superman. However, the judge also found that the copyright notices that appeared with the Superman newspaper strips did not meet the technical standards of the Copyright Act of 1909 and were therefore invalid. Furthermore, since the newspaper strips carried stories adapted from \"Action Comics\", the judge ruled that DC Comics had effectively abandoned the copyright to the \"Action Comics\" stories and Superman, and therefore forfeited its right to sue Fawcett for copyright infringement.\nDC Comics appealed this decision. The appeals court ruled that unintentional mistakes in the copyright notices of the newspaper strips did not invalidate the copyrights. Furthermore, Fawcett knew that DC Comics never intended to abandon the copyrights, and therefore Fawcett's infringement was not an innocent misunderstanding, and therefore Fawcett owed damages to DC Comics. The appeals court remanded the case back to the lower court to determine how much Fawcett owed in damages.\nAt that point, Fawcett Comics decided to settle out of court with DC Comics. Fawcett paid DC Comics $ and agreed to stop publishing Captain Marvel. The last Captain Marvel story from Fawcett Comics was published in September 1953.\nDC Comics licensed Captain Marvel in 1972 and published crossover stories with Superman. By 1991, DC Comics had purchased Fawcett Comics and with it the full rights to Captain Marvel. DC eventually renamed the character \"Shazam\" to prevent disputes with Marvel Comics, who had created a character of their own named \"Captain Marvel\" back when the Fawcett character had been out of print.\nCharacter overview.\nSeveral elements of the \"Superman\" narrative have remained consistent in the myriad stories published since 1938.\nSuperman.\nIn \"Action Comics\" #1 (1938), Superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans. Shortly after he is born, his planet is destroyed in a natural cataclysm, but his scientist father foresaw the calamity and saves his baby son by sending him to Earth in a small spaceship. The ship is too small to carry anyone else, so Superman's parents are forced to stay behind and die in the cataclysm. The earliest newspaper strips name the planet Krypton, the baby Kal-L, and his biological parents Jor-L and Lora; their names were changed to Jor-el, and Lara in a 1942 spinoff novel by George Lowther. The ship lands in the American countryside, where the baby is discovered by the Kents, a farming couple.\nThe Kents name the boy Clark and raise him in a farming community. A 1947 episode of the radio serial places this yet unnamed community in Iowa. It is named Smallville in \"Superboy\" #2 (June 1949). The 1978 Superman movie placed it in Kansas, as have most Superman stories since. \"New Adventures of Superboy\" #22 (Oct. 1981) places it in Maryland.\nIn \"Action Comics\" #1 and most stories published before 1986, Superman's powers begin developing in infancy. From 1944 to 1986, DC Comics regularly published stories of Superman's childhood and adolescent adventures, when he called himself \"Superboy\". From 1986 on (beginning with \"Man of Steel\" #1), Superman's powers emerged more slowly and he began his superhero career as an adult.\nThe Kents teach Clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed identity of Superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment's notice. To complete this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and in older stories he would suffer occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice.\nIn \"Superboy\" #78 (1960), Superboy makes his costume out of the indestructible blankets found in the ship he came to Earth in. In \"Man of Steel\" #1 (1986), Martha Kent makes the costume from human-manufactured cloth, and it is rendered indestructible by an aura that Superman projects. The \"S\" on Superman's chest at first was simply an initial for \"Superman\". When writing the script for the 1978 movie, Tom Mankiewicz made it the crest of Superman's Kryptonian family, the House of El. This was carried over into some comic book stories and later movies, such as \"Man of Steel\". In the comic story \"\", the crest is described as an old Kryptonian symbol for hope.\nClark works as a newspaper journalist. In the earliest stories, he worked for \"The Daily Star\", but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to the \"Daily Planet\". In comics from the early 1970s, Clark worked as a television journalist, which was an attempt to modernize the character. However, for the 1978 movie, the producers chose to make Clark a newspaper journalist again because that was how most people outside of comic book readers knew him.\nThe first story in which Superman dies was published in \"Superman\" #149 (1961), in which he is murdered by Lex Luthor by means of kryptonite. This story was \"imaginary\" and therefore was ignored in subsequent books. In \"Superman\" #188 (April 1966), Superman is killed by kryptonite radiation but is revived in the same issue by one of his android doppelgangers. In the 1990s \"The Death and Return of Superman\" story arc, after a deadly battle with Doomsday, Superman died in \"Superman\" #75 (Jan. 1993). He was later revived by the Eradicator using Kryptonian technology. In \"Superman\" #52 (May 2016) Superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning, and this time he is not resurrected, but replaced by the Superman of an alternate timeline.\nSuperman maintains a secret hideout called the \"Fortress of Solitude\", which is located somewhere in the Arctic. Here, Superman keeps a collection of mementos and a laboratory for science experiments. \"Action Comics\" #241 (1958) depicts the Fortress of Solitude as a cave in a mountain, sealed with a very heavy door that is opened with a gigantic key too heavy for anyone but Superman to use. In the 1978 movie, the Fortress of Solitude is a structure made of white crystal.\nClark Kent.\nSuperman's secret identity is Clark Joseph Kent, a reporter for the \"Daily Planet\". Although his name and history originate from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the \"Daily Planet\", he receives late-breaking news before the general public, always has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his publication deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities\u2014bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved. In the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Clark Kent was featured in a series that appeared primarily in \"The Superman Family\", \"The Private Life of Clark Kent\" where Superman dealt with various situations subtly while remaining Clark.\nTo deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a mainly passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as \"mild-mannered\", as in the opening narration of Max Fleischer's \"Superman\" animated theatrical shorts. These traits extended into Clark's wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses, combed-back hair, and occasionally a fedora. Clark wears his Superman costume underneath his street clothes, allowing easy changes between the two personae and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar \"S\" emblem when called into action. His hair also changes with the clothing change, with Superman sporting a small curl or spit curl on his forehead. Superman usually stores his Clark Kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape, though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location (such as the \"Daily Planet\" storeroom) for later retrieval.\nAs Superman's alter ego, the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become synonymous with secret identities and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the \"Toronto Star\" that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men Clark Gable and Kent Taylor, but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic Harold Lloyd and himself. Clark's middle name is given variously as either Joseph, Jerome, or Jonathan, being allusions to creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and to his adoptive father.\nPersonality.\nIn the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. He often uses excessive force and terror against criminals, on some occasions even killing them. This came to an end in late 1940 when new editor Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing. The character was softened and given a sense of humanitarianism. Ellsworth's code, however, is not to be confused with \"the Comics Code\", which was created in 1954 by the Comics Code Authority and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century.\nIn his first appearances, Superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities, being fired upon by the National Guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor. By 1942, however, Superman was working side-by-side with the police. Today, Superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality, and righteousness. He adheres to an unwavering moral code instilled in him by his adoptive parents. His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many citizens and other heroes, but has stirred resentment and criticism among others, who refer to him as the \"big blue boy scout\". Superman can be rather rigid in this trait, causing tensions in the superhero community. This was most notable with Wonder Woman, one of his closest friends, after she killed Maxwell Lord. Booster Gold initially had an icy relationship with the Man of Steel but grew to respect him.\nHaving lost his home world of Krypton, Superman is very protective of Earth, and especially of Clark Kent's family and friends. This same loss, combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite having his friends and parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians, Power Girl and Mon-El, have led to disappointment. The arrival of Supergirl, who has been confirmed to be his cousin from Krypton, relieved this loneliness somewhat. Superman's Fortress of Solitude acts as a place of solace for him in times of loneliness and despair.\nAbilities and weaknesses.\nThe catalog of Superman's abilities and his strength has varied considerably over the vast body of Superman fiction released since 1938.\nSince \"Action Comics\" #1 (1938), Superman has superhuman strength. The cover of \"Action Comics\" #1 shows him effortlessly lifting a car over his head. Another classic feat of strength on Superman's part is breaking steel chains. In some stories, he is strong enough to shift the orbits of planets and crush coal into diamond with his hands.\nSince \"Action Comics\" #1 (1938), Superman has a highly durable body, invulnerable for most practical purposes. At the very least, bullets bounce harmlessly off his body. In some stories, such as \"Kingdom Come\", not even a nuclear bomb can harm him.\nIn the earliest stories, Superman's costume is made out of exotic materials that are as tough as he is, which is why it typically does not tear up when he performs superhuman feats. In later stories, beginning with \"Man of Steel\" #1 (1986), Superman's body is said to project an aura that renders invulnerable any tight-fitting clothes he wears, and hence his costume is as durable as he is even if made of common cloth.\nIn \"Action Comics\" #1, Superman could not fly. He traveled by running and leaping, which he could do to a prodigious degree thanks to his strength. Superman gained the ability to fly in the second episode of the radio serial in 1940. Superman can fly faster than sound and in some stories, he can even fly faster than the speed of light to travel to distant galaxies.\nSuperman can project and perceive X-rays via his eyes, which allows him to see through objects. He first uses this power in \"Action Comics\" #11 (1939). Certain materials such as lead can block his X-ray vision.\nSuperman can project beams of heat from his eyes which are hot enough to melt steel. He first used this power in \"Superman\" #59 (1949) by applying his X-ray vision at its highest intensity. In later stories, this ability is simply called \"heat vision\".\nSuperman can hear sounds that are too faint for a human to hear, and at frequencies outside the human hearing range. This ability was introduced in \"Action Comics\" #11 (1939).\nSince \"Action Comics\" #20 (1940), Superman possesses superhuman breath, which enables him to inhale or blow huge amounts of air, as well as holding his breath indefinitely to remain underwater or space without adverse effects. He has a significant focus of his breath's intensity to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them. The \"freeze breath\" was first demonstrated in \"Superman\" #129 (1959).\n\"Action Comics\" #1 (1938) explained that Superman's strength was common to all Kryptonians because they were a species \"millions of years advanced of our own\". In the first newspaper strips, Jor-El is shown running and leaping like Superman, and his wife survives a building collapsing on her. Later stories explained they evolved superhuman strength simply because of Krypton's higher gravity. \"Superman\" #146 (1961) established that Superman's abilities other than strength (flight, durability, etc.) are activated by the light of Earth's yellow sun. This was shortly changed to all of his powers including strength being activated by yellow sunlight and deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of Krypton's sun.\nWeaknesses.\nExposure to green kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and incapacitates him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. Although green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with peculiar effects. Gold kryptonite, for instance, nullifies Superman's powers but otherwise does not harm him. Kryptonite first appeared in a 1943 episode of the radio serial. It first appeared in comics in \"Superman\" #61 (Dec. 1949).\nSuperman is also vulnerable to magic. Enchanted weapons and magical spells affect Superman as easily as they would a normal human. This weakness was established in \"Superman\" #171 (1964).\nLike all Kryptonians, Kal-El is also highly susceptible to psychokinetic phenomena ranging along Telekinesis, Illusion casting, Mind control, etc., as shown in \"Wonder Woman\" Vol 2 # 219 (Sept. 2005). A powerful enough psionic can affect either the psyche or microbiology of Superman to induce strokes or mangle his internal organs, as well as disrupt his mind and perceptions of the world, something a young metahuman showcased in \"Superman\" #48 (Oct. 1990).\nMany stories describe Superman as being vulnerable to radiation at wavelengths equal to the light of the \"red sun\" of the planet Krypton, which causes him to temporarily lose his powers.\nOver the years, writers have invented many other weaknesses for Superman using various science fiction tropes, with some of these weaknesses only existing for a short period of time.\nOccasional equipment.\nOn occasion, Superman has made use of a special aeroplane called the Supermobile which has the same abilities as him and can protect him from the radiation of a red sun.\nSuperman has used several fictional robots that resemble his appearance and have similar abilities. Superman robots played a particularly dominant role in the late 1950s and 1960s era Superman comics, when readers were first introduced to Superman possessing various robot duplicates. These robots each possessed a fraction of Superman's powers, and were sometimes used to substitute for him on missions or protect his secret identity. One notable Superman robot was named Ajax, also known as Wonder Man. Other Superman robots had other names, including Robot Z, Robot X-3, and MacDuff.\nThe idea of Superman robots extended into Superboy and Supergirl stories of the period as well, with the two also possessing robotic duplicates. In the early 1970s, the Superman comics largely abandoned the Superman robots as part of a change in tone and writing style. In-universe, the robots are rendered unusable by Earth's pollution levels and artificial radiation. The notion of Superman robots was reintroduced for post-Crisis comic continuity in a late 1990s storyline. While under Dominus' control, Superman builds a series of robots to oversee the Earth. Unlike the original Superman robots, they possess a more mechanical appearance. In \"Superman\" (vol. 2) #170, Krypto nearly kills Mongul and is confined to the Fortress of Solitude as punishment. A Superman robot nicknamed \"Ned\" is employed as Krypto's caretaker. In a later storyline, Brainiac 8 revived and increased the power to a forgotten Superman robot. The robot attacked the Teen Titans, killing Troia and Omen before it was defeated.\nSupporting characters.\nSuperman's first and most famous supporting character is Lois Lane, introduced in \"Action Comics\" #1. She is a fellow journalist at the \"Daily Planet\". As Jerry Siegel conceived her, Lois considers Clark Kent to be a wimp, but she is infatuated with the bold and mighty Superman, not knowing that Kent and Superman are the same person. Siegel objected to any proposal that Lois discover that Clark is Superman because he felt that, as implausible as Clark's disguise is, the love triangle was too important to the book's appeal. However, Siegel wrote stories in which Lois suspects Clark is Superman and tries to prove it, with Superman always duping her in the end; the first such story was in \"Superman\" #17 (July\u2013August 1942). This was a common plot in comic book stories prior to the 1970s. In a story in \"Action Comics\" #484 (June 1978), Clark Kent admits to Lois that he is Superman, and they marry. This was the first story in which Superman and Lois marry that was not an \"imaginary tale\". Many Superman stories since then have depicted Superman and Lois as a married couple, but about as many depict them in the classic love triangle. In modern era comic books, Superman and Lois are a stable married couple, and the \"Superman\" supporting cast was further expanded with the introduction of their son, Jon Kent.\nOther supporting characters include Jimmy Olsen, a photographer at the \"Daily Planet\", who is friends with both Superman and Clark Kent, though in most stories he does not know that Clark is Superman. Jimmy is frequently described as \"Superman's pal\", and was conceived to give young male readers a relatable character through which they could fantasize being friends with Superman.\nIn the earliest comic book stories, Clark Kent's employer is George Taylor of \"The Daily Star\", but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to Perry White of the \"Daily Planet\".\nClark Kent's foster parents are Jonathan and Martha Kent. In many stories, one or both of them have died by the time Clark becomes Superman. Clark's parents taught him that he should use his abilities for altruistic means, but that he should also find some way to safeguard his private life.\nAntagonists.\nThe villains Superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, corrupt politicians, and violent husbands; but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as to avoid offending censors or scaring children. The mad scientist Ultra-Humanite, introduced in \"Action Comics\" #13 (June 1939), was Superman's first recurring villain. Superman's best-known nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in \"Action Comics\" #23 (April 1940) and has been depicted as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman (sometimes both). In 1944, the magical imp Mister Mxyzptlk, Superman's first recurring super-powered adversary, was introduced. Superman's first alien villain, Brainiac, debuted in \"Action Comics\" #242 (July 1958). General Zod, who first appeared in \"Adventure Comics\" #283 (April 1961), is a fellow Kryptonian with similar powers. The monstrous Doomsday, introduced in \" #17\u201318 (Nov.-Dec. 1992), was the first villain to evidently kill Superman in physical combat without exploiting Superman's critical weaknesses such as kryptonite.\nAlternative depictions.\nThe details of Superman's origin story and supporting cast vary across his large body of fiction released since 1938, but most versions conform to the basic template described above. A few stories feature radically altered versions of Superman. An example is the graphic novel \", which depicts a communist Superman who rules the Soviet Union. DC Comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different versions of Superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes. For instance, in the 1960s, the Superman of \"Earth-One\" would occasionally feature in stories alongside the Superman of \"Earth-Two\", the latter of whom resembled Superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s.\nImpact and legacy.\nThe superhero archetype.\nSuperman is often considered the first superhero. This point can be debated: Ogon Bat, the Phantom, Zorro, and Mandrake the Magician arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate Superman. Nevertheless, Superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions: a costume, a codename, extraordinary abilities, and an altruistic mission. Superman's success in 1938 begat a wave of imitations, which include Batman, Captain America, and Captain Marvel. This flourishing is today referred to as America's Golden Age of Comic Books, which lasted from 1938 to about 1950. The Golden Age ended when American superhero book sales declined, leading to the cancellation of many characters; but Superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline, and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the Silver Age of Comic Books, when characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, and The X-Men were created.\nAfter World War II, American superhero fiction entered Japanese culture. Astro Boy, first published in 1952, was inspired by Mighty Mouse, which in turn was a parody of Superman. The \"Superman\" animated shorts from the 1940s were first broadcast on Japanese television in 1955, and they were followed in 1956 by the TV show \"Adventures of Superman\" starring George Reeves. These shows were popular with the Japanese and inspired Japan's own prolific genre of superheroes. The first Japanese superhero movie, \"Super Giant\", was released in 1957. The first Japanese superhero TV show was \"Moonlight Mask\" in 1958. Other notable Japanese superheroes include Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and Sailor Moon.\nFine art.\nSince the Pop Art period and the 1960s, the character of Superman has been \"appropriated\" by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, most notably by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Mel Ramos, Dulce Pinzon, Mr. Brainwash, Raymond Pettibon, Peter Saul, Giuseppe Veneziano, F. Lennox Campello, and others.\nLiterary analysis.\nSuperman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms, with Umberto Eco noting that \"he can be seen as the representative of all his similars\". Writing in \"Time\" in 1971, Gerald Clarke stated: \"Superman's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the Horatio Alger myth of the self-made man.\" Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which \"only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper\". Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman's partial role in exploring assimilation, the character's alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level.\nA.C. Grayling, writing in \"The Spectator\", traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of Al Capone, through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell war bonds, and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the Cold War as being one where \"matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions\", and discusses events post 9/11, stating that as a nation \"caught between the terrifying George W. Bush and the terrorist Osama bin Laden, America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape\".\nAn influence on early Superman stories is the context of the Great Depression. Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements. Comics scholar Roger Sabin sees this as a reflection of \"the liberal idealism of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal\", with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes. In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues, tackling a version of the Ku Klux Klan in a 1946 broadcast, as well as combating anti-semitism and veteran discrimination.\nScott Bukatman has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman's ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis. He writes that the character \"represented, in 1938, a kind of Corbusierian ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that 'Everything is known to us'.\"\nJules Feiffer has argued that Superman's real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what \"made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent.\" Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfillment, a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that \"If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from\" and Shuster supporting that as being \"why so many people could relate to it\".\nIan Gordon suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman, he notes was very much part of that effort.\nAn allegory for immigrants.\nSuperman's immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal. Aldo Regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in America. The extraterrestrial origin was seen by Regalado as challenging the notion that Anglo-Saxon ancestry was the source of all might. Gary Engle saw the \"myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in American culture\". He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the Western as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both of their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants' cultural heritage for the greater good. David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman's early stories portray a threat: \"the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country\". David Rooney, a theater critic for \"The New York Times\", in his evaluation of the play \"Year Zero\" considers Superman to be the \"quintessential immigrant story [...] [b]orn on an alien planet, he grows stronger on Earth, but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm\". Junot D\u00edaz argues that the character particularly resonates with the experiences of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Throughout the depictions of Superman's archenemy Lex Luthor in comics, film, and television, Luthor has frequently expressed and exploited xenophobia against Superman.\nReligious themes.\nIt is popularly believed that Superman took inspiration from Judaic mythology and there is some circumstantial evidence to support this. The British rabbi Simcha Weinstein notes that Superman's story has some parallels to that of Moses. For example, Moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and was adopted by a foreign culture. Weinstein also posits that Superman's Kryptonian name, \"Kal-El\", resembles the Hebrew phrase \"q\u014dl \u02be\u0113l\" (\u05e7\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc-\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc) which can be taken to mean \"Voice of God\". The historian Larry Tye suggests that this \"Voice of God\" is an allusion to Moses' role as a prophet. The suffix \"el\", meaning \"god\", is also found in the name of angels (e.g. Gabriel, Ariel), who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers. The Nazis also thought Superman was a Jew and in 1940 the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) newspaper \"Das Schwarze Korps\" denounced Superman and his creator Jerry Siegel.\nAll that said, historians such as Martin Lund and Les Daniels argue that the evidence for Judaic influence in Siegel and Shuster's stories is merely circumstantial. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were not practicing Jews and never acknowledged the influence of Judaism in any memoir or interview.\nSuperman stories have occasionally exhibited Christian themes as well. Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz consciously made Superman an allegory for Jesus Christ in the 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve: baby Kal-El's ship resembles the Star of Bethlehem, and Jor-El gives his son a messianic mission to lead humanity into a brighter future.\nThis messianic theme was revisited in the 2013 movie \"Man of Steel\", wherein Jor-El asks Superman to redeem the Kryptonian race, which corrupted itself through eugenics, by guiding humanity down a wiser path.\nIn other media.\nRadio.\nThe first adaptation of Superman beyond comic books was a radio show, \"The Adventures of Superman\", which ran from 1940 to 1951 for 2,088 episodes, most of which were aimed at children. The episodes were initially 15 minutes long, but after 1949 they were lengthened to 30 minutes. Most episodes were done live. Bud Collyer was the voice actor for Superman in most episodes. The show was produced by Robert Maxwell and Allen Ducovny, who were employees of Superman, Inc. and Detective Comics, Inc. respectively.\nStage.\nIn 1966 Superman had a Tony-nominated musical play produced on Broadway. \"It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman\" featured music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by Lee Adams and book by David Newman and Robert Benton. Actor Bob Holiday performed as Clark Kent/Superman and actress Patricia Marand performed as Lois Lane.\nFilm.\nThe success of the 1978 film arguably paved the way for later big-budget superhero movies like \"Batman\" (1989) and \"Spider-Man\" (2002).\nMerchandising.\nDC Comics trademarked the Superman chest logo in August 1938. Jack Liebowitz established Superman, Inc. in October 1939 to develop the franchise beyond the comic books. Superman, Inc. merged with DC Comics in October 1946. After DC Comics merged with Warner Communications in 1967, licensing for Superman was handled by the Licensing Corporation of America.\nThe Licensing Letter (an American market research firm) estimated that Superman licensed merchandise made $634 million in sales globally in 2018 (43.3% of this revenue came from the North American market). For comparison, in the same year, Spider-Man merchandise made $1.075 billion and Star Wars merchandise made $1.923 billion globally.\nThe earliest paraphernalia appeared in 1939: a button proclaiming membership in the Supermen of America club. The first toy was a wooden doll in 1939 made by the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company. \"Superman\" #5 (May 1940) carried an advertisement for a \"Krypto-Raygun\", which was a gun-shaped device that could project images on a wall. The majority of Superman merchandise is targeted at children, but since the 1970s, adults have been increasingly targeted because the comic book readership has gotten older.\nDuring World War II, Superman was used to support the war effort. \"Action Comics\" and \"Superman\" carried messages urging readers to buy war bonds and participate in scrap drives. Other superheroes became patriots who went to fight: Batman, Wonder Woman and Captain America.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28382", "revid": "1461430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28382", "title": "Splay tree", "text": "Self-adjusting binary search tree\nA splay tree is a binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. Like self-balancing binary search trees, a splay tree performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in O(log \"n\") amortized time. For random access patterns drawn from a non-uniform random distribution, their amortized time can be faster than logarithmic, proportional to the entropy of the access pattern. For many patterns of non-random operations, also, splay trees can take better than logarithmic time, without requiring advance knowledge of the pattern. According to the unproven dynamic optimality conjecture, their performance on all access patterns is within a constant factor of the best possible performance that could be achieved by any other self-adjusting binary search tree, even one selected to fit that pattern. The splay tree was invented by Daniel Sleator and Robert Tarjan in 1985.\nAll normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one basic operation, called \"splaying\". Splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree. One way to do this with the basic search operation is to first perform a standard binary tree search for the element in question, and then use tree rotations in a specific fashion to bring the element to the top. Alternatively, a top-down algorithm can combine the search and the tree reorganization into a single phase.\nAdvantages.\nGood performance for a splay tree depends on the fact that it is self-optimizing, in that frequently accessed nodes will move nearer to the root where they can be accessed more quickly. The worst-case height\u2014though unlikely\u2014is O(\"n\"), with the average being O(log \"n\").\nHaving frequently-used nodes near the root is an advantage for many practical applications (also see locality of reference), and is particularly useful for implementing caches and garbage collection algorithms.\nAdvantages include:\nDisadvantages.\nThe most significant disadvantage of splay trees is that the height of a splay tree can be linear. For example, this will be the case after accessing all \"n\" elements in non-decreasing order. Since the height of a tree corresponds to the worst-case access time, this means that the actual cost of a single operation can be high. However the amortized access cost of this worst case is logarithmic, O(log \"n\"). Also, the expected access cost can be reduced to O(log \"n\") by using a randomized variant.\nThe representation of splay trees can change even when they are accessed in a 'read-only' manner (i.e. by \"find\" operations). This complicates the use of such splay trees in a multi-threaded environment. Specifically, extra management is needed if multiple threads are allowed to perform \"find\" operations concurrently. This also makes them unsuitable for general use in purely functional programming, although even there they can be used in limited ways to implement priority queues.\nFinally, when the access pattern \"is\" random, the additional splaying overhead adds a significant constant factor to the cost compared to less-dynamic alternatives.\nOperations.\nSplaying.\nWhen a node \"x\" is accessed, a splay operation is performed on \"x\" to move it to the root. A splay operation is a sequence of \"splay steps\", each of which moves \"x\" closer to the root. By performing a splay operation on the node of interest after every access, the recently accessed nodes are kept near the root and the tree remains roughly balanced, so it provides the desired amortized time bounds.\nEach particular step depends on three factors:\nThere are three types of splay steps, each of which has two symmetric variants: left- and right-handed. For the sake of brevity, only one of these two is shown for each type. (In the following diagrams, circles indicate nodes of interest and triangles indicate sub-trees of arbitrary size.) The three types of splay steps are:\nZig step: this step is done when \"p\" is the root. The tree is rotated on the edge between \"x\" and \"p\". Zig steps exist to deal with the parity issue, will be done only as the last step in a splay operation, and only when \"x\" has odd depth at the beginning of the operation.\nZig-zig step: this step is done when \"p\" is not the root and \"x\" and \"p\" are either both right children or are both left children. The picture below shows the case where \"x\" and \"p\" are both left children. The tree is rotated on the edge joining \"p\" with \"its\" parent \"g\", then rotated on the edge joining \"x\" with \"p\". Zig-zig steps are the only thing that differentiate splay trees from the \"rotate to root\" method introduced by Allen and Munro prior to the introduction of splay trees.\nZig-zag step: this step is done when \"p\" is not the root and \"x\" is a right child and \"p\" is a left child or vice versa (\"x\" is left, \"p\" is right). The tree is rotated on the edge between \"p\" and \"x\", and then rotated on the resulting edge between \"x\" and \"g\".\nJoin.\nGiven two trees S and T such that all elements of S are smaller than the elements of T, the following steps can be used to join them to a single tree:\nSplit.\nGiven a tree and an element \"x\", return two new trees: one containing all elements less than or equal to \"x\" and the other containing all elements greater than \"x\". This can be done in the following way:\nInsertion.\nTo insert a value \"x\" into a splay tree:\nAs a result, the newly inserted node \"x\" becomes the root of the tree.\nAlternatively:\nDeletion.\nTo delete a node \"x\", use the same method as with a binary search tree:\nIn this way, deletion is reduced to the problem of removing a node with 0 or 1 children. Unlike a binary search tree, in a splay tree after deletion, we splay the parent of the removed node to the top of the tree.\nAlternatively:\nImplementation and variants.\nSplaying, as mentioned above, is performed during a second, bottom-up pass over the access path of a node. It is possible to record the access path during the first pass for use during the second, but that requires extra space during the access operation. Another alternative is to keep a parent pointer in every node, which avoids the need for extra space during access operations but may reduce overall time efficiency because of the need to update those pointers.\nAnother method which can be used is based on the argument that the tree can be restructured during the way down the access path instead of making a second pass. This top-down splaying routine uses three sets of nodes \u2013 left tree, right tree and middle tree. The first two contain all items of original tree known to be less than or greater than current item respectively. The middle tree consists of the sub-tree rooted at the current node. These three sets are updated down the access path while keeping the splay operations in check. Another method, semisplaying, modifies the zig-zig case to reduce the amount of restructuring done in all operations.\nBelow there is an implementation of splay trees in C++, which uses pointers to represent each node on the tree. This implementation is based on bottom-up splaying version and uses the second method of deletion on a splay tree. Also, unlike the above definition, this C++ version does \"not\" splay the tree on finds \u2013 it only splays on insertions and deletions, and the find operation, therefore, has linear time complexity.\ntemplate&lt;typename T, typename Comp = std::less&lt;T\u00bb\nclass splay_tree {\nprivate:\n Comp comp;\n unsigned long p_size;\n struct node {\n node *left, *right;\n node *parent;\n T key;\n ~node() {\n } *root;\n void left_rotate(node *x) {\n node *y = x-&gt;right;\n if (y) {\n x-&gt;right = y-&gt;left;\n if (y-&gt;left) y-&gt;left-&gt;parent = x;\n y-&gt;parent = x-&gt;parent;\n \n if (!x-&gt;parent) root = y;\n else if (x == x-&gt;parent-&gt;left) x-&gt;parent-&gt;left = y;\n else x-&gt;parent-&gt;right = y;\n if (y) y-&gt;left = x;\n x-&gt;parent = y;\n \n void right_rotate(node *x) {\n node *y = x-&gt;left;\n if (y) {\n x-&gt;left = y-&gt;right;\n if (y-&gt;right) y-&gt;right-&gt;parent = x;\n y-&gt;parent = x-&gt;parent;\n if (!x-&gt;parent) root = y;\n else if (x == x-&gt;parent-&gt;left) x-&gt;parent-&gt;left = y;\n else x-&gt;parent-&gt;right = y;\n if (y) y-&gt;right = x;\n x-&gt;parent = y;\n \n void splay(node *x) {\n while (x-&gt;parent) {\n if (!x-&gt;parent-&gt;parent) {\n if (x-&gt;parent-&gt;left == x) right_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n else left_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n } else if (x-&gt;parent-&gt;left == x &amp;&amp; x-&gt;parent-&gt;parent-&gt;left == x-&gt;parent) {\n right_rotate(x-&gt;parent-&gt;parent);\n right_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n } else if (x-&gt;parent-&gt;right == x &amp;&amp; x-&gt;parent-&gt;parent-&gt;right == x-&gt;parent) {\n left_rotate(x-&gt;parent-&gt;parent);\n left_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n } else if (x-&gt;parent-&gt;left == x &amp;&amp; x-&gt;parent-&gt;parent-&gt;right == x-&gt;parent) {\n right_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n left_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n } else {\n left_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n right_rotate(x-&gt;parent);\n \n void replace(node *u, node *v) {\n if (!u-&gt;parent) root = v;\n else if (u == u-&gt;parent-&gt;left) u-&gt;parent-&gt;left = v;\n else u-&gt;parent-&gt;right = v;\n if (v) v-&gt;parent = u-&gt;parent;\n \n node* subtree_minimum(node *u) {\n while (u-&gt;left) u = u-&gt;left;\n return u;\n \n node* subtree_maximum(node *u) {\n while (u-&gt;right) u = u-&gt;right;\n return u;\npublic:\n void insert(const T &amp;key) {\n node *z = root;\n node *p = nullptr;\n while (z) {\n p = z;\n if (comp(z-&gt;key, key)) z = z-&gt;right;\n else z = z-&gt;left;\n \n z = new node(key);\n z-&gt;parent = p;\n if (!p) root = z;\n else if (comp(p-&gt;key, z-&gt;key)) p-&gt;right = z;\n else p-&gt;left = z;\n splay(z);\n p_size++;\n \n node* find(const T &amp;key) {\n node *z = root;\n while (z) {\n if (comp(z-&gt;key, key)) z = z-&gt;right;\n else if (comp(key, z-&gt;key)) z = z-&gt;left;\n else return z;\n return nullptr;\n \n void erase(const T &amp;key) {\n node *z = find(key);\n if (!z) return;\n splay(z);\n if (!z-&gt;left) replace(z, z-&gt;right);\n else if (!z-&gt;right) replace(z, z-&gt;left);\n else {\n node *y = subtree_minimum(z-&gt;right);\n if (y-&gt;parent != z) {\n replace(y, y-&gt;right);\n y-&gt;right = z-&gt;right;\n y-&gt;right-&gt;parent = y;\n replace(z, y);\n y-&gt;left = z-&gt;left;\n y-&gt;left-&gt;parent = y;\n \n delete z;\n p_size--;\n/* //the alternative implementation\n void erase(const T &amp;key) {\n node *z = find(key);\n if (!z) return;\n splay(z);\n node *s = z-&gt;left;\n node *t = z-&gt;right;\n delete z;\n node *sMax = NULL;\n if (s) {\n s-&gt;parent = NULL;\n sMax = subtree_maximum(s);\n splay(sMax);\n root = sMax;\n if (t) {\n if (s)\n sMax-&gt;right = t;\n else\n root = t;\n t-&gt;parent = sMax;\n \n p_size--;\nAnalysis.\nA simple amortized analysis of static splay trees can be carried out using the potential method. Define:\n\u03a6 will tend to be high for poorly balanced trees and low for well-balanced trees.\nTo apply the potential method, we first calculate \u0394\u03a6: the change in the potential caused by a splay operation. We check each case separately. Denote by rank' the rank function after the operation. x, p and g are the nodes affected by the rotation operation (see figures above).\nZig-zag step.\nThe amortized cost of any operation is \u0394\u03a6 plus the actual cost. The actual cost of any zig-zig or zig-zag operation is 2 since there are two rotations to make. Hence:\nWhen summed over the entire splay operation, this telescopes to 1 + 3(rank(root)\u2212rank(\"x\")) which is O(log \"n\"), since we use The Zig operation at most once and the amortized cost of zig is at most 1+3(rank'(\"x\")\u2212rank(\"x\")).\nSo now we know that the total \"amortized\" time for a sequence of \"m\" operations is:\nformula_1\nTo go from the amortized time to the actual time, we must add the decrease in potential from the initial state before any operation is done (\u03a6\"i\") to the final state after all operations are completed (\u03a6\"f\").\nformula_2\nwhere the big O notation can be justified by the fact that for every node \"x\", the minimum rank is 0 and the maximum rank is log(\"n\").\nNow we can finally bound the actual time:\nformula_3\nWeighted analysis.\nThe above analysis can be generalized in the following way.\nThe same analysis applies and the amortized cost of a splaying operation is again:\nformula_4\nwhere \"W\" is the sum of all weights.\nThe decrease from the initial to the final potential is bounded by:\nformula_5\nsince the maximum size of any single node is \"W\" and the minimum is \"w(x)\".\nHence the actual time is bounded by:\nformula_6\nPerformance theorems.\nThere are several theorems and conjectures regarding the worst-case runtime for performing a sequence \"S\" of \"m\" accesses in a splay tree containing \"n\" elements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBalance Theorem\u2014The cost of performing the sequence \"S\" is formula_7.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\n \nThis theorem implies that splay trees perform as well as static balanced binary search trees on sequences of at least \"n\" accesses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStatic Optimality Theorem\u2014Let formula_8 be the number of times element \"x\" is accessed in \"S\". If every element is accessed at least once, then the cost of performing \"S\" is formula_9 \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\n \nThis theorem implies that splay trees perform as well as an optimum static binary search tree on sequences of at least \"n\" accesses. They spend less time on the more frequent items. Another way of stating the same result is that, on input sequences where the items are drawn independently at random from a non-uniform probability distribution on \"n\" items, the amortized expected (average case) cost of each access is proportional to the entropy of the distribution.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStatic Finger Theorem\u2014Assume that the items are numbered from 1 through \"n\" in ascending order. Let \"f\" be any fixed element (the 'finger'). Then the cost of performing \"S\" is formula_10 be the number of distinct elements accessed before the previous time element x was accessed. The cost of performing \"S\" is formula_11 \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\n \nThis theorem is equivalent to splay trees having key-independent optimality.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nScanning Theorem\u2014Also known as the Sequential Access Theorem or the Queue theorem. Accessing the \"n\" elements of a splay tree in symmetric order takes \"O\"(\"n\") time, regardless of the initial structure of the splay tree. The tightest upper bound proven so far is formula_12.\nDynamic optimality conjecture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in computer science\nDo splay trees perform as well as any other binary search tree algorithm?\nMore unsolved problems in computer science\nIn addition to the proven performance guarantees for splay trees there is an unproven conjecture of great interest from the original Sleator and Tarjan paper. This conjecture is known as the \"dynamic optimality conjecture\" and it basically claims that splay trees perform as well as any other binary search tree algorithm up to a constant factor.\nDynamic Optimality Conjecture: Let formula_13 be any binary search tree algorithm that accesses an element formula_14 by traversing the path from the root to formula_14 at a cost of formula_16, and that between accesses can make any rotations in the tree at a cost of 1 per rotation. Let formula_17 be the cost for formula_13 to perform the sequence formula_19 of accesses. Then the cost for a splay tree to perform the same accesses is formula_20.\nThere are several corollaries of the dynamic optimality conjecture that remain unproven:\nTraversal Conjecture: Let formula_21 and formula_22 be two splay trees containing the same elements. Let formula_19 be the sequence obtained by visiting the elements in formula_22 in preorder (i.e., depth first search order). The total cost of performing the sequence formula_19 of accesses on formula_21 is formula_27.\nDeque Conjecture: Let formula_19 be a sequence of formula_29 double-ended queue operations (push, pop, inject, eject). Then the cost of performing formula_19 on a splay tree is formula_31.\nSplit Conjecture: Let formula_19 be any permutation of the elements of the splay tree. Then the cost of deleting the elements in the order formula_19, splitting each tree into two separate trees at each deleted item, is formula_27.\nVariants.\nIn order to reduce the number of restructuring operations, it is possible to replace the splaying with \"semi-splaying\", in which an element is splayed only halfway towards the root.\nAnother way to reduce restructuring is to do full splaying, but only in some of the access operations \u2013 only when the access path is longer than a threshold, or only in the first \"m\" access operations.\nThe CBTree augments the splay tree with access counts at each node and uses them to restructure infrequently. A variant of the CBTree called the LazyCBTree does at most one rotation on each lookup. This is used along with an optimistic hand-over-hand validation scheme to make a concurrent self-adjusting tree.\nUsing pointer-compression techniques, it is possible to construct a succinct splay tree.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "28387", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28387", "title": "Spirituality", "text": "Philosophical and theological term\nThe meaning of spirituality has developed and expanded over time, and various meanings can be found alongside each other. Traditionally, spirituality referred to a religious process of re-formation which \"aims to recover the original shape of man\", oriented at \"the image of God\" as exemplified by the founders and sacred texts of the religions of the world. The term was used within early Christianity to refer to a life oriented toward the Holy Spirit and broadened during the Late Middle Ages to include mental aspects of life.\nIn modern times, the term has spread to other religious traditions. It broadened to refer to a wider range of experiences, including a range of esoteric and religious traditions. Modern usages tend to refer to a subjective experience of a sacred dimension, and the \"deepest values and meanings by which people live\", often in a context separate from organized religious institutions. This may involve belief in a supernatural realm beyond the ordinarily observable world, personal growth, a quest for an ultimate or sacred meaning, religious experience, or an encounter with one's own \"inner dimension\" or spirit.\nEtymology.\nThe term spirit means \"animating or vital principle in man and animals\". It is derived from the Old French , which comes from the Latin word (soul, ghost, courage, vigor, breath) and is related to \"spirare\" (to breathe). In the Vulgate, the Latin word is used to translate the Greek \"pneuma\" and Hebrew \"ruach\".\nThe term \"spiritual\", meaning \"concerning the spirit\", is derived from Old French (12c.), which is derived from Latin , which comes by or \"spirit\".\nThe term \"spirituality\" is derived from Middle French ', from Late Latin (nominative ), which is also derived from Latin '.\nDefinition.\nThere is no single, widely agreed-upon definition of spirituality. Surveys of the definition of the term, as used in scholarly research, show a broad range of definitions with limited overlap. A survey of reviews by McCarroll, each dealing with the topic of spirituality, gave twenty-seven explicit definitions among which \"there was little agreement\". This causes some difficulty in trying to study spirituality systematically; i.e., it impedes both understanding and the capacity to communicate findings in a meaningful fashion.\nAccording to Kees Waaijman, the traditional meaning of spirituality is a process of re-formation that \"aims to recover the original shape of man, the image of God. To accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in Judaism the Torah, in Christianity there is Christ, for Buddhism, Buddha, and in Islam, Muhammad.\" Houtman and Aupers suggest that modern spirituality is a blend of humanistic psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions, and Eastern religions.\nIn modern times the emphasis is on subjective experience and the \"deepest values and meanings by which people live\", incorporating personal growth or transformation, usually in a context separate from organized religious institutions. Spirituality can be defined generally as an individual's search for ultimate or sacred meaning, and purpose in life. Additionally it can mean to seek out or search for personal growth, religious experience, belief in a supernatural realm or afterlife, or to make sense of one's own \"inner dimension\".\nDevelopment of the meaning of spirituality.\nClassical, medieval, and early modern periods.\nBergomi detects \"an enlightened form of non-religious spirituality\" in late antiquity.\nIn ancient Rome, the concept of spirituality consisted mainly of the pax deorum (the peace of the gods); this was achieved through rituals and festivals that ensured divine favour and cosmic order. While Roman spirituality was communal, it also involved personal engagement with the divine through the study of mythology and philosophy. Myths served as allegories for moral lessons and models for personal conduct, guiding individuals in their relationship with the gods. The influence of Pythagorean philosophy, especially the Golden Verses, encouraged introspection, self-discipline, and ethical living. This blend of myth, philosophy, and ritual shaped a spirituality focused on both societal harmony and personal connection with the divine.\nWords translatable as \"spirituality\" first began to arise in the 5th century and only entered common use toward the end of the Middle Ages. In a Biblical context the term means being animated by God. The New Testament offers the concept of being driven by the Holy Spirit, as opposed to living a life in which one rejects this influence.\nIn the 11th century, this meaning of \"Spirituality\" changed. Instead, the word began to denote the mental aspect of life, as opposed to the material and sensual aspects of life, \"the ecclesiastical sphere of light against the dark world of matter\". In the 13th century \"spirituality\" acquired a social and psychological meaning. Socially it denoted the territory of the clergy: \"the ecclesiastical against the temporary possessions, the ecclesiastical against the secular authority, the clerical class against the secular class\". Psychologically, it denoted the realm of the inner life: \"the purity of motives, affections, intentions, inner dispositions, the psychology of the spiritual life, the analysis of the feelings\".\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, a distinction was made between higher and lower forms of spirituality: \"A spiritual man is one who is Christian 'more abundantly and deeper than others'.\" The word was also associated with mysticism and quietism, and acquired a negative meaning.\nModern spirituality.\nModern notions of spirituality developed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, mixing Christian ideas with Western esoteric traditions and elements of Asian, especially Indian, religions. Spirituality became increasingly disconnected from traditional religious organizations and institutions. It is sometimes associated today with philosophical, social, or political movements such as liberalism, feminist theology, and green politics.\nModern Roman religion.\nIn modern Roman neopagan spirituality, initiation is a central element that facilitates deeper spiritual development and access to sacred knowledge. It is viewed as a transformative process, guiding the initiate through stages of spiritual growth. Initiation introduces the individual to the esoteric meanings of Roman myths, deities, and the concept of pax deorum (peace of the gods), aligning the individual with cosmic order. This process not only prepares the initiate for participation in rituals but also emphasizes personal alignment with the divine will. As such, initiation is both a rite of passage and a means to engage meaningfully with divine forces, ensuring the individual's spiritual preparedness to uphold the traditions of Roman religious practice.\nTranscendentalism and Unitarian Universalism.\nRalph Waldo Emerson (1803\u20131882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field. He was one of the major figures in Transcendentalism, an early 19th-century liberal Protestant movement, which was rooted in English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher, the skepticism of Hume, and Neoplatonism.\nThe Transcendentalists emphasized an intuitive, experiential approach to religion. Following Schleiermacher, an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth. In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking. They also endorsed universalist and Unitarianist ideas, leading to Unitarian Universalism, the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.\nTheosophy, anthroposophy, and the perennial philosophy.\nA major influence on modern spirituality was the Theosophical Society, which searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions. It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably Neo-Vedanta, the revival of Theravada Buddhism, and Buddhist modernism, which have taken over modern western notions of personal experience and universalism and integrated them in their religious concepts. A second, related influence was Anthroposophy, whose founder, Rudolf Steiner, was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, and in the ways that such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as education, agriculture, and medicine. More independently, the spiritual science of Martinus was an influence, especially in Scandinavia.\nThe influence of Asian traditions on Western modern spirituality was also furthered by the perennial philosophy, whose main proponent Aldous Huxley was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's Neo-Vedanta and universalism, and the spread of social welfare, education and mass travel after World War II.\nNeo-Vedanta.\nAn important influence on western spirituality was Neo-Vedanta, also called \"neo-Hinduism\" and \"Hindu Universalism\", a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and orientalism. It aims to present Hinduism as a \"homogenized ideal of Hinduism\" with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine. Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the 19th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity. Unitarianism, and the idea of Universalism, was brought to India by missionaries, and had a major influence on neo-Hinduism via Ram Mohan Roy's Brahmo Samaj and Brahmoism. Roy attempted to modernise and reform Hinduism from the idea of Universalism. This universalism was further popularised, and brought back to the West as neo-Vedanta, by Swami Vivekananda.\nCarl Jung.\nCarl Jung placed a strong emphasis on the occult and spirituality. In his 1928 work \"The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man,\" Jung wrote, \"[T]he various forms of religion no longer appear to come from within, from the psyche; they seem more like items from the inventory of the outside world.\" Jung believed that something was missing in modern man, a sense of the mystical or the spiritual.\n\"Spiritual but not religious\".\nAfter the Second World War, spirituality and theistic religion became increasingly disconnected, and spirituality became more oriented on subjective experience, instead of \"attempts to place the self within a broader ontological context\". A new discourse developed, in which (humanistic) psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions and eastern religions are being blended, to reach the true self by self-disclosure, free expression, and meditation.\nThe distinction between the spiritual and the religious became more common in the popular mind during the late 20th century with the rise of secularism and the advent of the New Age movement. Authors such as Chris Griscom and Shirley MacLaine explored it in numerous ways in their books. Paul Heelas noted the development within New Age circles of what he called \"seminar spirituality\": structured offerings complementing consumer choice with spiritual options.\nAmong other factors, declining membership of organized religions and the growth of secularism in the western world have given rise to this broader view of spirituality. The term \"spiritual\" is now frequently used in contexts in which the term \"religious\" was formerly employed. Both theists and atheists have criticized this development.\nTraditional spirituality.\nAbrahamic faiths.\nJudaism.\nSpirituality in Judaism () may involve practices of Jewish ethics, Jewish prayer, Jewish meditation, Shabbat and holiday observance, Torah study, dietary laws, teshuvah, and other practices. It may involve practices ordained by halakhah or other practices. Common to all of these experiences is that they are done communally.\nKabbalah (literally \"receiving\") is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought of Judaism. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious Ein Sof (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). Interpretations of Kabbalistic spirituality are found within Hasidic Judaism, a branch of Orthodox Judaism founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov. Hasidism often emphasizes the Immanent Divine presence and focuses on emotion, fervour, and the figure of the Tzadik. This movement included an elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine Panentheism.\nThe Musar movement is a Jewish spiritual movement that has focused on developing character traits such as faith, humility, and love. The Musar movement, first founded in the 19th century by Israel Salanter and developed in the 21st century by Alan Morinis and Ira F. Stone, has encouraged spiritual practices of Jewish meditation, Jewish prayer, Jewish ethics, tzedakah, teshuvah, and the study of musar (ethical) literature.\nReform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have often emphasized the spirituality of Jewish ethics and tikkun olam, feminist spirituality, Jewish prayer, Torah study, ritual, and musar.\nChristianity.\nChristian spirituality is the spiritual practice of living out a personal faith. Pope Francis offered several ways in which the calling of Christian spirituality can be considered:\nThe terminology of the Catholic Church refers to an act of faith (\"fides qua creditur\") following the acceptance of faith (\"fides quae creditur\"). Although all Catholics are expected to pray together at Mass, there are many different forms of spirituality and private prayer that have developed over the centuries. Each of the major religious orders of the Catholic Church and other lay groupings have their own unique spirituality\u00a0\u2013 its own way of approaching God in prayer and in living out the Gospel.\nChristian mysticism refers to the development of mystical practices and theory within Christianity. It has often been connected to mystical theology, especially in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. The attributes and means by which Christian mysticism is studied and practiced are varied and range from ecstatic visions of the soul's mystical union with God to simple prayerful contemplation of Holy Scripture (i.e., \"Lectio Divina\").\nProgressive Christianity is a contemporary movement which seeks to remove the supernatural claims of the faith and replace them with a post-critical understanding of biblical spirituality based on historical and scientific research. It focuses on the lived experience of spirituality over historical dogmatic claims, and accepts that the faith is both true and a human construction, and that spiritual experiences are psychologically and neurally real and useful.\nIslam.\nAn inner spiritual struggle and an outer physical struggle are two commonly accepted meanings of the Arabic word \"jihad\":. The \"greater jihad\" is the inner struggle by a believer to fulfill his religious duties and fight against one's ego. This non-violent meaning is stressed by both Muslim and non-Muslim authors.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi, an 11th-century Islamic scholar, referenced a statement by the companion of Muhammad, Jabir ibn Abd-Allah:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Prophet ... returned from one of his battles, and thereupon told us, 'You have arrived with an excellent arrival, you have come from the Lesser Jihad to the Greater Jihad\u00a0\u2013 the striving of a servant (of Allah) against his desires (holy war).\"\nSufism.\nThe best known form of Islamic mystic spirituality is the Sufi tradition (famous through Rumi and Hafiz) in which a Sheikh or \"pir\" transmits spiritual discipline to students.\nSufism or () is defined by its adherents as the inner, mystical dimension of Islam. A practitioner of this tradition is generally known as a \"\" (). Sufis believe they are practicing ihsan (perfection of worship) as revealed by Gabriel to Muhammad,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Worship and serve Allah as you are seeing Him and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you.\nSufis consider themselves as the original true proponents of this pure original form of Islam. They are strong adherents to the principal of tolerance, peace and against any form of violence. The Sufi have suffered severe persecution by more rigid and fundamentalist groups such as the Wahhabi and Salafi movement. In 1843 the Senussi Sufi were forced to flee Mecca and Medina and head to Sudan and Libya.\nClassical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as \"a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God\". Alternatively, in the words of the Darqawi Sufi teacher Ahmad ibn Ajiba, \"a science through which one can know how to travel into the presence of the Divine, purify one's inner self from filth, and beautify it with a variety of praiseworthy traits\".\nIndian religions.\nJainism.\nJainism, traditionally known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion. The three main pillars of Jainism are ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (non-violence), anek\u0101ntav\u0101da (non-absolutism), and aparigraha (non-attachment). Jains take five main vows: ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing), brahmacharya (sexual continence), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle. Parasparopagraho j\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m (the function of souls is to help one another) is the faith's motto and the \u1e46am\u014dk\u0101ra mantra is its most common and basic prayer.\nJainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four leaders or Tirthankaras, with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the tradition holds to have lived millions of years ago; the twenty-third tirthankara Parshvanatha, whom historians date to 9th century BCE; and the twenty-fourth tirthankara, Mahavira around 600\u00a0BCE. Jainism is considered to be an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle of the cosmology.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhist practices are known as Bhavana, which literally means \"development\" or \"cultivating\" or \"producing\" in the sense of \"calling into existence\". It is an important concept in Buddhist praxis (\"Patipatti\"). The word \"bhavana\" normally appears in conjunction with another word forming a compound phrase such as \"citta-bhavana\" (the development or cultivation of the heart/mind) or \"metta-bhavana\" (the development/cultivation of loving kindness). When used on its own \"bhavana\" signifies 'spiritual cultivation' generally.\nVarious Buddhist paths to liberation developed throughout the ages. Best-known is the Noble Eightfold Path, but others include the Bodhisattva Path and Lamrim.\nHinduism.\nHinduism has no traditional ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no governing body, no prophets nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, henotheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, or atheistic. Within this diffuse and open structure, spirituality in Hindu philosophy is an individual experience, and referred to as ksaitraj\u00f1a (). It defines spiritual practice as one's journey towards moksha, awareness of self, the discovery of higher truths, Ultimate reality, and a consciousness that is liberated and content.\nFour paths.\nTraditionally, Hinduism identifies three \"m\u0101rga\" (ways) of spiritual practice, namely J\u00f1\u0101na (\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928), the way of knowledge; Bhakti, the way of devotion; and Karma yoga, the way of selfless action. In the 19th century Vivekananda, in his neo-Vedanta synthesis of Hinduism, added R\u0101ja yoga, the way of contemplation and meditation, as a fourth way, calling all of them \"yoga\".\nJ\u00f1\u0101na marga is a path often assisted by a \"guru\" (teacher) in one's spiritual practice. Bhakti marga is a path of faith and devotion to deity or deities; the spiritual practice often includes chanting, singing and music \u2013 such as in \"kirtans\" \u2013 in front of idols, or images of one or more deity, or a devotional symbol of the holy. Karma marga is the path of one's work, where diligent practical work or \"vartta\" (, profession) becomes in itself a spiritual practice, and work in daily life is perfected as a form of spiritual liberation and not for its material rewards. R\u0101ja marga is the path of cultivating necessary virtues, self-discipline, \"tapas\" (meditation), contemplation and self-reflection sometimes with isolation and renunciation of the world, to a pinnacle state called \"sam\u0101dhi\". This state of \"sam\u0101dhi\" has been compared to peak experience.\nThere is a rigorous debate in Indian literature on relative merits of these theoretical spiritual practices. For example, Chandogyopanishad suggests that those who engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice, while those who engage in \"tapas\" will succeed; Shvetashvatara Upanishad suggests that a successful spiritual practice requires a longing for truth, but warns of becoming 'false ascetic' who go through the mechanics of spiritual practice without meditating on the nature of Self and universal Truths. In the practice of Hinduism, suggest modern era scholars such as Vivekananda, the choice between the paths is up to the individual and a person's proclivities. Other scholars suggest that these Hindu spiritual practices are not mutually exclusive, but overlapping. These four paths of spirituality are also known in Hinduism outside India, such as in Balinese Hinduism, where it is called \"Chatur Marga\" (literally: four paths).\nSchools and spirituality.\nDifferent schools of Hinduism encourage different spiritual practices. In Tantric school for example, the spiritual practice has been referred to as \"s\u0101dhan\u0101\". It involves initiation into the school, undergoing rituals, and achieving moksha liberation by experiencing union of cosmic polarities. The Hare Krishna school emphasizes bhakti yoga as spiritual practice. In Advaita Vedanta school, the spiritual practice emphasizes j\u00f1\u0101na yoga in stages: samnyasa (cultivate virtues), sravana (hear, study), manana (reflect) and dhyana (nididhyasana, contemplate).\nSikhism.\nSikhism considers spiritual life and secular life to be intertwined: \"In the Sikh Weltanschauung\u00a0... the temporal world is part of the Infinite Reality and partakes of its characteristics.\" Guru Nanak described living an \"active, creative, and practical life\" of \"truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity\" as being higher than a purely contemplative life.\nThe 6th Sikh Guru Guru Hargobind re-affirmed that the political/temporal (Miri) and spiritual (Piri) realms are mutually coexistent. According to the 9th Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadhur, the ideal Sikh should have both Shakti (power that resides in the temporal), and Bhakti (spiritual meditative qualities). This was developed into the concept of the Saint Soldier by the 10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh.\nAccording to Guru Nanak, the goal is to attain the \"attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life\", the polar opposite to a self-centered existence. Nanak talks further about the one God or akal (timelessness) that permeates all life). and which must be seen with 'the inward eye', or the 'heart', of a human being.\nIn Sikhism there is no dogma, priests, monastics or yogis.\nAfrican spirituality.\nIn some African contexts, spirituality is considered a belief system that guides the welfare of society and the people therein, and eradicates sources of unhappiness occasioned by evil.\nIn traditional society prior to colonization and extensive introduction to Christianity or Islam, religion was the strongest element in society influencing the thinking and actions of the people. Hence spirituality was a sub-domain of religion. Despite the rapid social, economic and political changes of the last century, traditional religion remains the essential background for many African people. And that religion is a communal given, not an individual choice. Religion gives all of life its meaning and provides ground for action. Each person is \"a living creed of his religion\". There is no concern for spiritual matters apart from ones physical and communal life. Life continues after death but remains focused on pragmatic family and community matters.\nContemporary spirituality.\nThe term \"spiritual\" has frequently become used in contexts in which the term \"religious\" was formerly employed. Contemporary spirituality is also called \"post-traditional spirituality\" and \"New Age spirituality\". Hanegraaf makes a distinction between two \"New Age\" movements: New Age in a restricted sense, which originated primarily in mid-twentieth century England and had its roots in Theosophy and Anthroposophy, and \"New Age\" in a general sense, which emerged in the later 1970s:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;when increasing numbers of people ... began to perceive a broad similarity between a wide variety of \"alternative ideas\" and pursuits, and started to think of them as part of one \"movement\".\nThose who speak of spirituality outside of religion often define themselves as \"spiritual but not religious\", and generally believe in the existence of different \"spiritual paths\", emphasizing the importance of finding one's own individual path to spirituality. According to one 2005 poll, about 24% of the United States population identifies itself as \"spiritual but not religious\".\nLockwood draws attention to the variety of spiritual experience in the contemporary West:\nThe new Western spiritual landscape, characterised by consumerism and choice abundance, is scattered with novel religious manifestations based in psychology and the Human Potential Movement, each offering participants a pathway to the Self.\nThose who speak of spirituality within religion also recognise the need for spirituality to take on a contemporary form: thus, for example, Pope Francis referred to and reflected on \"contemporary devotion\" in his encyclical letter \"Dilexit nos\" issued in 2024.\nCharacteristics.\nModern spirituality centers on the \"deepest values and meanings by which people live\". It often embraces the idea of an ultimate or an alleged immaterial reality. It envisions an inner path enabling a person to discover the essence of his or her being.\nNot all modern notions of spirituality embrace transcendental ideas. Secular spirituality emphasizes humanistic ideas on moral character (qualities such as love, compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, responsibility, harmony, and a concern for others). These are aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialist view of the world without necessarily accepting belief in a supernatural reality or any divine being. Nevertheless, many humanists (e.g. Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre) who clearly value the non-material, communal, and virtuous aspects of life reject this usage of the term \"spirituality\" as being overly-broad (i.e. it effectively amounts to saying \"everything and anything that is good and virtuous is \"necessarily\" spiritual\"). In 1930 Russell, a self-described agnostic renowned as an atheist, wrote \"... one's ego is no very large part of the world. The man who can centre his thoughts and hopes upon something transcending self can find a certain peace in the ordinary troubles of life which is impossible to the pure egoist.\"\nSimilarly, Aristotle\u00a0\u2013 one of the first known Western thinkers to demonstrate that morality, virtue and goodness can be derived without appealing to supernatural forces\u00a0\u2013 argued that \"men create Gods in their own image\" (not the other way around). Moreover, theistic and atheistic critics alike dismiss the need for the \"secular spirituality\" label on the basis that it appears to be nothing more than obscurantism in that:\nAlthough personal well-being, both physical and psychological, is said to be an important aspect of modern spirituality, this does not imply that spirituality is \"essential\" to achieving happiness (e.g. http:// ). Free-thinkers who reject notions that the numinous or non-material is important to living well can be just as happy as more spiritually-oriented individuals (https://)\nContemporary proponents of spirituality may suggest that spirituality develops inner peace and forms a foundation for happiness. For example, meditation and similar practices are suggested to help the practitioner cultivate a personal inner life and character. Ellison and Fan (2008) assert that spirituality \"causes\" a wide array of positive health outcomes, including \"morale, happiness, and life satisfaction\". However, Schuurmans-Stekhoven (2013) actively attempted to replicate this research and found more \"mixed\" results. Nevertheless, spirituality has played a central role in some self-help movements such as Alcoholics Anonymous:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSuch spiritually-informed treatment approaches have been challenged as pseudoscience.\nSpiritual experience.\nSpiritual experiences play a central role in modern spirituality. Both western and Asian authors have popularised this notion. Important early-20th century Western writers who studied the phenomenon of spirituality, and their works, include William James, \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\" (1902) and Rudolph Otto, especially \"The Idea of the Holy\" (1917)\nJames' notions of \"spiritual experience\" had a further influence on the modernist streams in Asian traditions, making them even further recognisable for a western audience.\nWilliam James popularized the use of the term \"religious experience\" in his \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\". He has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which allegedly grants knowledge.\nWayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834), who argued that religion is based on a \"feeling\" of the infinite. Schleiermacher used the idea of \"religious experience\" to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. Many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential, adopted the concept.\nMajor Asian influences on contemporary spirituality have included Swami Vivekananda (1863\u20131902) and D. T. Suzuki (1870\u20131966). Vivekananda popularised a modern syncretic Hinduism in which an emphasis on personal experience replaced the authority of scriptures. Suzuki had a major influence on the popularisation of Zen in the west and popularized the idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality. Other influences came through Paul Brunton's \"A Search in Secret India\" (1934), which introduced Ramana Maharshi (1879\u20131950) and Meher Baba (1894\u20131969) to a western audience.\nSpiritual experiences can include being connected to a larger reality, yielding a more comprehensive self; joining with other individuals or the human community; with nature or the cosmos; or with the divine realm.\nSpiritual practices.\nKees Waaijman discerns four forms of spiritual practices:\nSpiritual practices may include meditation, mindfulness, prayer, the contemplation of sacred texts, ethical development,\nand spiritual retreats in a convent. Love and/or compassion are often described as the mainstay of spiritual development.\nWithin spirituality is also found \"a common emphasis on the value of thoughtfulness, tolerance for breadth and practices and beliefs, and appreciation for the insights of other religious communities, as well as other sources of authority within the social sciences\".\nScientific research.\nHealth and well-being.\nVarious studies (most originating from North America) have reported a positive correlation between spirituality and mental well-being in both healthy people and those encountering a range of physical illnesses or psychological disorders. Although spiritual individuals tend to be optimistic, report greater social support, and experience higher intrinsic meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, whether the correlation represents a causal link remains contentious. Both supporters and opponents of this claim agree that past statistical findings are difficult to interpret, in large part because of the ongoing disagreement over how spirituality should be defined and measured. There is also evidence that an agreeable/positive temperament and/or a tendency toward sociability (which all correlate with spirituality) might actually be the key psychological features that predispose people to subsequently adopt a spiritual orientation and that these characteristics, not spiritually \"per se\", add to well-being. There is also some suggestion that the benefits associated with spirituality and religiosity might arise from being a member of a close-knit community. Social bonds available via secular sources (i.e., not unique to spirituality or faith-based groups) might just as effectively raise well-being. In sum, spirituality may not be the \"active ingredient\" (i.e., past association with psychological well-being measures might reflect a reverse causation or effects from other variables that correlate with spirituality), and that the effects of agreeableness, conscientiousness, or virtue\u00a0\u2013 personality traits common in many non-spiritual people yet known to be slightly more common among the spiritual\u00a0\u2013 may better account for spirituality's apparent correlation with mental health and social support.\nIntercessionary prayer.\nMasters and Spielmans conducted a meta-analysis of all the available and reputable research examining the effects of distant intercessory prayer. They found no discernible health effects from being prayed for by others. In fact, one large and scientifically rigorous study by Herbert Benson and colleagues revealed that intercessory prayer had no effect on recovery from cardiac arrest, but patients told people were praying for them actually had an \"increased risk\" of medical complications.\nSpiritual care in health care professions.\nIn the health-care professions there is growing interest in \"spiritual care\", to complement the medical-technical approaches and to improve the outcomes of medical treatments. Puchalski et al. argue for \"compassionate systems of care\" in a spiritual context.\nSpiritual experiences.\nNeuroscientists have examined brain functioning during reported spiritual experiences finding that certain neurotransmitters and specific areas of the brain are involved. Moreover, experimenters have also successfully induced spiritual experiences in individuals by administering psychoactive agents known to elicit euphoria and perceptual distortions. Conversely, religiosity and spirituality can also be \"dampened\" by electromagnetic stimulation of the brain. These results have motivated some leading theorists to speculate that spirituality may be a benign subtype of psychosis \u2013 benign in the sense that the same aberrant sensory perceptions that those suffering clinical psychoses evaluate as distressingly incongruent and inexplicable are instead interpreted by spiritual individuals as positive (personal and meaningful transcendent experiences).\nMeasurement.\nConsiderable debate persists about\u00a0\u2013 among other factors\u00a0\u2013 spirituality's relation to religion, the number and content of its dimensions, its relation to concepts of well-being, and its universality. A number of research groups have developed instruments which attempt to measure spirituality quantitatively, including unidimensional (e.g. the Character Strength Inventory\u2014Spirituality and the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale) and multi-dimensional (e.g. Spiritual Transcendence Scale (STS) and the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS)) scales. MacDonald et al. gave an \"Expressions of Spirituality Inventory\" (ESI-R) measuring five dimensions of spirituality to over 4000 persons across eight countries. The study results and interpretation highlighted the complexity and challenges of measurement of spirituality cross-culturally.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPublished sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb-sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some characters appear in \"The Sandman\" (1989\u20131994), some in spinoffs like \"The Dreaming\" (1996\u20132001) and \"Lucifer\" (1999\u20132007), and others in earlier stories that \"The Sandman\" was based on as well as the podcast and the Netflix TV series. Their stories occur in the DC Universe, generally tangentially to the mainstream DC stories.\nThe Endless.\nThe Endless are a family of seven anthropomorphic personifications of universal concepts, around whom much of the series revolves. They are the children of Mother Night and Father Time. All debuted in the \"Sandman\" series, except Destiny, who was created by Marv Wolfman and Berni Wrightson in \"Weird Mystery Tales\" #1 (1972).\nFrom eldest to youngest, they are:\nTime.\nTime is the personification of time and the father of the Endless. He resides in the Realm of Time and was the one who gifted Destiny with his Cosmic Log.\nIn the Netflix series, Time is portrayed by Rufus Sewell.\nNight.\nNight is the personification of night and the mother of the Endless through Time.\nIn the Netflix series, Night is portrayed by Tanya Moodie.\nDreams and nightmares.\nThese inhabitants of the Dreaming are often ordinary human beings who later became either dreams or nightmares.\nCain and Abel.\nCain and Abel are based on the Biblical Cain and Abel, adapted by editor Joe Orlando with Bob Haney (writer) and Jack Sparling (artist) (Cain), and Mark Hannerfeld (writer) and Bill Draut (artist) (Abel). They were depicted together in Abel's first appearance, and parted to their respective Houses at the end of the story. Although Cain would abuse Abel, he was not shown killing him until \"Swamp Thing\" vol. 2 #33. In \"Elvira's House of Mystery\" #11, Cain expresses shock at having killed his brother in recent times. In the same issue, a contest-winning letter establishes that Cain and the House exist both in the dream world and the real world, and that only in the dream world does Cain continue to harm Abel. In \"The Sandman\", Cain is shown to kill Abel quite often. In issue #2, Lucien calls this unusual and recent.\nOriginally, they were the respective \"hosts\" of the EC-style horror comic anthologies \"House of Mystery\" and \"House of Secrets\" which ran from the 1950s through 1983\u2014Cain debuting in \"House of Mystery\" #175 (1968) and Abel in \"DC Special\" #4 and \"House of Secrets\" #81 (both 1969). During the 1970s, they also co-hosted the horror/humor anthology \"Plop!\". They were also both recurring characters in DC's \"Elvira's House of Mystery\" (1986\u20131988).\nIn 1985, the characters were revived by writer Alan Moore, who introduced them into his \"Swamp Thing\" series in issue #33, retelling the Swamp Thing's original origin story from a 1971 issue of \"House of Secrets\". Gary Cohn and Dan Mishkin included them in the pages of \"Blue Devil\" in 1986. Jamie Delano also occasionally used them in a cameo role in his title \"Hellblazer\".\nIn Gaiman's \"Sandman\" universe, the biblical Cain and Abel live in the Dreaming at Dream's invitation. This is based on the verse in the Bible which says that Cain was sent to live in the Land of Nod. They live as neighbors in two houses near a graveyard: Cain in the broad House of Mystery and Abel in the tall House of Secrets. According to their appearance in \"Swamp Thing\", the difference is that 'a mystery may be shared, but a secret must be forgotten if one tries to tell it'.\nGaiman's Cain is an aggressive, overbearing character. He is a thin, long-limbed man with an angular, drawn face, glasses, a tufty beard, and hair drawn into two points above his ears. He has been described by other characters as sounding \"just like Vincent Price\".\nGaiman's Abel is a nervous but kind-hearted man. He also has a stammer. He is somewhat similar in appearance to Cain, with a tufty beard and hair that comes to points above his ears, though his hair is black rather than brown. He is shorter and fatter than Cain, with a more open face. It is eventually learned that the only time he does not stutter is when he is telling a story or when he is dead.\nCain kills Abel frequently and in many brutal ways, whereupon Abel later returns to life. He often expresses hope for a more harmonious relationship with his brother.\nCain and Abel own a large green draconic gargoyle named Gregory, who also made his debut in \"House of Mystery\" #175. In the first appearance of the characters in \"Sandman\", issue #2, Cain gives Abel an egg that soon hatches into another gargoyle, a small golden one. Abel names the gargoyle \"Irving\". but Cain insists that the names of gargoyles must always begin with a \"G.\", and Abel (after another death and resurrection) renames the gargoyle \"Goldie\", after an invisible/imaginary friend to whom Abel told his early \"House of Secrets\" stories. A letter in issue #91 was attributed to Goldie, who claimed that it was herself depicted on the cover of issue #88.\nThey shelter Dream until his strength is restored following his 72-year-long imprisonment. In the fourth story arc, ', Cain is sent to Hell to give a message to Lucifer because Cain is protected by a curse that would deter Lucifer from harming him. Cain and Abel also aid The Corinthian with the child Daniel during ', the penultimate story arc of the series. Abel is one of the victims of the Furies in this series and is brought back to life by the new Dream at Cain's request.\nIn the podcast, Cain and Abel are voiced by Michael Roberts and Kerry Shale.\nIn the Netflix series \"The Sandman\", Cain and Abel are portrayed by Sanjeev Bhaskar and Asim Chaudhry respectively.\nThe Corinthian.\nThe Corinthian is a nightmare created by Dream, of human appearance but with two small additional mouths in place of his eyes. He enjoys eating the eyeballs of people he kills.\nThe first version of the Corinthian is destroyed by Dream while speaking at a \"Cereal Convention\" for spending several unsupervised decades on Earth as a serial killer (in Dream's view, a waste of his potential), and it is shown in \"\" (2013) that Dream intended to do this before his imprisonment.\nNear the end of the series, Dream creates a second Corinthian, altering his personality to be obedient and useful rather than homicidal. In a later story in \"The Dreaming\", the second Corinthian is haunted by the actions of the first.\nIn the podcast, the Corinthian is voiced by Riz Ahmed.\nThe Corinthian is portrayed by Boyd Holbrook in the Netflix series, having a more expanded role before the Doll's House arc. He is shown to manipulate circumstances regarding Ethel Cripps' death and behaves in a much less hostile way to Jed Walker, appearing to not desire to harm him. He is also shown as gay or pansexual in the series, often having sex with his male victims before killing them.\nEve.\nEve is a special character who has been seen in the \"Lucifer\" series and is depicted as living in a cave in The Dreaming.\nFiddler's Green.\nFiddler's Green is the personification of a place in the Dreaming which all travelers (specifically sailors) dream of someday finding. It sometimes assumes human form and goes wandering under the alias Gilbert, a kindly, portly man who resembles G. K. Chesterton (the G stood for Gilbert) in appearance and behavior. As \"Gilbert\", Fiddler's Green accompanied Rose Walker to find her brother Jed and gave her the means by which to summon Dream to rescue her from danger at the Cereal Convention that the Corinthian was speaking at. Afterwards, Fiddler's Green thereafter returned to the Dreaming and resumed his true form before Rose. He was killed by the Three in \"\" and refused to be resurrected by the new Dream as his death will have no meaning. Dream allows Fiddler's Green to return to the dead.\nIn the podcast, Fiddler's Green is voiced by Ray Porter.\nIn the Netflix series, Fiddler's Green is portrayed by Stephen Fry. This version of Gilbert has a slightly smaller role than in the comics, but still accompanies Rose to the Cereal Convention (under the name of \"Dutch Uncle\", the name of an unseen serial killer in that issue whose name was seen on a piece of paper). Following Corinthian's defeat, Fiddler's Green returns to his true form upon returning to the Dreaming.\nGate Keepers.\nA Wyvern, a Griffin, and a Hippogriff are the gate keepers of Dream's castle and are also referred to as the Guardians of the Gate. The wyvern was more land dragon-like and had no dragon wings until later appearances, the griffin also had a lion mane and has all four legs of a lion, and the hippogriff was depicted with a winged horse-like appearance. The gate keepers often intercept anyone from entering Dream's Ghost Castle. They derive all their power and authority from Dream so when Dream was captured and lost his power, they could no longer guard or protect the Dreaming.\nTheir first comic book appearance was in \"Dream of a Thousand Cats\" where the Siamese Cat had to get past them in order to see the Cat of Dreams.\nIn issue #24, the Guardians of the Gate see a lot of envoys showing up at the Ghost Castle in light of Lucifer's abdication. The Griffin sends a message through his statue in the throne room to inform Dream about it and that the Guardians of the Gate can't keep them all back. Dream instructs the Griffin to tell his fellow Guardians of the Gate to let them in.\nDelirium later runs into the Guardians of the Gate where she is briefly picked up by the Wyvern when she tried to enter Dream's castle.\nAfter the Griffin was destroyed by the Three in their Erinyes aspect, the new Dream did not recreate him. Instead, he asked the Gryphons of Greek myth to send one of their own. The Queen of Gryphons dispatches a Gryphon of Arimapsa to replace the Dreaming's Griffin. When Matthew meets this Gryphon (who is depicted with cattle-like hooves for back legs) and informs him of being the only Griffin of his land to meet the new Dream's requirements, he informs Matthew that his land of Arimapsa is somewhere far from the Dreaming. The Guardians of the Gate state to Matthew that they have been sent by the new Dream to attend Dream's wake, but opted not to leave their post. (\"The Sandman\" Vol. 2 #71)\nIn the podcast, the Wyvern, the Griffin, and the Hippogriff are voiced by Harry Myers, Ray Porter, and Tom Alexander.\nIn the Netflix series, the Wyvern, the Griffin, and the Hippogriff are shown on the castle with the Wyvern voiced by Nonso Anozie, the Griffin voiced by Diane Morgan in season one and by Jo Martin in season two, and the Hippogriff voiced by Tom Wu in season one and by Paul Rhys in season two. The Wyvern resembled his mythological depiction and the Griffin is a female. Their roles in the animated episode \"Dream of a Thousand Cats\", the confrontation of the envoys, and Delirium's encounter with them remain intact. Unlike the comics, the Kindly Ones' Erinyes aspect tried to kill the Griffin by aging her bones only for Dream to come out and heal her.\nGregory.\nGregory is the pet gargoyle of Cain.\nGregory appears in the Netflix series. He was willingly absorbed by Dream in order to help restore the Dreaming prior to Dream's quest to reclaim his stolen items.\nGoldie.\nGoldie is a fictional character in \"The Sandman\" comic book series by Neil Gaiman.\nGoldie is a pet baby gargoyle, given to Abel by his brother Cain in \"\". Abel originally intends to name him Irving, but Cain insists that gargoyle names must all begin with a \"G\". Cain then proceeded to murder Abel over this. Abel soon returns as he is murdered by Cain all the time. He then agrees to name the gargoyle Goldie, after \"an old friend\", though he tells Goldie in private that he will continue to think of him as Irving.\nGoldie appears for a short scene in ' in which he is sitting upon Abel's shoulder as Lucien asks Abel about the inhabitants of the house. He later appears throughout the \"Parliament of Rooks\" story in ', and briefly at the beginning of '. He also accompanies Abel in ' and is with him when he gets murdered by the Furies, crying when his master is killed. He is later seen playing with Daniel Hall.\nGoldie later takes on a pivotal role as the guardian of the tree of life in the \"Sandman\" spin-off series \"The Dreaming\". On his/her quest to the tree, a search party forms. He was retconned into a female gargoyle for the new series.\nGoldie is named after the \"'imaginary' friend\" to whom Abel would tell his early stories in the pages of \"House of Secrets\".\nIn issue 39 of the 2008 reboot of the \"House of Mystery\" comic series, it is revealed that Goldie is \"Gigi\", a waitress at the House of Mystery and a bit player in the series. Goldie was transformed by Lotus Blossom, another character in the series, at Goldie's request in exchange for a book of magic spells. Goldie was not enthralled with the idea of growing up to be a gargoyle, and instead wanted to be a human girl. The newly reborn Gigi joined Lotus Blossom on her exploits in the series, often serving as an enforcer for her. It is revealed that Abel knows Gigi's true history, but if his brother Cain knew, it was not shown.\nIn the podcast, Goldie's vocal effects were provided by Karen Batke.\nGoldie appears in the Netflix series.\nLucien.\nLucien is the chief librarian in the Dreaming, and is a tall thin, bookish man. He first appeared in \"Weird Mystery Tales\" #18 (May 1975) and was apparently killed in \"Secrets of Haunted House\" #44 (January 1982).\nLike Cain and Abel, Lucien, created by Paul Levitz, Nestor Redondo, and Joe Orlando, was originally the host of a 1970s \"weird tales\" comic, specifically the three-issue \"Tales of Ghost Castle\" (May/June\u2013October 1975). In that series, he is portrayed as the guardian of a castle in Transylvania abandoned by both sides during World War II, watching over its forgotten library with his companion, a werewolf named Rover. In his first appearance in \"\" (issue #2) this is retroactively revealed to be Dream's castle.\nLucien is the effective keeper of the Dreaming in Dream's absence, and becomes one of Dream's most faithful and trusted servants after proving his loyalty by never abandoning his post during that period. His primary function is to protect the Library, wherein are contained all the books that have ever been dreamed of, including the ones that have never been written. The titles of some of these books, many of which are sequels to real works, are visible. He is, despite his frail appearance, apparently quite capable in combat, \"[dealing] with\" several unpleasant creatures who escape imprisonment during the events of \"The Kindly Ones\".\nIn issue #68, it is revealed that Lucien's existence in the Dreaming began as serving the role of Dream's first raven. When writing \"The Sandman Companion\", author Hy Bender interpreted this as meaning that Lucien was also the first man. An allusion to \"Mr. Raven\", the ghostly librarian in George MacDonald's novel \"Lilith\", may be intended.\nIn the podcast, Lucien is voiced by Simon Vance.\nIn the Netflix series, Vivienne Acheampong portrays Lucienne, a gender-swapped version of Lucien.\nMatthew.\nMatthew is the raven companion of Dream.\nMatthew was originally Matthew Cable, a long-time supporting character in the \"Swamp Thing\" series, but because he died while asleep in the Dreaming, he was offered the chance to become a dream raven and serve Dream if he wished, and he accepted.\nMatthew is not the first of Morpheus' ravens. Former ravens include Aristeas of Marmora, who returned to his life as a man for one year at one point, and Lucien, the first of the ravens. Morpheus seems to keep the ravens around out of some sort of unspoken need for companionship, though he also sends them on occasional missions.\nMatthew's word balloons and font style are scratchy and uneven, probably to represent a hoarse, cawing voice, and perhaps as an indicator of his crude, smart-aleck personality. Underneath his frequently irreverent manner, Matthew is actually very loyal to Dream, and he is one of the characters who takes it the hardest when Dream perishes, initially seeking release from his service, but eventually coming to terms with his loss and choosing to remain as Daniel Hall's raven after speaking to different characters.\nIn the podcast, Matthew is voiced by Andy Serkis.\nIn the Netflix series, Matthew is voiced by Patton Oswalt.\nMervyn Pumpkinhead.\nMervyn \"Merv\" Pumpkinhead is Dream's cantankerous, cigar-smoking janitor: an animated scarecrow whose head is a jack-o'-lantern. He resembles Jack Pumpkinhead of L. Frank Baum's Oz books.\nMervyn is first seen in \"\", driving a bus on which Dream travels. Thereafter, Merv is in charge of the construction, maintenance, and demolition work in the Dreaming, though he sometimes complains that his job is superfluous because Dream can change any of the Dreaming at will. One issue of the \"Dreaming\" spin-off comic focuses on a dreamer who enjoys working under Merv's supervision. Later issues have him assisted by Abudah.\nMervyn was one of the few who took arms against the Furies in ', but was easily killed. He is returned to life by the new Dream in ' who rebuilds his body and grows a new pumpkin to serve as his head.\nIn a past incarnation shown in \"\", Mervyn was seen to have had a turnip for a head instead of a pumpkin as pumpkins were not then known in Europe.\nKevin Smith voices Mervyn in the podcast adaptation.\nIn the Netflix series, Mervyn is performed by Nicholas Anscombe and voiced by Mark Hamill.\nMartin Tenbones.\nMartin Tenbones is a large dog-like dream who is Barbie's companion.\nIn the podcast, Martin Tenbones is voiced by Ray Porter.\nIn the Netflix series, Martin Tenbones is voiced by Lenny Henry.\nDora.\nDora is a dream that has the form of a young girl in her 20s. She can also assume a monstrous form.\nMinor dreams.\nBrute and Glob.\nBrute and Glob are two trouble-making nightmares who try to gain power during Dream's absence. They originally appeared in Jack Kirby's 1974 \"Sandman\" series, as sidekicks to the title character, and continued as such when Hector Hall became the Sandman in \"Infinity Inc.\" In the original comics, Brute was similar to Thing where he shouted \"It's clobberin' time!\" and often referred to his Uncle Harry.\nIn \"\", it is revealed that they controlled the Sandmen in secret whereupon Dream exiled them to \"the darkness\" (a place of imprisonment and, presumably, torture, within the Dreaming).\nNear the end of ', the Furies tell Dream that they have released his prisoners from the darkness, but Brute and Glob are neither mentioned nor seen in this volume or in '.\nThey next appear in \"The Dreaming\" #57\u201360, \"The Sandman Presents: Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Dreams\u00a0...

She was once a major goddess, but the loss of her believers over time has significantly reduced her powers. She is often coquettish toward Dream, who sometimes goes to her for advice or companionship; but she has often claimed never to have been his lover. Bast has also appeared in issues of \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Hawkgirl\", wherein she is one of the chief goddesses worshiped by the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall.\nBast appears in \"Sandman Presents: Bast: Eternity Game\" (2003), where she attempts to regain her lost power.\nIn the podcast, Bast is voiced by Bebe Neuwirth.\nThe Presence/The Creator.\nThe Presence is the \"Sandman\" universe's equivalent of a Supreme Being and he shares many characteristics with the standard Abrahamic God, such as almost never taking a physical form, being a Creator deity, and having unmatched power. Nevertheless, Gaiman has on several occasions stated that he never intended the Creator to be any specific religion's god, just as he makes it clear in the first appearance of the abode of the angels, the Silver City, that it \"is not Paradise. It is not Heaven. It is the Silver City, that is not part of the order of created things\", although the Silver City is often identified as \"Heaven\" in the \"Lucifer\" comic book series.\nIn that series, one of the critical turning points is the Presence's abandonment of his Creation, which leads to a large number of problems, including struggles to claim the power that the Creator has abandoned, to make the destruction of the universe inevitable and to the slow unraveling of the universe due to the disappearance of the Name of the Creator written on every atom in existence. This is an ongoing storyline in \"Lucifer\".\nLoki.\nLoki is a trickster god seen in \"; based on the Norse god Loki. In his own form, Loki is a tall, thin man with yellow eyes and long red hair that resembles flames; but he is capable of assuming any appearance at will. He is sometimes nicknamed 'Lie-Smith' and 'Sky-walker' by other characters.\nHe is temporarily freed from his punishment by Odin to accompany his negotiations for the rulership of Hell; whereafter he deceives Odin and Thor into imprisoning another god in his place, but fails to fool Dream, who frees the other god and sends a simulacrum of Loki to take his punishment, in exchange for Loki's debt to himself.\nLoki returns in \", wherein he works with Puck to kidnap Daniel, a child under Dream's protection. The second Corinthian and Matthew eventually find Daniel. Loki attempts to fool them by taking the form of Dream, but the Corinthian strangles Loki and consumes his eyes. A blinded Loki is taken by Odin and Thor back to his punishment.\nLoki reappears in \"Lucifer\" wherein Lucifer comes to Loki to take his ship for his own universe and destroys the snake that tortures Loki, who therefore allows him the ship.\nIn the podcast, Loki is voiced by David Tennant.\nIn the Netflix series, Loki is portrayed by Freddie Fox.\nOdin.\nOdin, as based on the Norse God Odin, appears as an old man wearing a wide-brimmed hat, a cloak, and carrying a staff. He is usually depicted as a dark, mysterious figure, missing one eye and accompanied by two ravens named Huginn and Muninn (\"thought\" and \"memory\"), and two wolves named Geri and Freki.\nOdin appeared in \"Season of Mist\" where he, Thor, and Loki partake in the negotiations for the ruler of Hell.\nIn \"The Kindly Ones\", Odin and Thor take Loki back to his punishment for kidnapping Daniel Hall and causing the Three to kill Dream.\nIn the podcast, Odin is voiced by Bill Nighy.\nIn the Netflix series, Odin is portrayed by Clive Russell. Unlike the comics, Odin responded to the botched mead-themed summon that the second Corinthian prevented Johanna Constantine from doing and intervened before the Corinthian can eat his eyes.\nThe Three.\nThe Three appear in the form of any group of three women; usually the Mother, the Maiden and the Crone, the three aspects of the Triple Goddess in many mythologies. Sometimes, they appear in the form of the three witches from DC's horror anthology \"The Witching Hour\": Mildred, Mordred, and Cynthia. As these witches, they also appeared in a prestige format limited series of the same title, and two standard limited series, \"Witchcraft\" and \"Witchcraft: Le Terreur\".\nThe Three repeatedly appear throughout \"The Sandman\", fulfilling different functions at different points in the story. Their first appearance is in \"The Sandman\" #2, where they appear as the three witches, Mildred (mother), Mordred (crone), and Cynthia (maiden) from the DC horror anthology \"The Witching Hour\". They later take many different forms over the course of the series, and the \"three women\" symbol remains an extremely common one, often blurring the lines between when characters are supposed to be merely themselves and when they are supposed to be representations of the Three. The Three represent the female principle, prophecy, and mystery, and they are often a vaguely menacing and enigmatic presence in the series. Incarnations of the Three include the Erinyes (Furies) in their vengeful aspect and the Moirai (Fates) or Weird Sisters in their divinatory aspect. They also sometimes subtly appear in the form of other characters (such as Eve) or groups of characters. Their Erinyes form were responsible for massacring Dream, Abel, Mervyn Pumpkinhead, Abudah Fiddler's Green, and the Griffin Gate Keeper.\nThe Three later appeared in a graphic novel named \"WitchCraft\", in which one of their priestesses in ancient Rome, Ursula, is raped by barbarians. She is then reincarnated three times, followed by the witches, and wronged again by reincarnations of the barbarian leader until the modern age, when she comes back as his elderly mother-in-law and manages to defeat him. The Three then assure the barbarian that he would be reincarnated as each of the priestesses he had raped, in order, with the exception of Ursula. He would never know what was happening until the moment of death, at which point it would start all over again. The Three are satisfied, and in the end decide that Ursula will live another twenty years and become an accomplished and respected witch in her twilight years, and her grandchild will be beautiful.\nIn the podcast, the Mother is voiced by Ellen Thomas, the Crone is voiced by Cathy Tyson, and the Maiden is voiced by Sandra Dickinson.\nIn the Netflix series, the Mother is portrayed by Nina Wadia, the Crone is portrayed by Souad Faress, and the Maiden is portrayed by Dinita Gohil.\nCalliope.\nCalliope is one of the Muses. She has had a history with Dream's Morpheus alias where they fathered Orpheus.\nIn 1927, Calliope became a prisoner of Erasmus Fry after he found her bathing in a stream on Mount Helicon. He raped her for inspiration. By 1986, Fry gave Calliope to struggling author Richard Madoc and he used her inspiration to write his stories. By the time Dream was freed from his imprisonment, he helped to free her by flooding Richard's mind with too many inspirations. When Richard declared Calliope free, Calliope left to ensure that none of her fellow Muses would get trapped like she did.\nIn the podcast, Calliope is voiced by Samantha B\u00e9art.\nIn the Netflix series, Calliope is portrayed by Melissanthi Mahut.\nOther gods.\nIshtar.\nThe goddess Ishtar, disguised as an exotic dancer; a former lover of Destruction.\nIn the Netflix series, Ishtar is portrayed by Amber Rose Revah.\nPharamond.\nPharamond is a former god, last of his pantheon, and a friend of Dream.

That story was reprinted in \"DC Special\" #4 (July 1969), which also contains Abel's debut. Kirby also pitted Wesley Dodds against someone claiming to be Thor in \"Adventure Comics\" #75 (June 1942).\nLater, a museum worker named Henry Meke handled Thor's hammer and briefly became Thor during thunderstorms in \"Batman\" #127 (October 1959).\nIn \"Season of Mist\", Thor accompanied Odin and Loki to the Dreaming in order to get the Key to Hell from him. At one point, Thor had difficulty with the gate keepers upon his arrival.\nIn \"The Kindly Ones\", Odin and Thor take Loki back to his punishment for kidnapping Daniel Hall and causing the Three to kill Dream.\nThor also appears in \"War of the Gods\" and \"Jack Kirby's Fourth World\" (The Thor seen in \"The Sandman\" does not resemble the one seen in the other DC comics).\nIn the podcast, Thor is voiced by Mitch Benn.\nIn the Netflix series, Thor is portrayed by Laurence O'Fuarain.

Based on a statement from Agony and Ecstasy in \"Hellblazer\" #12, he may have usurped his position from Belial (described at the time was the third member of the triumvirate). He appears as a ragged opening into darkness, full of disembodied eyes and mouths. He was cast out after Lucifer abandoned Hell and later imprisoned by Dream in a glass jar. He reappears, still in Dream's glass jar, in \"Lucifer Volume 2\" (2015).\nHe is based on the demon Azazel.\nAzazel first appeared in DC Comics battling Madame Xanadu in the story intended for \"Doorway to Nightmare\" #6 (it was cancelled after #5) that was eventually published in \"Cancelled Comic Cavalcade\" #2 and \"The Unexpected\" #190. As with Lucifer's appearance in \"The Brave and the Bold\", he looked more like a traditional devil, but was identified as an incubus: here, a creature who steals people's dreams and imprints them upon tapestries that give him power, and cannot be destroyed without killing the victims.\nIn the podcast, Azazel is voiced by Kerry Shale.\nIn the Netflix series, Azazel is voiced by Roger Allam in his ragged opening into darkness form during season one and by Wil Coban in his humanoid form during season two while also voicing his ragged opening into darkness form.\nBeelzebub.\nAlong with Lucifer and Azazel, Beelzebub is a demon who was the third King of Hell. He often appears as either a gigantic green fly or a fly's head on two short human legs. Sometimes, a human face can be seen between the fly's eyes. His constant buzzing slurs his speech (for example, 'Bbbbut nooo. Itzzz a Triummmvirate.').\nHe is based on the demon Beelzebub.\nIn the podcast, Beezlebug is voiced by Ray Porter.\nChoronzon.\nChoronzon is a demon and a former duke of Hell who served under Beelzebub.

Duma eventually allies with Lucifer and Elaine Belloc to save creation and persuades Hell's new ruler Christopher Rudd to bring his army to Heaven's aid at the Battle of Armageddon.\nIn the Netflix series, Duma is portrayed by Rilwan Abiola Owokoniran.\nLucifer.\nLucifer is the sometime ruler of Hell and a fallen angel. He is based on the fallen angel Lucifer, whose story was created by John Milton in his epic poem \"Paradise Lost\". Neil Gaiman also used the character Lucifer in his short story 'Murder Mysteries', wherein he was a captain in the Silver City, with Azazel as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nIn the book \"Hanging out with the Dream King\" (a book consisting of interviews with Gaiman's collaborators), one of Gaiman's artists, Kelley Jones, states that Lucifer's appearance is based on that of David Bowie:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Neil was adamant that the Devil was David Bowie. He just said, \"He is. You \"must\" draw David Bowie. Find David Bowie, or I'll send you David Bowie. Because if it isn't David Bowie, you're going to have to redo it until it \"is\" David Bowie.\" So I said, \"Okay, it's David Bowie.\"\nLucifer made at least three previous appearances in DC Comics (\"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\" #65, \"Weird Mystery Tales\" #4, and \"DC Special Series\" #8, a.k.a. \"The Brave and the Bold Special\"), but his appearance was more traditional.

The name \"Mazikeen\" comes from that of a shapeshifting demon of Jewish mythology.\nMazikeen first appeared in \"The Sandman\", where she was Lucifer's consort while he reigned in Hell. At the time, half of her face was normal, but the other half was horribly misshapen and skeletal, causing her speech to be nearly unintelligible. (Gaiman wrote Mazikeen's dialogue by trying to speak using only half of his mouth, and writing down phonetically what came out.)\nWhen Lucifer resigned, Mazikeen left Hell and ended up following her master, becoming part of the staff at the \"Lux\" (Latin for \"light\", and the first root word in \"Lucifer\"), an elite Los Angeles bar that Lucifer had opened and played piano at. To conceal her demonic nature, she covered the deformed half of her face with a white mask and rarely spoke.\nIn the ongoing comic book series \"Lucifer\", Mazikeen is a devoted ally of Lucifer Morningstar and the war leader of the Lilin, a race descended from Lilith. A fearsome warrior and a respected leader, Mazikeen is a prominent character in the Lucifer comics. She has the appearance of a human female with long black hair.\nIn \"Lucifer\", Mazikeen's face was turned fully human when she was resuscitated by the Basanos following the destruction of the Lux in a fire. This was because the vessel of the Basanos, Jill Presto, did not realize that Mazikeen's face was naturally deformed, and assumed that it was burned in the fire.\nWhen Lucifer refused to assist her in restoring her face to its former state, she defected to her family, the Lilim-in-Exile. As their war leader, she led their army against Lucifer's cosmos, allying herself briefly with the Basanos. However, this was a ruse; after a desperate gamble, she bought Lucifer enough time to destroy the Basanos and regain control of his creation. Lucifer then accepted her into his service once more and made the Lilim-in-Exile the standing army of his universe.\nLucifer ultimately restores Mazikeen's half-skeletal face shortly before departing the known universes.\nIn the podcast, Mazikeen is voiced by Karen Batke.\nIn the Netflix series, Mazikeen is portrayed by Lesley-Ann Brandt.

Dream finally gives the key to Remiel and Duma, and the two angels descend to Hell to rule over the countless sinners and demons there.\nFollowing the end of the \"Sandman\" series, Remiel and Duma lose ownership of Hell in the \"Lucifer\" spin-off series. At the end of the series, Remiel tries to rebel against Elaine Belloc, refusing to accept her as God's successor. When he tries to kill Gaudium and Spera, friends of Elaine's, she puts him in his own Hell until he reforms.\nIn the podcast, Remiel is voiced by Adrian Lester.\nIn the Netflix series, Remiel is portrayed by Jake Fairbrother.\nMinor angels and demons.\nSquatterbloat.\nSquatterbloat is a rhyme-speaking demon who serves as the Gatekeeper of Hell.\nIn the Netflix series, Squatterbloat is performed by Martyn Ford.\nKetele.\nKetele is a demon in Hell who doubted that Lucifer was originally from Heaven during Dream's second visit to Hell and prior to Lucifer's abdication.\nRimmon-My-Petal.\nRimmon-My-Petal is a demon in Hell who doubted that Lucifer was originally from Heaven during Dream's second visit to Hell and prior to Lucifer's abdication.\nMerkin, Mother of Spiders.\nFirst appeared in \"Season of Mists\", Merkin, Mother of Spiders is an envoy with Azazel.

Gradually, he acquires a conscience and by the 20th century, he has become full of remorse at his past deeds. Dream converses with Gadling once per century, of Gadling's latest occupations.

Unlike the comics, Destruction and Death help Orpheus get into the Greek underworld.\nThessaly.\nThessaly is the last of the millennia-old witches of Thessaly. She makes her first appearance in \". She has a bookish appearance with straight hair and thick glasses that belie her personality: amoral, cold-blooded, proud, and ruthless, though not malicious. She will kill people who are potential threats with no hesitation or remorse.\nNeil Gaiman named this character after the land of witches, Thessaly, in Greece. In one of Plato's dialogues, the Gorgias, Socrates states \"I would not have us risk that which is dearest on the acquisition of this power, like the Thessalian enchantresses, who, as they say, bring down the moon from heaven at the risk of their own perdition.\" In the series, Thessaly does exactly that, with deadly consequences, just as Socrates predicts. Later in the series, Thessaly changes her name to Larissa, which is the capital of Thessaly. Larissa was actually the local fountain nymph, after whom the town was named. It is suggested however that Thessaly is even older than this civilization and may date from Neolithic times. In a later series, Thessaly tells someone her name is Lamia. \"Lamia\" refers to several types of monster, and to other magical and supernatural characters, in Greek mythology, as well as to the Thessalian witches Meroe and Panthia in \"The Golden Ass\" by Apuleius.\nThessaly returns in the later volumes, where she is Dream's lover for a time, but this relationship ends unhappily for both and is never actually shown in the series. When it is alluded to in ' Thessaly is never mentioned by name, so only in ' is this romance revealed. Also in \"The Kindly Ones\", Thessaly provides Lyta Hall with protection and sanctuary from Dream while he is being targeted for death by the Furies, who are using Hall as a vessel.\nIn \"\" she attends Dream's wake and funeral. Thessaly speaks with two of Dream's lovers and recalls her relationship with Dream. She remarks that part of his attraction to her was that she was not intimidated by him. To her surprise she later would dream of Morpheus, and the two kindled a romance, with Dream madly in love with Thessaly (though this affection was not mutual). When Morpheus ended his courtship and resumed working Thessaly realized she did not love Morpheus and left the Dreaming. When Lyta wakes up after Dream's death, Thessaly calmly advises her to leave. Thessaly suggests that many people, including herself, would be more than happy to murder Lyta for her part in Morpheus' destruction.\nThessaly also is the star of two spin-off comic series, \"The Thessaliad\" and \"Thessaly, Witch for Hire\" written by Bill Willingham. In the spin-offs, Thessaly (under that name) and her companion, a ghost named Fetch, first set out to tackle various gods of the underworld who want her dead. Later she is unwillingly pressured into a monster-killing contract.\nShe is alluded to in the \"Faction Paradox\" series, in the character Thessalia and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Larissa.\nIn the podcast, Thessaly is voiced by Emma Corrin.\nMad Hettie.\nMad Hettie is a London tramp born in 1741. At the time of \"Sandman\" #3, she was 247 years old. Mad Hettie appears frequently in other DC comics such as \"Hellblazer\", first appearing in #9. She also had a large role in \"Death: The High Cost of Living\", where she is shown to be rude, miserly and constantly complains about the lack of knowledge that present day youths have. She has been accused of being a witch and also appears to have abilities as a haruspex. However, she merely states that \"you don't get to your two hundred and fiftieth without learning a few tricks\".\nLater, Hettie worked in the series \"The Dreaming\" in which it was discovered that she had dealings with Destiny, Johanna Constantine and President Thomas Jefferson.\nIn \"The Sandman: Overture\", it is revealed that she had stolen a magical timepiece in her youth, which remained hidden in her memories until Daniel retrieved it.\nIn the podcast, Mad Hettie is voiced by Josie Lawrence.\nIn the Netflix series, Mad Hettie is portrayed by Clare Higgins.\nThe Silk Man.\nAppearing for the first time in \"Lucifer: Nirvana\", the Silk Man is an immortal sorcerer, described by Lucifer as \"a fossil remnant from an earlier, cruder creation. His body is a weaving that has to be renewed constantly. Silk Man's spirit too, come to that. A messy form of immortality, but it seems to do the job.\" In earlier days, Silk Man was the leader of the Arao Jinn. He appears as a mercenary, hired by the angel Perdissa to kill Lucifer. Silk Man seems to need to consume living things to stay alive, weaving them into himself. He is severely damaged by Perdissa and eventually killed by Lucifer.\nVassily.\nIn \"\", Vassily appears as an old man telling his teen-aged granddaughter a tale from \"the old country\", Russia. A youth raised in a remote forest has a series of adventures, including meeting with Lucien (to whom he gives a book) and Baba Yaga, and marrying a fellow shape-changing wolf. At the end of the story, it is revealed that the grandfather is the youth in his own story.\nMortals.\nThe following are known mortals:\nRoderick Burgess.\nRoderick Burgess (1863\u20131947), born Morris Burgess Brocklesby and known also as The Daemon King, was the Lord Magus of The Order of the Ancient Mysteries. His magical fraternity was based in \"Fawney Rig\" in Sussex, and was initially funded by his inherited industrial wealth. Burgess is a magician rather in the vein of the real Aleister Crowley, and within the DC world is Crowley's rival.\nThe series begins with Burgess' attempt to capture and bind Death, which fails, capturing Dream instead. Burgess keeps Dream trapped in a glass globe for the rest of his (Burgess') life, attempting to bargain with Dream, but Dream remains silent. Burgess dies from a heart attack still attempting to get a response out of Dream. His order passes the globe and Dream to his son Alex.\nBurgess is a bald-headed, slightly pot-bellied man with a large hook nose. He is ultimately self-centred; his sole purpose for the Order is to bring money and power to himself, and he is consumed by his desire to achieve immortality. His relationship with his son is only briefly touched on, though it is implied that it is unhealthy, with Burgess pushing his son to spend his life pursuing his father's dreams.\nIn the podcast, Roderick Burgess is voiced by Stephen Critchlow.\nCharles Dance portrays the character in the television series \"The Sandman\" on Netflix. This version of the character dies of a brain hemorrhage instead of a heart attack.\nAlex Burgess.\nAlex Burgess is the son of Roderick Burgess, mother unknown (but probably Ethel Cripps, and therefore half-brother of Doctor Destiny). He is taught by his father, and takes part in his rituals. Upon Roderick Burgess' death, Alex inherits his estate, including his magical order. He keeps Dream imprisoned, as his father did, trying to bargain for power and immortality in exchange for Dream's release.\nThe Order of the Ancient Mysteries enjoys a resurgence in popularity in the 1960s, but by the 1970s it is in decline again. Alex passes ownership of the Order on to his boyfriend, Paul McGuire, and becomes obsessed with his prisoner and with his father. Finally, in 1988, Dream escapes and puts Alex into a nightmare of \"eternal waking\", in which he is forever dreaming he is waking up, and each waking degenerates into another horrible nightmare. This nightmare lasts for years, ending only with Dream's death in \".\nAlex is quite tall and near-sighted. He has brown hair which he wears in a variety of styles throughout his life, but by old age he is bald and has come to resemble his father very closely. His relationship with McGuire is deep and heartfelt, but his obsessions with his father and with Dream eventually come to rule his life. In \", he appears again as the child that we see in his first appearance.\nAlex is in many ways a tragic figure, perhaps the first statement of the theme that Desire explores in \"\": \"The bonds of family bind both ways\". Had Alex not been born the son of his father, inheriting the imprisoned Dream, his life might have been much happier. However, he is finally able to find some measure of fulfillment in his old age, following Dream's death and also attends his funeral.\nHis name almost certainly derives from Anthony Burgess's \"A Clockwork Orange\", the protagonist of which is named Alex, but could also be a nod to Aleister Crowley, whose original middle name was Alexander and who was mentioned in the first issue.\nIn the podcast, Alex Burgess is voiced by Blake Ritson.\nAlex appears in \"The Sandman\" episode \"Sleep of the Just\", portrayed by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as a young man, Laurie Kynaston as an adult, Benedick Blythe as an elderly man in season one, and by Geoffrey Beevers as an elderly man in season two. Unlike the comics, Dream later releases Alex from his \"eternal waking\" prior to creating the second Corinthian. Upon waking up, Alex calls for Paul, who runs in to Alex's bedroom to see Alex awake as they embrace each other.\nRuthven Sykes.\nRuthven Sykes is a bespectacled Afro-Caribbean man with short hair.\nHe is Roderick Burgess' second-in-command of the Order of the Ancient Mysteries until November 1930, when he steals a number of treasures (including Dream's helmet, ruby and pouch of sand) and \u00a3200,000 in cash from the order and flees to San Francisco with Roderick's mistress, Ethel Cripps. In December 1930, he trades the helmet to the demon Choronzon for an amulet that looks like an eyeball on a chain. This amulet protects him from the magics of Burgess until 1936 when Ethel Cripps leaves him taking the amulet with her. He is then killed.\nIn the podcast, Ruthven Sykes is voiced by Oris Erhuero.\nIn the Netflix series, Ruthven Sykes is portrayed by Ansu Kabia.\nEthel Cripps.\nEthel Cripps, also known as Ethel Dee, is the mother of John Dee. She was the mistress of Roderick Burgess until she fled with Ruthven Sykes.\nHer last joy was her son, John Dee, whom she sought for 10 years. She discovered that he had become a living corpse, which happened because of his use of the Sandman's Ruby.\nAt this time, she was 90 years old, and it was alluded that she had been kept alive by an amulet in the shape of an eye which granted its user protection, the amulet that Ruthven Sykes had been given by the demon Choronzon in exchange for Dream's helmet. Sykes, who had been second in command in The Order of Ancient Mysteries, needed protection from Roderick Burgess who was seeking retribution for Sykes' treachery of the theft of the \u00a3200,000 and Dream's magical items, which were in possession of the Order at the time he fled with Ethel Cripps to San Francisco in 1930. \"Magical War\" was declared upon them, and Ruthven knew he would need a way to protect himself from the hexes Burgess sought to put upon him.\nIn 1936, Ethel walked out on Ruthven, taking with her the amulet of protection and Dream's Ruby. While in his possession, the amulet protected Sykes from Burgess' hexes, but without it, he died a messy and painful death, with his insides exploding out of him. The amulet continued to protect Ethel while Choronzon was still in possession of Dream's helmet.\nAfter Dream escaped and sought to regain his items, he descended to Hell to find his helmet. He had to battle Choronzon to regain it. After his victory, the compact was withdrawn and the power of protection the amulet possessed ended which also ended the life of Ethel Dee.\nIn the podcast, Ethel Cripps is voiced by Karen Bartke.\nIn the Netflix series, Ethel Cripps is portrayed by Joely Richardson as an older woman and by Niamh Walsh as a younger woman. Unlike the comics, Ethel gave the Amulet of Protection to her son before dying.\nWesley Dodds.\nWesley Dodds, also known as Sandman, is the original costumed crimefighter who used the name. According to Gaiman, he was merely filling a hole in the universe in a similar way to a process of evolution, in which animals fill up a niche\u2014for instance, what should fly. He is first seen in \"The Sandman\" series in a two-panel cameo in issue #1, and another cameo in issue #26. Dream occasionally appeared in dream sequences in Dodds's own series, \"Sandman Mystery Theatre\". The two finally met for real in Gaiman's \"Sandman Midnight Theatre\". Dodds appeared out of costume during ' (#72). The reason for his prophetic visions is explained as him being embodied with a small portion of Dream's essence. His reasoning for assuming his role as The Sandman is given as nightmares of Dream in his helmet that plague him \"until\" he begins his career as a crimefighter, after which \"Wesley Dodds sleeps the sleep of the Just.\"\nIn the podcast, Wesley Dodds is voiced by Ray Porter.\nJohanna Constantine.\nLady Johanna Constantine is an 18th-century supernatural adventuress. Dream encounters her several times, once to ask her to recover the head of his son, Orpheus\u00a0\u2013 a mission she performed so successfully that part of its aftereffects was the ending of the French Revolution's Reign of Terror.\nIn the \"Hellblazer Special: Lady Constantine\" graphic novel, an ancient evil refers to Johanna Constantine as 'the Constantine', the 'laughing magician', and the 'constant one', all titles that have been used (usually by other ancient evils) to describe John Constantine. The evil taunts her, saying \"did you think to trick us with a new form?\" There is the implication that throughout all times there have been recurring incarnations of Constantine who contain the spark of magic. In the story Johanna Constantine learns that \"the Devil and the Wandering Jew\" meet once every hundred years in a London pub; this meeting is actually between Dream and Hob Gadling, as she discovers when she interrupts the meeting. The story's conclusion shows Johanna Constantine inheriting a property she calls \"Fawney Rig\", after the con job wherein a gilded ring is sold as though it were solid gold, the implication being that she attained the property through trickery. This property was later owned by Roderick Burgess, the mage who captures Dream in the beginning of \"The Sandman\".\nIn her middle age, Johanna Constantine is charged by persons unknown with the key to a box containing the sigil of America, allegedly created by Destiny. This is stolen and hidden in the future by the wanderer, Mad Hettie. Hettie both blackmails (\"I knows about you and the little Corsican\") and bribes Johanna for her silence, promising her that she would live to age 99. This promise proves true, with Johanna dying at age 99 while getting out of her wheelchair when she hears the song of her old companion Orpheus.\nJohanna is an ancestor of John Constantine, as revealed in the miniseries \"The Sandman Presents: Love Street\".\nShe is also mentioned in the \"Doctor Who\" novel \"The Man in the Velvet Mask\", set in an alternate post-Revolutionary France.\nIn the podcast, Johanna Constantine is voiced by Joanna Lumley.\nJenna Coleman was cast as two versions of Johanna in the TV adaptation of \"The Sandman\": one in the eighteenth-century that encountered Dream and Hob Gadling and another in the present day where she is an occult detective just like John. In this show, Johanna serves the exact same role as John in the comics. Dream once saw into her nightmare regarding a previously botched exorcism that dragged her friend Astra Logue to Hell.\nJohn Constantine.\nJohn Constantine is a con man and magician. He is a descendant of Johanna Constantine who accompanies Dream on a quest to find his pouch of sand.\nJohn Constantine has his own series, \"John Constantine: Hellblazer\", which occasionally has guest appearances by Cain and Abel. He is also prominently featured in another series, \"Swamp Thing\", from which he originated.\nIn the podcast, John Constantine is voiced by Taron Egerton.\nJohn Dee.\nJohn Dee, also known as Doctor Destiny, is a DC Comics villain whose powers were derived from his use of Dream's Ruby. He was incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, with other Batman villains such as The Scarecrow and The Joker, until freed by the amulet given to him by his mother, Ethel Dee, former mistress to Roderick Burgess. He had previously fought the Sandman (Garrett Sanford) alongside the Justice League.\nJohn originally named himself 'Doctor Destiny' to protect his mother's surname, but after her death changed it back. The Ruby had drained away his mental and physical state until he was no longer able to sleep or dream without it. This had the unpleasant effect of turning him into a browned, living corpse.\nBeing able to control dreams, he used the ruby to bring out the 'darkness' and 'bestiality' of many people across the world. He originally sought power, money and mostly the restoration of his human body, but the madness brought about by overuse of the relic drove him to savage, monstrous acts of depravity using the ruby. To quote: \"I think I'll dismember the world and then I'll dance in the wreckage.\"\nWhile doing this, over a period of 24 hours he focused the energy of the ruby on several people in a cafe, one of them a friend of Rose Walker and an ex-lover of Foxglove. He used them as puppets, horribly having them murder and degrade each other as if they were toys, until all were dead.\nDream double-bluffed him into destroying the ruby, which Dee believed to be Dream's life. It actually only stored some of his energy, and with it released Dream instead became even more powerful than before. Easily overpowering Dee, Dream decided not to destroy him, and instead returned him to Arkham. Dee was finally able to sleep and his sadism and depravity faded as he now could again dream.\nHe has since appeared in \"Justice League\" and \"Justice Society\" stories, having retained some residual power from the ruby. Even worse, since he has managed to replicate its power perfectly, the second ruby is now out of his grasp. However, since the new ruby is attuned to him, he has since not regressed to his previous vicious persona, mostly seeking the dominion of dreams or the waking world through dreams.\nIn the podcast, John Dee is voiced by William Hope.\nJohn Dee appears in the Netflix series, portrayed by David Thewlis. This variant has a more expanded, different role. He does not kill Rosemary when they drive together, but he leaves her the Amulet of Protection he received from his mother. John does not possess his comic variant's shriveled appearance, simply looking like a weak middle aged man. Additionally, his use of the ruby is different: he still kills the people in the diner but the ruby's power is more specific: he uses it to remove people's ability to lie. Dream later defeated him. Taking pity, Dream places him in a dreamless state and returns him to the institution that he escaped from.\nUnity Kinkaid.\nUnity Kinkaid first appears as one of the victims of the sleepy sickness that follows Dream's capture in the first collection of issues in the series, \"\". Following his capture, she sleeps until he escapes. While asleep, she gives birth to a daughter named Miranda Walker. It is later shown that the father of Miranda was Desire. Unity is later identified as a \"vortex of Dream\": a rare entity with the ability to telepathically combine the dreams of other beings and who can thus cause the destruction of the Dreaming. The only time Dream is allowed to take a human life is to kill a vortex. Desire's intervention transfers the vortex to Unity's granddaughter Rose Walker in the hope that Dream will kill one of their relatives and thus incur the vengeance of the Furies. Before Dream can kill Rose, Unity reclaims the vortex and dies in her stead.\nUnity is of medium height, with reddish-brown hair that she wears long and loose, in the final dream-meeting between herself, Rose, and Dream; as the old woman of waking life, she has grey hair and wears a curiously old-fashioned dress.\nIn the podcast, Unity Kinkaid is voiced by Sue Johnston as an old woman and by Tracy Wiles as a young woman.\nIn the Netflix series, Unity is portrayed by Sandra James-Young. This version is a Black British woman.\nLyta Hall.\nHippolyta \"Lyta\" Hall is a major character, the mother of Daniel. During Dream's captivity, pregnant Lyta and her husband were held captive in a dream-realm controlled by Brute and Glob, two of Dream's minions. In this pocket realm, Lyta remained pregnant for two years, giving birth to her son Daniel only after Dream destroys the pocket realm (and Lyta's husband) and frees her. When Dream tells Lyta that the child she gestated in dreams will one day belong to him, Lyta swears she will protect Daniel at all costs.\nWhen Daniel goes missing, Lyta is convinced that Dream has stolen him and seeks revenge, unwittingly setting into motion the events of Dream's death at the hands of the Three while unaware that the real culprits were Loki and Puck. Though her son Daniel would end up becoming the new Dream and give her mother a mark that would help keep her safe.\nIn the podcast, Lyte Hall is voiced by Laura Lefkow.\nLyte Hall is portrayed by Razane Jammal in the Netflix series.

He was raised by his grandfather Ezra Paulsen and then taken and imprisoned by his abusive Aunt Clarice and Uncle Barnaby at the behest of Desire following the death of Ezra and the death of Burt. Once Rose rescues him, he is revealed in \"The Wake\" to have become close to her.\nIn the podcast, Jed is voiced by Mack Keith-Roach.\nIn the Netflix series, Jed (named Jed Walker) is portrayed by Eddie Karanja while a younger version of him was portrayed by Aryel Tsoto.

The pair mysteriously show up on Dolphin Island a few hours after the drowning death of Jed's grandfather Ezra and the death of Burt who was the brother of Clarice. They take him to live with their own children Bruce and Susie. Clarice and Barnaby later treated him as a personal slave not unlike Cinderella, with minimal food even as he does all the cooking.

The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The club entered the NFL as an expansion team in 1976 in the NFC. From 1977 to 2001, Seattle was assigned to the American Football Conference (AFC) West; the team rejoined the NFC in 2002. They have played their home games at Lumen Field in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood since 2002, having previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976\u20131999) and Husky Stadium (1994 and 2000\u20132001).\nSeahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the \"12s\" (formerly the \"12th Man\"), or the \"12th Fan\". The team's fans twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event within the span of a few months, first registering 136.6 decibels during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in September 2013, and later registering 137.6\u00a0dB during a \"Monday Night Football\" game against the New Orleans Saints that December. As the only NFL team based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, the Seahawks attract support from a wide geographical area that includes parts of the U.S. states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Utah, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia.\nThe Seahawks have won 11 division titles and three conference championships, and are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have reached three Super Bowls, losing 21\u201310 to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Super Bowl XL, defeating the Denver Broncos 43\u20138 for their first championship at Super Bowl XLVIII, and losing 28\u201324 to the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLIX. Players Kenny Easley, Walter Jones, Steve Hutchinson, Cortez Kennedy, and Steve Largent have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. In addition, players Dave Brown, Jacob Green, Dave Krieg, Curt Warner, Jim Zorn, Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with head coaches Chuck Knox and Mike Holmgren, radio announcer Pete Gross, and franchise owner Paul Allen.\nHistory.\nNordstrom / Sarkowsky era (1976\u20131988).\nUnder the terms of the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams. In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced their intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle. In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise. That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.\nIn March 1975, the owners hired as general manager John Thompson, a former executive director of the NFL Management Council and former Washington Huskies executive. The name \"Seattle Seahawks\" (\"seahawk\" is another name for osprey) was picked on June 17, 1975, after a public contest that drew more than 20,000 entries proposing more than 1,700 names, including Skippers, Pioneers, and Lumberjacks.\nThompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30\u201331, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league. The Seahawks were awarded the second overall pick in the 1976 draft, which they used to acquire defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976, in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the new Kingdome.\nThe Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch conferences twice since the merger. The franchise began play in 1976 in the NFC West but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season to join the AFC West. This was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers, the first of which was the Seahawks' first regular-season victory.\nIn 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9\u20137 record, the Seahawks made their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. The next season was the Seahawks' best to that point, finishing 12\u20134; it would remain the franchise's best until 2005. Knox won the NFL Coach of the Year Award.\nBehring / Hofmann era (1988\u20131996).\nIn 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for a reported $80 million. The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but would miss the playoffs in the next three seasons, after which Knox left the team. For most of the 1990s, the Seahawks continued to struggle. They saw three consecutive losing seasons (1992\u20131994) under head coach Tom Flores, including a franchise worst 2\u201314 season in 1992. After the 1994 season, Flores was fired and Dennis Erickson was brought in as head coach.\nPaul Allen era (1997\u2013present).\nIn 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team's operations to Anaheim, California, although the team continued to play in Seattle. They also contemplated moving the team itself, which was in bankruptcy for a short period. The move was widely criticized. The NFL threatened Behring with a $500,000-per-day fine if he did not move the team's operations back to Seattle. \nThe following year, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen for $200\u00a0million.\nErickson's tenure as head coach ended after the 1998 season; the Seahawks missed the playoffs for all four of his seasons with the team, extending their \"playoff drought\" to ten seasons.\nMike Holmgren years (1999\u20132008).\nIn 1999, Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach. He would coach for 10 seasons. The Seahawks won their second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs, losing to the Miami Dolphins 20\u201317.\nIn 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced divisions of four teams each. This restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland. That same year, the team opened its new home stadium, Seahawks Stadium, after spending the previous two seasons at Husky Stadium after the Kingdome's implosion in 2000.\nIn the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13\u20133, including a 42\u20130 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles in a \"Monday Night Football\" game. The 13\u20133 record earned them the top seed in the NFC. They defeated the Washington Redskins in the Divisional Round and won the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten list of games with controversial referee calls. Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls that altered the game. Before 2005, the Seahawks had not won a playoff game since the 1984 season, a streak of 21 years (five teams had ever had a drought of twenty years at the time, with their six straight losses being tied for third-most in history). That drought was ended with a 20\u201310 win over the Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.\nIn the 2006 season, the Seahawks finished 9\u20137 and won the NFC West. The defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21\u201320 in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Chicago Bears 27\u201324 in the Divisional Round. In the 2007 season, the Seahawks finished 10\u20136 and won the NFC West. The team defeated Washington in the Wild Card Round 35\u201314 before losing to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round 42\u201320. The 2008 season saw the team go 4\u201312 and finish third in the NFC West. Holmgren departed from the team after the 2008 season, after the end of his contract. Defensive backs coach Jim L. Mora was named as Holmgren's successor. In 2009, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5\u201311 record. Shortly after, Mora was fired on January 8, 2010 and Pete Carroll was hired.\nPete Carroll years (2010\u20132023).\nPre-Super Bowl (2010\u20132012).\nIn the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making the playoffs despite a 7\u20139 record. They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7\u20139, Rams 7\u20139, 49ers 6\u201310, Cardinals 5\u201311) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3\u20132 division record). In the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the New Orleans Saints, 41\u201336. The Seahawks made even more history when Marshawn Lynch made a 67-yard run, breaking nine tackles, to clinch the victory. The fans reacted so loudly that a small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle. Lynch's run would be nicknamed the \"Beast Quake\". The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35\u201324. The 2011 season saw the team go 7\u20139 once again, but they were not able to get into the postseason with a third-place finish in the NFC West.\nThe 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals. The highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4\u20131 in their next five games en route to an 11\u20135 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins. This was the first time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road. However, in the 2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth-quarter deficit would not be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30\u201328. Quarterback Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi MAX Rookie of the Year award.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII champions (2013).\nIn the 2013 NFL season, the Seahawks continued their momentum from the previous season, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for an NFL-best regular season record of 13\u20133, while earning the NFC's #1 playoff seed. Their 2013 campaign included big wins over the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and the San Francisco 49ers. Six Seahawks players were named to the Pro Bowl: Quarterback Russell Wilson, center Max Unger, running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor. However, none of them were able to play in the Pro Bowl, as the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints 23\u201315 and the San Francisco 49ers 23\u201317, in the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos. On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won the franchise's first Super Bowl Championship, defeating the Broncos 43\u20138. The Seahawks' defense performance in 2013 was acclaimed as one of the best in the Super Bowl era.\nPost-championship years (2014\u20132023).\nThe 2014 campaign saw the team lose some key pieces, including wide receiver Golden Tate to free agency and wide receiver Sidney Rice and defensive end Chris Clemons to retirement. Percy Harvin was also let go mid-season after several underachieving weeks and clashes with the rest of the locker room. Despite starting 3\u20133, they rallied to a 12\u20134 record, good enough once again for the #1 seed in the NFC Playoffs. After dispatching the Carolina Panthers handily in the Divisional Round 31\u201317, they faced the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Despite five turnovers and trailing 19\u20137 late in the contest, the Seahawks prevailed in overtime to reach Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots, but an ill-fated interception at the 1-yard line late in the championship game stymied a comeback attempt and thwarted the Seahawks' bid to be the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the Patriots had won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX.\nThe Seahawks returned to the playoffs in both 2015 and 2016, but despite winning the Wild Card game in both years they failed to win either Divisional round game on the road. The 2017 iteration of the team missed the playoffs for the first time in six years, as injuries to their core players coupled with disappointing acquisitions of running back Eddie Lacy and kicker Blair Walsh failed them in a competitive NFC. The team cut ties with most of the remaining players that had been part of their meteoric rise and turnover both their Offensive and Defensive coaching staff in 2018, and an influx of young talent helped propel the team to a 10\u20136 record and another playoff berth that ultimately ended in a loss in the Wild Card game to the Dallas Cowboys. In October 2018, owner Paul Allen died after a prolonged fight with cancer. In 2019, the Seahawks put up their best record since their last trip to the Super Bowl at 11\u20135, but they still lost 3 out of their last 4 games and lost their chance to win the NFC West. A likely explanation for their sloppy finish is because many of their players were injured late in the season. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 17\u20139 in the Wild Card game, they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round, failing another attempt at a second Super Bowl.\nThe 2020 season saw the Seahawks win their first five games, a franchise-best for a start to a season. Despite the Seahawks losing three of their next four games, the Seahawks finished strong, earning twelve victories for the first time since their Super Bowl season in 2014, and winning the division for the first time in four years. However, despite the 12\u20134 record and the division title, the Seahawks' season ended the following week against the Los Angeles Rams, who never trailed in a 30\u201320 victory. The Seahawks struggled and started the 2021 season 3\u20138. Russell Wilson had an injured finger missing 3 games and the Seahawks were shut out the first time in the Wilson era in Week 10 against the Green Bay Packers. This was their worst first half of a season since 2009, under then-head coach Jim Mora. The Seahawks were eliminated from playoff contention on December 26 in a loss to the Chicago Bears, and they finished last in their division for the first time since 1996. With wins over the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals they finished 7\u201310.\nThe 2021 season was followed by an offseason of change, punctuated with the trade of quarterback Russell Wilson to the team he and the Seahawks beat in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Denver Broncos, on March 6, 2022. The Broncos traded quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive end Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (for that year's draft, No. 9 overall, and 2023's), two second-round picks (that year's, No. 40 overall, and 2023's) and a 2022 fifth-round selection to the Seahawks for Wilson and a 2022 fourth-round pick. Another hallmark franchise player from the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks, former All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner, was cut by the team that same day, a move that saves them $16.6 million in cap space. The Seahawks also took on $26 million in dead money by trading Wilson; ESPN Stats &amp; Information research revealed it to be the second-most dead money a team has ever incurred, trailing the $33.8 million the Philadelphia Eagles ate in their trade of Carson Wentz the previous year.\nIn the 2022 season, the Seahawks finished with a 9\u20138 record and made the playoffs. The team's season ended in the Wild Card round with a 41\u201323 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The 2023 season saw the Seahawks finish 9\u20138 and miss the postseason. Carroll was fired from his head coaching position after the 2023 season. Carroll remained with the team in an unspecified advisory role.\nMike Macdonald years (2024\u2013present).\nMike Macdonald, formerly defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens, was hired as the new head coach. In the 2024 season, the Seahawks went 10\u20137 but missed the postseason.\nLogos and uniforms.\nWhen the Seahawks debuted in 1976, the team's logo was a stylized royal blue and forest green osprey's head based on Kwakwaka\u02bcwakw art masks. The helmet and pants were silver while the home jerseys were royal blue with white and green sleeve stripes and white numerals and names. The road jersey was white, with white, blue and green sleeve stripes and had blue numerals and names. The socks were blue and had the same green and white striping pattern seen on the blue jerseys. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did so in the late 1970s, at a time when most teams were wearing white shoes. They would switch to white shoes in 1980.\nIn 1983, coinciding with the arrival of Chuck Knox as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly. The striping on the arms now incorporated the Seahawks logo, and the \"TV numbers\", previously located on the sleeves, moved onto the shoulders. The helmet facemasks changed from gray to blue. Also, the socks went solid blue at the top, and white on bottom. In the 1985 season, the team wore 10th Anniversary patches on the left side of their pants. It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. In 1994, the year of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976\u201382 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, Shaun Alexander's rookie year and Cortez Kennedy's last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new Reebok uniform system still in their then-current uniforms after that company signed a 10-year deal to be the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Before this, various companies made the team's uniforms.\nOn March 1, 2002, to coincide with the team moving to the NFC as well as the opening of Seahawks Stadium, both the logo and the uniforms were heavily redesigned. The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter \"Seahawks Blue\", a darker \"Seahawks Navy\" and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter \"Seahawks Blue\" color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular-season game, the 2005 season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against Minnesota (November 22), St. Louis (November 29), Houston (December 13), and Green Bay (December 27).\nThe Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during Super Bowl XL despite being designated as the visitor, since the Pittsburgh Steelers, the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys.\nOn September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the Chicago Bears. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular-season finale against the Tennessee Titans. In December 2009, then-coach Jim Mora announced that the new lime green jerseys were being retired because the team did not win in them, because he liked the standard blue home jerseys better, and added that the home jersey is a better match for the navy pants. In the same press conference, he stated that the new navy pants \"felt better\" on players as opposed to the Seahawks blue pants. For the 2010 season, Seattle returned to the traditional all \"Seahawks Blue\" at home and all white on the road.\nOn April 3, 2012, Nike, which took over as the official uniform supplier for the league from Reebok, unveiled new uniform and logo designs for the Seahawks for the 2012 season. The new designs incorporate a new accent color, \"Wolf Grey\", and the main colors are \"College Navy\" and \"Action Green\". The uniforms incorporate \"feather trims\", multiple feathers on the crown of the helmet, twelve feathers printed on the neckline and down each pant leg to represent the \"12th Man\", referring to the team's fans. The Seahawks have three different jersey colors: navy blue, white, and an alternate grey jersey. The Seahawks will have three different pants: navy blue with green feathers, gray with navy blue feathers, and white with navy blue feathers. Their new logo replaces the Seahawk blue with wolf grey. Altogether, there are nine different uniform combinations possible.\nThe Seahawks wore their Nike home blue jerseys for the first regular-season game on September 16, 2012, against the Dallas Cowboys. The uniform Marshawn Lynch wore in that game is preserved at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. On September 9, 2012, the Seahawks wore their Nike white away jerseys for the first regular-season game against the Arizona Cardinals; on October 14, 2012, with the Carolina Panthers wearing white at home, they wore their blue jerseys with gray pants (and would do so again against the Miami Dolphins seven weeks later); and on December 16, 2012, they wore their Alternate Wolf Grey jerseys for the first time against the Buffalo Bills.\nThe all-navy ensemble is the Seahawks' current primary uniform option for home games. Initially, the Seahawks paired their navy uniforms with gray pants on select road games in which the home team wore white jerseys, but on December 5, 2021, the Seahawks wore this combination at home for the first time in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. On the road, the Seahawks primarily pair their white uniforms with the navy pants (that combination was used during their Super Bowl XLVIII win), although they also pair the white uniforms with either white or gray pants on occasion. The all-gray uniforms were worn occasionally on the road, mainly against the Arizona Cardinals.\nIn 2016, the Seahawks unveiled their NFL Color Rush uniform, an all-Action Green ensemble. They first wore the uniform on December 16 against the Los Angeles Rams at home, marking the first time they wore green uniforms since 2009. The Seahawks continue to wear the Color Rush set as an alternate uniform alongside the all-gray combination.\nDuring a home matchup with the Vikings on December 3, 2019, the Seahawks wore their Color Rush green tops and regular navy pants. The combination was used again on October 11, 2020, also against the Vikings, and then again on November 19, against the Arizona Cardinals. It was used once in 2021, on Thursday Night Football vs. the Rams.\nIn July 2023, the Seahawks introduced a throwback uniform set inspired by the team's 1983\u20132001 design. These uniforms were worn in Week 8 against the Cleveland Browns. Consequently, the gray alternate tops were retired due to NFL regulations restricting teams to two alternate jerseys.\nThe Seahawks were long the only NFL team to have never worn white jerseys in a home game. That changed on September 24, 2023, when the team wore white jerseys at home against the Carolina Panthers. The game marked the 10th anniversary of the Seahawks' first Super Bowl victory, as the current team wore the same white jersey/navy pants combination from Super Bowl XLVIII.\nDuring the 2025 NFL Draft, the NFL and Nike announced that the NFC WEST and AFC EAST would debut a \"rivalry uniform\" in the 2025 season that will be worn once a season against a division rival. The new fifth uniforms were intended to connect to the teams' cities, like the MLB\u2019s City Connect uniforms. On August 28, 2025, the new \"High-Decibel Zone\" Rivalries uniform was unveiled. In Wolf Grey and Iridescent Green, the design marks a return of the uniform color the team gave up in favor of the throwbacks the prior season. The green, a first of its kind in the NFL, features a metallic sheen that seems to change color depending on lighting and viewing angle.\nThe jersey features a unique iridescent green soundwave design on the upper chest and shoulders, as well as down the sides of the pants, meant to represent the notorious loudness of the fanbase at Lumen Field. Bordered in navy blue, the player numbers on the front and back are in the same green material with small repeating \"12\"s replacing the \"feather\" pattern of the standard uniform numbers. A green \"12\" patch is placed at the back of the collar. Navy blue stripes appear around the collar, at the bottoms of the sleeve cuffs, and down the sides of the pants. With wolf grey gloves, any additional items like tees, sleeves, and leg tights are in navy blue. The striking iridescent green helmet has a metallic chrome finish, making the color appear to alternate between green and blue in the light. The logo appears in white outline and the phrase \"12 AS ONE\" sits at the bottom of the back of the helmet.\nRivalries.\nDivisional.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nThe rivalry between the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams came into existence in 2002 after the Seahawks moved to the NFC West. The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams managed to defeat the Seahawks in Seattle 27\u201320 and currently hold the streak for the only two wins against the Seahawks at home during the postseason. Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined in competition throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, but several notable matchups between the two clubs would still occur. The rivalry saw new life as the Rams' Mob Squad-era teams regularly clashed with Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams, often escalating into bitter grudge matches for control of the division. After the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, and subsequent playoff success (most recently with a Super Bowl victory in 2022); the rivalry has increased in intensity; especially as Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams waned in competition. Due to the recent dominance by the Rams under Sean McVay and former defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Seahawks fans have recently viewed the Rams as their divisional arch rival. Tensions especially ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game after a widely publicized taunt from Safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during week 16. The Rams would go onto decimate the Seahawks in the wild card game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction to get retribution after Adams' comments and cigar gesture.\nAs of the 2024 season, the Seahawks lead the series 28\u201327, but the Rams have won both playoff meetings.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nFrom 2011 to 2014, the Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers emerged as two of the best teams in the NFC, and developed a rivalry as a result. The 49ers head coach at the time, Jim Harbaugh, had a contentious history with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll due to Harbaugh's previous job as coach at Stanford against Carroll's USC Trojans. Harbaugh's 49ers won the first three head-to-head contests but lost Week 16 of 2012. Both teams reached the playoffs that year, however the 49ers reached Super Bowl XLVII, which they lost. In 2013, the Seahawks won in a Week 2 contest, but the 49ers would triumph in Week 14. The Seahawks would beat the 49ers in the 2013 season NFC Championship Game 23\u201317 in a controversial win. The Seahawks went on to win the next 10 matchups, sweeping the regular season series against the 49ers from 2014 to 2018. After splitting games in 2018 and 2019, the 49ers won 6 straight against the Seahawks, including the 2022 wild card game. The Seahawks won the second matchup of 2024 to end the streak.\nAs of the end of the 2024 season, the Seahawks lead the series 31\u201323.\nArizona Cardinals.\nThe Arizona Cardinals and Seahawks became divisional rivals after both were moved to the NFC West during the league's 2002 realignment. This rivalry has become one of the NFL's more bitter in recent years, as the mid-to-late 2010s often saw the Seahawks and Cardinals square off for NFC West supremacy. The rivalry hit its peak as the Cardinals frequently clashed with the Legion Of Boom-era Seahawks led by Russell Wilson and head coach Pete Carroll, although Seattle shares more intense rivalries with the Rams and 49ers. Despite this, the two teams have been known to beat each other on their respective home fields, with Seattle having more wins against the Cardinals in Arizona than Seattle, and vice versa. Seattle leads the series 30\u201322\u20131, and the two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.\nConference.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nSince moving to the NFC, the Seahawks have faced the Green Bay Packers several times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive, the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16\u20130 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28\u201322 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX. As of the 2024 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 16\u20139.\nHistoric.\nDenver Broncos.\nFrom the 1980s to the 2002 league realignment, the Denver Broncos were a major rival for the Seahawks. As of the 2023 season, the Broncos lead 35\u201323 against the Seahawks with Seattle having won both postseason meetings. Since 2002, Denver has won three of five interconference meetings, and the teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, where the Seahawks won 43\u20138. On March 8, 2022, the Seattle Seahawks agreed to trade Russell Wilson and a 2022 fourth-round pick to the Denver Broncos for quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (2022\u2014No. 9 overall\u2014and 2023), two second-round picks (2022\u2014No. 40 overall\u2014and 2023) and a 2022 fifth-round selection. Russell Wilson's first game against the Seattle Seahawks as a member of the Denver Broncos was played September 12, 2022, on Monday Night Football, where the Seahawks won 17\u201316.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nThe Raiders and Seahawks played many times being old members of the AFC West. Seattle's move to the NFC has made the matchup occur much less frequently, playing only five times since the end of the 2002 season. The Raiders lead the all-time series 30\u201326.\nHeadquarters and training camps.\nDuring the Seahawks' first ten seasons (1976\u201385), the team's headquarters was in Kirkland at the southern end of the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point), on the shores of Lake Washington. The summer training camps were held across the state at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, southwest of Spokane.\nWhen the team's new headquarters across town in Kirkland was completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons (1986\u201396), staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In 1997, Dennis Erickson's third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney for training camp, which continued through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to the Seahawk's Kirkland facility because of the scheduled China Bowl (NFL) game, which was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp, where the team has held their training camps since. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.\nSeasons and overall records.\nThe Seattle Seahawks have competed in 50 NFL seasons, dating back to their expansion year of 1976. The team has compiled a 402\u2013373\u20131 () regular-season record and a 17\u201319 () record in the playoffs, for an overall record of 419\u2013392\u20131 and a winning percentage. Seattle has reached the playoffs in 20 separate seasons, including in the 2005 season when they lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2013 season when they defeated the Denver Broncos to win Super Bowl XLVIII, and the 2014 season when they lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. In the 2010 season, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to earn a spot in the playoffs with a losing record (7\u20139, .438) in a full season; this was by winning the division. The Seahawks would go on to defeat the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the , becoming the first team ever to win a playoff game with a losing record. Until Week 7 of the 2016 season against the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks had never recorded a tied game in their history.\nPlayers.\n35th Anniversary Team (2010).\nThe 35th Anniversary team was voted upon by users on Seahawks.com and announced in 2010. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Seahawks have retired five numbers in franchise history.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nNote: Although Mike McCormack served as head coach, president, and general manager for the Seahawks, he is \"only\" listed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his contributions as a tackle for the New York Yanks and the Cleveland Browns.\nOwnership and personnel.\nPrevious head coaches.\nThe Seahawks have had nine head coaches in franchise history.\nTeam culture.\n12s.\nThe 12s (formerly the 12th man) refers to the fan support of the Seahawks. The team's first home stadium, the Kingdome, was one of the loudest and most disruptive environments in the NFL. Opponents were known to practice with rock music blaring at full blast to prepare for the often painfully high-decibel levels generated at games in the Kingdome.\nIn 2002, the Seahawks began playing at what is now Lumen Field. Every regular-season and playoff game at Lumen Field since the second week of the 2003 season has been played before a sellout crowd. Like the Kingdome before it, Lumen Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league. The stadium's partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and reflect it back down to the field. This noise has caused problems for opposing teams. From 2002 through 2012, there were 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.\nThe Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6\u00a0dB. As of September 29, 2014, the record of 142.2\u00a0dB is held in Arrowhead Stadium by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.\nBefore kickoff of each home game, the Seahawks salute their fans by raising a giant #12 flag at the south end of the stadium. Current and former players, coaches, local celebrities, prominent fans including Patti Hammond, Seattle-area athletes, and former owner Paul Allen have raised the flag. Earlier, the Seahawks retired the #12 jersey on December 15, 1984, as a tribute to their fans. Before their Super Bowl win, the Seahawks ran onto the field under a giant 12th Man flag.\nIn September 1990, Texas A&amp;M University filed, and was later granted, a trademark application for the \"12th Man\" term, based on their continual usage of the term since the 1920s. In January 2006, Texas A&amp;M filed suit against the Seattle Seahawks to protect the trademark and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. In the agreement, which expired in 2016, Texas A&amp;M licensed the Seahawks to continue using the phrase, in exchange for a licensing fee, public acknowledgement of A&amp;M's trademark when using the term, a restriction in usage of the term to seven states in the Northwest United States, and a prohibition from selling any \"12th Man\" merchandise. Once the agreement expired, the Seahawks were allowed to continue using the number \"12\" but were no longer permitted to use the \"12th Man\" phrase. In August 2015, the Seahawks decided to drop their signage of the \"12th Man\" term and shifted towards referring to their fans as the \"12s\" instead.\nMascots.\nStarting in the 1998 season, Blitz has been the Seahawks' official mascot. Before the 2014 NFL season, Blitz was given a new look and a sidekick; a secondary mascot named Boom was introduced to appeal to and interact with younger children.\nIn the 2003 and 2004 seasons, a hawk named Faith would fly around the stadium just before the team came out of the tunnel. However, because of her relatively small size and an inability to be trained to lead the team out of the tunnel, Faith was replaced by an augur hawk named Taima before the start of the 2005 NFL season. Taima started leading the team out of the tunnel in September 2006.\nCheerleaders.\nA group of female and male cheerleaders known as the Seahawks Dancers rallies the crowd from the sidelines and performs a halftime routine during home games at Lumen Field. The group was an all-female squad called the Sea Gals until it admitted male members and was renamed before the 2019 NFL season. During the off-season, a unit of the Dancers travels to parades and other events, as well as with other NFL cheerleaders on the road.\nBand.\nBeginning in 2004, the Seahawks introduced their drum line, the Blue Thunder. The group plays at every home game and at other Seattle events.\nFranchise records and achievements.\nIndividual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNFL Most Valuable Player\nSuper Bowl MVP\nNFL Offensive Player of the Year\nNFL Defensive Player of the Year\nNFL Comeback Player of the Year\nWalter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award\nPepsi NFL Rookie of the Year\nNFL Coach of the Year\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFirst-team All-Pro\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNFL All-Decade Team\nNFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team\nRadio and television.\nThe Seahawks' flagship station is KIRO 710 kHz \u2013 KIRO-FM 97.3 MHz. Games are heard on 47 stations in five western states and Canada. Microsoft holds naming rights for the broadcasts for their web search engine under the moniker of the \"Bing Radio Network\". The current announcers are former Seahawks players Steve Raible (who was the team's color commentator from 1982 to 2003) and Dave Wyman. The Raible-Wyman regular season pairing has been together since the final four games of 2017 but became full time starting in 2018. On local television broadcast preseason games are split between former Seahawks Paul Moyer, Sam Adkins, and Brock Huard. Pete Gross, who called the games from 1976 until just days before his death from cancer in 1992, is a member of the team's Ring of Honor. Other past announcers include Steve Thomas from 1992 to 1997, Lee Hamilton (also known as \"Hacksaw\") from 1998 to 1999, Brian Davis from 2000 to 2003, and former Seahawk Warren Moon from 2004 to 2017.\nPreseason games not shown on national networks were produced in-house by Seahawks Broadcasting and televised by KING-TV, channel 5 (and, in 2008, also on sister station KONG-TV since KING, an NBC affiliate, was committed to the Summer Olympics in China). Kate Scott became the announcer for Seahawks TV preseason games in 2023, replacing Curt Menefee (the host of \"Fox NFL Sunday\") who had been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. KCPQ-TV, which airs most of the Seahawks' regular-season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area's Fox affiliate), became the television partner for the team in 2012 and replaced KING-TV as broadcaster for preseason games, but KING-TV regained the partnership in 2022; simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" air (as of the 2018 season) on CBS affiliate KIRO-TV. In addition, any Saturday or Sunday afternoon games broadcast by CBS (usually\u2014but not always\u2014with the Seahawks hosting an AFC opponent) will air on KIRO-TV.\nRadio affiliates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\nExplanatory notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations"}
{"id": "28392", "revid": "51058819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28392", "title": "The Saint (Simon Templar)", "text": "Fictional character invented by Leslie Charteris\nThe Saint is the nickname of the fictional character Simon Templar, featured in a series of novels and short stories by Leslie Charteris published between 1928 and 1963. After that date other authors collaborated with Charteris on books until 1983; two additional works produced without Charteris's participation were published in 1997. The character has also been portrayed in the franchise \"The Saint\", which includes motion pictures, radio dramas, comic strips, comic books, and three television series.\nOverview.\nSimon Templar.\nSimon Templar is a Robin Hood-like figure known as the Saint\u2014from his initials, per \"The Saint Meets the Tiger\", and the reader is told that he was given the nickname at the age of nineteen. In addition, per \"Knight Templar\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTemplar has aliases, often using the initials S.T. such as \"Sebastian Tombs\" or \"Sugarman Treacle\". Blessed with boyish humour, he makes humorous remarks and leaves a \"calling card\" at his \"crimes,\" a stick figure of a man with a halo over his head. This is used as the logo of the books, the films, and the three TV series. Supposedly, the stick figure was created by Charteris when he was a boy, \"...drawing cartoons for his own four-page magazine at 10...\"\nHe is described as \"a buccaneer in the suits of Savile Row, amused, cool, debonair, with hell-for-leather blue eyes and a saintly smile\".\nHis origin remains a mystery; he is explicitly British, but in early books (\"e.g.,\" \"Meet the Tiger\") there are references which suggest that he had spent some time in the United States battling Prohibition villains. Presumably, his acquaintance with Bronx sidekick Hoppy Uniatz dates from this period. In the books, his income is derived from the pockets of the \"ungodly\" (as he terms those who live by a lesser moral code than his own), whom he is given to \"socking on the boko.\" There are references to a \"ten percent collection fee\" to cover expenses when he extracts large sums from victims, the remainder being returned to the owners, given to charity, shared among Templar's colleagues, or some combination of those possibilities.\nTemplar's targets include corrupt politicians, warmongers, and other low life. \"He claims he's a Robin Hood,\" says one victim, \"but to me he's just a robber and a hood.\" Robin Hood appears to be one inspiration for the character; Templar stories were often promoted as featuring \"The Robin Hood of modern crime,\" and this phrase to describe Templar appears in several stories. A term used by Templar to describe his acquisitions is \"boodle,\" a term also applied to the short story collection.\nThe Saint has a dark side, as he is willing to ruin the lives of the \"ungodly,\" and even kill them, if he feels that more innocent lives can be saved. In the early books, Templar refers to this as murder, although he considers his actions justified and righteous, a view usually shared by partners and colleagues. Several adventures centre on his intention to kill. (For example, \"Arizona\" in \"The Saint Goes West\" has Templar planning to kill a Nazi scientist.)\nDuring the 1920s and early 1930s, the Saint is fighting European arms dealers, drug runners, and white slavers while based in his London home. His battles with Rayt Marius mirror the 'four rounds with Carl Petersen' of Bulldog Drummond. During the first half of the 1940s, Charteris cast Templar as a willing operative of the American government, fighting Nazi interests in the United States during World War II.\nBeginning with the \"Arizona\" novella, Templar is fighting his own war against Germany. \"The Saint Steps In\" reveals that Templar is operating on behalf of a mysterious American government official known as Hamilton who appears again in the next WWII-era Saint book, \"The Saint on Guard,\" and Templar is shown continuing to act as a secret agent for Hamilton in the first post-war novel, \"The Saint Sees it Through.\" The later books move from confidence games, murder mysteries, and wartime espionage, and place Templar as a global adventurer.\nAccording to \"Saint\" historian Burl Barer, Charteris made the decision to remove Templar from his usual confidence-game trappings, not to mention his usual co-stars Uniatz, girlfriend Patricia Holm, valet Orace, and police foil Claud Eustace Teal, as they were all inappropriate for the post-war stories he was writing.\nAlthough the Saint functions as an ordinary detective in some stories, others depict ingenious plots to get even with vanity publishers and other rip-off artists, greedy bosses who exploit their workers, con men, etc.\nCharteris gave Templar interests and quirks as the series went on. Early talents as an amateur poet and songwriter were displayed, often to taunt villains, though the novella \"The Inland Revenue\" established that poetry was also a hobby. That story revealed that Templar had written an adventure novel featuring a South American hero not far removed from The Saint himself.\nTemplar also on occasion would break the fourth wall in an almost metafictional sense, making references to being part of a story and mentioning in one early story how he cannot be killed so early on; the 1960s television series would also have Templar address viewers. Charteris in his narrative also frequently breaks the fourth wall by making references to the \"chronicler\" of the Saint's adventures and directly addressing the reader. In the story \"The Sizzling Saboteur\" in \"The Saint on Guard\" Charteris inserts his own name. In the story \"Judith\" in \"Saint Errant\" is the line, \"'This,' the Saint said to nobody in particular, 'sounds like one of those stories that fellow Charteris might write.'\" Furthermore, in the 1955 story \"The Unkind Philanthropist,\" published in the collection \"The Saint on the Spanish Main,\" Templar states outright that (in his fictional universe) his adventures are indeed written about by a man named Leslie Charteris.\nOther recurring characters.\nThe Saint has many partners, though none last throughout the series. For the first half until the late 1940s, the most recurrent is Patricia Holm, his girlfriend, who was introduced in the first story, the 1928 novel \"Meet the Tiger,\" in which she shows herself a capable adventurer. Holm appeared erratically throughout the series, sometimes disappearing for books at a time. Templar and Holm lived together in a time when common-law relationships were uncommon and, in some areas, illegal.\nThey have an easy, non-binding relationship, as Templar is shown flirting with other women from time to time. However, his heart remains true to Holm in the early books, culminating in his considering marriage in the novella \"The Melancholy Journey of Mr. Teal,\" only to have Holm say that she had no interest in marrying. Holm disappeared in the late 1940s, and according to Barer's history of \"The Saint,\" Charteris refused to allow Templar a steady girlfriend, or Holm to return. (However, according to the Saintly Bible website, Charteris did write a film story that would have seen Templar encountering a son he had had with Holm.) Holm's final appearance as a character was in the short stories \"Iris,\" \"Lida,\" and \"Luella,\" contained within the 1948 collection \"Saint Errant;\" the next direct reference to her does not appear in print until the 1983 novel \"Salvage for the Saint.\"\nAnother recurring character, Scotland Yard Inspector Claud Eustace Teal, could be found attempting to put the Saint behind bars, although in some books they work in partnership. In \"The Saint in New York,\" Teal's American counterpart, NYPD Inspector John Henry Fernack, was introduced, and he would become, like Teal, an Inspector Lestrade-like foil and pseudo-nemesis in a number of books, notably the American-based World War II novels of the 1940s.\nThe Saint had a band of compatriots, including Roger Conway, Norman Kent, Archie Sheridan, Richard \"Dicky\" Tremayne (a name that appeared in the 1990s TV series, \"Twin Peaks\"), Peter Quentin, Monty Hayward, and his ex-military valet, Orace.\nIn later stories, the dim-witted and constantly soused but reliable American thug Hoppy Uniatz was at Templar's side. Of the Saint's companions, only Norman Kent was killed during an adventure (he sacrifices himself to save Templar in the novel \"The Last Hero\"); the other males are presumed to have settled down and married (two to former female criminals: Dicky Tremayne to \"Straight Audrey\" Perowne and Peter Quentin to Kathleen \"The Mug\" Allfield; Archie Sheridan is mentioned to have married in \"The Lawless Lady\" in \"Enter the Saint,\" presumably to Lilla McAndrew after the events of the story \"The Wonderful War\" in \"Featuring the Saint).\"\nThe Hirondel.\nThe Hirondel (sometimes misspelled as Hirondelle) is a fictional car driven by Simon Templar. The Hirondel is an opulent, eight-cylinder, cream and red vehicle costing \u00a35,000 and is a recurring element in many of The Saint books. The Hirondel is also used by Storm (Captain Arden) in the non-Saint novel \"Daredevil.\" \"Daredevil\" also features inspector Teal. The Hirondel was featured in a 1972 issue of \"Automobile Quarterly\" (Vol. 10 No. 1).\nPublishing history.\nThe origins of the Saint can be found in early works by Charteris, some of which predated the first Saint novel, 1928's \"Meet the Tiger\", or were written after it but before Charteris committed to writing a Saint series. Burl Barer reveals that an obscure early work, \"Daredevil\", not only featured a heroic lead who shared \"Saintly\" traits (down to driving the same make of car) but also shared his adventures with Inspector Claud Eustace Teal\u2014a character later a regular in Saint books. Barer writes that several early Saint stories were rewritten from non-Saint stories, including the novel \"She Was a Lady\", which appeared in magazine form featuring a different lead character.\nCharteris utilized three formats for delivering his stories. Besides full-length novels, he wrote novellas for the most part published in magazines, notably developing the character in the pages of the British story-paper \"The Thriller\" under the tutelage of Monty Hayden, who was developing the \u2033Desperado\u2033 character type for the magazine, and these were later collected in hardback books collecting two or three stories per volume. He also wrote short stories featuring the character, again mostly for magazines and later compiled into omnibus editions. In later years these short stories carried a common theme, such as the women Templar meets or exotic places he visits. With the exception of \"Meet the Tiger\", chapter titles of Templar novels usually contain a descriptive phrase describing the events of the chapter; for example, Chapter Four of \"Knight Templar\" is titled \"How Simon Templar dozed in the Green Park and discovered a new use for toothpaste\".\nAlthough Charteris's novels and novellas had more conventional thriller plots than his confidence game short stories, both novels and stories are admired. As in the past, the appeal lies in the vitality of the character, a hero who can go into a brawl and come out with his hair combed and who, faced with death, lights a cigarette and taunts his enemy with the signature phrase \"As the actress said to the bishop\u00a0...\"\nThe period of the books begins in the 1920s and moves to the 1970s as the 50 books progress (the character being seemingly ageless). In early books most activities are illegal, although directed at villains. In later books, this becomes less so. In books written during World War II, the Saint was recruited by the government to help track spies and similar undercover work. Later he became a cold warrior fighting Communism. The quality of writing also changes; early books have a freshness which becomes replaced by cynicism in later works. A few Saint stories crossed into science fiction and fantasy, \"The Man Who Liked Ants\" and the early novel \"The Last Hero\" being examples; one Saint short story, \"The Darker Drink\" (also published as \"Dawn\"), was even published in the October 1952 issue of \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\". When early Saint books were republished in the 1960s to the 1980s, it was not uncommon to see freshly written introductions by Charteris apologizing for the out-of-date tone; according to a Charteris \"apology\" in a 1969 paperback of \"Featuring the Saint\", he attempted to update some earlier stories when they were reprinted but gave up and let them sit as period pieces. The 1963 edition of the short story collection \"The Happy Highwayman\" contains examples of abandoned revisions; in one story published in the 1930s (\"The Star Producers\"), references to actors of the 1930s were replaced for 1963 with names of current movie stars; another 1930s-era story, \"The Man Who Was Lucky\", added references to atomic power. Although Templar is depicted as ageless, Charteris occasionally acknowledged the passing of time for those around him, such as in the 1956 short story collection \"The Saint Around the World\" which features the retirement of Inspector Teal in one story.\nCharteris started retiring from writing books following 1963's \"The Saint in the Sun\". The next book to carry Charteris's name, 1964's \"Vendetta for the Saint\", was written by science fiction author Harry Harrison, who had worked on the \"Saint\" comic strip, after which Charteris edited and revised the manuscript. Between 1964 and 1983, another 14 \"Saint\" books would be published, credited to Charteris but written by others. In his introduction to the first, \"The Saint on TV\", Charteris called these volumes a team effort in which he oversaw selection of stories, initially adaptations of scripts written for the 1962\u20131969 TV series \"The Saint\", and with Fleming Lee writing the adaptations (other authors took over from Lee). Charteris and Lee collaborated on two Saint novels in the 1970s, \"The Saint in Pursuit\" (based on a story by Charteris for the \"Saint\" comic strip) and \"The Saint and the People Importers\". The \"team\" writers were usually credited on the title page, if not the cover. One later volume, \"Catch the Saint\", was an experiment in returning The Saint to his period, prior to World War II (as opposed to recent Saint books set in the present day). Several later volumes also adapted scripts from the 1970s revival TV series \"Return of the Saint\".\nThe last \"Saint\" volume in the line of books starting with \"Meet the Tiger\" in 1928 was \"Salvage for the Saint\", published in 1983. According to the Saintly Bible website, every Saint book published between 1928 and 1983 saw the first edition issued by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in the United Kingdom (a company that originally published only religious books) and The Crime Club (an imprint of Doubleday that specialized in mystery and detective fiction) in the United States. For the first 20 years, the books were first published in Britain, with the United States edition following up to a year later. By the late 1940s to early 1950s, this situation had been reversed. In one case\u2014\"The Saint to the Rescue\"\u2014a British edition did not appear until nearly two years after the American one.\nFrench language books published over 30 years included translated volumes of Charteris originals as well as novelisations of radio scripts from the English-language radio series and comic strip adaptations. Many of these books credited to Charteris were written by others, including Madeleine Michel-Tyl.\nCharteris died in 1993. Two additional Saint novels appeared around the time of the 1997 film starring Val Kilmer: a novelisation of the film (which had little connection to the Charteris stories) and \"Capture the Saint\", a more faithful work published by The Saint Club (originated by Charteris in 1936). Both books were written by Burl Barer, who in the early 1990s published a history of the character in books, radio, and television.\nCharteris wrote 14 novels between 1928 and 1971 (the last two co-written), 34 novellas, and 95 short stories featuring Simon Templar. Between 1963 and 1997, an additional seven novels and fourteen novellas were written by others.\nIn 2014, all the Saint books from \"Enter the Saint\" to \"Salvage for the Saint\" (but not \"Meet the Tiger\" nor Burl Barer's \"Capture the Saint\") were republished in both the United Kingdom and United States.\nOn radio.\nSeveral radio drama series were produced in North America, Ireland, and Britain. The earliest was for Radio \u00c9ireann's Radio Athlone in 1940 and starred Terence De Marney. Radio Times dated 11 October 1940 refers to \"'The Saint' Terence de Marney as the Charteris hero.\" Both NBC and CBS produced \"Saint\" series during 1945, starring Edgar Barrier and Brian Aherne. Many early shows were adaptations of published stories, although Charteris wrote several storylines for the series which were novelised as short stories and novellas.\nThe longest-running radio incarnation was Vincent Price, who played the character in a series between 1947 and 1951 on three networks: CBS, Mutual and NBC. Like \"The Whistler\", the program had an opening whistle theme with footsteps. Price left in May 1951, to be replaced by Tom Conway, who played the role for several more months; his brother, George Sanders, had played Templar on film. For more about the Saint on American radio, see \"The Saint (radio program)\".\nThe next English-language radio series aired on Springbok Radio in South Africa between 1953 and 1957. These were fresh adaptations of the original stories and starred Tom Meehan. Around 1965 to 1966 the South African version of Lux Radio Theatre produced a single dramatization of \"The Saint\". The English service of South Africa produced another series radio adventures for six months in 1970\u20131971. The most recent English-language incarnation was a series of three one-hour-long radio plays on BBC Radio 4 in 1995, all adapted from Charteris novels: \"Saint Overboard\", \"The Saint Closes The Case\" and \"The Saint Plays With Fire\", starring Paul Rhys as Templar.\nIn film.\nNot long after creating The Saint, Charteris began a long association with Hollywood as a screenwriter. He was successful in getting a major studio, RKO Radio Pictures, interested in a film based on one of his works. The first, \"The Saint in New York\" in 1938, based on the 1935 novel of the same name, starred Louis Hayward as Templar and Jonathan Hale as Inspector Henry Fernack, the American counterpart of Mr Teal.\nThe film was a success and RKO began a Saint series. Some of the films were based on Charteris's original novels or novellas; others were original stories based upon outlines by Charteris. Louis Hayward was no longer available, as he was now under contract to independent producer Edward Small. The role of Simon Templar went to George Sanders. Sanders's suave, offhand manner captured the urbane yet daring qualities of the Saint character. \nAfter five films RKO discontinued American production but made two more films in England, using funds that had been frozen by recent British legislation. Actor Hugh Sinclair played Simon Templar in both films, produced in 1941: \"The Saint's Vacation\" and \"The Saint Meets the Tiger\". The second film was shelved until 1943, when it was released by Republic Pictures.\nIn 1943 RKO launched a new series featuring \"The Falcon\". George Sanders again played a debonair adventurer, and \"Saint\" leading lady Wendy Barrie was on hand as well. The new Falcon pictures followed the \"Saint\" pattern so closely that author Charteris sued RKO, charging unfair competition. Charteris told author David Zinman in 1971, \"RKO switched to The Falcon, a flagrant carbon copy of their version of The Saint, in my opinion with the single mercenary motive of saving the payments they had to make to me for the film rights.\" Charteris actually makes fun of The Falcon in his 1943 novel \"The Saint Steps In\", with a character referring to the Falcon as \"a bargain-basement imitation\" of The Saint.\nIn 1953, British Hammer Film Productions produced \"The Saint's Return\" (known as \"The Saint's Girl Friday\" in the United States), for which Louis Hayward returned to the role. This was followed by an unsuccessful French production in 1960.\nIn the mid-1980s, the \"National Enquirer\" and other newspapers reported that Roger Moore was planning to produce a movie based on \"The Saint\" with Pierce Brosnan as Templar, but it was never made. In 1989, six movies were made by Taffner starring Simon Dutton. These were syndicated in the United States as part of a series of films titled \"Mystery Wheel of Adventure,\" while in the United Kingdom they were shown as a series on ITV.\nIn 1991, as detailed by Burl Barer in his 1992 history of \"The Saint,\" plans were announced for a series of motion pictures. Ultimately, however, no such franchise appeared. A feature film \"The Saint\" starring Val Kilmer was released in 1997, but it diverged in style from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar's use of aliases. Kilmer's Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; this would have been unthinkable in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer's character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even his main enemies live to stand trial, whereas Charteris's version had no qualms about taking another life. Kilmer's Saint is presented as a master of disguise, but Charteris's version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris's own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar's Volvo.\nIn July 2021, Paramount Pictures announced a reboot film, with Reg\u00e9-Jean Page set to play Templar.\nOn television.\nThe actor Roger Moore brought Simon Templar to the new medium of television in the series \"The Saint\", which ran from 1962 to 1969, and Moore remains the actor most closely identified with the character. (According to the book \"Spy Television\" by Wesley Britton, the first actor offered the role was Patrick McGoohan of \"Danger Man\" and \"The Prisoner.\")\nOther actors played Templar in later series, notably \"Return of the Saint\" (1978\u20131979) starring Ian Ogilvy; the series ran for one season on CBS and ITV. A television pilot for a series to be called \"The Saint in Manhattan\", starring Australian actor Andrew Clarke, was shown on CBS in 1987 as part of the \"CBS Summer Playhouse;\" this pilot was produced by Donald L. Taffner, but it never progressed beyond the pilot stage. \nInspector John Fernack of the NYPD, played by Kevin Tighe, made his first film appearance since the 1940s in that production, while Templar (sporting a moustache) got about in a black Lamborghini bearing the ST1 licence plate.\nSince the 1997 Val Kilmer film \"The Saint\", there have been several failed attempts at producing pilots for potential new \"Saint\" television series. On 13 March 2007, TNT said it was developing a one-hour series to be executive produced by William J. MacDonald and produced by Jorge Zamacona. James Purefoy was announced as the new Simon Templar. Production of the pilot, which was to have been directed by Barry Levinson, did not go ahead. Another attempt at production was planned for 2009 with Scottish actor Dougray Scott starring as Simon Templar. Roger Moore announced on his website that he would be appearing in the new production, which was being produced by his son, Geoffrey Moore, in a small role.\nIt was announced in December 2012 that a third attempt would be made to produce a pilot for a potential TV series. This time, English actor Adam Rayner was cast as Simon Templar and American actress Eliza Dushku as Patricia Holm (a character from the novels never before portrayed on television and only once in the films), with Roger Moore producing. Unlike the prior attempts, production of the Rayner pilot did commence in December 2012 and continued into early 2013, with Moore and Ogilvy making cameo appearances, according to a cast list posted on the official Leslie Charteris website and subsequently confirmed in the trailer that was released. The pilot was not picked up for a series, but a large amount of additional footage was shot to complete it as the television film \"The Saint\", released on 11 July 2017.\nFilms.\nSince 1938, numerous films have been produced in the United States, France and Australia based to varying degrees upon the Saint. A few were based, usually loosely, upon Charteris's stories, but most were original.\nThis is a list of the films featuring Simon Templar and of the actors who played the Saint:\nIn the 1930s, RKO purchased the rights to produce a film adaptation of \"Saint Overboard,\" but no such movie was ever produced.\n\"This list includes only productions that became TV series, and does not include pilots.\"\nNote.\nThree of the actors to play Templar\u2014Roger Moore, Ian Ogilvy, and Simon Dutton\u2014have been appointed vice presidents of \"The Saint Club\" that was founded by Leslie Charteris in 1936.\nOn the stage.\nIn the late 1940s Charteris and sometime Sherlock Holmes scriptwriter Denis Green wrote a stage play titled \"The Saint Misbehaves\".\nIt was never publicly performed, as soon after writing it Charteris decided to focus on non-Saint work. For many years it was thought to be lost; however, two copies are known to exist in private hands, and correspondence relating to the play can be found in the Leslie Charteris Collection at Boston University.\nIn comics.\nThe Saint appeared in a long-running series starting as a daily comic strip 27 September 1948 with a Sunday added on 20 March the following year. The early strips were written by Leslie Charteris, who had previous experience writing comic strips, having replaced Dashiell Hammett as the writer of the \"Secret Agent X-9\" strip. The original artist was Mike Roy. In 1951, when John Spranger replaced Roy as the artist, he altered the Saint's appearance by depicting him with a beard. Bob Lubbers illustrated \"The Saint\" in 1959 and 1960. The final two years of the strip were drawn by Doug Wildey before it came to an end on 16 September 1961.\nConcurrent with the comic strip, Avon Comics published 12 issues of a \"The Saint\" comic book between 1947 and 1952 (some of these stories were reprinted in the 1980s). Some issues included uncredited short text stories; one of these, \"Danger No. 5\", also appeared as filler in issue 2 of the 1952 war comic \"Captain Steve Savage\".\nThe 1960s TV series is unusual in that it is one of the few major programs of its genre that was not adapted as a comic book in the United States. It was, however, adapted as a comic strip in the British weekly comic \"TV Tornado (later merging with TV21)\", where it ran from 1967 to 1970, drawn by Vicente Alcazar. The strip was titled \"Meet the Saint\" in later issues.\nIn Sweden, a long-running Saint comic book was published from 1966 to 1985 under the title \"Helgonet\". It originally reprinted the newspaper strip, but already in 1969 original stories were commissioned for \"Helgonet\". These stories were also later reprinted in other European countries. About 170 stories were produced from 1969 to 1991 (after 1985, the stories were published in the Swedish \"James Bond\" comic book). Two of the main writers were Norman Worker and Donne Avenell; the latter also co-wrote the novels \"The Saint and the Templar Treasure\" and the novella collection \"Count on the Saint\", while Worker contributed to the novella collection \"Catch the Saint\".\nA new American comic book series was launched by Moonstone in the summer of 2012, but it never went beyond a single promotional issue \"zero\".\nIn magazines.\nThe original Saint novellas first appeared in \"The Thriller\" (1929\u20131940), edited by Monty Hayden, a friend of the author, who was sometimes given a thinly disguised role in the early stories. Charteris also edited or oversaw several magazines that tied in with the Saint. The first of these were anthologies titled \"The Saint's Choice\" that ran for seven issues in 1945\u201346. A few years later Charteris launched \"The Saint Detective Magazine\" (later titled \"The Saint Mystery Magazine\" and \"The Saint Magazine\"), which ran for 141 issues between 1953 and 1967, with a separate British edition that ran just as long but published different material. In most issues of \"Saint's Choice\" and the later magazines Charteris included at least one Saint story, usually previously published in one of his books but occasionally original. In several mid-1960s issues, however, he substituted \"Instead of the Saint\", a series of essays on topics of interest to him. The rest of the material in the magazines consisted of novellas and short stories by other mystery writers of the day. An Australian edition was also published for a few years in the 1950s. In 1984 Charteris attempted to revive the \"Saint\" magazine, but it ran for only three issues.\nLeslie Charteris himself portrayed The Saint in \"The Saint Goes West\", a photo play in an issue of \"Life magazine\" published in 19 May 1941. Other performers in the piece were Morgan Conway, Lucia Carroll and Marjorie Woodworth.\nBook series.\nMost Saint books were collections of novellas or short stories, some of which were published individually either in magazines or in smaller paperback form. Many of the books have also been published under different titles over the years; the titles used here are the more common ones for each book.\nFrom 1964 to 1983, the Saint books were collaborative works; Charteris acted in an editorial capacity and received front cover author credit, while other authors wrote these stories and were credited inside the book. These collaborative authors are noted. (Sources: Barer and the editions themselves.)\nOmnibus editions.\nIn addition to the above, numerous paperback omnibuses compiling short stories and novellas have been published. Examples include \"Arrest the Saint\" (Avon, 1951), \"Concerning the Saint\" (Avon, 1958) and \"The Saint Cleans Up\" (Avon, 1959). In 1983, Avenel Books published the hardcover omnibus \"The Saint: Five Complete Novels\", though this was actually three novellas and two full-length novels, combining the books \"Enter the Saint\", \"The Holy Terror\" (a.k.a. \"The Saint vs. Scotland Yard\"), \"The Last Hero\" (a.k.a. \"The Saint Closes the Case\") and \"Knight Templar\" (a.k.a. \"The Avenging Saint\").\nFrench adventures.\nA number of \"Saint\" adventures were published in French over a 30-year period, most of which have yet to be published in English. Many of these stories were ghostwritten by Madeleine Michel-Tyl and credited to Charteris (who exercised some editorial control). The French books were generally novelisations of scripts from the radio series, or novels adapted from stories in the American \"Saint\" comic strip. One of the writers who worked on the French series, Fleming Lee, later wrote for the English-language books.\nUnpublished works.\nBurl Barer's history of the Saint identifies two manuscripts that to date have not been published. The first is a collaboration between Charteris and Fleming Lee called \"Bet on the Saint\" that was rejected by Doubleday, the American publishers of the Saint series. Charteris, Barer writes, chose not to submit it to his United Kingdom publishers, Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The rejection of the manuscript by Doubleday meant that The Crime Club's long-standing right of first refusal on any new Saint works was now ended and the manuscript was then submitted to other United States publishers, without success. Barer also tells of a 1979 novel titled \"The Saint's Lady\" by a Scottish fan, Joy Martin, which had been written as a present for and as a tribute to Charteris. Charteris was impressed by the manuscript and attempted to get it published, but it too was ultimately rejected. The manuscript, which according to Barer is in the archives of Boston University, features the return of Patricia Holm.\nAccording to the Saintly Bible website, at one time Leslie Charteris biographer Ian Dickerson was working on a manuscript (based upon a film story idea by Charteris) for a new novel titled \"Son of the Saint\" in which Templar shares an adventure with his son by Patricia Holm. The book has, to date, not been published.\nA fourth unpublished manuscript, this time written by Charteris himself, titled \"The Saint's Second Front\" was written during the Second World War but was rejected at the time; believed lost for decades, it emerged at an auction in 2017.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2003 BBC documentary series \"Heroes and Weapons of World War II\" episode titled \"The Man Who Designed the Spitfire\" (Episode 2) at approximately 18 minutes in the film an RAF pilot is seen at rest in his dispersal hut with a large Saint stick-man logo on his flying gear (see image at right). He is perhaps showing some personal identification with Simon Templar's own war against Germany in the novella \"Arizona\".\nIn 1980 English punk band Splodgenessabounds released a single \"Simon Templer\" (misspelling intentional). It reached number 7 in the UK charts. The song appears mocking of the TV character, concluding \"I think Simon's a bit of a bore/Ian Ogilvy and Podgy Moore.\"\nIn 1962 students from James Cook University, Townsville, Australia abseiled down the pink granite monolith, Castle Hill and painted the character on its side as an act of patriotism, as the university had adopted the character as their mascot. At first, the local council (and some of the public) considered this vandalism and removed it, only for the students to keep repainting it. The council eventually gave up, and The Saint has been a permanent fixture since the 1970s. The irony now is that Queensland State Legislation states that objects older than 30 years old are eligible for cultural heritage status. This means that The Saint, originally a piece of graffiti, is now a Townsville Cultural Heritage icon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Almost 80 million people worldwide stutter, about 1% of the world's population, with a prevalence among males at least twice that of females. Persistent stuttering into adulthood often leads to outcomes detrimental to overall mental health, such as social isolation and suicidal thoughts.\nStuttering is not connected to the physical ability to produce phonemes (i.e. it is unrelated to the structure or function of the vocal cords). It is also unconnected to the structuring of thoughts into coherent sentences inside sufferers' brains, meaning that people with a stutter know precisely what they are trying to say (in contrast with alternative disorders like aphasia). Stuttering is purely a neurological disconnect between intent and outcome during the task of expressing each individual sound. While there are rarer neurogenic (e.g. acquired during physical insult) and psychogenic (e.g. acquired after adult-onset mental illness or trauma) variants, the typical etiology, development, and presentation is that of idiopathic stuttering in childhood that then becomes persistent into adulthood.\nAcute nervousness and stress do not cause stuttering but may trigger increased stuttering in people who have the disorder. There is a significant correlation between anxiety, particularly social anxiety, and stuttering, but stuttering is a distinct, engrained neurobiological phenomenon and thus only exacerbated, not caused, by anxiety. Anxiety consistently worsens stuttering symptoms in acute settings in those with comorbid anxiety disorders.\nLiving with a stigmatized speech disability like a stutter can result in high allostatic load (i.e. adverse pathophysiological sequelae of high and/or highly variable nervous system stress). Despite the negative physiological outcomes associated with stuttering and its concomitant stress levels, the link is not bidirectional: neither acute nor chronic stress has been shown to cause a predisposition to stuttering.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacteristics.\nAudible disfluencies.\nCommon stuttering behaviors are observable signs of speech disfluencies, for example: repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. \nThe disorder is \"variable\", which means that in certain situations the stuttering might be more or less noticeable, such as speaking on the phone or in large groups. People who stutter often find that their stuttering fluctuates, sometimes at random.\nThe moment of stuttering often begins before the disfluency is produced, described as a moment of \"anticipation\"\u2014where the person who stutters knows which word they are going to stutter on. The sensation of losing control and anticipation of a stutter can lead people who stutter to react in different ways including behavioral and cognitive reactions. Some behavioral reactions can manifest outwardly and be observed as physical tension or struggle anywhere in the body.\nOutward physical behaviors.\nPeople who stutter may have reactions, avoidance behaviors, or secondary behaviors related to their stuttering that may look like struggle and tension in the body. These could range anywhere from tension in the head and neck, behaviors such as snapping or tapping, or facial grimacing. \nBehavioral reactions.\nThese behavioral reactions are those that might not be apparent to listeners and only be perceptible to people who stutter. Some people who stutter exhibit covert behaviors such as avoiding speaking situations, substituting words or phrases when they know they are going to stutter, or use other methods to hide their stutter.\nFeelings and attitudes.\nStuttering could have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters. Joseph Sheehan described this in terms of an analogy to an iceberg, with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the waterline and a broader set of symptoms such as negative emotions hidden below the surface. Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt are frequent in people who stutter, and may increase tension and effort. With time, continued negative experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. People who stutter may project their own attitudes onto others, believing that the others think them nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.\nThe impact of discrimination against stuttering can be severe. This may result in fears of stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying or discrimination, or feeling pressured to hide stuttering. In popular media, stuttering is sometimes seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is no direct correlation in that direction.\nAlternatively, there are those who embrace stuttering pride and encourage other stutterers to take pride in their stutter and to find how it has been beneficial for them.\nAccording to adults who stutter, however, stuttering is defined as a \"constellation of experiences\" expanding beyond the external disfluencies that are apparent to the listener. Much of the experience of stuttering is internal and encompasses experiences beyond the external speech disfluencies, which are not observable by the listener.\nAssociated conditions.\nStuttering can co-occur with other disabilities. These associated disabilities include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCauses.\nThe cause of developmental stuttering is complex. It is thought to be neurological with a genetic factor.\nVarious hypotheses suggest multiple factors contributing to stuttering. There is strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis. Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter. In a 2010 article, three genes were found by Dennis Drayna and team to correlate with stuttering: GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA. Researchers estimated that alterations in these three genes were present in 9% of those who have a family history of stuttering.\nThere is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concurrent speech, language, learning or motor difficulties. For some people who stutter, congenital factors may play a role. In others, there could be added impact due to stressful situations. However there is no evidence to suggest this as a cause.\nLess common causes of stuttering include neurogenic stuttering (stuttering that occurs secondary to brain damage, such as after a stroke) and psychogenic stuttering (stuttering related to a psychological condition).\nHistory of causes.\nAuditory processing deficits were proposed as a cause of stuttering due to differences in stuttering for deaf or Hard of Hearing individuals, as well as the impact of auditory feedback machines on some stuttering cases.\nSome possibilities of linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not has been proposed. Brain scans of adult stutterers have found greater activation of the right hemisphere, than of the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.\nThe 'capacities and demands model' has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. Speech performance varies depending on the 'capacity' that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the 'demands' placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Demands may be increased by internal factors or inadequate language skills or external factors. In stuttering, severity often increases when demands placed on the person's speech and language system increase. However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated. Stress, or demands, can impact many disorders without being a cause.\nAnother theory has been that adults who stutter have elevated levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine.\nIt was once thought that forcing a left-handed student to write with their right-hand due to bias against left-handed people caused stuttering, but this myth died out.\nDiagnosis.\nSome characteristics of stuttered speech are not as easy for listeners to detect. As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a licensed speech\u2013language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation of the individual and information about the individual's background, through a case history. The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child). They may also observe parent-child interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child's parents. The overall goal of assessment for the SLP will be (1) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists, and (2) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment.\nDuring direct observation of the client, the SLP will observe various aspects of the individual's speech behaviors. In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Disfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (\"Riley's Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)\"). They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course. One such test includes the stuttering prediction instrument for young children (SPI), which analyzes the child's case history, and stuttering frequency in order to determine the severity of the disfluency and its prognosis for chronicity for the future.\nStuttering is a multifaceted, complex disorder that can impact an individual's life in a variety of ways. Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker's experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).\nClinical psychologists with adequate expertise can also diagnose stuttering per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes. The DSM-5 describes \"Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\" for developmental stuttering, and \"Adult-onset Fluency Disorder\". However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA's published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms \"fluency\" and \"disfluency\".\nOther disfluencies.\nPreschool aged children often have difficulties with speech concerning motor planning and execution; this often manifests as disfluencies related to speech development (referred to as normal dysfluency or \"other disfluencies\"). This type of disfluency is a normal part of speech development and temporarily present in preschool-aged children who are learning to speak.\nClassification.\n\"Developmental stuttering\" is stuttering that has its onset in early childhood when a child is learning to speak. \"Neurogenic stuttering\" (stuttering that occurs secondary to brain damage, such as after a stroke) and \"psychogenic stuttering\" (stuttering related to a psychological condition) are less common and classified separately from developmental.\nDevelopmental (and persistent).\n\"Developmental stuttering\" is a sometimes transient period of stuttering that has its onset in early childhood, i.e. when a child is learning to speak. About 5-7% of children are said to stutter during this period. Despite its name, the onset itself is often sudden. This type of stutter may persist after the age of 7, which is then classified as \"persistent stuttering\", which is the typical aetiology, pathogenesis, and presentation of adult stuttering.\nNeurogenic (or \"acquired\").\n\"Neurogenic stuttering\", which may also be called \"acquired stuttering\", typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including the cortical and subcortical regions, cerebellum, and even the neural pathway regions (i.e. the deepest clusters - tracts - of nerves and nerve cells). It may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. This stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback are not effective with the acquired type.\nPsychogenic.\n\"Psychogenic stuttering\", which accounts for less than 1% of all stuttering cases, may arise after a traumatic experience such as a death, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nOther disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering, or associated disorders include autism, cluttering, Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, palilalia, spasmodic dysphonia, selective mutism, and apraxia of speech.\nTreatment.\nWhile there is no cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist and the best option is dependent on the individual. Therapy should be individualized and tailored to the specific and unique needs of the client. The speech\u2013language pathologist and the client typically work together to create achievable and realistic goals that target communication confidence, autonomy, managing emotions and stress related to their stutter, and working on disclosure.\n Fluency shaping therapy trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on operant conditioning techniques. This type of therapy is not considered best practice in the field of speech and language pathology and is potentially harmful and traumatic for clients.\n The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful. The most widely known approach was published by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy. Stuttering modification therapy should not be used to promote fluent speech or presented as a cure for stuttering. \n Avoidance Reduction Therapy for Stuttering (ARTS) is an effective form of modification therapy. It is a framework based on theories developed by professor Joseph Sheehan and his wife Vivian Sheehan. This framework focuses on self-acceptance as someone who stutters, and efficient, spontaneous and joyful communication, essentially, minimizing quality-of-life impact due to stuttering.\n Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the voice of the person who stutters while they are talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback). Studies of these techniques have had mixed results.\n No medication is currently FDA-approved for stuttering. Some research suggests that dopamine antagonists such as ecopipam and deutetrabenazine may have therapeutic potential. More recently, psychedelics have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for developmental stuttering, based on their ability to modulate brain metabolism and neural networks such as the default mode and social-cognitive networks. These systems are thought to contribute to the persistence of stuttering and its associated features, including social anxiety. While clinical trials are currently lacking, anecdotal reports and parallels with other psychiatric conditions have prompted calls for formal investigation.\nSupport.\nSelf-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering.\nPrognosis.\nAmong ages 3\u20135, the prognosis for spontaneously recovery is about 65% to 87.5%. By 7 years of age or within the first two years of stuttering, and about 74% recover by their early teens. In particular, girls are shown to recover more often.\nPrognosis is guarded with later age of onset: children who start stuttering at age 3\u00bd years or later, and/or duration of greater than 6\u201312 months since onset, that is, once stuttering has become established, about 18% of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously. Stuttering that persists after the age of seven is classified as persistent stuttering, and is associated with a much lower chance of recovery.\nEpidemiology.\nThe lifetime prevalence, or the proportion of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5\u20136%, and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females. As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less. This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade, as girls have higher recovery rates. the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.\nCross cultural.\nCross-cultural studies of stuttering prevalence were very active in early and mid-20th century, particularly under the influence of the works of Wendell Johnson, who claimed that the onset of stuttering was connected to the cultural expectations and the pressure put on young children by anxious parents, which has since been debunked. Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs. Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races at similar rates, about 1% of general population (and is about 5% among young children) all around the world. A US-based study indicated that there were no racial or ethnic differences in the incidence of stuttering in preschool children.\nDifferent regions of the world are researched unevenly. The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population. African populations, particularly from West Africa, might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world\u2014reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%. Many regions of the world are not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all.\nBilingual stuttering.\nIdentification.\nBilingualism is the ability to speak two languages. Many bilingual people have been exposed to more than one language since birth and throughout childhood. Since language and culture are relatively fluid factors in a person's understanding and production of language, bilingualism may be a feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.\nIt was once believed that being bilingual would 'confuse' a child and cause stuttering, but research has debunked this myth.\nStuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses. For example, morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less depending on the individual case.\nHistory.\nBecause of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced and the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, it has long been a subject of scientific interest and speculation as well as discrimination and ridicule. People who stutter can be traced back centuries to Demosthenes, who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth. The Talmud interprets Bible passages to indicate that Moses also stuttered, and that placing a burning coal in his mouth had caused him to be \"slow and hesitant of speech\" (Exodus 4, v.10).\nGalen's humoral theories were influential in Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering was attributed to an imbalance of the four bodily humors\u2014yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Hieronymus Mercurialis, writing in the sixteenth century, proposed to redress the imbalance by changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and purging. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.\nIn and around eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe, surgical interventions for stuttering were recommended, including cutting the tongue with scissors, removing a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue, and cutting nerves, or neck and lip muscles. Others recommended shortening the uvula or removing the tonsils. All were abandoned due to the danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering. Less drastically, Jean Marc Gaspard Itard placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support \"weak\" muscles.\nItalian pathologist Giovanni Morgagni attributed stuttering to deviations in the hyoid bone, a conclusion he came to via autopsy. Blessed Notker of St. Gall (c.\u2009840 \u2013 912), called Balbulus (\"The Stutterer\") and described by his biographer as being \"delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine,\" was invoked against stammering.\nA royal Briton who stammered was King George VI. He went through years of speech therapy, most successfully under Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, for his stammer. The Academy Award-winning film \"The King's Speech\" (2010) in which Colin Firth plays George VI, tells his story. The film is based on an original screenplay by David Seidler, who also stuttered until age 16.\nAnother British case was that of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Churchill claimed, perhaps not directly discussing himself, that \"[s]ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience\u00a0...\" However, those who knew Churchill and commented on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that \"Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter\" in her 1941 book \"I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary\". She related one example, \"'It's s-s-simply s-s-splendid,' he stuttered\u2014as he always did when excited.\" Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of \"The American Mercury\" (1942) that \"Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple\" and that \"born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man's perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time.\"\nFor centuries \"cures\" such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one's life, \"hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy\", strengthening the tongue as a muscle, and various herbal remedies were tried. Similarly, in the past people subscribed to odd theories about the causes of stuttering, such as tickling an infant too much, eating improperly during breastfeeding, allowing an infant to look in the mirror, cutting a child's hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the \"work of the devil\".\nSociety and culture.\nStuttering community.\nMany countries have regular events and activities to bring people who stutter together for mutual support. These events take place at regional, national, and international levels. At a regional level, there may be stuttering support or chapter groups that look to provide a place for people who stutter in the local area to meet, discuss and learn from each other.\nAt a national level, stuttering organizations host conferences. Conferences vary in their focus and scope; some focus on the latest research developments, some focus on stuttering and the arts, and others simply look to provide a space for stutterers to come together.\nThere are two international meetings of stutterers. The International Stuttering Association World Congress primarily focuses on individuals who stutter. Meanwhile, the Joint World Congress on Stuttering and Cluttering brings together academics, researchers, speech-language pathologists, as well as people who stutter or clutter, with a focus on research and treatments for stuttering.\nHistoric advocacy and self-help.\nSelf-help and advocacy organisations for people who stammer have reportedly been in existence since the 1920s.\u00a0In 1921, a Philadelphia-based attorney who stammered, J. Stanley Smith, established the Kingsley Club.\u00a0 Designed to support people with a stammer in the Philadelphia area, the club took inspiration for its name from Charles Kingsley.\u00a0Kingsley, a nineteenth-century English social reformer and author of \"Westward Ho!\" and \"The Water Babies\", had a stammer himself.\nWhilst Kingsley himself did not appear to recommend self-help or advocacy groups for people who stammer, the Kingsley Club promoted a positive mental attitude to support its members in becoming confident speakers, in a similar way discussed by Charles Kingsley in \"Irrationale of Speech\".\nOther support groups for people who stammer began to emerge in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1935 a Stammerer's Club was established in Melbourne, Australia, by a Mr H. Collin of Thornbury.\u00a0At the time of its formation it had 68 members. The club was formed in response to the tragic case of a man from Sydney who \"sought relief from the effects of stammering in suicide\".\u00a0As well as providing self-help, this club adopted an advocacy role with the intention of appealing to the Government to provide special education and to fund research into the causes of stammering.\nDisability rights movement.\nSome people who stutter, and are part of the disability rights movement, have begun to embrace their stuttering voices as an important part of their identity. In July 2015 the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced the launch of the Defence Stammering Network to support and champion the interests of British military personnel and MOD civil servants who stammer and to raise awareness of the condition.\nAlthough the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 intended to cover speech disabilities, it was not explicitly named and lawsuits increasingly did not cover stuttering as a disability. In 2009, additional amendments were made to the ADA, and it now specifically covers speech disorders.\nStuttering pride.\nStuttering pride (or stuttering advocacy) is a social movement repositioning stuttering as a valuable and respectable way of speaking. The movement seeks to counter the societal narratives in which temporal and societal expectations dictate how communication takes place. In this sense, the stuttering pride movement challenges the pervasive societal narrative of stuttering as a defect and instead positions stuttering as a valuable and respectable way of speaking in its own right. The movement encourages stutterers to take pride in their unique speech patterns and in what stuttering can tell us about the world. It also advocates for societal adjustments to allow stutterers equal access to education and employment opportunities, and addresses how this may impact stuttering therapy.\nAssociations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28395", "revid": "41562511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28395", "title": "Saxony", "text": "State in Germany\nSaxony, officially the Free State of Saxony, is a landlocked state of Germany, bordering the states of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria, as well as the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig. Saxony is the tenth largest of Germany's sixteen states, with an area of , and the seventh most populous, with more than 4\u00a0million inhabitants. \nThe term Saxony has been in use for more than a millennium. It was used for the medieval Duchy of Saxony, the Electorate of Saxony of the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Saxony, and twice for a republic. The first Free State of Saxony was established in 1918 as a constituent state of the Weimar Republic. After World War II, it was under Soviet occupation before it became part of communist East Germany and was abolished by the government in 1952. Following German reunification, the Free State of Saxony was reconstituted with enlarged borders in 1990 and became one of the five new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nThe area of the modern state of Saxony should not be confused with Old Saxony, the area inhabited by Saxons. Old Saxony corresponds roughly to the modern German states of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and the Westphalian portion of North Rhine-Westphalia. Historically the region of Saxony has sometimes been referred to as Upper Saxony or Obersachsen in German to distinguish it from Lower Saxony.\nThe state is also home to a minority of Sorbs, a West Slavic ethnic group native to the area, numbering an estimated 80,000 people.\nHistory.\nSaxony has a long history as a duchy, an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire (the Electorate of Saxony), and finally as a kingdom (the Kingdom of Saxony). In 1918, after Germany's defeat in World War I, its monarchy was overthrown and a republican form of government was established under the current name. The state was broken up into smaller units during communist rule (1949\u20131989), but was re-established on 3 October 1990 on the reunification of East and West Germany.\nPrehistory.\nIn prehistoric times, the territory of present-day Saxony was the site of some of the largest of the ancient central European monumental temples, dating from the fifth millennium BC. Notable archaeological sites have been discovered in Dresden and the villages of Eythra and Zwenkau near Leipzig. The Germanic presence in the territory of today's Saxony is thought to have begun in the first century BC.\nParts of Saxony were possibly under the control of the Germanic King Marobod during the Roman empire era. By the late Roman period, several tribes known as the Saxons emerged, from which the subsequent state(s) draw their name. \nStem Duchy of Saxony.\nSince the late 6th century, the territory of modern-day Saxony and parts of Thuringia was populated by Polabian Slavs, most prominently the Sorbs. It was conquered by Francia and subsequently organized as the Sorbian March. A legacy of this period is the modern ethnic group of Sorbs in Saxony. Eastern and western parts of present Saxony were ruled by Bohemia at various times between 1075 and 1635 (with some intermissions), and Schirgiswalde (; ) remained a Bohemian exclave until 1809. Eastern parts were also ruled by Poland between 1002 and 1032, by the Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, from 1319 to 1346, and by Hungary from 1469 to 1490, and Pechern () was part of the Duchy of \u017baga\u0144, one of the Lower Silesian duchies formed in the course of the medieval fragmentation of Poland, remaining under the Piast dynasty until 1472.\nThe first medieval Duchy of Saxony was a late Early Middle Ages \"Carolingian stem duchy\", which emerged around the start of the 8th century AD and grew to include the greater part of Northern Germany, what are now the modern German states of Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein and Saxony-Anhalt. Saxons converted to Christianity during this period, with Charlemagne outlawing pagan practices. This geographical region is unrelated to present-day Saxony but the name moved southwards due to certain historical events (see below).\nHoly Roman Empire.\nThe territory of the Free State of Saxony became part of the Holy Roman Empire by the 10th century, when the dukes of Saxony were also kings (or emperors) of the Holy Roman Empire, comprising the Ottonian, or Saxon, dynasty. The Margravate of Meissen was founded in 985 as a frontier march, that soon extended to the Kwisa (Queis) river to the east and as far as the Ore Mountains. In the process of , settlement of German farmers in the sparsely populated area was promoted. Around this time, the Billungs, a Saxon noble family, received extensive lands in Saxony. The emperor eventually gave them the title of dukes of Saxony. After Duke Magnus died in 1106, causing the extinction of the male line of Billungs, oversight of the duchy was given to Lothar of Supplinburg, who also became emperor for a short time.\nIn 1137, control of Saxony passed to the Guelph dynasty, descendants of Wulfhild Billung, eldest daughter of the last Billung duke, and the daughter of Lothar of Supplinburg. In 1180 large portions west of the Weser were ceded to the Bishops of Cologne, while some central parts between the Weser and the Elbe remained with the Guelphs, becoming later the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. The remaining eastern lands, together with the title of Duke of Saxony, passed to an Ascanian dynasty (descended from Eilika Billung, Wulfhild's younger sister) and were divided in 1260 into the two small states of Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. The former state was also named \"Lower Saxony\", the latter \"Upper Saxony\", thence the later names of the two Imperial Circles Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. Both claimed the Saxon electoral privilege for themselves, but the Golden Bull of 1356 accepted only Wittenberg's claim, with Lauenburg nevertheless continuing to maintain its claim. In 1422, when the Saxon electoral line of the Ascanians became extinct, the Ascanian Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg tried to reunite the Saxon duchies.\nHowever, Sigismund, King of the Romans, had already granted Margrave Frederick IV the Warlike of Meissen (House of Wettin) an expectancy of the Saxon electorate in order to remunerate his military support. On 1 August 1425 Sigismund enfeoffed the Wettinian Frederick as Prince-Elector of Saxony, despite the protests of Eric V. Thus the Saxon territories remained permanently separated.\nThe Electorate of Saxony was then merged with the much larger Wettinian Margraviate of Meissen; however, it used the higher-ranking title Electorate of Saxony and even the Ascanian coat-of-arms for the entire monarchy. Thus Saxony came to include Dresden and Meissen. Hence, the territory of the modern Free State of Saxony shares the name with the old Saxon stem duchy for historical and dynastic reasons rather than any significant ethnic, linguistic or cultural connection. In the 18th and 19th centuries Saxe-Lauenburg was colloquially called the Duchy of Lauenburg, which was held in a personal union by the Electorate of Hanover from the 18th century to the Napoleonic wars, and in a personal union with Denmark (along with neighbouring Holstein and Schleswig) for much the 19th century. In 1876 it was absorbed into Prussia as the Duchy of Lauenburg district of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein).\nFoundation of the second Saxon state.\nSaxe-Wittenberg, mostly in modern Saxony-Anhalt, became subject to the margravate of Meissen, ruled by the Wettin dynasty in 1423. This established a new and powerful state, occupying large portions of the present Free State of Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Bavaria (Coburg and its environs). Although the centre of this state was far to the southeast of the former Saxony, it came to be referred to as Upper Saxony and then simply Saxony, while the former Saxon territories in the north were now known as Lower Saxony (the modern term Niedersachsen deriving from this).\nIn 1485, Saxony was split in the Treaty of Leipzig. A collateral line of the Wettin princes received what later became Thuringia and founded several small states there (see \"Ernestine duchies\"). Since these princes were allowed to use the Saxon coat of arms, in many towns of Thuringia, the coat of arms can still be found in historical buildings.\nThe remaining Saxon state became still more powerful, receiving Upper and Lower Lusatia in the Peace of Prague (1635). It also became known in the 18th century for its cultural achievements, although it was politically weaker than Prussia and Austria, states which oppressed Saxony from the north and south, respectively.\nBetween 1697 and 1763, two successive Electors of Saxony were also elected Kings of Poland in personal union. Many landmarks in Saxony date from this period and contain remnants of the former close Polish-Saxon relation, such as the coat of arms of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth on the facades and in the interiors of palaces, churches, edifices, etc. (e.g. Zwinger, Dresden Cathedral, Moritzburg Castle), and on numerous mileposts, and the close political and cultural relationship persisted well into the 19th century, with Saxony being the place of preparations for the Polish Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising against the partitioning powers, and one of the chief destinations for Polish refugees from partitioned Poland, including the artistic and political elite, such as composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, war hero J\u00f3zef Bem and writer Adam Mickiewicz.\nIn 1756, Saxony joined a coalition of Austria, France and Russia against Prussia. Frederick II of Prussia chose to attack preemptively and invaded Saxony in August 1756, precipitating the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years' War). The Prussians quickly defeated Saxony and incorporated the Saxon army into the Prussian Army. At the end of the Seven Years' War, Saxony recovered its independence in the 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg.\n19th century.\nIn 1806, French Emperor Napoleon abolished the Holy Roman Empire and established the Electorate of Saxony as a kingdom in exchange for military support. The Elector Frederick Augustus III accordingly became King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. Frederick Augustus remained loyal to Napoleon during the wars that swept Europe in the following years; he was taken prisoner and his territories were declared forfeit by the allies in 1813, after the defeat of Napoleon. Prussia intended the annexation of Saxony but the opposition of Austria, France, and the United Kingdom to this plan resulted in the restoration of Frederick Augustus to his throne at the Congress of Vienna although he was forced to cede the northern part of the kingdom to Prussia, which led to the loss of nearly 60% of the Saxon territory, and 40% of its population. Most of these lands were merged with the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Altmark and some smaller territories to become the Prussian Province of Saxony, a predecessor of the modern state of Saxony-Anhalt. Lower Lusatia and part of the former Saxe-Wittenberg territory became part of the Province of Brandenburg and the northeastern part of Upper Lusatia became part of the Province of Silesia. The rump Kingdom of Saxony had roughly the same extent as the present state, albeit slightly smaller.\nMeanwhile, in 1815, the Kingdom of Saxony joined the German Confederation. In the politics of the Confederation, Saxony was overshadowed by Prussia and Austria. King Anthony of Saxony came to the throne of Saxony in 1827. Shortly thereafter, liberal pressures in Saxony mounted and broke out in revolt during 1830\u2014a year of revolution in Europe. The revolution in Saxony resulted in a constitution for the Kingdom of Saxony that served as the basis for its government until 1918.\nDuring the 1848\u201349 constitutionalist revolutions in Germany, Saxony became a hotbed of revolutionaries, with anarchists such as Mikhail Bakunin and democrats including Richard Wagner and Gottfried Semper taking part in the May Uprising in Dresden in 1849. The May uprising in Dresden forced King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony to concede further reforms to the Saxon government.\nIn 1854 Frederick Augustus II's brother, King John of Saxony, succeeded to the throne. A scholar, King John translated Dante. King John followed a federalistic and pro-Austrian policy throughout the early 1860s until the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War. During that war, Prussian troops overran Saxony without resistance and then invaded Austrian Bohemia. After the war, Saxony was forced to pay an indemnity and to join the North German Confederation in 1867. Under the terms of the North German Confederation, Prussia took over control of the Saxon postal system, railroads, military and foreign affairs. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Saxon troops fought together with Prussian and other German troops against France. In 1871, Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire.\n20th century.\nAfter King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony abdicated on 13 November 1918, Saxony, remaining a constituent state of Germany (Weimar Republic), became the Free State of Saxony under a new constitution enacted on 1 November 1920. In October 1923, when the Communist Party of Germany entered the Social Democratic-led government in Dresden with hidden revolutionary intentions, the Reich government under Chancellor Gustav Stresemann used a \"Reichsexekution\" to send troops into Saxony to remove the Communists from the government. The state retained its name and borders during the Nazi era as a (Gau Saxony), but lost its quasi-autonomous status and its parliamentary democracy.\nDuring World War II, under the secret Nazi programme \"Aktion T4\", an estimated 15,000 people suffering from mental and physical disabilities, as well as a number of concentration camp inmates, were murdered at Sonnenstein killing centre near Pirna. Numerous subcamps of the Buchenwald, Flossenburg and Gross-Rosen concentration camps were operated in Saxony.\nAs the war drew to its end, U.S. troops under General George Patton occupied the western part of Saxony in April 1945, while Soviet troops occupied the eastern part. That summer, the entire state was handed over to Soviet forces as agreed in the London Protocol of September 1944. Britain, the US, and the USSR then negotiated Germany's future at the Potsdam Conference. Under the Potsdam Agreement, all German territory East of the Oder-Neisse line was annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union, and, unlike in the aftermath of World War I, the annexing powers were allowed to expel the inhabitants. During the following three years, Poland and Czechoslovakia expelled German-speaking people from their territories, and some of these expellees came to Saxony. Only a small area of Saxony lying east of the Neisse River and centred around the town of Reichenau (Bogatynia) was annexed by Poland. Traditional close relations of Saxony with neighbouring German-speaking Egerland were thus completely destroyed, making the border of Saxony along the Ore Mountains a linguistic border.\nPart of the former Prussian province of Lower Silesia lay west of the Oder-Neisse line and therefore was separated from the bulk of its former province; the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SVAG) merged this territory into Saxony. This former Silesian territory broadly corresponded with the Upper Lusatian territory annexed by Prussia in 1815.\nOn 20 October 1946, SVAG organised elections for the Saxon state parliament (), but many people were arbitrarily excluded from candidacy and suffrage, and the Soviet Union openly supported the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The new minister-president Rudolf Friedrichs (SED), had been a member of the SPD until April 1946. He met his Bavarian counterparts in the U.S. zone of occupation in October 1946 and May 1947, but died suddenly in mysterious circumstances the following month. He was succeeded by Max Seydewitz, a loyal follower of Joseph Stalin.\nThe German Democratic Republic (East Germany), including Saxony, was established in 1949 out of the Soviet zone of Occupied Germany, becoming a constitutionally socialist state, part of COMECON and the Warsaw Pact, under the leadership of the SED. In 1952 the government abolished the Free State of Saxony, and divided its territory into three : Leipzig, Dresden, and Karl-Marx-Stadt (formerly and currently Chemnitz). Areas around Hoyerswerda were also part of the Cottbus Bezirk.\nThe Free State of Saxony was reconstituted with slightly altered borders in 1990, following German reunification. Besides the formerly Silesian area of Saxony, which was mostly included in the territory of the new Saxony, the free state gained further areas north of Leipzig that had belonged to Saxony-Anhalt until 1952.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nThe highest mountain in Saxony is the Fichtelberg () in the Western Ore Mountains.\nRivers.\nThere are numerous rivers in Saxony. The Elbe is the most dominant one. The Neisse defines the border between Saxony and Poland. Other rivers include the Mulde and the White Elster.\nLargest cities and towns.\nThe largest cities and towns in Saxony according to the 31 July 2022 estimate are listed below. Leipzig forms a conurbation with Halle, known as \"Ballungsraum Leipzig/Halle\". The latter city is located just across the border of Saxony-Anhalt. Leipzig shares, for instance, an S-train system (known as \"S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland\") and an airport with Halle.\nPolitics.\nSaxony is a parliamentary democracy. The Minister President of Saxony heads the government of Saxony. Michael Kretschmer has been Minister President since 13 December 2017.\n2024 European Parliament Election.\nIn the 2024 European Parliament election, AfD received the highest percentage of votes in Saxony, winning 31.8% of the ballots. The other states where AfD has become the strongest party are Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Brandenburg. These four states were part of East Germany like Saxony. Compared to the last election, AfD increased their votes in Saxony which was 25.3% in the 2019 European Parliament election.\nCDU/CSU received 21.8% of the votes in Saxony and became the second strongest party in the 2024 EP election. BSW was in the third place by receiving 12.6% of the votes. The Left lost a significant proportion of their votes compared to the 2019 election. Their votes regressed from 11.7% to 4.9%.\nFederal politics.\nSaxony has 16 constituencies for the Bundestag.\nAdministration.\nSaxony is divided into 10 districts:\n\u00a0 1. Bautzen (BZ)\n\u00a0 2. Erzgebirgskreis (ERZ)\n\u00a0 3. G\u00f6rlitz (GR)\n\u00a0 4. Leipzig (L)\n\u00a0 5. Meissen (MEI) (Meissen)\n\u00a0 6. Mittelsachsen (FG)\n\u00a0 7. Nordsachsen (TDO)\n\u00a0 8. S\u00e4chsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge (PIR)\n\u00a0 9. Vogtlandkreis (V)\n10. Zwickau (Z)\nIn addition, three cities have the status of an urban district ():\nBetween 1990 and 2008, Saxony was divided into the three regions (\"Regierungsbezirke\") of Chemnitz, Dresden, and Leipzig. The 1994\u20131996 Saxony district reform created 22 new districts and seven independent cities. After the 2008 Saxony district reform, these regions \u2013 with some alterations of their respective areas \u2013 were called \"Direktionsbezirke\". In 2012, the authorities of these regions were merged into one central authority, the \"Landesdirektion Sachsen\".\nDemographics.\nPopulation change.\nSaxony is a densely populated state if compared with more rural German states such as Bavaria or Lower Saxony. However, the population has declined over time. The population of Saxony began declining in the 1950s due to emigration, a process which accelerated after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After bottoming out in 2013, the population has stabilized due to increased immigration and higher fertility rates. The cities of Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz, and the towns of Radebeul and Markkleeberg in their vicinity, have seen their populations increase since 2000. The following tables illustrate the foreign resident populations and the population of Saxony from 1816 to 2022:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBirthrate.\nThe average number of children per woman in Saxony was 1.60 in 2018, the fourth-highest rate of all German states. Within Saxony, the highest is the Bautzen district with 1.77, while Leipzig is the lowest with 1.49. Dresden's fertility rate of 1.58 is the highest of all German cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants.\nSorbian population.\nSaxony is home to the Sorbs. There are currently between 45,000 and 60,000 Sorbs living in Saxony (Upper Lusatia region). Today's Sorb minority is the remainder of the Slavic population that settled throughout Saxony in the early Middle Ages and over time slowly assimilated into the German speaking society. Many geographic names in Saxony are of Sorbic origin (including the three largest cities Chemnitz, Dresden and Leipzig). The Sorbic language and culture are protected by special laws and cities and villages in eastern Saxony that are inhabited by a significant number of Sorbian inhabitants have bilingual street signs and administrative offices provide service in both, German and Sorbian. The Sorbs enjoy cultural self-administration which is exercised through the Domowina. Former Minister President Stanislaw Tillich is of Sorbian ancestry and has been the first leader of a German state from a national minority.\nReligion.\nAs of 2011, 72.6% of people are not affiliated with any religion. The Protestant Church in Germany represents the largest Christian denomination in the state, adhered to by 21.4% of the population. Members of the Roman Catholic Church formed a minority of 3.8%. About 0.9% of the Saxons belonged to an Evangelical free church (\"Evangelische Freikirche\", i.e. various Protestants outside the EKD), 0.3% to Orthodox churches and 1% to other religious communities. The Moravian Church (see above) still maintains its religious centre in Herrnhut and it is there where 'The \"Daily Watchwords\"' (Losungen) are selected each year which are in use in many churches worldwide. In particular in the larger cities, there are numerous smaller religious communities. \nThe international Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a presence in the Freiberg Germany Temple which was the first of its kind in Germany, opened in 1985 even before its counterpart in Western Germany. It now also serves as a religious center for the church members in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. In Leipzig, there is a significant Buddhist community, which mainly caters to the population of Vietnamese origin, with one Buddhist temple built in 2008 and another one currently under construction. The Sikh faith also maintains a presence in Saxony's three largest cities with three (though small) Gurdwara.\nEconomy.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 124.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 3.7% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 28,100 euros or 93% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 85% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the highest of the states of the former GDR. Saxony has a \"very high\" Human Development Index value of 0.930 (2018), which is at the same level as Denmark. Within Germany Saxony is ranked 9th.\nSaxony has, after Saxony-Anhalt, the most vibrant economy of the states of the former East Germany (GDR). Its economy grew by 1.9% in 2010. Nonetheless, unemployment remains above the German average. The eastern part of Germany, excluding Berlin, qualifies as an \"Objective\u00a01\" development-region within the European Union, and was eligible to receive investment subsidies up to 30% until 2013. FutureSAX, a business plan competition and entrepreneurial support organisation, has been in operation since 2002.\nMicrochip-makers near Dresden have given the region the nickname \"Silicon Saxony\". The publishing and porcelain industries of the region are well known, although their contributions to the regional economy are no longer significant. Today, the automobile industry, machinery production, and services mainly contribute to the economic development of the region.\nSaxony reported an average unemployment of 5.5% in 2019.\nThe Leipzig area, which until recently was among the regions with the highest unemployment rate, could benefit greatly from investments by Porsche and BMW. With the VW Phaeton factory in Dresden, and many parts suppliers, the automobile industry has again become one of the pillars of Saxon industry, as it was in the early 20th century. Zwickau is another major Volkswagen location. Freiberg, a former mining town, has emerged as a foremost location for solar technology. Dresden and some other regions of Saxony play a leading role in some areas of international biotechnology, such as electronic bioengineering. While these high-technology sectors do not yet offer a large number of jobs, they have stopped or even reversed the brain drain that was occurring until the early 2000s in many parts of Saxony. Regional universities have strengthened their positions by partnering with local industries. Glash\u00fctte is the birthplace of the German watchmaking industry and home to highly regarded watch manufacturers such as A.\u00a0Lange\u00a0&amp;\u00a0S\u00f6hne and Glash\u00fctte Original.\nInternational trade.\nSaxony is a strongly export-oriented economy. In 2018, exports amounted to 40.48 billion euros while imports stood at 24.41 billion euros. The largest export partner of Saxony is China with an amount of 6.72 billion euros, while the second largest export market are the United States with 3.59 billion. The largest exporting sectors are the automobile industry and mechanical engineering.\nIn April 2022, Saxony received about 84% of its imported oil and gas from Russia while nationally Germany only imported about one third from Russia. This is mainly due to the pipeline network, which since the time of the GDR has been strongly integrated with the Soviet Union, similar to other states of Eastern Europe.\nTourism.\nSaxony is a renowned tourist destination in Germany. The cities of Dresden and Leipzig are two of Germany's most visited cities. Areas along the border with the Czech Republic, such as the Lusatian Mountains, Ore Mountains, Saxon Switzerland, and Vogtland, attract significant numbers of visitors. In addition, Saxony has well-preserved historic towns such as G\u00f6rlitz, Bautzen, Freiberg, Pirna, Meissen and Stolpen as well as numerous castles and palaces. New tourist destinations are developing, notably in the Lusatian Lake District.\nEducation.\nSaxony has four large universities, six (Universities of Applied Sciences) and six art schools.\nThe Dresden University of Technology (TU Dresden), founded in 1828, is one of Germany's oldest universities, and one of the ten largest universities in Germany. It is a member of TU9, a consortium of nine leading German Institutes of Technology.\nLeipzig University, founded in 1409, is one of the oldest universities in the world, and the second-oldest university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. Famous alumni include Leibniz, Goethe, Ranke, Nietzsche, Wagner, Cai Yuanpei, Angela Merkel, Raila Odinga, and Tycho Brahe; the university is, additionally, associated with nine Nobel laureates.\nWith over 11,000 students, the Chemnitz University of Technology is the third largest university in Saxony.\nEstablished in 1765, the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, located in the former mining town of Freiberg, is the oldest university of mining and metallurgy in the world.\nSaxony is home to several Max Planck Institutes and research institutions of the Fraunhofer Society, and one of the two main campuses of the German National Library is located in Leipzig.\nCulture.\nSaxony is part of Central Germany as a cultural area. As such, throughout German history it has played an important role in shaping German culture.\nLanguages.\nThe most common patois spoken in Saxony are combined in the group of \"Thuringian and Upper Saxon dialects\". Due to the inexact use of the term \"Saxon dialects\" in colloquial language, the Upper Saxon attribute has been added to distinguish it from Old Saxon and Low Saxon. Other German dialects spoken in Saxony are the dialects of the Ore Mountains, which have been affected by Upper Saxon dialects, and the dialects of the Vogtland, which are more affected by the East Franconian languages.\nUpper Sorbian (a West Slavic language) is spoken in the parts of Upper Lusatia that are inhabited by the Sorbian minority. The Germans in Upper Lusatia speak distinct dialects of their own (Lusatian dialects).\nMotherland of the Reformation.\nSaxony is often seen as the \"motherland of the Reformation\". It was predominantly Lutheran Protestant from the Reformation until the late 20th century.\nThe Electoral Saxony, a predecessor of today's Saxony, was the original birthplace of the Reformation. The elector was Lutheran starting in 1525. The Lutheran church was organized through the late 1510s and the early 1520s. It was officially established in 1527 by John the Steadfast. Although some of the sites associated with Martin Luther also lie in the current state of Saxony-Anhalt (including Wittenberg, Eisleben and Mansfeld), today's Saxony is usually viewed as the formal successor to what used to be Luther's country back in the 16th century (i.e. the Electoral Saxony).\nMartin Luther personally oversaw the Lutheran church in Saxony and shaped it consistently with his own views and ideas. The 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were heavily dominated by Lutheran orthodoxy. In addition, the Reformed faith made inroads with the so-called crypto Calvinists, but was strongly persecuted in an overwhelmingly Lutheran state. In the 17th century, Pietism became an important influence. In the 18th century, the Moravian Church was set up on Count von Zinzendorf's property at Herrnhut. From 1525, the rulers were traditionally Lutheran and widely acknowledged as defenders of the Protestant faith, although \u2013 beginning with Augustus II the Strong, who was required to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1697 in order to become King of Poland \u2013 its monarchs were exclusively Roman Catholic. That meant Augustus and the subsequent Electors of Saxony, who were Roman Catholic, ruled over a state with an almost entirely Protestant population.\nIn 1925, 90.3% of the Saxon population was Protestant, 3.6% was Roman Catholic, 0.4% was Jewish and 5.7% was placed in other religious categories.\nAfter World War II, Saxony was incorporated into East Germany which pursued a policy of state atheism. After 45 years of Communist rule, the majority of the population has become unaffiliated. Nonetheless, even during this time Saxony remained an important place of religious dialogue and it was at Meissen where the agreement on mutual recognition between the German Evangelical Church and the Church of England was signed in 1988.\nSports.\nIn 2020, there were 4,447 registered sports clubs of various disciplines with over 600,000 members in Saxony. The most popular sport in Saxony is football. With RB Leipzig there is one Saxon team playing in the Bundesliga as well as the European Champions League. Leipzig is notable for a longstanding football tradition, a Leipzig team having been the first national football champion in German history. Another popular sport is handball with SC DHfK Leipzig playing in the Bundesliga. On a local level sports such as table tennis, cycling, mountaineering and volleyball are popular.\nRock climbing.\nSaxony prides itself to have been one of the first places in the world where modern recreational rock climbing was developed. Falkenstein rock in the area of Bad Schandau is considered to be the place were the German rock climbing tradition started in 1864.\nWinter sports.\nThe Ore Mountains in southern Saxony are a traditional center for winter sports, and there are a number of training facilities for the German Winter Olympics team in the region. Thus, climate change poses a certain threat to the development of the region's winter sports industry. \nThe ski resort of Oberwiesenthal is the highest town of Germany, at an altitude of 900 m, though the surrounding mountains do not reach the same height as those found in the alpine areas of Southern Germany.\nArt.\nThe two major cultural centers of Saxony are Dresden and Leipzig. The two cities have each a unique character which is reflecting the role they played throughout Saxon and German history, Dresden being a political center while Leipzig has been a major trading city. Thus, Dresden is well known for the art collections of the former Saxon kings (Dresden State Art Collections with the Green Vault and Zwinger as the most well-known parts).\nLeipzig on the other hand never had a royal court, so its culture is borne largely by its citizens. The city is famous for its relationship with classical music and names like Johann Sebastian Bach, Mendelssohn or Wagner are linked to it. Over the past decades the city became famous for its modern art scene, most notably the Neue Leipziger Schule (New Leipzig School) with artists such as Neo Rauch.\nPorcelain.\nSaxony was the first place in Europe to develop and produce white porcelain, a luxury good until then imported only from China. The Meissen Porcelain manufactory has been producing porcelain since 1710. It is one of the world's leading porcelain manufacturers and one of the oldest and most internationally known German luxury brands.\nCuisine.\nSaxon cuisine encompasses regional cooking traditions of Saxony. In general the cuisine is very hearty and features many peculiarities of Mid-Germany such as a great variety of sauces which accompany the main dish and the fashion to serve potato dumplings (Kl\u00f6\u00dfe/Kn\u00f6del) as a side dish instead of potatoes, pasta or rice. Also much freshwater fish is used in Saxon cuisine. The area around Dresden is home to the easternmost wine region in Germany (see: Saxony (wine region)).\nAnthem.\nSaxony (as other German states) has its own anthem, dating back to the monarchy of the 19th century. 'Gott segne Sachsenland' (God save Saxony) is based on the melody of God save the King.\nTransport.\nAir.\nThe state has two major international airports:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a member of the Goidelic branch of Celtic, Scottish Gaelic, alongside both Irish and Manx, developed out of Old Irish. It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period, although a common literary language was shared by the Gaels of both Ireland and Scotland until well into the 17th century. Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language place names.\nIn the 2011 census of Scotland, 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population, three years and older) reported being able to speak Gaelic, 1,275 fewer than in 2001. The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, there is a language revival, and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses. In the 2022 census of Scotland, it was found that 2.5% of the Scottish population had some skills in Gaelic, or 130,161 persons. Of these, 69,701 people reported speaking the language, with a further 46,404 people reporting that they understood the language, but did not speak, read, or write in it.\nOutside of Scotland, a dialect known as Canadian Gaelic has been spoken in Canada since the 18th century. In the 2021 census, 2,170 Canadian residents claimed knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, a decline from 3,980 speakers in the 2016 census. There exists a particular concentration of speakers in Nova Scotia, with historic communities in other parts of North America, including North Carolina and Glengarry County, Ontario having largely disappeared.\nScottish Gaelic is classed as an indigenous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which the UK Government has ratified, and the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 established a language-development body, . With the passing of the Scottish Languages Act 2025, Gaelic, alongside Scots, has become an official language of Scotland.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName.\nAside from \"Scottish Gaelic\", the language may also be referred to simply as \"Gaelic\", pronounced in English. However, \"Gaelic\" also refers to the Irish language () and the Manx language ().\nScottish Gaelic is distinct from Scots, the Middle English-derived language which had come to be spoken in most of the Lowlands of Scotland by the early modern era. Prior to the 15th century, this language was known as (\"English\") by its own speakers, with Gaelic being called (\"Scottish\"). Beginning in the late 15th century, it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as (\"Irish\") and the Lowland vernacular as . Today, Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish, so the word in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nBased on medieval traditional accounts and the apparent evidence from linguistic geography, Gaelic has been commonly believed to have been brought to Scotland in the 4th and 5th centuries CE by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of on Scotland's west coast, in what is present-day Argyll.55166 An alternative view has been voiced by archaeologist Ewan Campbell, who has argued that the putative migration or takeover is not reflected in archaeological or placename data (as pointed out earlier by Leslie Alcock). Campbell has also questioned the age and reliability of the medieval historical sources speaking of a conquest. Instead, he has inferred that Argyll formed part of a common Q-Celtic-speaking area with Ireland, connected rather than divided by the sea, since the Iron Age. These arguments have been opposed by some scholars defending the early dating of the traditional accounts and arguing for other interpretations of the archaeological evidence.\nRegardless of how it came to be spoken in the region, Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to until the eighth century, when it began expanding into Pictish areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. During the reign of Caustant\u00edn mac \u00c1eda (Constantine II, 900\u2013943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than as the kingdom of the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten. Bilingualism in Pictish and Gaelic, prior to the former's extinction, led to the presence of Pictish loanwords in Scottish Gaelic and syntactic influence which could be considered to constitute a Pictish substrate.\nIn 1018, after the conquest of Lothian (theretofore part of England and inhabited predominantly by speakers of Northumbrian Old English) by the Kingdom of Scotland, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith. Colloquial speech in Scotland had been developing independently of that in Ireland since the eighth century. For the first time, the entire region of modern-day Scotland was called in Latin, and Gaelic was the .276554 In southern Scotland, Gaelic was strong in Galloway, adjoining areas to the north and west, West Lothian, and parts of western Midlothian. It was spoken to a lesser degree in north Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, the Clyde Valley and eastern Dumfriesshire. In south-eastern Scotland, there is no evidence that Gaelic was ever widely spoken.\nDecline.\nMany historians mark the reign of King Malcolm Canmore (Malcolm III) between 1058 and 1093 as the beginning of Gaelic's eclipse in Scotland. His wife Margaret of Wessex spoke no Gaelic, gave her children Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic names, and brought many English bishops, priests, and monastics to Scotland.19 During the reigns of Malcolm Canmore's sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I (their successive reigns lasting 1097\u20131153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth\u2013Clyde line and along the northeastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under David I, attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking Old English. This was the beginning of Gaelic's status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.\nClan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there. The semi-independent Lordship of the Isles in the Hebrides and western coastal mainland remained thoroughly Gaelic since the language's recovery there in the 12th century, providing a political foundation for cultural prestige down to the end of the 15th century.\nBy the mid-14th century what eventually came to be called Scots (at that time termed Inglis) emerged as the official language of government and law.139 Scotland's emergent nationalism in the era following the conclusion of the Wars of Scottish Independence was organized using Scots as well. For example, the nation's great patriotic literature including John Barbour's \"The Brus\" (1375) and Blind Harry's \"The Wallace\" (before 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. By the end of the 15th century, English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as 'Yrisch' or 'Erse', i.e. Irish and their own language as 'Scottis'.\nModern era.\nA steady shift away from Scottish Gaelic continued into and through the modern era. Some of this was driven by policy decisions by government or other organisations, while some originated from social changes. In the last quarter of the 20th century, efforts began to encourage use of the language.\nThe Statutes of Iona, enacted by James VI in 1609, was one piece of legislation that addressed, among other things, the Gaelic language. It required the heirs of clan chiefs to be educated in lowland, Protestant, English-speaking schools. James VI took several such measures to impose his rule on the Highland and Island region. In 1616, the Privy Council proclaimed that schools teaching in English should be established. Gaelic was seen, at this time, as one of the causes of the instability of the region. It was also associated with Catholicism.\nThe Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was founded in 1709. They met in 1716, immediately after the failed Jacobite rising of 1715, to consider the reform and civilisation of the Highlands, which they sought to achieve by teaching English and the Protestant religion. Initially, their teaching was entirely in English, but soon the impracticality of educating Gaelic-speaking children in this way gave rise to a modest concession: in 1723, teachers were allowed to translate English words in the Bible into Gaelic to aid comprehension, but there was no further permitted use. Other less prominent schools worked in the Highlands at the same time, also teaching in English. This process of anglicisation paused when evangelical preachers arrived in the Highlands, convinced that people should be able to read religious texts in their own language. The first well known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767, when James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. In 1798, four tracts in Gaelic were published by the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home, with 5,000 copies of each printed. Other publications followed, with a full Gaelic Bible in 1801. The influential and effective Gaelic Schools Society was founded in 1811. Their purpose was to teach Gaels to read the Bible in their own language. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the SSPCK (despite their anti-Gaelic attitude in prior years) and the British and Foreign Bible Society distributed 60,000 Gaelic Bibles and 80,000 New Testaments.98 It is estimated that this overall schooling and publishing effort gave about 300,000 people in the Highlands some basic literacy. Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible; the lack of a well known translation may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic.\nCounterintuitively, access to schooling in Gaelic increased knowledge of English. In 1829, the Gaelic Schools Society reported that parents were unconcerned about their children learning Gaelic, but were anxious to have them taught English. The SSPCK also found Highlanders to have significant prejudice against Gaelic. T. M. Devine attributes this to an association between English and the prosperity of employment: the Highland economy relied greatly on seasonal migrant workers travelling outside the . In 1863, an observer sympathetic to Gaelic stated that \"knowledge of English is indispensable to any poor islander who wishes to learn a trade or to earn his bread beyond the limits of his native Isle\". Generally, rather than Gaelic speakers, it was Celtic societies in the cities and professors of Celtic from universities who sought to preserve the language.\nThe Education (Scotland) Act 1872 provided universal education in Scotland, but completely ignored Gaelic in its plans. The mechanism for supporting Gaelic through the Education Codes issued by the Scottish Education Department were steadily used to overcome this omission, with many concessions in place by 1918. However, the members of Highland school boards tended to have anti-Gaelic attitudes and served as an obstacle to Gaelic education in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nLoss of life due to World War I and the 1919 sinking of the HMY, combined with emigration, resulted in the 1910s seeing unprecedented damage to the use of Scottish Gaelic, with a 46% fall in monolingual speakers and a 19% fall in bilingual speakers between the 1911 and 1921 Censuses. Michelle MacLeod of Aberdeen University has said that there was no other period with such a high fall in the number of monolingual Gaelic speakers: \"Gaelic speakers became increasingly the exception from that point forward with bilingualism replacing monolingualism as the norm for Gaelic speakers.\"\nThe Linguistic Survey of Scotland (1949\u20131997) surveyed both the dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language, and also mixed use of English and Gaelic across the Highlands and Islands.\nDefunct dialects.\nDialects of Lowland Gaelic have been defunct since the 18th century. Gaelic in the Eastern and Southern Scottish Highlands, although alive until the mid-20th century, is now largely defunct. Although modern Scottish Gaelic is dominated by the dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye, there remain some speakers of the Inner Hebridean dialects of Tiree and Islay, and even a few native speakers from Western Highland areas including Wester Ross, northwest Sutherland, Lochaber and Argyll. Dialects on both sides of the Straits of Moyle (the North Channel) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the Mull of Kintyre, on Rathlin and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary. Some features of moribund dialects have been preserved in Nova Scotia, including the pronunciation of the broad or velarised l () as , as in the Lochaber dialect.131\nStatus.\nThe European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, (ECRML), was ratified by the Council of Europe in 1998, with the Government of the United Kingdom ratifying the ECRML in 2001. The ECRML aimed to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages, with Scottish Gaelic being included in Part III of the Charter; Part III\nproviding for a higher level of protection and specific actions for its use in public life. Following the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005, the Scottish Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European Union in 2009 which made provision for Scottish Gaelic speakers to communicate with EU institutions in their native language.(The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020).\nThe Endangered Languages Project lists Gaelic's status as \"threatened\", with \"20,000 to 30,000 active users\". UNESCO classifies Gaelic as \"definitely endangered\".\nOn 30 November 2025, (Saint Andrew's Day), the Scottish Parliament's Scottish Languages Act 2025 came into effect, establishing Scottish Gaelic and Scots as official languages of Scotland, in addition to English.\nNumber of speakers.\nThe 1755\u20132001 figures are census data quoted by MacAulay.141 The 2011 Gaelic speakers figures come from table KS206SC of the 2011 Census. The 2011 total population figure comes from table KS101SC. The numbers of Gaelic speakers relate to the numbers aged 3 and over, and the percentages are calculated using those and the number of the total population aged 3 and over.\nAcross the whole of Scotland, the 2011 census showed that 25,000 people (0.49% of the population) used Gaelic at home. Of these, 63.3% said that they had a full range of language skills: speaking, understanding, reading and writing Gaelic. 40.2% of Scotland's Gaelic speakers said that they used Gaelic at home. To put this in context, the most common language spoken at home in Scotland after English and Scots is Polish, with about 1.1% of the population, or 54,000 people. In 2022, the census showed that 3,551 people recorded Gaelic as their 'main language'. In Stornoway, 195 people out of 6,796 residents aged 3 and over listed Gaelic as their main language, 2.9% of the population. In Na h-Eileanan Siar (the Outer Hebrides) in general, 1,761 out of 25,563 residents indicated it as their main language, or 6.9% of the population. Most (1,011) of these were 65 years and older.\nDistribution in Scotland.\nThe 2011 UK Census showed a total of 57,375 Gaelic speakers in Scotland (1.1% of population over three years old), of whom only 32,400 could also read and write the language. Compared with the 2001 Census, there has been a diminution of about 1300 people. This is the smallest drop between censuses since the Gaelic-language question was first asked in 1881. The Scottish government's language minister and took this as evidence that Gaelic's long decline has slowed.\nThe main stronghold of the language continues to be the Outer Hebrides (), where the overall proportion of speakers is 52.2%. Important pockets of the language also exist in the Highlands (5.4%) and in Argyll and Bute (4.0%) and Inverness (4.9%). The locality with the largest absolute number is Glasgow with 5,878 such persons, who make up over 10% of all of Scotland's Gaelic speakers.\nGaelic continues to decline in its traditional heartland. Between 2001 and 2011, the absolute number of Gaelic speakers fell sharply in the Western Isles (\u22121,745), Argyll &amp; Bute (\u2212694), and Highland (\u2212634). The drop in Stornoway, the largest parish in the Western Isles by population, was especially acute, from 57.5% of the population in 1991 to 43.4% in 2011. The only parish outside the Western Isles over 40% Gaelic-speaking is Kilmuir in Northern Skye at 46%. The islands in the Inner Hebrides with significant percentages of Gaelic speakers are Tiree (38.3%), Raasay (30.4%), Skye (29.4%), Lismore (26.9%), Colonsay (20.2%), and Islay (19.0%).\nToday, no civil parish in Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 65% (the highest value is in Barvas, Lewis, with 64.1%). In addition, no civil parish on mainland Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 20% (the highest is in Ardnamurchan, Highland, with 19.3%). Out of a total of 871 civil parishes in Scotland, the proportion of Gaelic speakers exceeds 50% in seven parishes, 25% in 14 parishes, and 10% in 35 parishes.\nDecline in traditional areas has recently been balanced by growth in the Scottish Lowlands. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the number of Gaelic speakers rose in nineteen of the country's 32 council areas. The largest absolute gains were in Aberdeenshire (+526), North Lanarkshire (+305), the Aberdeen City council area (+216), and East Ayrshire (+208). The largest relative gains were in Aberdeenshire (+0.19%), East Ayrshire (+0.18%), Moray (+0.16%), and Orkney (+0.13%).\nIn 2018, the census of pupils in Scotland showed 520 students in publicly funded schools had Gaelic as the main language at home, an increase of 5% from 497 in 2014. During the same period, Gaelic medium education in Scotland has grown, with 4,343 pupils (6.3 per 1000) being educated in a Gaelic-immersion environment in 2018, up from 3,583 pupils (5.3 per 1000) in 2014. Data collected in 2007\u20132008 indicated that even among pupils enrolled in Gaelic medium schools, 81% of primary students and 74% of secondary students report using English more often than Gaelic when speaking with their mothers at home. The effect on this of the significant increase in pupils in Gaelic-medium education since that time is unknown.\nPreservation and revitalization.\nGaelic Medium Education is one of the primary ways that the Scottish Government is addressing Gaelic language shift. Along with the B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig policies, preschool and daycare environments are also being used to create more opportunities for intergenerational language transmission in the Outer Hebrides. \u00a0However, revitalization efforts are not unified within Scotland or Nova Scotia, Canada. One can attend Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig, a national centre for Gaelic Language and Culture, based in Sleat, on the Isle of Skye. This institution is the only source for higher education which is conducted entirely in Scottish Gaelic. They offer courses for Gaelic learners from beginners into fluency. They also offer regular bachelors and graduate programmes delivered entirely in Gaelic. Concerns have been raised around the fluency achieved by learners within these language programmes because they are disconnected from vernacular speech communities. In regard to language revitalization planning efforts, many feel that the initiatives must come from within Gaelic speaking communities, be led by Gaelic speakers, and be designed to serve and increase fluency within the vernacular communities as the first and most viable resistance to total language shift from Gaelic to English. Currently, language policies are focused on creating new language speakers through education, instead of focused on how to strengthen intergenerational transmission within existing Gaelic speaking communities.\nChallenges to preservation and revitalization.\nIn the Outer Hebrides, accommodation ethics exist amongst native or local Gaelic speakers when engaging with new learners or non-locals. Accommodation ethics, or ethics of accommodation, is a social practice where local or native speakers of Gaelic shift to speaking English when in the presence of non-Gaelic speakers out of a sense of courtesy or politeness. This accommodation ethic persists even in situations where new learners attempt to speak Gaelic with native speakers. This creates a situation where new learners struggle to find opportunities to speak Gaelic with fluent speakers. Affect is the way people feel about something, or the emotional response to a particular situation or experience. For Gaelic speakers, there is a conditioned and socialized negative affect through a long history of negative Scottish media portrayal and public disrespect, state mandated restrictions on Gaelic usage, and highland clearances. This negative affect towards speaking openly with non-native Gaelic speakers has led to a language ideology at odds with revitalization efforts on behalf of new speakers, state policies (such as the Gaelic Language Act), and family members reclaiming their lost mother tongue. New learners of Gaelic often have a positive affective stance to their language learning, and connect this learning journey towards Gaelic language revitalization. The mismatch of these language ideologies, and differences in affective stance, has led to fewer speaking opportunities for adult language learners and therefore a challenge to revitalization efforts which occur outside the home. Positive engagements between language learners and native speakers of Gaelic through mentorship has proven to be productive in socializing new learners into fluency.\nUsage.\nOfficial.\nScotland.\nIn the 2022 census, 3,551 people claimed Gaelic as their 'main language.' Of these, 1,761 (49.6%) were in Na h-Eileanan Siar, 682 (19.2%) were in Highland, 369 were in Glasgow City and 120 were in City of Edinburgh; no other council area had as many as 80 such respondents.\nScottish Parliament.\nGaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts and was long suppressed.\nThe UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Gaelic. Gaelic, along with Irish and Welsh, is designated under Part III of the Charter, which requires the UK Government to take a range of concrete measures in the fields of education, justice, public administration, broadcasting and culture. It has not received the same degree of official recognition from the UK Government as Welsh. \nWith the advent of devolution, which saw a devolved Scottish Parliament created, Scottish matters have begun to receive greater attention, and it achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted on 21 April 2005. The key provisions of the Act are:\nAfter its creation, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig required a Gaelic Language Plan from the Scottish Government. This plan was accepted in 2008, and some of its main commitments were: identity (signs, corporate identity); communications (reception, telephone, mailings, public meetings, complaint procedures); publications (PR and media, websites); staffing (language learning, training, recruitment).\nFollowing a consultation period, in which the government received many submissions, the majority of which asked that the bill be strengthened, a revised bill was published; the main alteration was that the guidance of the is now statutory (rather than advisory). In the committee stages in the Scottish Parliament, there was much debate over whether Gaelic should be given 'equal validity' with English. Due to executive concerns about resourcing implications if this wording was used, the Education Committee settled on the concept of 'equal respect'. It is not clear what the legal force of this wording is.\nThe Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament unanimously, with support from all sectors of the Scottish political spectrum, on 21 April 2005. Under the provisions of the Act, it will ultimately fall to BnG to secure the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland.\nSome commentators, such as (2006) argue that the Gaelic Act falls so far short of the status accorded to Welsh that one would be foolish or na\u00efve to believe that any substantial change will occur in the fortunes of the language as a result of 's efforts.\nOn 10 December 2008, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Scottish Human Rights Commission had the UDHR translated into Gaelic for the first time.\nHowever, given there are no longer any monolingual Gaelic speakers, following an appeal in the court case of \"Taylor v Haughney\" (1982), involving the status of Gaelic in judicial proceedings, the High Court ruled against there being a general right to use the Gaelic language in court proceedings.\nWhile the goal of the Gaelic Language Act was to aid in revitalization efforts through government mandated official language status, the outcome of the act is distanced from the actual minority language communities. It helps to create visibility of the minority language in civil structures, but does not impact or address the lived experiences of the Gaelic speaker communities wherein the revitalization efforts may have a higher return of new Gaelic speakers. Efforts are being made to concentrate resources, language planning, and revitalization efforts towards vernacular communities in the Western Isles.\nQualifications in the language.\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority offer two streams of Gaelic examination across all levels of the syllabus: Gaelic for learners (equivalent to the modern foreign languages syllabus) and Gaelic for native speakers (equivalent to the English syllabus).\n performs assessment of spoken Gaelic, resulting in the issue of a Bronze Card, Silver Card or Gold Card. Syllabus details are available on An Comunn's website. These are not widely recognised as qualifications, but are required for those taking part in certain competitions at the annual .\nEuropean Union.\nIn October 2009, a new agreement allowed Scottish Gaelic to be formally used between Scottish Government ministers and European Union officials. The deal was signed by Britain's representative to the EU, Sir Kim Darroch, and the Scottish government. This did not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU but gave it the right to be a means of formal communications in the EU's institutions. The Scottish government had to pay for the translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government's support for Gaelic. He said; \"Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed\". Culture Minister Mike Russell said; \"this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad and I look forward to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon. Seeing Gaelic spoken in such a forum raises the profile of the language as we drive forward our commitment to creating a new generation of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.\"\nSignage.\nBilingual road signs, street names, business and advertisement signage (in both Gaelic and English) are gradually being introduced throughout Gaelic-speaking regions in the Highlands and Islands, including Argyll. In many cases, this has simply meant re-adopting the traditional spelling of a name (such as or rather than the anglicised forms \"Ratagan\" or \"Lochailort\" respectively).\nSome monolingual Gaelic road signs, particularly direction signs, are used on the Outer Hebrides, where a majority of the population can have a working knowledge of the language. These omit the English translation entirely.\nBilingual railway station signs are now more frequent than they used to be. Practically all the stations in the Highland area use both English and Gaelic, and the use of bilingual station signs has become more frequent in the Lowlands of Scotland, including areas where Gaelic has not been spoken for a long time.\nThis has been welcomed by many supporters of the language as a means of raising its profile as well as securing its future as a 'living language' (i.e. allowing people to use it to navigate from A to B in place of English) and creating a sense of place. However, in some places, such as Caithness, the Highland Council's intention to introduce bilingual signage has incited controversy.\nThe Ordnance Survey has acted in recent years to correct many of the mistakes that appear on maps. They announced in 2004 that they intended to correct them and set up a committee to determine the correct forms of Gaelic place names for their maps. Ainmean-\u00c0ite na h-Alba (\"Place names in Scotland\") is the national advisory partnership for Gaelic place names in Scotland.\nCanada.\nIn the nineteenth century, Canadian Gaelic was the third-most widely spoken European language in British North America and Gaelic-speaking immigrant communities could be found throughout what is modern-day Canada. Gaelic poets in Canada produced a significant literary tradition. The number of Gaelic-speaking individuals and communities declined sharply, however, after the First World War.\nNova Scotia.\nAt the start of the 21st century, it was estimated that no more than 500 people in Nova Scotia still spoke Scottish Gaelic as a first language. In the 2011 census, 300 people claimed to have Gaelic as their first language (a figure that may include Irish Gaelic). In the same 2011 census, 1,275 people claimed to speak Gaelic, a figure that not only included all Gaelic languages but also those people who are not first language speakers, of whom 300 claim to have Gaelic as their \"mother tongue.\"\nThe Nova Scotia government maintains the Office of Gaelic Affairs (), which is dedicated to the development of Scottish Gaelic language, culture and tourism in Nova Scotia, and which estimates about 2,000 total Gaelic speakers to be in the province. As in Scotland, areas of North-Eastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton have bilingual street signs. Nova Scotia also has (The Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia), a non-profit society dedicated to the maintenance and promotion of the Gaelic language and culture in Maritime Canada. In 2018, the Nova Scotia government launched a new Gaelic vehicle licence plate to raise awareness of the language and help fund Gaelic language and culture initiatives.\nIn September 2021, the first Gaelic-medium primary school outside of Scotland, named , opened in Mabou, Nova Scotia.\nOutside Nova Scotia.\nMaxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly.\nIn Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School now offers both an introductory and an advanced course in Gaelic; both language and history are taught in these classes. This is the first recorded time that Gaelic has ever been taught as an official course on Prince Edward Island.\nThe province of British Columbia is host to the (The Gaelic Society of Vancouver), the Vancouver Gaelic Choir, the Victoria Gaelic Choir, as well as the annual Gaelic festival \"Vancouver\". The city of Vancouver's Scottish Cultural Centre also holds seasonal Scottish Gaelic evening classes.\nMedia.\nThe BBC operates a Gaelic-language radio station as well as a television channel, . Launched on 19 September 2008, BBC Alba is widely available in the UK (on Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media). It also broadcasts across Europe on the Astra 2 satellites. The channel is being operated in partnership between BBC Scotland and \u2013 an organisation funded by the Scottish Government, which works to promote the Gaelic language in broadcasting. The ITV franchise in central Scotland, STV Central, has, in the past, produced a number of Scottish Gaelic programmes for both BBC Alba and its own main channel.\nUntil BBC Alba was broadcast on Freeview, viewers were able to receive the channel , which broadcast for an hour every evening. Upon BBC Alba's launch on Freeview, it took the channel number that was previously assigned to TeleG.\nThere are also television programmes in the language on other BBC channels and on the independent commercial channels, usually subtitled in English. The ITV franchise in the north of Scotland, STV North (formerly \"Grampian Television\") produces some non-news programming in Scottish Gaelic.\nEducation.\nScotland.\nThe Education (Scotland) Act 1872, which completely ignored Gaelic and led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living in 2001 could recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. Even later, when these attitudes had changed, little provision was made for Gaelic medium education in Scottish schools. As late as 1958, even in Highland schools, only 20% of primary students were taught Gaelic as a subject, and only 5% were taught other subjects through the Gaelic language.\nGaelic-medium playgroups for young children began to appear in Scotland during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Parent enthusiasm may have been a factor in the \"establishment of the first Gaelic medium primary school units in Glasgow and Inverness in 1985\".\nThe first modern solely Gaelic-medium secondary school, (\"Glasgow Gaelic School\"), was opened at Woodside in Glasgow in 2006 (61 partially Gaelic-medium primary schools and approximately a dozen Gaelic-medium secondary schools also exist). According to , a total of 2,092 primary pupils were enrolled in Gaelic-medium primary education in 2008\u201309, as opposed to 24 in 1985.\nThe Columba Initiative, also known as (formerly ), is a body that seeks to promote links between speakers of Scottish Gaelic and Irish.\nIn November 2019, the language-learning app Duolingo opened a beta course in Gaelic.\nStarting from summer 2020, children starting school in the Western Isles will be enrolled in GME (Gaelic-medium education) unless parents request differently. Children will be taught Scottish Gaelic from P1 to P4 and then English will be introduced to give them a bilingual education.\nCanada.\nIn May 2004, the Nova Scotia government announced the funding of an initiative to support the language and its culture within the province. Several public schools in Northeastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton offer Gaelic classes as part of the high-school curriculum.\nMaxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly. In Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School offer an introductory and an advanced course in Scottish Gaelic.\nHigher and further education.\nA number of Scottish and some Irish universities offer full-time degrees including a Gaelic language element, usually graduating as Celtic Studies.\nIn Nova Scotia, Canada, St. Francis Xavier University, the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and Cape Breton University (formerly known as the \"University College of Cape Breton\") offer Celtic Studies degrees and/or Gaelic language programs. The government's Office of Gaelic Affairs offers lunch-time lessons to public servants in Halifax.\nIn Russia the Moscow State University offers Gaelic language, history and culture courses.\nThe University of the Highlands and Islands offers a range of Gaelic language, history and culture courses at the National Certificate, Higher National Diploma, Bachelor of Arts (ordinary), Bachelor of Arts (Honours) and Master of Science levels. It offers opportunities for postgraduate research through the medium of Gaelic. Residential courses at on the Isle of Skye offer adults the chance to become fluent in Gaelic in one year. Many continue to complete degrees, or to follow up as distance learners. A number of other colleges offer a one-year certificate course, which is also available online (pending accreditation).\nLews Castle College's Benbecula campus offers an independent 1-year course in Gaelic and Traditional Music (FE, SQF level 5/6).\nChurch.\nIn the Western Isles, the isles of Lewis, Harris and North Uist have a Presbyterian majority (largely Church of Scotland \u2013 in Gaelic, Free Church of Scotland and Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland). The isles of South Uist and Barra have a Catholic majority. All these churches have Gaelic-speaking congregations throughout the Western Isles. Notable city congregations with regular services in Gaelic are St Columba's Church, Glasgow and Greyfriars Tolbooth &amp; Highland Kirk, Edinburgh. \u2014a shorter Gaelic version of the English-language Book of Common Order\u2014was published in 1996 by the Church of Scotland.\nThe widespread use of English in worship has often been suggested as one of the historic reasons for the decline of Gaelic. The Church of Scotland is supportive today, but has a shortage of Gaelic-speaking ministers. The Free Church also recently announced plans to abolish Gaelic-language communion services, citing both a lack of ministers and a desire to have their congregations united at communion time.\nLiterature.\nFrom the sixth century to the present day, Scottish Gaelic has been used as a literary language. Two prominent writers of the twentieth century are Anne Frater and Sorley MacLean.\nNames.\nPersonal names.\nGaelic has its own version of European-wide names which also have English forms, for example: (John), (Alexander), (William), (Catherine), (Robert), (Christina), (Ann), (Mary), (James), (Patrick) and (Thomas).\nNot all traditional Gaelic names have direct equivalents in English: , which is normally rendered as \"Euphemia\" (Effie) or \"Henrietta\" (Etta) (formerly also as Henny or even as Harriet), or, , which is \"matched\" with \"Dorothy\", simply on the basis of a certain similarity in spelling. Many of these traditional Gaelic-only names are now regarded as old-fashioned, and hence are rarely or never used.\nSome names have come into Gaelic from Old Norse; for example, ( &lt; ), (&lt; ), or (&lt; ), (&lt; ), (). These are conventionally rendered in English as \"Sorley\" (or, historically, \"Somerled\"), \"Norman\", \"Ronald\" or \"Ranald\", \"Torquil\" and \"Iver\" (or \"Evander\").\nSome Scottish names are Anglicized forms of Gaelic names: \u2192 (Angus), \u2192 (Donald), for instance. , and the recently established (pronounced ) come from the Gaelic for, respectively, James, and Mary, but derive from the form of the names as they appear in the vocative case: (James) (nom.) \u2192 (voc.) and (Mary) (nom.) \u2192 (voc.).\nSurnames.\nThe most common class of Gaelic surnames are those beginning with (Gaelic for \"son\"), such as \u2009/\u2009 (MacLean). The female form is (Gaelic for \"daughter\"), so Catherine MacPhee is properly called in Gaelic, (strictly, is a contraction of the Gaelic phrase , meaning \"daughter of the son\", thus really means \"daughter of MacDonald\" rather than \"daughter of Donald\"). The \"of\" part actually comes from the genitive form of the patronymic that follows the prefix; in the case of , (\"of Donald\") is the genitive form of (\"Donald\").\nSeveral colours give rise to common Scottish surnames: (Bain \u2013 white), (Roy \u2013 red), (Dow, Duff \u2013 black), (Dunn \u2013 brown), (Bowie \u2013 yellow) although in Gaelic these occur as part of a fuller form such as 'son of the servant of', i.e. .\nPhonology.\nMost varieties of Gaelic show either eight or nine vowel qualities () in their inventory of vowel phonemes, which can be either long or short. There are also two reduced vowels () which occur only in their short versions. Although some vowels are strongly nasal, instances of distinctive nasality are rare. There are about nine diphthongs and a few triphthongs.\nMost consonants have both palatal and non-palatal counterparts, including a very rich system of liquids, nasals and trills (i.e. three contrasting \"l\" sounds, three contrasting \"n\" sounds and three contrasting \"r\" sounds). The historically voiced stops have lost their voicing, so the phonemic contrast today is between unaspirated and aspirated . In many dialects, these stops may however gain voicing through secondary articulation through a preceding nasal, for examples \"door\" but \"the door\" as or .\nIn some fixed phrases, these changes are shown permanently, as the link with the base words has been lost, as in \"now\", from \"this time/period\".\nIn medial and final position, the aspirated stops are preaspirated rather than postaspirated.\nOrthography.\nScottish Gaelic orthography is fairly regular; its standard was set by the 1767 New Testament. The 1981 Scottish Examination Board recommendations for Scottish Gaelic, the Gaelic Orthographic Conventions, were adopted by most publishers and agencies, although they remain controversial among some academics, most notably Ronald Black.\nThe quality of consonants (broad or slender) is indicated by the vowels surrounding them. Slender (palatalised) consonants are surrounded by slender vowels (\u27e8e, i\u27e9), while broad (neutral or velarised) consonants are surrounded by broad vowels (\u27e8a, o, u\u27e9). The spelling rule known as (\"slender to slender and broad to broad\") requires that a word-medial consonant or consonant group followed by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 and similarly, if followed by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9.\nThis rule sometimes leads to the insertion of a silent written vowel. For example, plurals in Gaelic are often formed with the suffix , for example, (\"shoe\") / (\"shoes\"). But because of the spelling rule, the suffix is spelled -\u27e8ean\u27e9 (but pronounced the same, ) after a slender consonant, as in (\"[a] people\") / (\"peoples\") where \u27e8e\u27e9 is purely a graphic vowel inserted to conform with the spelling rule because \u27e8i\u27e9 precedes the \u27e8r\u27e9.\nUnstressed vowels omitted in speech can be omitted in informal writing, e.g. (\"I hope.\") &gt; \nScots English orthographic rules have also been used at various times in Gaelic writing. Notable examples of Gaelic verse composed in this manner are the Book of the Dean of Lismore and the manuscript.\nAlphabet.\nOgham.\nThe Ogham writing system was used in Ireland to write Primitive Irish and Old Irish until it was supplanted by the Latin script in the 5th century CE in Ireland. In Scotland, the majority of Ogham inscriptions are in Pictish but a number of Goidelic Ogham inscriptions also exist, such as the Giogha Stone which bears the inscription VICULA MAQ CUGINI 'Viqula, son of Comginus', with Goidelic MAQ (modern \"mac\" 'son') rather than Brythonic MAB (cf. modern Welsh \"mab\" 'son').\nInsular script.\nThe Insular script was used both in Ireland and Scotland but had largely disappeared in Scotland by the 16th century. It consisted of the same 18 letters still in modern use \u27e8a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u\u27e9. and generally did not contain \u27e8j, k, q, v, w, x, y, z\u27e9.\nIn addition to the base letters, vowels in the Insular script could be accented with an acute accent (\u27e8\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa\u27e9 to indicate length. The overdot was used to indicate lenition of \u27e8\u1e1f, \u1e61\u27e9, while the following \u27e8h\u27e9 was used for \u27e8ch, ph, th\u27e9. The lenition of other letters was not generally indicated initially but eventually the two methods were used in parallel to represent the lenition of any consonant and competed with each other until the standard practice became to use the overdot in the Insular Script and the following \u27e8h\u27e9 in Roman type, i.e. \u27e8\u1e03, \u010b, \u1e0b, \u1e1f, \u0121, \u1e41, \u1e57, \u1e61, \u1e6b\u27e9 are equivalent to \u27e8bh, ch, dh, fh, gh, mh, ph, sh, th\u27e9. The use of Gaelic type and the overdot today is restricted to decorative usages.\nLetters with an overdot have been available since Unicode 5.0 .\nLatin script.\nThe modern Scottish Gaelic alphabet has 18 letters: \u27e8a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u\u27e9. \u27e8h\u27e9 is mostly used to indicate lenition of a consonant. The letters of the alphabet were traditionally named after trees, but this custom has fallen out of use.\nLong vowels are marked with a grave accent (\u27e8\u00e0, \u00e8, \u00ec, \u00f2, \u00f9\u27e9), indicated through digraphs (e.g. \u27e8ao\u27e9 for ) or conditioned by certain consonant environments (e.g. \u27e8u\u27e9 preceding a non-intervocalic \u27e8nn\u27e9 is ). Traditionally the acute accent was used on \u27e8\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00f3\u27e9 to represent long close-mid vowels, but the spelling reforms replaced it with the grave accent.\nCertain 18th century sources used only an acute accent along the lines of Irish, such as in the writings of Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (1741\u201351) and the earliest editions (1768\u201390) of Duncan Ban MacIntyre.\nGrammar.\nScottish Gaelic is an Indo-European language with an inflecting morphology, verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order and two grammatical genders.\nNoun inflection.\nGaelic nouns inflect for four cases (nominative/accusative, vocative, genitive and dative) and three numbers (singular, dual and plural).\nThey are also normally classed as either masculine or feminine. A small number of words that used to belong to the neuter class show some degree of gender confusion. For example, in some dialects \"the sea\" behaves as a masculine noun in the nominative case, but as a feminine noun in the genitive ().\nNouns are marked for case in a number of ways, most commonly involving various combinations of lenition, palatalisation and suffixation.\nVerb inflection.\nThere are 12 irregular verbs. Most other verbs follow a fully predictable paradigm, although polysyllabic verbs ending in laterals can deviate from this paradigm as they show syncopation.\nThere are:\nWord order.\nWord order is strictly verb\u2013subject\u2013object, including questions, negative questions and negatives. Only a restricted set of preverb particles may occur before the verb.\nLexicon.\nThe majority of the vocabulary of Scottish Gaelic is of Celtic origin. However, Gaelic contains substantially more words of non-Goidelic extraction than Irish. The main sources of loanwords into Gaelic are the Germanic languages English, Scots and Norse. Other sources include Latin, French and the Brittonic languages.\nMany direct Latin loanwords in Scottish Gaelic were adopted during the Old and Middle Irish (600\u20131200 CE) stages of the language and are often terms related to Christianity. Latin is also the source of the days of the week (\"Monday\"), (Tuesday), (\"Saturday\") and (\"Sunday\").\nBrittonic.\nThe Brittonic languages Cumbric and Pictish were spoken in Scotland during the Early to High Middle Ages, and Scottish Gaelic has many Brittonic influences. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However, some common words such as (\"legacy\"), (; \"mountain\") and (; \"bush\") are transparently Brittonic in origin.\nScottish Gaelic contains a number of words, principally toponymic elements, that are sometimes more closely aligned in their usage and sense with their Brittonic cognates than with their Irish. This is indicative of the operation of a Brittonic substrate influence. Such items include:\nNeologisms.\nIn common with other Indo-European languages, the neologisms coined for modern concepts are typically based on Greek or Latin, although often coming through English; \"television\", for instance, becomes and \"computer\" becomes . Some speakers use an English word even if there is a Gaelic equivalent, applying the rules of Gaelic grammar. With verbs, for instance, they will simply add the verbal suffix (, or, in Lewis, , as in, \" watch (Lewis, \"watch \") telly\" (I am watching the television), instead of \"\". This phenomenon was described over 170 years ago, by the minister who compiled the account covering the parish of Stornoway in the \"New Statistical Account of Scotland\", and examples can be found dating to the eighteenth century. However, as Gaelic medium education grows in popularity, a newer generation of literate Gaels has become more familiar with modern Gaelic vocabulary.\nLoanwords into other languages.\nScottish Gaelic has also influenced the Scots language and English, particularly Scottish Standard English. Loanwords include: whisky, slogan, brogue, jilt, clan, galore, trousers, gob, as well as familiar elements of Scottish geography like ben (), glen () and . Irish has also influenced Lowland Scots and English in Scotland, but it is not always easy to distinguish its influence from that of Scottish Gaelic.\nCommon words and phrases with Irish and Manx equivalents.\nNote: Items in brackets denote archaic, dialectal or regional variant forms\nSample text.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Scottish Gaelic:\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English:\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

It was founded in 312\u00a0BC by the Macedonian general Seleucus I Nicator, following the division of the Macedonian Empire founded by Alexander the Great, and ruled by the Seleucid dynasty until its annexation by the Roman Republic under Pompey in 63\u00a0BC.\nAfter receiving the Mesopotamian regions of Babylonia and Assyria in 321\u00a0BC, Seleucus I began expanding his dominions to include the Near Eastern territories that encompass modern-day Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, and Lebanon, all of which had been under Macedonian control after the fall of the former Achaemenid Empire. At the Seleucid Empire's height, it had consisted of territory that covered Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what are now modern Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Turkmenistan.\nThe Seleucid Empire was a major center of Hellenistic culture. Greek customs and language were privileged; the wide variety of local traditions had been generally tolerated, while an urban Greek elite had formed the dominant political class and was reinforced by steady immigration from Greece. The empire's western territories were repeatedly contested with Ptolemaic Egypt\u2014a rival Hellenistic state. To the east, conflict with the Indian ruler Chandragupta of the Maurya Empire in 305\u00a0BC led to the cession of vast territory west of the Indus and a political alliance.\nIn the early second century\u00a0BC, Antiochus III the Great attempted to project Seleucid power and authority into Hellenistic Greece, but his attempts were thwarted by the Roman Republic and its Greek allies. The Seleucids were forced to pay costly war reparations and had to relinquish territorial claims west of the Taurus Mountains in southern Anatolia, marking the gradual decline of their empire. Mithridates I of Parthia conquered much of the remaining eastern lands of the Seleucid Empire in the mid-second century\u00a0BC, including Assyria and what had been Babylonia, while the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom continued to flourish in the northeast. The Seleucid kings were thereafter reduced to a rump state in Syria after a civil war, until their conquest by Tigranes the Great of Armenia in 83 BC, and ultimate overthrow by the Roman general Pompey in 63 BC.\nName.\nContemporary sources, such as a loyalist decree honoring Antiochus I from Ilium, in Greek language define the Seleucid state both as an empire (, ) and as a kingdom (, ). Similarly, Seleucid rulers were described as kings in Babylonia.\nThe rulers did not describe themselves as being of any particular territory or people, but starting from the 2nd century BC, ancient writers referred to them as the Syrian kings, the kings of Syria or of the Syrians, the kings descended from Seleucus Nicator, the kings of Asia, and other designations.\nHistory.\nPartition of Alexander's empire.\nAlexander, who quickly conquered the Persian Empire under its last Achaemenid dynast, Darius III, died young in 323 BC, leaving an expansive empire of partly Hellenised culture without an adult heir. The empire was put under the authority of a regent, Perdiccas, and the vast territories were divided among Alexander's generals, who thereby became satraps at the Partition of Babylon, all in that same year.\nRise of Seleucus.\nAlexander's generals, known as , jostled for supremacy over parts of his empire following his death. Ptolemy I Soter, a former general and then current satrap of Egypt, was the first to challenge the new system, which eventually led to the demise of Perdiccas. Ptolemy's revolt created a new subdivision of the empire with the Partition of Triparadisus in 320 BC. Seleucus, who had been \"Commander-in-Chief of the Companion cavalry\" () and appointed first or court chiliarch (which made him the senior officer in the Royal Army after the regent and commander-in-chief Perdiccas since 323 BC, though he helped to assassinate him later) received Babylonia and, from that point, continued to expand his dominions ruthlessly. Seleucus established himself in Babylon in 312 BC, the year later used as the foundation date of the Seleucid Empire.\nBabylonian War (311\u2013309 BC).\nThe rise of Seleucus in Babylon threatened the eastern extent of the territory of Antigonus I Monophthalmus in Asia. Antigonus, along with his son Demetrius I Poliorcetes, unsuccessfully led a campaign to annex Babylon. The victory of Seleucus ensured his claim of Babylon and legitimacy. He ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire enormous eastern part of Alexander's empire, as described by the historian Appian:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, Tapouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia after that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus.\nSeleucid\u2013Mauryan War (305\u2013303 BC).\nChandragupta Maurya (Sandrokottos) founded the Maurya Empire in 321 BC after the conquest of the Nanda Empire and their capital Pataliputra in Magadha. Chandragupta then redirected his attention to the Indus River region, and by 317 BC, he conquered the remaining Greek satraps left by Alexander. Expecting a confrontation, Seleucus gathered his army and marched to the Indus. It is said that Chandragupta could have fielded a conscript army of 600,000 men and 9,000 war elephants.\nChandragupta received, formalized through a treaty, territory west of the Indus, including the Hindu Kush, modern day Afghanistan, and the eastern part of Balochistan province of Pakistan, bordering on the Indus. Archaeologically, concrete indications of Mauryan rule, such as the inscriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka, are known as far as Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. According to Appian:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt is generally thought that Chandragupta married Seleucus's daughter, or a Macedonian princess, a gift from Seleucus to formalize an alliance. In a return gesture, Chandragupta sent 500 war elephants, a military asset which would play a decisive role at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to Chandragupta, and later Deimakos to his son Bindusara, at the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar state). Megasthenes wrote detailed descriptions of India and Chandragupta's reign, which have been partly preserved to us through Diodorus Siculus. Later Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt and contemporary of Ashoka the Great, is also recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his own. But Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus (Chandragupta Maurya) in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants.\nOther territories ceded before Seleucus' death were Gedrosia in the south-east of the Iranian plateau, and, to the north of this, Arachosia on the west bank of the Indus River.\nWestward expansion.\nFollowing his and Lysimachus' decisive victory over Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, Seleucus took control over eastern Anatolia and northern Syria.\nIn the latter area, he founded a new capital at Antioch on the Orontes, a city he named after his father. An alternative capital was established at Seleucia on the Tigris, north of Babylon. Seleucus's empire reached its greatest extent following his defeat of his erstwhile ally, Lysimachus, at Corupedion in 281 BC, after which Seleucus expanded his control to encompass western Anatolia. He hoped further to take control of Lysimachus's lands in Europe \u2013 primarily Thrace and even Macedonia itself, but was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus on landing in Europe.\nHis son and successor, Antiochus I Soter, was left with an enormous realm consisting of nearly all of the Asian portions of the Empire, but faced with Antigonus II Gonatas in Macedonia and Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Egypt, he proved unable to pick up where his father had left off in conquering the European portions of Alexander's empire.\nBreakup of Central Asian territories.\nAntiochus I (reigned 281\u2013261 BC) and his son and successor Antiochus II Theos (reigned 261\u2013246 BC) were faced with challenges in the west, including repeated wars with Ptolemy II and a Celtic invasion of Asia Minor\u2014distracting attention from holding the eastern portions of the Empire together. Towards the end of Antiochus II's reign, various provinces simultaneously asserted their independence, such as Bactria and Sogdiana under Diodotus, Cappadocia under Ariarathes III, and Parthia under Andragoras. A few years later, the last was defeated and killed by the invading Parni of Arsaces\u2014the region would then become the core of the Parthian Empire.\nDiodotus, the Seleucid governor for the Bactrian territory, asserted independence in around 245 BC, although the exact date is far from certain, to form the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. This kingdom was characterized by a rich Hellenistic culture and was to continue its domination of Bactria until around 125 BC when it was overrun by the invasion of northern nomads. One of the Greco-Bactrian kings, Demetrius I of Bactria, invaded India around 180 BC to form the Indo-Greek Kingdoms.\nThe rulers of Persis, called Fratarakas, also seem to have established some level of independence from the Seleucids during the 3rd century BC, especially from the time of Vahbarz. They would later overtly take the title of Kings of Persis, before becoming vassals to the newly formed Parthian Empire.\nThe Seleucid satrap of Parthia, named Andragoras, first claimed independence, in a parallel to the secession of his Bactrian neighbour. Soon after, however, a Parthian tribal chief called Arsaces invaded the Parthian territory around 238 BC to form the Arsacid dynasty, from which the Parthian Empire originated.\nAntiochus II's son Seleucus II Callinicus came to the throne around 246 BC. Seleucus II was soon dramatically defeated in the Third Syrian War against Ptolemy III of Egypt and then had to fight a civil war against his own brother Antiochus Hierax. Taking advantage of this distraction, Bactria and Parthia seceded from the empire. In Asia Minor too, the Seleucid dynasty seemed to be losing control: the Gauls had fully established themselves in Galatia, semi-independent semi-Hellenized kingdoms had sprung up in Bithynia, Pontus, and Cappadocia, and the city of Pergamum in the west was asserting its independence under the Attalid dynasty. The Seleucid economy started to show the first signs of weakness, as Galatians gained independence and Pergamum took control of coastal cities in Anatolia. Consequently, they managed to partially block contact with the West.\nRevival (223\u2013191 BC).\nA revival would begin when Seleucus II's younger son, Antiochus III the Great, took the throne in 223 BC. Although initially unsuccessful in the Fourth Syrian War against Egypt, which led to a defeat at the Battle of Raphia (217 BC), Antiochus would prove himself to be the greatest of the Seleucid rulers after Seleucus I himself. He spent the next ten years on his anabasis (journey) through the eastern parts of his domain and restoring rebellious vassals like Parthia and Greco-Bactria to at least nominal obedience. He gained many victories such as the Battle of Mount Labus and Battle of the Arius and besieged the Bactrian capital. He even emulated Seleucus with an expedition into India where he met with King Sophagasenus () receiving war elephants, perhaps in accordance of the existing treaty and alliance set after the Seleucid-Mauryan War.\nActual translation of Polybius 11.34 (No other source except Polybius makes any reference to Sophagasenus):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He [Antiochus] crossed the Caucasus Indicus (Paropamisus) (\"Hindu Kush\") and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him. Having traversed Arachosia and crossed the river Enymanthus, he came through Drangene to Carmania; and as it was now winter, he put his men into winter quarters there.\nWhen he returned to the west in 205 BC, Antiochus found that with the death of Ptolemy IV, the situation now looked propitious for another western campaign. Antiochus and Philip V of Macedon then made a pact to divide the Ptolemaic possessions outside of Egypt, and in the Fifth Syrian War, the Seleucids ousted Ptolemy V from control of Coele-Syria. The Battle of Panium (200 BC) definitively transferred these holdings from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Antiochus appeared, at the least, to have restored the Seleucid Kingdom to glory.\nExpansion into Greece and war with Rome.\nFollowing the defeat of his erstwhile ally Philip by Rome in 197 BC, Antiochus saw the opportunity for expansion into Greece itself. Encouraged by the exiled Carthaginian general Hannibal, and making an alliance with the disgruntled Aetolian League, Antiochus launched an invasion across the Hellespont. With his huge army he aimed to establish the Seleucid empire as the foremost power in the Hellenic world, but these plans put the empire on a collision course with the new rising power of the Mediterranean, the Roman Republic. At the battles of Thermopylae (191 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), Antiochus's forces suffered resounding defeats, and he was compelled to make peace and sign the Treaty of Apamea (188 BC), the main clause of which saw the Seleucids agree to pay a large indemnity, to retreat from Anatolia and to never again attempt to expand Seleucid territory west of the Taurus Mountains. The Kingdom of Pergamum and the Republic of Rhodes, Rome's allies in the war, gained the former Seleucid lands in Anatolia. Antiochus died in 187 BC on another expedition to the east, where he sought to extract money to pay the indemnity.\nRoman power, Parthia and Judea.\nThe reign of his son and successor Seleucus IV Philopator (187\u2013175 BC) was largely spent in attempts to pay the large indemnity, and Seleucus was ultimately assassinated by his minister Heliodorus.\nSeleucus' younger brother, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, now seized the throne. He attempted to restore Seleucid power and prestige with a successful war against the old enemy, Ptolemaic Egypt, which met with initial success as the Seleucids defeated and drove the Egyptian army back to Alexandria itself. As the king planned on how to conclude the war, he was informed that Roman commissioners, led by the Proconsul Gaius Popillius Laenas, were near and requesting a meeting with the Seleucid king. Antiochus agreed, but when they met and Antiochus held out his hand in friendship, Popilius placed in his hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate and told him to read it. The decree demanded that he should abort his attack on Alexandria and immediately stop waging the war on Ptolemy. When the king said that he would call his friends into council and consider what he ought to do, Popilius drew a circle in the sand around the king's feet with the stick he was carrying and said, \"Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate.\" For a few moments he hesitated, astounded at such a peremptory order, and at last replied, \"I will do what the senate thinks right.\" He then chose to withdraw rather than set the empire to war with Rome again.\nOn his return journey, according to Josephus, he made an expedition to Judea, took Jerusalem by force, slew a great many who had favored Ptolemy, sent his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and interrupted the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation, for three years and six months.\nThe latter part of his reign saw a further disintegration of the Empire despite his best efforts. Weakened economically, militarily and by loss of prestige, the Empire became vulnerable to rebels in the eastern areas of the empire, who began to further undermine the empire while the Parthians moved into the power vacuum to take over the old Persian lands. Antiochus' aggressive Hellenizing (or de-Judaizing) activities provoked a full scale armed rebellion in Judea\u2014the Maccabean Revolt. Efforts to deal with both the Parthians and the Jews as well as retain control of the provinces at the same time proved beyond the weakened empire's power. Antiochus orchestrated a military campaign, capturing Artaxias I, King of Armenia, and reoccupying Armenia. His offensive ventured as far as Persepolis, but he was forced from the city by the populace. On his return home, Antiochus died in Isfahan in 164 BC.\nCivil war and further decay.\nAfter the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Seleucid Empire became increasingly unstable. Frequent civil wars made central authority tenuous at best. Epiphanes' young son, Antiochus V Eupator, was first overthrown by Seleucus IV's son, Demetrius I Soter in 161 BC. Demetrius I attempted to restore Seleucid power in Judea particularly, but was overthrown in 150 BC by Alexander Balas\u2014an impostor who (with Egyptian backing) claimed to be the son of Epiphanes. Alexander Balas reigned until 145 BC when he was overthrown by Demetrius I's son, Demetrius II Nicator. Demetrius II proved unable to control the whole of the kingdom, however. While he ruled Babylonia and eastern Syria from Damascus, the remnants of Balas' supporters\u2014first supporting Balas' son Antiochus VI, then the usurping general Diodotus Tryphon\u2014held out in Antioch.\nMeanwhile, the decay of the Empire's territorial possessions continued apace. By 143 BC, the Jews in the form of the Maccabees had fully established their independence. Parthian expansion continued as well. In 139 BC, Demetrius II was defeated in battle by the Parthians and was captured. By this time, the entire Iranian Plateau had been lost to Parthian control.\nDemetrius Nicator's brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes, took the throne after his brother's capture. He faced the enormous task of restoring a rapidly crumbling empire, one facing threats on multiple fronts. Hard-won control of Coele-Syria was threatened by the Jewish Maccabee rebels. Once-vassal dynasties in Armenia, Cappadocia, and Pontus were threatening Syria and northern Mesopotamia; the nomadic Parthians, brilliantly led by Mithridates I of Parthia, had overrun upland Media (home of the famed Nisean horse herd); and Roman intervention was an ever-present threat. Sidetes managed to bring the Maccabees to heel and frighten the Anatolian dynasts into a temporary submission; then, in 133, he turned east with the full might of the Royal Army (supported by a body of Jews under the Hasmonean prince, John Hyrcanus) to drive back the Parthians.\nSidetes' campaign initially met with spectacular success, recapturing Mesopotamia, Babylonia, and Media. In the winter of 130/129 BC, his army was scattered in winter quarters throughout Media and Persis when the Parthian king, Phraates II, counter-attacked. Moving to intercept the Parthians with only the troops at his immediate disposal, he was ambushed and killed at the Battle of Ecbatana in 129 BC. Antiochus Sidetes is sometimes called the last great Seleucid king.\nAfter the death of Antiochus VII Sidetes, all of the recovered eastern territories were recaptured by the Parthians. The Maccabees again rebelled, civil war soon tore the empire to pieces, and the Armenians began to encroach on Syria from the north.\nCollapse (100\u201363 BC).\nBy 100 BC, the once-formidable Seleucid Empire encompassed little more than Antioch and some Syrian cities. Despite the clear collapse of their power, and the decline of their kingdom around them, nobles continued to play kingmakers on a regular basis, with occasional intervention from Ptolemaic Egypt and other outside powers. The Seleucids existed solely because no other nation wished to absorb them\u2014seeing as they constituted a useful buffer between their other neighbours. In the wars in Anatolia between Mithridates VI of Pontus and Sulla of Rome, the Seleucids were largely left alone by both major combatants.\nMithridates' ambitious son-in-law, Tigranes the Great, king of Armenia, however, saw opportunity for expansion in the constant civil strife to the south. In 83 BC, at the invitation of one of the factions in the interminable civil wars, he invaded Syria and soon established himself as ruler of Syria, putting the Seleucid Empire virtually at an end.\nSeleucid rule was not entirely over, however. Following the Roman general Lucullus' defeat of both Mithridates and Tigranes in 69 BC, a rump Seleucid kingdom was restored under Antiochus XIII. Even so, civil wars could not be prevented, as another Seleucid, Philip II, contested rule with Antiochus. After the Roman conquest of Pontus, the Romans became increasingly alarmed at the constant source of instability in Syria under the Seleucids. Once Mithridates was defeated by Pompey in 63 BC, Pompey set about the task of remaking the Hellenistic East, by creating new client kingdoms and establishing provinces. While client nations like Armenia and Judea were allowed to continue with some degree of autonomy under local kings, Pompey saw the Seleucids as too troublesome to continue; doing away with both rival Seleucid princes, he made Syria into a Roman province.\nCulture.\nThe domain of the Seleucids stretched from the Aegean Sea to what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, therefore including a diverse array of cultures and ethnic groups. Greeks, Assyrians, Armenians, Georgians, Persians, Medes, Mesopotamians, Jews, and more all lived within its bounds. The immense size of the empire gave the Seleucid rulers a difficult balancing act to maintain order, resulting in a mixture of concessions to local cultures to maintain their own practices while also firmly controlling and unifying local elites under the Seleucid banner.\nThe government established Greek cities and settlements throughout the empire via a program of colonization that encouraged immigration from Greece; both city settlements as well as rural ones were created that were inhabited by ethnic Greeks. These Greeks were given good land and privileges, and in exchange were expected to serve in military service for the state. Despite being a tiny minority of the overall population, these Greeks were the backbone of the empire: loyal and committed to a cause that gave them vast territory to rule, they overwhelmingly served in the military and government. Unlike Ptolemaic Egypt, Greeks in the Seleucid Empire seem to rarely have engaged in mixed marriages with non-Greeks; they kept to their own cities.\nThe various non-Greek peoples of the empire were still influenced by the spread of Greek thought and culture, a phenomenon referred to as Hellenization. Historically significant towns and cities, such as Antioch, were created or renamed with Greek names, and hundreds of new cities were established for trade purposes and built in Greek style from the start. Local educated elites who needed to work with the government learned the Greek language, wrote in Greek, absorbed Greek philosophical ideas, and took on Greek names; some of these practices then slowly filtered down to the lower classes. Hellenic ideas began an almost 250-year expansion into the Near East, Middle East, and Central Asian cultures.\nSynthesizing Hellenic and indigenous cultural, religious, and philosophical ideas \u2013 an ethnic unity framework established by Alexander \u2013 met with varying degrees of success. The result was times of simultaneous peace and rebellion in various parts of the empire. In general, the Seleucids allowed local religions to operate undisturbed, such as incorporating Babylonian religious tenets, to gain support. Tensions around the integration of Judaism were present during the reign of the Seleucid governments. Though previous governments had managed a relatively seamless integration of Judean religious and cultural practices, the rule of Antiochus IV introduced significant changes. Antiochus IV instigated a bidding process for the High Priest position\u2014this led to Menelaus, a radical Hellenist, outbidding Jason, a moderate Hellenist who upheld many traditional Judean practices. The shift from Jason to Menelaus unsettled the Jewish populace due to Menelaus's more extreme Hellenistic leanings. Aggravating the situation, Antiochus IV initiated a series of religious persecutions. This cumulated in a localized revolt in Jerusalem. Antiochus IV's violent retaking of the city and the banning of traditional Judean practices led to the eventual loss of control of Judea by the Seleucid government, paving the way for the rise of an independent Hasmonean kingdom.\nArchaeologist Gideon Ashford argued that the empire's administrative and cultural influence had been substantially underestimated. Through his attribution of the so-called Amida Archive to a Seleucid provincial bureaucracy, Ashford advanced what he called an \"Invisible Hellenism\" model, portraying the empire as a sophisticated broker of Greco-Iranian cultural exchange. Although his minor re-dating of sites and his reconstruction of Seleucid Antioch drew some criticism, Ashford's work has helped revive interest in the quotidian infrastructure of Seleucid rule.\nMilitary.\nAs with the other major Hellenistic armies, the Seleucid army fought primarily in the Greco-Macedonian style, with its main body being the phalanx. The phalanx was a large, dense formation of men armed with small shields and a long pike called the . This form of fighting had been developed by the Macedonian army in the reign of Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great. Alongside the phalanx, the Seleucid armies used numerous native and mercenary troops to supplement their Greek forces, which were limited due to the distance from the Seleucid rulers' Macedonian homeland. The size of the Seleucid army usually varied between 70,000 and 200,000 in manpower.\nThe distance from Greece put a strain on the Seleucid military system, as it was primarily based around the recruitment of Greeks as the key segment of the army. In order to increase the population of Greeks in their kingdom, the Seleucid rulers created military settlements. There were two main periods in the establishment of settlements, firstly under Seleucus I Nicator and Antiochus I Soter and then under Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The military settlers were given land, \"varying in size according to rank and arm of service'. They were settled in 'colonies of an urban character, which at some point could acquire the status of a polis\". The settler-soldiers were called ; they would maintain the land as their own and in return, they would serve in the Seleucid army when called. The majority of settlements were concentrated in Lydia, northern Syria, the upper Euphrates and Media. Antiochus III brought Greeks from Euboea, Crete and Aetolia and settled them in Antioch.\nThese Greek settlers would be used to form the Seleucid phalanx and cavalry units, with picked men put into the kingdom's guards' regiments. The rest of the Seleucid army would consist of native and mercenary troops, who would serve as light auxiliary troops. While the Seleucids were happy to recruit from less populated and outlying parts of the Empire such as the Arabs and Jews, Iranian peoples in the east, and inhabitants of Asia Minor to the north, they generally eschewed recruiting native Syrians and native Mesopotamians (Babylonians). This was presumably mostly from a desire not to train and arm the people who were an overwhelming majority in the trade and governmental centers of the Empire in Antioch and Babylon, risking revolt. While a revolt in a remote place could be put down by resolute action from the center, an uprising in Syria-Coele would have undermined the kingdom's very existence.\nFollowing losses of territory in Asia Minor during the Roman-Seleucid War, King Antiochus IV sponsored a new wave of immigration and settlements to replace them and maintain enough Greeks to staff the phalanxes seen at the military parade at Daphne in 166\u2013165 BC. Antiochus IV built 15 new cities \"and their association with the increased phalanx... at Daphne is too obvious to be ignored\".\nEconomy.\nAs a hegemonic empire, much of the state's wealth accumulation centered around maintaining its sizable military. While the motive is simple enough, the Seleucid Empire boasts of a sophisticated political economy that extracts wealth from local temples, cities (or ), and royal estates; much of which was inherited from their Achaemenid predecessors. Recent discussion indicates a market-oriented economy under the Seleucids. However, evidencing limits our understanding of the Seleucid economy to the Hellenistic Near-East; that is, through their holdings in Syria, Asia Minor, and Mesopotamia. Little is known about the economy of the Upper Satrapies.\nMonetization.\nCurrency plays an increasingly central role under the Seleucids; however, monetization was nothing new in their newly acquired lands. Rather, the introduction and widespread implementation of currency is attributed to Darius I's tax reforms centuries prior; hence, the Seleucids see a continuation rather than shift in this practice, i.e. the payment of taxation in silver or, if necessary, in kind. In this regard, the Seleucids are notable for paying their sizeable armies exclusively in silver. Nevertheless, there are two significant developments of currency during the Seleucid period: the adoption of the \"Attic Standard\" in certain regions, and the popularization of bronze coinage.\nThe adoption of the Attic standard was not uniform across the realm. The Attic standard was already the common currency of the Mediterranean prior to Alexander's conquest; that is, it was the preferred currency for foreign transactions. As a result, coastal regions under the Seleucids\u2014Syria and Asia Minor\u2014were quick to adopt the new standard. In Mesopotamia, however, the millennia-old shekel (weighing 8.33 g silver) prevailed over the Attic standard. According to Historian R. J. van der Spek, this is due to their particular method in recording price, which favored bartering over monetary transactions. The Mesopotamians used the value of one shekel as a fixed reference point, against which the amount of a good is given. Prices themselves are accounted in terms of their weight in silver per ton, e.g., 60 g silver, barley, June 242 BC. The minute difference in weight between a shekel and didrachm (weighing 8.6 g silver) could not be expressed in this barter system, and a Greek tetradrachm would be \"a far too heavy denomination...in daily trade.\"\nBronze coinage, dating from the late fifth and fourth century, was popularized as a \"fiduciary\" currency facilitating \"small-scale exchanges\" in the Hellenistic period. It was principally a legal tender which circulated only around its locales of production; however, the great Seleucid mint at Antioch during Antiochus III's reign (which Numismatist Arthur Houghton dubs \"The Syrian and Coele-Syrian Experiment\") began minting bronze coins (weighing 1.25\u20131.5g) to serve a \"regional purpose.\" The reasons behind this remain unclear. However, Spek notes a chronic shortage of silver in the Seleucid empire. In fact, Antiochus I's heavy withdrawal of silver from a satrap is noted by the Babylonian astronomical diaries (AD No. \u2013 273 B 'Rev. 33'): \"purchases in Babylon and other cities were made in Greek bronze coins.\" This was unprecedented because \"in official documents [bronze coins] played no part\"; it was a sign of \"hardship\" for the Seleucids. Nevertheless, the low denomination of bronze coinage meant it was used in tandem with bartering; making it a popular and successful medium of exchange.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture, like most pre-modern economies, constituted a vast majority of the Seleucid economy. Somewhere between 80 and 90% of the Seleucid population was employed, in some form, within the prevailing agricultural structures inherited from their Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid predecessors. These included temples, , and royal estates. We should clarify that the term , according to Spek, did not confer any special status to cities in the Seleucid sources; it was simply the term for \"city\"\u2014Greek or otherwise. Regardless, agricultural produce varied from region to region. But in general, Greek produced: \"grain, olives and their oil, wine...figs, cheese from sheep and goats, [and] meat.\" Whereas Mesopotamian production from temple land consisted of: \"barley, dates, mustard (or cascuta/dodder), cress (cardamom), sesame and wool\"; which, as the core region of the Seleucid empire, was also the most productive.\nRecent evidence indicates that Mesopotamian grain production, under the Seleucids, was subject to market forces of supply and demand. Traditional \"primitivist\" narratives of the ancient economy argue that it was \"marketless\"; however, the Babylonian astronomical diaries show a high degree of market integration of barley and date prices\u2014to name a few\u2014in Seleucid Babylonia. Prices exceeding \"370g\" silver per ton in Seleucid Mesopotamia was considered a sign of famine. Therefore, during periods of war, heavy taxation, and crop failure, prices increase drastically. In an extreme example, Spek believes tribal Arab raiding into Babylonia caused barley prices to skyrocket to 1493 grams of silver per ton from 5\u20138 May, 124 BC. The average Mesopotamian peasant, if working for a wage at a temple, would receive 1 shekel; it \"was a reasonable monthly wage for which one could buy one kor of grain= 180 [liters].\" While this appears dire, we should be reminded that Mesopotamia under the Seleucids was largely stable and prices remained low. With encouraged Greek colonization and land reclamation increasing the supply of grain production, however, the question of whether this artificially kept prices stable is uncertain.\nThe Seleucids also continued the tradition of actively maintaining the Mesopotamian waterways. As the greatest source of state income, the Seleucid kings actively managed the irrigation, reclamation, and population of Mesopotamia. In fact, canals were often dug by royal decrees, to which \"some were called the King's Canal for that reason.\" For example, the construction of the Pallacottas canal was able to control the water level of the Euphrates which, as Arrian notes in his Anabasis 7.21.5, required: \"over two months of work by more than 10,000 Assyrians.\"\nRole of the state\u2013political economy.\nAs a hegemonic empire, the state's primary focus was maintaining its sizable army via wealth extraction from three major sources: tribute from autonomous and temples, and proportional land-tax from royal land. The definition of \"royal land\" remains contested. While all agree do not constitute royal land, some remain uncertain over the status of temple land. Yet, they commanded notable economic power and functioned almost independently from the state. Nevertheless, the Seleucid manner of extraction, in contrast to earlier regimes, is considered more \"aggressive\" and \"predatory\".\nIn theory, the Seleucid state was an absolute monarchy that did not recognize private property in our modern sense. Any land that was not delegated to the or temples was considered private property of the sovereign; thus, considered as Royal Land and liable to direct tax by the state. Here, a \"proportional land-tax\", that is, a tax based on the size of one's plot, is collected by the local governor (or Satrap) and sent to the capital. However, there is no evidence for the amount that was taxed on any given region.\nTribute was heavily levied on and temples. Although tribute is paid annually, the amount demanded increases significantly during wartime. During a civil war in 149 BC, Demetrius II demanded the province of Judaea to pay 300 talents of silver, which was seen as \"severe.\" But this was far from an isolated case. In fact, the Babylonian Astronomical Diaries in 308/7 BC note a hefty 50% tax on harvest \"from the lands of the temple of Shamash (in Sipprar or Larsa).\" Nevertheless, annual tribute was \"a long-accepted and uncontroversial practice.\" Also, royal land was regularly donated to the temples and ; albeit under the assumption that a greater share of revenue is given to the state in exchange.\nThe controversial practice of temple \"despoliation\", however, was a regular occurrence under the Seleucids\u2014in contrast to earlier times. Although the Seleucid kings were aware and appreciated the sacrosanctity of religious treasures, their concentration in these places \"proved irresistible\" in the face of \"short-term fiscal constraints.\" As an example, Antiochus III's despoliation of the Anahit Temple in Ecbatana, wherein he procured 4000 silver talents, was used to fund his Great Eastern campaign. According to historian Michael J. Taylor:It is difficult to believe that these monarchs who knew enough to bow before Nabu, bake bricks for Esagil, and enforce kosher regulations in Jerusalem, would be blithely aware of the political hazards of removing Temple treasures. It is more likely that they knew the risks but took them anyway.\nA rebellion in 169 BC during Antiochus III's campaign in Egypt demonstrates that these \"risks\" occasionally backfire. The increasingly bold interference is due, in large part, to the appointment of provincial high-priests by the monarch himself. Often they were his court \"favorites\", whose prerogatives were purely administrative; essentially, they served to collect tribute for the state. Unsurprisingly: \"native elites profoundly feared that the arrival of a Seleucid official might quickly cascade into a wholesale removal of Temple treasures.\"\nAcademic discussion.\nInterpretations on the Seleucid economy since the late 19th century traditionally fell between the \"modernist\" and \"primitivist\" camps. On one hand, the modernist view\u2014largely associated with Michael Rostovtzeff and Eduard Meyer\u2014argues that the Hellenistic economies operated along price-setting markets with capitalist enterprises exported over long distances in \"completely monetarized markets.\" On the other hand, the primitivist view\u2014associated with M.I. Finley, Karl Polanyi and Karl B\u00fccher\u2014interprets ancient economies as \"autarchic\" in nature with little to no interaction among each other. However, recent discussion has since criticized these models for their grounding on \"Greco-centric\" sources.\nRecent discussion has since rejected these traditional dichotomies. According to Spek and Reger, the current view is that the Seleucid economy\u2014and Hellenistic economies more broadly\u2014were \"partially\" market-oriented, and \"partially\" monetarized. While the market was subject to forces of supply and demand, a majority of produce was still consumed by their producers and was, hence, \"invisible\" to the observer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its area is approximately , and the population is estimated at 8,000,000. Silesia is split into two main subregions, Lower Silesia in the west and Upper Silesia in the east.\nSituated along the Oder River, with the Sudeten Mountains extending across the southern border, Silesia is a heavily industrialised region rich in mineral and natural resources. The largest city and Lower Silesia's capital is Wroc\u0142aw; the historic capital of Upper Silesia is Opole. The biggest metropolitan area is the Katowice metropolitan area, the centre of which is Katowice. Parts of the Czech city of Ostrava and the German city of G\u00f6rlitz are situated within Silesia's borders.\nSilesia\u2019s culture reflects its complex history and diverse influences, comprising Polish, Czech, and German elements. The region is known for its distinctive Silesian language (still spoken by a minority in Upper Silesia), richly decorated folk costumes, hearty regional cuisine, and a mix of Gothic, Baroque, and industrial-era architecture seen in its cities and towns. The region contains many historical landmarks and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Silesia's borders and national affiliation have changed over time, both when it was a hereditary possession of noble houses and after the rise of modern nation-states, resulting in an abundance of castles and strongholds, especially in the Jelenia G\u00f3ra valley.\nFirst held by Great Moravia at the end of the 9th century and Bohemia in the early 10th century, Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state, and after its fragmentation in the 12th century it formed the Duchy of Silesia. As a result of further fragmentation, it was divided into individual duchies, ruled by various lines of the Polish Piast dynasty. In the 14th century, it became a constituent part of the Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire, which passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy in 1526; however, a number of duchies remained under the rule of Polish dukes (Piast, Jagiellon, Sobieski) as formal Bohemian fiefdoms. As a result of the Silesian Wars, the region was annexed by Prussia from Austria in 1742 and subsequently became a part of the German Empire in 1871.\nAfter World War I, when the Poles and Czechs regained their independence, the easternmost part of Upper Silesia became again part of Poland by the decision of the Entente Powers after insurrections by Poles and the Upper Silesian plebiscite, while the remaining former Austrian parts of Silesia were divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland. During World War II, as a result of German occupation the entire region was under control of Nazi Germany. In 1945, after World War II, most of the German-held Silesia was transferred to Polish jurisdiction by the Potsdam Agreement between the victorious Allies and became again part of Poland. The small Lusatian strip west of the Oder\u2013Neisse line, which had belonged to Silesia since 1815, became part of East Germany.\nAs the result of the forced population shifts of 1945\u201348, today's inhabitants of Silesia speak the national languages of their respective countries. Previously German-speaking Lower Silesia has developed a new mixed Polish dialect and novel costumes. There is ongoing debate about whether the Silesian language, common in Upper Silesia, should be considered a dialect of Polish or a separate language. The Lower Silesian German dialect is nearing extinction due to its speakers' expulsion.\nEtymology.\nThe names of Silesia in different languages most likely share their etymology\u2014 ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Latin, Spanish and English: \"Silesia\"; ; ; . The names all relate to the name of a river (now \u015al\u0119za) and mountain (Mount \u015al\u0119\u017ca) in mid-southern Silesia, which served as a place of cult for pagans before Christianization.\n\"\u015al\u0119\u017ca\" is listed as one of the numerous Pre-Indo-European topographic names in the region (see old European hydronymy). According to some Polonists, the name \"\u015al\u0119\u017ca\" or \"\u015al\u0119\u017c\" is directly related to the Old Polish words \"\u015bl\u0119g\" or \"\u015bl\u0105g\" , which means dampness, moisture, or humidity. They disagree with the hypothesis of an origin for the name \"\u015al\u0105sk\" from the name of the Silings tribe.\nIn Polish common usage, \"\u015al\u0105sk\" refers to traditionally Polish Upper Silesia and today's Silesian Voivodeship, but less to Lower Silesia, which is different from Upper Silesia in many respects as its population was predominantly German-speaking from around the mid-19th century until 1945\u201348.\nHistory.\nIn the fourth century BC from the south, through the K\u0142odzko Valley, the Celts entered Silesia, and settled around Mount \u015al\u0119\u017ca near modern Wroc\u0142aw, O\u0142awa and Strzelin.\nGermanic Lugii tribes were first recorded within Silesia in the 1st century BC. West Slavs and Lechites arrived in the region around the 7th century, and by the early ninth century, their settlements had stabilized. Local West Slavs started to erect boundary structures like the Silesian Przesieka and the Silesia Walls. The eastern border of Silesian settlement was situated to the west of the Bytom, and east from Racib\u00f3rz and Cieszyn. East of this line dwelt a closely related Lechitic tribe, the Vistulans. Their northern border was in the valley of the Barycz River, north of which lived the Western Polans tribe who gave Poland its name.\nThe first known states in Silesia were Greater Moravia and Bohemia. In the 10th century, the Polish ruler Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty incorporated Silesia into the newly established Polish state. In 1000, the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw was established as the oldest Catholic diocese in the region, and one of the oldest dioceses in Poland, subjugated to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno. Poland repulsed German invasions of Silesia in 1017 at Niemcza and in 1109 at G\u0142og\u00f3w. During the Fragmentation of Poland, Silesia and the rest of the country were divided into many smaller duchies ruled by various Silesian dukes. In 1178, parts of the Duchy of Krak\u00f3w around Bytom, O\u015bwi\u0119cim, Chrzan\u00f3w, and Siewierz were transferred to the Silesian Piasts, although their population was primarily Vistulan and not of Silesian descent. \nWalloons came to Silesia as one of the first foreign immigrant groups in Poland, probably settling in Wroc\u0142aw since the 12th century, with further Walloon immigrants invited by Duke Henry the Bearded in the early 13th century. Since the 13th century, German cultural and ethnic influence increased as a result of immigration from German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire.\nThe first granting of municipal privileges in Poland took place in the region, in the town of Z\u0142otoryja by Henry the Bearded. Medieval municipal rights modeled after Lw\u00f3wek \u015al\u0105ski and \u015aroda \u015al\u0105ska, both established by Henry the Bearded, became the basis of municipal form of government for several cities and towns in Poland, and two of five local Polish variants of medieval town rights. The Book of Henryk\u00f3w, which contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language, as well as a document which contains the oldest printed text in Polish, were created in Henryk\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw in Silesia, respectively.\nIn 1241, the Mongols conducted their first invasion of Poland, causing widespread panic and mass flight. They looted much of the region and defeated the combined Polish, Moravian and German forces led by Duke Henry II the Pious at the Battle of Legnica, which took place at Legnickie Pole near the city of Legnica. Upon the death of Orda Khan, the Mongols chose not to press forward further into Europe, but returned east to participate in the election of a new Grand Khan (leader).\nBetween 1289 and 1292, Bohemian king Wenceslaus II became \"suzerain\" of some of the Upper Silesian duchies. Polish monarchs had not renounced their hereditary rights to Silesia until 1335. The province became part of the Bohemian Crown which was part of the Holy Roman Empire; however, a number of duchies remained under the rule of the Polish dukes from the houses of Piast, Jagiellon and Sobieski as formal Bohemian fiefdoms, some until the 17th\u201318th centuries. In 1469, sovereignty over the region passed to Hungary, and in 1490, it returned to Bohemia. In 1526 Silesia passed with the Bohemian Crown to the Habsburg monarchy.\nIn the 15th century, several changes were made to Silesia's borders. Parts of the territories that had been transferred to the Silesian Piasts in 1178 were bought by the Polish kings in the second half of the 15th century (the Duchy of O\u015bwi\u0119cim in 1457; the Duchy of Zator in 1494). The Bytom area remained in the possession of the Silesian Piasts, though it was a part of the Diocese of Krak\u00f3w. The Duchy of Krosno Odrza\u0144skie () was inherited by the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1476 and with the renunciation of King Ferdinand I and the estates of Bohemia in 1538, became an integral part of Brandenburg. From 1645 until 1666, the Duchy of Opole and Racib\u00f3rz was held in pawn by the Polish House of Vasa as dowry of the Polish queen Cecylia Renata.\nIn 1742, most of Silesia was seized by King Frederick II of Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession, eventually becoming the Prussian Province of Silesia in 1815; consequently, Silesia became part of the German Empire when it was proclaimed in 1871. The Silesian capital Breslau became at that time one of the big cities in Germany. Breslau was a center of Jewish life in Germany and an important place of science (university) and industry (manufacturing of locomotives). German mass tourism started in the Silesian mountain region (Hirschberg, Schneekoppe). \nAfter World War I, a part of Silesia, Upper Silesia, was contested by Germany and the newly independent Second Polish Republic. The League of Nations organized a plebiscite to decide the issue in 1921. It resulted in 60% of votes being cast for Germany and 40% for Poland. Following the third Silesian uprising (1921), however, the easternmost portion of Upper Silesia (including Katowice), with a majority ethnic Polish population, was awarded to Poland, becoming the Silesian Voivodeship. The Prussian Province of Silesia within Germany was then divided into the provinces of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia. Meanwhile, Austrian Silesia, the small portion of Silesia retained by Austria after the Silesian Wars, was mostly awarded to the new Czechoslovakia (becoming known as Czech Silesia and Trans-Olza), although most of Cieszyn and territory to the east of it went to Poland.\nPolish Silesia was among the first regions invaded during Germany's 1939 attack on Poland, which started World War II. One of the claimed goals of Nazi German occupation, particularly in Upper Silesia, was the extermination of those whom Nazis viewed as \"subhuman\", namely Jews and ethnic Poles. The Polish and Jewish population of the then Polish part of Silesia was subjected to genocide involving expulsions, mass murder and deportation to Nazi concentration camps and forced labour camps, while Germans were settled in pursuit of . Two thousand Polish intellectuals, politicians, and businessmen were murdered in the in 1940 as part of a Poland-wide Germanization program. Silesia also housed one of the two main wartime centers where medical experiments were conducted on kidnapped Polish children by Nazis. Czech Silesia was occupied by Germany as part of Sudetenland. In Silesia, Nazi Germany operated the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, several prisoner-of-war camps for Allied POWs (including the major Stalag VIII-A, Stalag VIII-B, Stalag VIII-C camps), numerous Nazi prisons and thousands of forced labour camps, including a network of forced labour camps solely for Poles (), subcamps of prisons, POW camps and of the Gross-Rosen and Auschwitz concentration camps.\nThe Potsdam Conference of 1945 defined the Oder-Neisse line as the border between Germany and Poland, pending a final peace conference with Germany which never took place. At the end of WWII, Germans in Silesia fled from the battle ground, assuming they would be able to return when the war was over. However, they could not return, and those who had stayed were expelled and a new Polish population, including people displaced from former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and from Central Poland, joined the surviving native Polish inhabitants of the region. After 1945 and in 1946, nearly all of the 4.5\u00a0million Silesians of German descent fled, or were interned in camps and expelled, including some thousand German Jews who survived the Holocaust and had returned to Silesia.\nThe newly formed Polish United Workers' Party created a Ministry of the Recovered Territories that claimed half of the available arable land for state-run collectivized farms. Many of the new Polish Silesians who resented the Germans for their invasion in 1939 and brutality in occupation now resented the newly formed Polish communist government for their population shifting and interference in agricultural and industrial affairs.\nThe administrative division of Silesia within Poland has changed several times since 1945. Since 1999, it has been divided between Lubusz Voivodeship, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Opole Voivodeship, and Silesian Voivodeship. Czech Silesia is now part of the Czech Republic, forming part of the Moravian-Silesian Region and the northern part of the Olomouc Region. Germany retains the Silesia-Lusatia region ( or ) west of the Neisse, which is part of the federal state of Saxony.\nThe region was affected by the 1997, 2010 and 2024 Central European floods.\nEthnic History.\nModern Silesia is inhabited by Poles, Silesians, Germans, and Czechs. Germans first came to Silesia during the Late Medieval Ostsiedlung. The last Polish census of 2011 showed that the Silesians are the largest ethnic or national minority in Poland, Germans being the second; both groups are located mostly in Upper Silesia. The Czech part of Silesia is inhabited by Czechs, Moravians, Silesians, and Poles.\nIn the early 19th century the population of the Prussian part of Silesia was between 2/3 and 3/4 German-speaking, between 1/5 and 1/3 Polish-speaking, with Sorbs, Czechs, Moravians and Jews forming other smaller minorities (see Table 1. below).\nBefore the Second World War, Silesia was inhabited mostly by Germans, with Poles a large minority, forming a majority in Upper Silesia. Silesia was also the home of Czech and Jewish minorities. The German population tended to be based in the urban centres and in the rural areas to the north and west, whilst the Polish population was mostly rural and could be found in the east and in the south.\nEthnic structure of Prussian Upper Silesia (Opole regency) during the 19th century and the early 20th century can be found in Table 2.:\nThe Austrian part of Silesia had a mixed German, Polish and Czech population, with Polish-speakers forming a majority in Cieszyn Silesia.\nReligion.\nHistorically, Silesia was about equally split between Protestants (overwhelmingly Lutherans) and Roman Catholics. In an 1890 census taken in the German part, Roman Catholics made up a slight majority of 53%, while the remaining 47% were almost entirely Lutheran. Geographically speaking, Lower Silesia was mostly Lutheran except for the Glatzer Land (now K\u0142odzko County). Upper Silesia was mostly Roman Catholic except for some of its northwestern parts, which were predominantly Lutheran. Generally speaking, the population was mostly Protestant in the western parts, and it tended to be more Roman Catholic the further east one went. In Upper Silesia, Protestants were concentrated in larger cities and often identified as German. After World War II, the religious demographics changed drastically as Germans, who constituted the bulk of the Protestant population, were forcibly expelled. Poles, who were mostly Roman Catholic, were resettled in their place. Today, Silesia remains predominantly Roman Catholic.\nExisting since the 12th century, Silesia's Jewish community was concentrated around Wroc\u0142aw and Upper Silesia, and numbered 48,003 (1.1% of the population) in 1890, decreasing to 44,985 persons (0.9%) by 1910. In Polish East Upper Silesia, the number of Jews was around 90,000\u2013100,000. Historically, the community had suffered a number of localised expulsions such as their 1453 expulsion from Wroc\u0142aw. From 1712 to 1820 a succession of men held the title Chief Rabbi of Silesia (\"Landesrabbiner\"): Naphtali ha-Kohen (1712\u201316); Samuel ben Naphtali (1716\u201322); \u1e24ayyim Jonah Te'omim (1722\u20131727); Baruch b. Reuben Gomperz (1733\u201354); Joseph Jonas Fr\u00e4nkel (1754\u201393); Jeremiah L\u00f6w Berliner (1793\u201399); Lewin Saul Fr\u00e4nkel (1800\u20137); Aaron Karfunkel (1807\u201316); and Abraham ben Gedaliah Tiktin (1816\u201320).\nConsequences of World War II.\nAfter the German invasion of Poland in 1939, following Nazi racial policy, the Jewish population of Silesia was subjected to genocide with executions performed by Einsatzgruppe z. B.V. led by Udo von Woyrsch and Einsatzgruppe I led by Bruno Streckenbach, imprisonment in ghettos, and ethnic cleansing of the General Government. In their efforts to exterminate the Jews through murder and ethnic cleansing, the Germans established the Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen camps in the province of Silesia. Expulsions were carried out openly and reported in the local press. Those sent to ghettos would from 1942 be expelled to concentration and work camps. Between 5 May and 17 June, 20,000 Silesian Jews were sent to Birkenau to gas chambers and during August 1942, 10,000 to 13,000 Silesian Jews were murdered by gassing at Auschwitz. Most Jews in Silesia were exterminated by the Nazis. After the war Silesia became a major centre for repatriation of the Jewish population in Poland which survived Nazi German extermination and in autumn 1945, 15,000 Jews were in Lower Silesia, mostly Polish Jews returned from territories now belonging to Soviet Union, rising in 1946 to seventy thousand as Jewish survivors from other regions in Poland were relocated.\nThe majority of Germans fled or were expelled from the present-day Polish and Czech parts of Silesia during and after World War II. From June 1945 to January 1947, 1.77\u00a0million Germans were expelled from Lower Silesia, and 310,000 from Upper Silesia. Today, most German Silesians and their descendants live in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, many of them in the Ruhr area working as miners, like their ancestors in Silesia. One of its most notable but controversial spokesmen was the Christian Democratic Union politician Herbert Hupka.\nThe expulsion of Germans led to widespread underpopulation. The population of the town of G\u0142og\u00f3w fell from 33,500 to 5,000, and from 1939 to 1966 the population of Wroc\u0142aw fell by 25%. Attempts to repopulate Silesia proved unsuccessful in the 1940s and 1950s, and Silesia's population did not reach pre-war levels until the late 1970s. The Polish settlers who repopulated Silesia were partly from the former Polish Eastern Borderlands, which was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939. Wroc\u0142aw was partly repopulated with refugees from the formerly Polish city of Lw\u00f3w.\nGeography.\nMost of Silesia is relatively flat, although its southern border is generally mountainous. It is primarily located in a swath running along both banks of the upper and middle Oder (Odra) River, but it extends eastwards to the upper Vistula River. The region also includes many tributaries of the Oder, including the B\u00f3br (and its tributary the Kwisa), the Barycz and the Nysa K\u0142odzka. The Sudeten Mountains run along most of the southern edge of the region, though at its south-eastern extreme it reaches the Silesian Beskids and Moravian-Silesian Beskids, which belong to the Carpathian Mountains range.\nHistorically, Silesia was bounded to the west by the Kwisa and B\u00f3br Rivers, while the territory west of the Kwisa was in Upper Lusatia (earlier \"Milsko\"). However, because part of Upper Lusatia was included in the Province of Silesia in 1815, in Germany G\u00f6rlitz, Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis and neighbouring areas are considered parts of historical Silesia. Those districts, along with Poland's Lower Silesian Voivodeship and parts of Lubusz Voivodeship, make up the geographic region of Lower Silesia.\nSilesia has undergone a similar notional extension at its eastern extreme. Historically, it extended only as far as the Brynica River, which separates it from Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie in the Lesser Poland region. However, to many Poles today, Silesia () is understood to cover all of the area around Katowice, including Zag\u0142\u0119bie. This interpretation is given official sanction in the use of the name Silesian Voivodeship () for the province covering this area. In fact, the word in Polish (when used without qualification) now commonly refers exclusively to this area (also called or Upper Silesia).\nAs well as the Katowice area, historical Upper Silesia also includes the Opole region (Poland's Opole Voivodeship) and Czech Silesia. Czech Silesia consists of a part of the Moravian-Silesian Region and the Jesen\u00edk District in the Olomouc Region.\nNatural resources.\nSilesia is a resource-rich and populous region. Since the middle of the 18th century, coal has been mined. The industry had grown while Silesia was part of Germany, and peaked in the 1970s under the People's Republic of Poland. During this period, Silesia became one of the world's largest producers of coal, with a record tonnage in 1979. Coal mining declined during the next two decades, but has increased again following the end of Communist rule.\nThe 41 coal mines in Silesia are mostly part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, which lies in the Silesian Upland. The coalfield has an area of about . Deposits in Lower Silesia have proven to be difficult to exploit and the area's unprofitable mines were closed in 2000. In 2008, an estimated 35\u00a0billion tonnes of lignite reserves were found near Legnica, making them some of the largest in the world.\nFrom the fourth century BC, iron ore has been mined in the upland areas of Silesia. The same period had lead, copper, silver, and gold mining. Zinc, cadmium, arsenic, and uranium have also been mined in the region. Lower Silesia features large copper mining and processing between the cities of Legnica, G\u0142og\u00f3w, Lubin, and Polkowice. In the Middle Ages, gold () and silver () were mined in the region, which is reflected in the names of the former mining towns of Z\u0142otoryja, Z\u0142oty Stok and Srebrna G\u00f3ra.\nThe region is known for stone quarrying to produce limestone, marl, marble, and basalt.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nThe region also has a thriving agricultural sector, which produces cereals (wheat, rye, barley, oats, corn), potatoes, rapeseed, sugar beets and others. Milk production is well developed. The Opole Silesia has for decades occupied the top spot in Poland for their indices of effectiveness of agricultural land use.\nMountainous parts of southern Silesia feature many significant and attractive tourism destinations (e.g., Karpacz, Szczyrk, Wis\u0142a). Silesia is generally well forested. This is because greenness is generally highly desirable by the local population, particularly in the highly industrialized parts of Silesia.\nDemographics.\nSilesia has been historically diverse in every aspect. Nowadays, the largest part of Silesia is located in Poland; it is often cited as one of the most diverse regions in that country.\nThe United States Immigration Commission, in its \"Dictionary of Races or Peoples\" (published in 1911, during a period of intense immigration from Silesia to the United States), considered Silesian as a geographical (not ethnic) term, denoting the inhabitants of Silesia. It is also mentioned the existence of both Polish Silesian and German Silesian dialects in that region.\nCities and towns.\nThe following table includes the cities and towns in Silesia with a population greater than 20,000 (2022).\nFlags and coats of arms.\nThe emblems of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia originate from the emblems of the Piasts of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia. The coat of arms of Upper Silesia depicts the golden eagle on the blue shield. The coat of arms of Lower Silesia depicts a black eagle on a golden (yellow) shield.\nFlags with their colors refer to the coat of arms of Silesia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They consist mainly of mountain ranges and are the highest part of the Bohemian Massif. They stretch from the Saxon capital of Dresden in the northwest across to the region of Lower Silesia in Poland and to the city of Ostrava in the Czech Republic in the east. Geographically the Sudetes are a \"Mittelgebirge\" with some characteristics typical of high mountains. Its plateaus and subtle summit relief makes the Sudetes more akin to mountains of Northern Europe than to the Alps.\nIn the east of the Sudetes, the Moravian Gate and Ostrava Basin separates from the Carpathian Mountains. The Sudetes' highest mountain is Sn\u011b\u017eka () at , which is also the highest mountain of the Czech Republic, Bohemia, Silesia, and Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It lies in the Giant Mountains on the border between the Czech Republic and Poland. Prad\u011bd (1,491\u00a0m/4,893\u00a0ft) in the Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains is the highest mountain of Moravia. Lusatia's highest point (1,072\u00a0m/3,517\u00a0ft) lies on Smrk mountain in the Jizera Mountains, and the Sudetes' highest mountain in Germany, which is also the country's highest mountain east of the river Elbe, is Lausche (793\u00a0m/2,600\u00a0ft) in the Lusatian Mountains. The most notable rivers rising in the Sudetes are the Elbe, Oder, Spree, Morava, B\u00f3br, Lusatian Neisse, Eastern Neisse, Jizera and Kwisa. The highest parts of the Sudetes are protected by national parks; Karkonosze and Sto\u0142owe (Table) in Poland and Krkono\u0161e in the Czech Republic.\nIn the west, the Sudetes border with the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The westernmost point of the Sudetes lies in the Dresden Heath (\"Dresdner Heide\"), the westernmost part of the West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands, in Dresden.\nThe Sudeten Germans (the German-speaking inhabitants of Czechoslovakia) as well as the Sudetenland (the border regions of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia they inhabited) are named after the Sudetes.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Sudetes\" is derived from \"Sudeti montes\", a Latinization of the name \"Soudeta ore\" used in the \"Geographia\" by the Greco-Roman writer Ptolemy (Book 2, Chapter 10) c.\u2009AD 150 for a range of mountains in Germania in the general region of the modern Czech Republic.\nThere is no consensus about which mountains he meant, and he could for example have intended the Ore Mountains, joining the modern Sudetes to their west, or even (according to Sch\u00fctte) the Bohemian Forest (although this is normally considered to be equivalent to Ptolemy's Gabreta forest). The modern Sudetes are probably Ptolemy's Askiburgion mountains. It has also been proposed that Ptolemy's Askiburgion and Sudeti are the same mountains, with one being measured from the north, and one from the south.\nPtolemy wrote \"\u03a3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\" in Greek, which is a neuter plural. Latin \"mons\", however, is a masculine, hence Sudeti. The Latin version, and the modern geographical identification, is likely to be a scholastic innovation, as it is not attested in classical Latin literature. The meaning of the name is not known. In one hypothetical derivation, it means \"Mountains of Wild Boars\", relying on Indo-European *su-, \"pig\". A better etymology perhaps is from Latin \"sudis\", plural \"sudes\", \"spines\", which can be used of spiny fish or spiny terrain.\nSubdivisions.\nThe Sudetes are usually divided into:\nHigh Sudetes (, , ) is together name for the ranges of Giant Mountains, Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk and Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk Mountains.\nClimate.\nThe highest mountains, those located along the Czech\u2013Polish border have annual precipitations around . The Table Mountains, which reach in elevation, have precipitations ranging from at lower locations to in the upper parts, with July being the rainiest month. Snow cover at the Table Mountains typically last 70 to 95 days depending on altitude.\nVegetation.\nSettlement, logging and clearance has left forest pockets in the foothills with dense and continuous forest being found in the upper parts of the mountains. Due to logging in the last centuries little remains of the broad-leaf trees like beech, sycamore, ash and littleleaf linden that were once common in the Sudetes. Instead Norway spruce was planted in their place in the early 19th century, in some places amounting to monocultures. To provide more space for spruce plantations various peatlands were drained in the 19th and 20th century. Some spruce plantations have suffered severe damage as the seeds used came from lowland specimens that were not adapted to mountain conditions. Silver fir grow naturally in the Sudetes being more widespread in past times, before clearance since the Late Middle Ages and subsequent industrial pollution reduced the stands.\nMany arctic-alpine and alpine vascular plants have a disjunct distribution being notably absent from the central Sudetes despite suitable habitats. Possibly this is the result a warm period during the Holocene (last 10,000 years) which wiped out cold-adapted vascular plants in the medium-sized mountains of the central Sudetes where there was no higher ground that could serve as refugia. Besides altitude the distribution of some alpine plants is influenced by soil. This is the case of \"Aster alpinus\" that grows preferentially on calcareous ground. Other alpine plants such as \"Cardamine amara\", \"Epilobium anagallidifolium\", \"Luzula sudetica\" and \"Solidago virgaurea\" occur beyond their altitudinal zonation in very humid areas.\nPeatlands are common in the mountains occurring on high plateaus or in valley bottoms. Fens occur at slopes.\nTimber line.\nThe higher mountains of the Sudetes lie above the timber line which is made up of Norway spruce. Spruces in wind-exposed areas display features such as flag tree disposition of branches, tilted stems and elongated stem cross sections. Forest-free areas above the timber line have increased historically by deforestation yet lowering of the timber line by human activity is minimal. Areas above the timber line appear discontinuously as \"islands\" in the Sudetes. In the Giant Mountains the timber line lies at \"c\". 1230\u00a0m a.s.l. while to the southeast in the Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains it lie at \"c\". 1310\u00a0m a.s.l. Part of the Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains have been above the timber line for no less than 5000 years. Mountains rise considerably above the timber line, at most 400\u00a0m, a characteristic that sets the Sudetes apart from other \"Mittelgebirge\" of Central Europe.\nGeology.\nGeological research has been hampered by the multinational geography of the Sudetes with and the limitation of studies to state boundaries.\nBedrock.\nThe igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Sudetes originated during the Variscan orogeny and its aftermath. The Sudetes are the northeasternmost accessible part of Variscan orogen as in the North European Plain the orogen is buried beneath sediments. Plate tectonic movements during the Variscan orogeny assembled together four major and two to three lesser tectonostratigraphic terranes. The assemblage of the terranes ought to have involved the closure of at least two ocean basins containing oceanic crust and marine sediments. This is reflected in the ophiolites, MORB-basalts, blueschists and eclogites that occur in-between terranes. Various terranes of the Sudetes are likely extensions of the Armorican terrane while other terranes may be the fringes of the ancient Baltica continent. One possibility for the amalgamation of terranes in the Sudetes is that the G\u00f3ry Sowie-K\u0142odzko terrane collided with the Orlica-\u015anie\u017cnik terrane causing the closure of a small oceanic basin. This event led to obduction of the Central Sudetic ophiolite in the Devonian period. In the Early Carboniferous the joint G\u00f3ry Sowie-K\u0142odzko-Orlica-\u015anie\u017cnik terrane collided with the Brunovistulian terrane. This last terrane was part of the Old Red Continent and could correspond either to Baltica or the eastern tip of the narrow Avalonia terrane. Also by the Early Carboniferous the Saxothuringian terrane collided with the G\u00f3ry Sowie-K\u0142odzko-Orlica-\u015anie\u017cnik terrane closing the Rheic Ocean.\nOnce the main phase of deformation of the orogeny was over basins that had formed in-between metamorphic rock massifs were filled by sedimentary rock in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. During and after sedimentation large granitic plutons intruded the crust. Viewed in a map today these plutons make up about 15% the Sudetes. Granites are of S-type. The granites and grantic-gneisses of Izera in the west Sudetes are disassociated from orogeny and thought to have formed during rifting along a passive continental margin. The Karkonosze Granite, also in the west Sudetes, have been dated to have formed \"c\". 318 million years ago at the beginning of the Variscan orogeny. The Karkonosze Granite is intruded by somewhat younger lamprophyre dykes.\nA NW-SE to WNW-ESE oriented strike-slip fault \u2014the Intra-Sudetic fault\u2014 runs through the length of the Sudetes. The Intra-Sudetic fault is parallel with the Upper Elbe fault and Middle Oder fault. Other main faults at the sudetes are also NW-SE oriented, dextral and of strike slip type. These include the T\u0142umacz\u00f3w-Sienna Fault and the Marginal Sudetic Fault.\nVolcanism and thermal waters.\nThere are remnants of lava flows and volcanic plugs in the Sudetes. The volcanic rocks making up these outcrops are of mafic chemistry and include basanite and represent episodes of volcanism in the Oligocene and Miocene periods. Volcanism affected not only the Sudetes but also parts of the Sudetic foreland being part of a SW-NE oriented Bohemo-Silesian Belt of volcanic rocks. Mantle xenoliths have been recovered from the lavas of a volcano at Je\u0161t\u011bd-Koz\u00e1kov Ridge in the Czech western Sudetes. These pyroxenite xenoliths arrived to surface from approximate depths of 35, 70 and 73\u00a0km and indicate a complex history for the mantle beneath the Sudetes.\nThere are thermal springs in the Sudetes with measured temperatures of 29 to 44\u00a0\u00b0C. Drilling has revealed the existence of waters at 87\u00a0\u00b0C at depths of 2000\u00a0m. These modern waters are believed to be associated to the Late Cenozoic volcanism in Central Europe.\nUplift and landforms.\nThe Sudetes forms the NE border of the Bohemian Massif. In detail the Sudetes is made up of a series of massifs that are rectangular and rhomboid in plan view. These mountains corresponds to horsts and domes separated by basins, including grabens. The mountains took their present form after the Late Mesozoic retreat of the seas from the area which left the Sudetes subject to denudation for at least 65 million years. This meant that during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic 8 to 4\u00a0km of rock was eroded from the top of what is now the Sudetes. Concurrently with the Cenozoic denudation the climate cooled due to the northward drift of Europe. The collision between Africa and Europe has resulted in the deformation and uplift of the Sudetes. As such the uplift is related to the contemporary rise of the Alps and Carpathians. The acceleration of uplift of the Sudetes occurred during the Middle Miocene because of the Bohemian Massif's growth. Uplift was accomplished by the creation or reactivation of numerous faults leading to a reshaping of the relief by renewed erosion. Various \"hanging valleys\" attest to this uplift. Block tectonics has uplifted or sunken crustal blocks. While the Late Cenozoic uplift has uplifted the Sudetes as a whole some grabens precede this uplift.\nWeathering during the Cenozoic led to the formation of an etchplain in parts of Sudetes. While this etchplain has been eroded various landforms and weathering mantles have been suggested to attest its former existence. At present the mountain range shows a remarkable diversity of landforms. Some of the landforms present are escarpments, inselbergs, bornhardts, granitic domes, tors, flared slopes and weathering pits. Various escarpments have originated from faults and may reach heights of up to 500\u00a0m. To the northeast the Sudetes is separated from the Sudetic foreland by a sharp mountain front made up of an escarpment linked to the Sudetic Marginal Fault. Near Kaczawa this escarpment reaches 80 to 120\u00a0m in height. The relative influence of Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic movements and erosion in shaping the mountain landscape may vary along the northern front of the Sudetes.\nDuring the Quaternary glaciations the Giant Mountains was the most glaciated part of the Sudetes. Evidence of this are its glacial cirques and the glacial valleys that develop next to it. The precise timing of the glaciations in the Sudetes is poorly constrained. Parts of the Sudetes remained free from glacier ice developing permafrost soils and periglacial landforms such as rock glaciers, nivation hollows, patterned ground, blockfields, solifluction landforms, blockstreams, tors and cryoplanation terraces. The occurrence or not of these periglacial landforms depends on altitude, the steepness and direction of slopes and the underlying rock type.\nMass wasting.\nOther than debris flows there is little contemporary mass wasting in the mountains. Avalanches are common in the Sudetes.\nHistory.\nThe area around the Sudetes had by the 12th century been relatively densely settled with agriculture and settlements expanding further in the High Middle Ages from the 13th century onward. The majority of settlers were Germans from neighbouring Silesia, founding typical \"Waldhufend\u00f6rfer\". As this trend went on thinning of forest and deforestation had turned clearly unsustainable by the 14th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries agriculture had reached the inner part of Table Mountains in the Central Sudetes. Destruction and degradation of the Sudetes forest peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries with demand of firewood coming from glasshouses that operated through the area in the early modern period.\nSome limited form of forest management begun in the 18th century while in the industrial age demand for firewood was sustained by metallurgic industries in the settlements and cities around the mountains. In the 19th century the Central Sudetes had an economic boom with sandstone quarrying and a flourishing tourism industry centered on the natural scenery. Despite this there was at least since the 1880s a trend of depopulation of villages and hamlets which continued into the 20th century. Since World War II various areas that were cleared of forest have been re-naturalized. Industrial activity across Europe has caused considerable damage to the forests as acid rain and heavy metals has arrived with westerly and southwesterly winds. Silver firs have proven particularly vulnerable to industrial soil contamination.\nSudetes and \"Sudetenland\".\nAfter World War I, the name \"Sudetenland\" came into use to describe areas of the First Czechoslovak Republic with large ethnic German populations. In 1918, the short-lived rump state of German-Austria proclaimed a Province of the Sudetenland in northern Moravia and Austrian Silesia around the city of Opava (\"Troppau\").\nThe term was used in a wider sense when on 1 October 1933 Konrad Henlein founded the Sudeten German Party and in Nazi German parlance \"Sudetendeutsche\" (Sudeten Germans) referred to all autochthonous ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia. They were heavily clustered in the entire mountainous periphery of Czechoslovakia\u2014not only in the former Moravian \"Provinz Sudetenland\" but also along the northwestern Bohemian borderlands with German Lower Silesia, Saxony and Bavaria, in an area formerly called German Bohemia. In total, the German minority population of interwar Czechoslovakia numbered around 20% of the total national population.\nSparking the Sudeten Crisis, Adolf Hitler got his future enemies Britain and France to concede the \"Sudetenland\" with most of the Czechoslovak border fortifications in the 1938 Munich Agreement, leaving the remainder of Czechoslovakia shorn of its natural borders and buffer zone, finally occupied by Germany in March 1939. After being annexed by Nazi Germany, much of the region was redesignated as the \"Reichsgau Sudetenland\".\nAfter World War II, most of the previous population of the Sudetes was forcibly expelled on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement and the Bene\u0161 decrees, and the region was resettled by new Polish and Czechoslovak citizens. A considerable proportion of the Czechoslovak populace thereafter strongly objected to the use of the term \"Sudety\". In the Czech Republic the designation \"Krkono\u0161sko-jesenick\u00e1 subprovincie\" is used in academic context and usually only the discrete Czech names for the individual mountain ranges (e.g. Giant Mountains) appear, as under Subdivisions above.\nEconomy and tourism.\nPart of the economy of the Sudetes is dedicated to tourism. Coal mining towns like Wa\u0142brzych have re-oriented their economies towards tourism since the decline of mining in the 1980s. As of 2000 scholar Krzysztof R. Mazurski judged that the Sudetes, much like Poland's Baltic coast and the Carpathians, were unlikely to attract much foreign tourism. Sandstone was quarried in Sudetes during the 19th and 20th centuries. Likewise volcanic rock has also been quarried to such degree untouched volcanoes are scarce. Sandstone labyrinths have been a notable tourist attraction since the 19th century with considerable investments being done in projecting trails some of which involve rock engineering.\nIn the Sudetes there are several spa towns with sanatoria: Jesen\u00edk, Velk\u00e9 Losiny, Bludov, Lipov\u00e1-l\u00e1zn\u011b, Jansk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b and Karlova Stud\u00e1nka in the Czech Republic, and Kudowa-Zdr\u00f3j, Polanica-Zdr\u00f3j, Duszniki-Zdr\u00f3j, L\u0105dek-Zdr\u00f3j and Jedlina-Zdr\u00f3j in Poland. In many places the tourist base is developed \u2013 hotels, guest houses and ski infrastructure.\nThe nearest international airports are Dresden Airport in Dresden and Wroc\u0142aw Airport in Wroc\u0142aw.\nNotable towns.\nTowns in this area with more than 10,000 inhabitants include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His father, Christopher B\u00e1thory, ruled Transylvania as voivode (or deputy) of the absent prince, Stephen B\u00e1thory. Sigismund was still a child when the Diet of Transylvania elected him voivode at his dying father's request in 1581. Initially, regency councils administered Transylvania on his behalf, but Stephen B\u00e1thory made J\u00e1nos Ghyczy the sole regent in 1585. Sigismund adopted the title of prince after Stephen B\u00e1thory died.\nThe Diet proclaimed Sigismund to be of age in 1588, but only after he agreed to expel the Jesuits. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated him, but the ban was lifted in 1590, and the Jesuits returned a year later. His blatant favoritism towards the Catholics made him unpopular among his Protestant subjects. He decided to join the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire. Since he could not convince the Diet to support his plan, he renounced the throne in July 1594, but the commanders of the army convinced him to revoke his abdication. At their proposal, he purged the noblemen who opposed the war against the Ottomans. He officially joined the Holy League and married Maria Christina of Habsburg, a niece of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II. The marriage was never consummated.\nMichael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, and \u0218tefan R\u0103zvan, Voivode of Moldavia, acknowledged his suzerainty. Their united forces defeated an Ottoman army in the Battle of Giurgiu. The triumph was followed by a series of Ottoman victories, and Sigismund abdicated in favor of Rudolph II in early 1598, receiving the duchies of Racib\u00f3rz and Opole as a compensation. His maternal uncle, Stephen Bocskai, persuaded him to return in late summer, but he could not make peace with the Ottoman Empire. He renounced Transylvania in favor of Andrew B\u00e1thory and settled in Poland in 1599. During the following years, Transylvania was regularly pillaged by unpaid mercenaries and Ottoman marauders. Sigismund returned at the head of a Polish army in 1601, but he could not strengthen his position. He again abdicated in favor of Rudolph and settled in Bohemia in June 1602. After he was accused of a conspiracy against the emperor, he spent fourteen months in jail in Prague in 1610 and 1611. He died at his Bohemian estate.\nEarly life.\nSigismund was the son of Christopher B\u00e1thory and his second wife, Elisabeth Bocskai. He was born in V\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania) in 1573, according to the Transylvanian historian, Istv\u00e1n Szamosk\u00f6zy. At the time of Sigismund's birth, his uncle, Stephen B\u00e1thory, was the voivode of Transylvania. After being elected King of Poland in late 1575, Stephen B\u00e1thory adopted the title of Prince of Transylvania and made Sigismund's father voivode. Stephen B\u00e1thory set up a separate chancellery in Krak\u00f3w to supervise the administration of the principality.\nSigismund's father and uncle were Roman Catholic, but his mother was Calvinist. According to the Jesuit Antonio Possevino, Sigismund demonstrated his devotion to Catholicism already at the age of seven. His mother mocked him for his piety, saying that he only wanted to secure his uncle's goodwill. Sigismund was especially hostile towards the Anti-Trinitarians in his youth. His mother died in early 1581.\nReign.\nVoivode.\nChristopher B\u00e1thory fell seriously ill after his wife's death. At his request, the Diet of Transylvania elected Sigismund voivode in Kolozsv\u00e1r (present-day Cluj-Napoca in Romania) around 15May 1581. Since Sigismund was still a minor, his dying father tasked a council of twelve noblemen with the government. Christopher B\u00e1thory's cousin, D\u00e9nes Cs\u00e1ky, and his brother-in-law, Stephen Bocskai, headed the council. Christopher B\u00e1thory died on 27May.\nThe Ottoman Sultan, Murad III, confirmed Sigismund's election on 3July 1581, reminding him of his obligation to pay a yearly tribute of 15,000 florins. However, P\u00e1l M\u00e1rkh\u00e1zy, a young nobleman who lived in Istanbul, offered to double the tribute and to pay an additional tax of 100,000 florins if he was made the ruler of Transylvania. The Grand Vizier, Koca Sinan Pasha, supported M\u00e1rkh\u00e1zy's claim. Taking advantage of the situation, Murad demanded the same payments from Sigismund, but Stephen B\u00e1thory and the \"Three Nations of Transylvania\" resisted. After receiving the customary tribute from Transylvania, the sultan again confirmed Sigismund's rule in November 1581.\nStephen B\u00e1thory who took charge of Sigismund's education confirmed the position of his Jesuit tutors, J\u00e1nos Leleszi and Gergely V\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi. According to Szamosk\u00f6zy, Stephen B\u00e1thory also ordered Sigismund's companions to talk of foreign lands, wars, and hunting with him during their dinners together. He reorganized the government on 3May 1583, charging S\u00e1ndor Kendi, Farkas Kovacs\u00f3czy, and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sombori with the administration of Transylvania during Sigismund's minority. The Diet suggested to Stephen B\u00e1thory that he dismiss them, but he only dissolved the council on 1May 1585. He replaced the three councillors with the devout Calvinist J\u00e1nos Ghyczy, making him regent for Sigismund.\nPrince under guardianship.\nSigismund adopted the title of Prince of Transylvania after Stephen B\u00e1thory died on 13 December 1586. He was still a minor, and Ghyczy continued to rule as regent. Sigismund was one of the candidates to the throne of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. His advisors knew that he had little chance to win, but they wanted to demonstrate that the B\u00e1thorys had a valid claim to rule the Commonwealth. Kovacs\u00f3czy officially announced Sigismund's application at the \"Sejm\" (or general assembly) on 14August 1587. Five days later, the assembly elected Sigismund III Vasa king. During the ensuing war of succession, Transylvanian troops supported SigismundIII against Maximilian of Habsburg, who had also laid claim to Poland and Lithuania.\nSigismund's cousins, Balthasar and Stephen B\u00e1thory, returned from Poland to Transylvania. Balthasar wanted to take charge of the government, making his court at Fogaras (present-day F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 in Romania) the center of those who opposed Ghyczy's rule. Kovacs\u00f3czy, the chancellor of Transylvania, remained neutral in the conflict.\nIn October 1588 the Diet proposed to declare the sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania. He did not accept the offer, mainly because he did not want to expel his confessor, Alfonso Carillo. The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not to resist the Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.\nInternal conflicts.\nSigismund took the customary oath of the Transylvanian monarchs on 23December 1588. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated him for the expulsion of the Jesuits. Sigismund's cousin, Cardinal Andrew B\u00e1thory, urged the pope to lift the ban, saying that the prince's Protestant advisors had forced him to throw out the priests. The pope authorized Sigismund to employ a confessor in May 1589, and the excommunication was revoked on Easter 1590.\nSigismund made several attempts to strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Church, especially by appointing Catholics to the highest positions of state administration. Carillo and other Jesuit priests returned to Sigismund's court in disguise in early 1591. Sigismund met Andrew and Balthasar B\u00e1thory in August to seek their support for the legalization of the Jesuits' presence, but they refused to stand by the priests at the Diet.\nSigismund dispatched his favorite, Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3sika, to Tuscany to start negotiations regarding his marriage to Eleonora Orsini (a niece of Ferdinando I de' Medici), although his cousins had sharply opposed J\u00f3sika's appointment. He also invited Italian artists and artisans to his court, making them his advisors or butlers. Szamosk\u00f6zy described them as \"the trashiest representatives of the noblest nation\". The delegates of the \"Three Nations\" criticized Sigismund for his prodigal way of life at the Diet in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in November. To reduce his authority, the Diet prescribed that Sigismund should only make decisions in the royal council. Sigismund deprived his cousins of the allowances that the royal treasury had paid to them.\nGossip about conspiracies spread during the following months. S\u00e1ndor Kendi accused Sigismund's former tutor, J\u00e1nos G\u00e1lffy, of deliberately stirring up debates between the prince and his cousins. Other courtiers claimed that Balthasar B\u00e1thory was planning to dethrone Sigismund. A Jesuit priest was informed at Vienna that G\u00e1lffy and his allies wanted to murder the prince and his cousins. In late 1591 Sigismund stated that he was willing to renounce in favor of Balthasar if the members of the royal council favored his cousin. His offer was refused, but during the debate Kendi referred to Sigismund and Balthasar as the \"two monsters and greatest disasters of the Transylvanian realm\". Pope Clement VIII's legate, Attilio Amalteo, mediated a reconciliation between Sigismund and his cousins in the summer of 1592. The pope also urged Sigismund to marry a Catholic princess from the House of Lorraine.\nAt the demand of the sultan, Transylvania troops assisted Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia. The sultan also ordered Sigismund to pay double the amount of the yearly tribute. Balthasar B\u00e1thory murdered Sigismund's secretary, P\u00e1l Gyulai, on 10December 1592. He also persuaded Sigismund to order the execution of G\u00e1lffy on 8March 1593. That summer, Sigismund went to Krak\u00f3w in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland. The Holy See had proposed the marriage, which could have enabled Sigismund to rule Poland during the absence of the king, who was also King of Sweden, but the plan came to nothing.\nMurad III declared war against the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph in August. The sultan ordered Sigismund to send reinforcements to support the Ottoman army in Royal Hungary. According to diplomatic sources, the grand vizier was planning to occupy Transylvania. At the proposal of Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of Poland, Sigismund sent envoys to Elizabeth I of England, asking her to intervene on his behalf at the Sublime Porte. She ordered her ambassador at Istanbul, Edward Barton, to support Sigismund.\nPope Clement VIII wanted to persuade Sigismund to join the Holy League that the pope had organized against the Ottoman Empire. After Rudolph's troops defeated the Ottomans in a series of battles in the autumn of 1593, Sigismund decided to join the Holy League, provided that Rudolph acknowledged the independence of Transylvania from the Hungarian Crown. However, the delegates of the Three Nations refused to declare war against the Ottoman Empire at three consecutive Diets between May and July. Sigismund abdicated, tasking Balthasar B\u00e1thory with the government in late July. Balthasar wanted to seize the throne, but Kovacs\u00f3czy, Kendi, and the other leading officials decided to set up an aristocratic council to administer Transylvania.\nThe commanders of the army (including Stephen Bocskai), and Friar Carillo jointly convinced Sigismund to return on 8August. They also persuaded him to order the arrest of Kovacs\u00f3czy, Kendi, Balthasar B\u00e1thory, and twelve other noblemen who had opposed the war against the Ottomans on 28August, accusing them of plotting. S\u00e1ndor and G\u00e1bor Kendi were beheaded along with two other members of the royal council; Balthasar B\u00e1thory, Kovacs\u00f3czy, and Ferenc Kendi were strangled in prison. All but one murdered noblemen were Protestants, mostly Unitarians. Many of their relatives converted to Catholicism to prevent the confiscation of their estates.\nHoly League.\nSigismund decided to join the Holy League together with Aaron the Tyrant, voivode of Moldavia, and Michael the Brave, voivode of Wallachia, on 5October 1594. The two voivodes had started direct negotiations with the Holy See, but Sigismund, who claimed suzerainty over them, prevented them from conducting further direct negotiations. Sigismund's envoy, Stephen Bocskai, signed the document that confirmed the membership of Transylvania in the Holy League in Prague on 28January 1595. According to the treaty, RudolphII recognized Sigismund's hereditary right to rule Transylvania and Partium and to use the title of prince, but he also stipulated that the principality was to be re-united with the Hungarian Crown if Sigismund's family died out. The Diet of Transylvania confirmed the treaty on 16April. The Diet also prohibited religious innovations, which gave rise to the persecution of Szekler Sabbatarians in Udvarhelysz\u00e9k.\nThe Wallachian boyars and prelates recognized Sigismund's suzerainty over Wallachia on behalf of Michael the Brave in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r on 20May 1595. According to the treaty, Michael was forbidden to enter into an alliance with foreign powers without Sigismund's approval. The voivode's right to sentence his boyars to death was also limited. The Diet of Transylvanian was authorized to impose taxes in Wallachia with a council of twelve boyars. After Aaron the Tyrant refused to sign a similar treaty, Sigismund invaded Moldavia and captured him in Ia\u0219i. He made \u0218tefan R\u0103zvan the new voivode on 3June, forcing him to swear fealty to him. Thereafter, Sigismund styled himself \"By the Grace of God, Prince of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia, Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Count of the Sz\u00e9kelys and Lord of Parts of the Kingdom of Hungary\".\nSigismund married Maria Christina of Habsburg, a niece of RudolphII, on 6August. However, the marriage was never consummated. Sigismund accused Margit Majl\u00e1th (who was the mother of his executed cousin, Balthasar B\u00e1thory) of witchcraft, causing his impotence. Historian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy notes that Sigismund's contemporaries made no reference to his relationship with women, showing that Sigismund was homosexual.\nGy\u00f6rgy Borb\u00e9ly, Ban of Kar\u00e1nsebes, captured Lippa (now Lipova in Romania) and other Ottoman fortresses along the Maros River before the end of August. Koca Sinan Pasha broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael the Brave to retreat towards Transylvania. Michael confronted the invaders in the Battle of C\u0103lug\u0103reni, but he could not prevent them from seizing T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and Bucharest. He withdrew to Stoene\u0219ti to await the arrival of the Transylvanian and Moldavian troops.\nSince the Ottoman army outnumbered the forces at Sigismund's disposal, he proposed the Sz\u00e9kely commoners (who had been reduced to serfdom in the 1560s) to restore their freedom if they joined his campaign against the Ottomans. The Sz\u00e9kelys accepted his offer, enabling Sigismund to launch a counter-invasion in Wallachia in early October. The united forces of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia defeated the retreating Ottoman army in the Battle of Giurgiu on 25October. Although the victory was not decisive, the battle enabled the two voivodes to maintain their alliance with the Holy League.\nIgnoring the Sz\u00e9kely warriors' preeminent role during the war, the Diet of Transylvania refused to restore their freedom on 15December. Sigismund left for Prague to start negotiations with RudolphII in early January 1596, tasking his wife and Stephen Bocskai with the government. The Sz\u00e9kelys tried to secure their freedom, but Bocskai repressed their movement with extraordinary cruelty during the \"Bloody Carnival\" in early 1596.\nRudolph II promised Sigismund to send reinforcements and money to continue the war against the Ottomans. Sigismund returned to Transylvania on 4March. He laid siege to Temesv\u00e1r (now Timi\u0219oara in Romania), but he lifted the siege when an Ottoman army of 20,000 strong approached the fortress. The Ottoman Sultan Mehmed III invaded Royal Hungary in summer. Sigismund joined his forces with the royal army, which was under the command of Maximilian of Habsburg. However, the Ottomans routed their united army in the Battle of Mez\u0151keresztes between 23 and 26 October.\nSigismund again went to Prague to meet RudolphII and offered to abdicate in January 1597. After he returned to Transylvania, he restored the Roman Catholic bishopric in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. He sent envoys to Italy to demand the supreme command of a new Christian army, but his delegates at Istanbul started negotiations regarding a reconciliation with the sultan.\nAbdications and returns.\nThe failure of his marriage and the defeats of the Holy League diminished Sigismund's self-confidence. He sent his envoys to RudolphII and again offered to abdicate in September 1597. An agreement regarding his abdication was signed on 23December 1597. RudolphII granted Sigismund the Silesian duchies of Racib\u00f3rz and Opole and a yearly subsidy of 50,000 thalers. The agreement was kept secret for months.\nThe Diet of Transylvania acknowledged Sigismund's abdication on 23March 1598. Maria Christierna took charge of the government until the arrival of Maximilian of Habsburg, whom RudolphII had appointed to administer Transylvania. Sigismund went to Silesia, but he did not like his new duchies. Bocskai, who had been dismissed after Sigismund's abdication, urged him to return.\nSigismund came to Kolozsv\u00e1r on 21 August. On the following day, Bocskai convoked the Diet to his military camp at Sz\u00e1szsebes (now Sebe\u0219 in Romania), and the delegates proclaimed Sigismund prince. Most Transylvanians accepted the decision, but Gy\u00f6rgy Kir\u00e1ly, the deputy captain of V\u00e1rad, remained loyal to RudolphII. In September an Ottoman army invaded the principality, capturing the fortresses along the Maros. Sigismund sent his envoys to the commander of the army, Mehmed, convincing him to attack V\u00e1rad instead of breaking into Transylvania proper.\nAll of Sigismund's attempts to make peace with the sultan failed. He sent his envoys to Prague to negotiate with RudolphII, while his confessor, Carillo, started negotiations with Jan Zamoyski in Poland. At Sigismund's invitation, his cousin, Andrew B\u00e1thory, returned from Poland. Sigismund abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (now Media\u0219 in Romania) on 21March 1599. Eight days later, the Diet proclaimed Andrew B\u00e1thory prince, hoping that Andrew could make peace with the Ottomans with the assistance of Poland. Sigismund left Transylvania for Poland in June. His marriage with Maria Christierna was declared invalid in Rome in August.\nAndrew B\u00e1thory lost his throne and his life fighting against Michael the Brave and his Sz\u00e9kely allies in autumn. Michael the Brave administered Transylvania as RudolphII's governor, but his rule was unpopular among the noblemen, especially because of the pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers. As early as 9February 1600 Sigismund announced that he was ready to return to Transylvania. Moses Sz\u00e9kely, a commander-in-chief during Michael the Brave's campaign against Moldavia in May, deserted Michael and came to Poland to meet Sigismund.\nThe elected leader of the Transylvanian noblemen, Istv\u00e1n Cs\u00e1ky, sought assistance from RudolphII's military commander, Giorgio Basta, against Michael. Basta invaded Transylvania and expelled Michael the Brave in September. Basta's unpaid soldiers regularly pillaged the principality, while Ottoman and Tatar marauders made frequent incursions across the frontiers. Sigismund returned to Transylvania across Moldavia at the head of a Polish army on 24March 1601. The Diet proclaimed him prince in Kolozsv\u00e1r on 3April. Basta and Michael the Brave invaded Transylvania in summer. They routed Sigismund's army in the Battle of Goroszl\u00f3 on 3August 1601. After the battle, Sigismund fled to Moldavia, but he returned on 6September.\nThe sultan's envoy confirmed Sigismund's position as Prince of Transylvania in Brass\u00f3 (now Bra\u0219ov in Romania) on 2October. At the head of an army which also included Ottoman and Tatar soldiers, Sigismund expanded his rule over most regions of the principality, but he could not capture Kolozsv\u00e1r in late November. He started new negotiations with Basta over his abdication in March 1602, because he did not trust his own supporters. He referred to them as \"intoxicated and brutish sons of a bitch\" and asked Istv\u00e1n Cs\u00e1ky to help him to leave their camp on 2July. He left Transylvania for the last time on 26July 1602.\nLast years.\nBasta's soldiers accompanied Sigismund to Tokaj. Before long, he went to Prague to beg for RudolphII's mercy. He received the \"incolatus\" (or the right to own lands in Bohemia) in 1604. After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, but he did not accept the offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, saying that he had no information about the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor's offer.\nSigismund received the domain of Libochovice in Bohemia. After one of his employees accused him of plotting against the emperor, Sigismund was imprisoned for fourteen months in the jails of Prague Castle in 1610. Sigismund died of a stroke in Libochovice on 27March 1613. He was buried in a crypt in the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

John Thomas Scopes, commonly known as the Scopes trial or Scopes Monkey Trial, was an American legal case from July 10 to July 21, 1925, in which a high school teacher, John T. Scopes, was accused of violating the Butler Act, a Tennessee state law which outlawed the teaching of human evolution in public schools. The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held. Scopes was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution, but he incriminated himself deliberately so the case could have a defendant. Scopes was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had offered to defend anyone accused of violating the Butler Act in an effort to challenge the constitutionality of the law.\nScopes was found guilty and was fined $100 (equivalent to $1,850 in 2025), but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. William Jennings Bryan, a three-time presidential candidate and former secretary of state, argued for the prosecution, while famed labor and criminal lawyer Clarence Darrow served as the principal defense attorney for Scopes. The trial publicized the fundamentalist\u2013modernist controversy, which set modernists, who believed evolution could be consistent with religion, against fundamentalists, who believed the word of God as revealed in the Bible took priority over all human knowledge. The case was thus seen both as a theological contest and as a trial on whether evolution should be taught in schools. The trial became a symbol of the larger social anxieties associated with the cultural changes and modernization that characterized the 1920s in the United States. It also served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity and highlighted the growing influence of mass media, having been covered by news outlets around the country and being the first trial in American history to be nationally broadcast by radio.\nBackground and origins.\nEvolution and Butler Act.\nIn the mid-19th century, English naturalists Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace independently developed the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection, and that all life on earth is descended from a common ancestor. Their work was jointly published in 1858, and further expanded upon the following year in Darwin's book \"On the Origin of Species.\" As knowledge of the theory began to spread over the succeeding decades, many Christian denominations came to accept the theory, believing that the creation narrative in the Book of Genesis to be an allegory that was not intended to be interpreted literally. Nevertheless, a number of Christian groups came to reject the theory, believing that the Bible was inerrant and should be interpreted literally and that evolution implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe. Some were also critical of the applications of natural selection to sociology, economics, and politics, which became known as Social Darwinism. In the early 20th century, a schism known as the Fundamentalist\u2013modernist controversy arose within American Protestant Christianity, especially Presbyterianism, in response to the cultural, scientific, and technological developments of the time. Fundamentalists insisted on the literal inerrancy of Scripture and rejected interpretations that contradicted biblical accounts, while modernists sought to reconcile faith with scientific advancements, including evolutionary theory.\nTennessee State Representative John Washington Butler, a Tennessee farmer and head of the World Christian Fundamentals Association, lobbied state legislatures to pass anti-evolution laws. He introduced the Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of human evolution in public schools in Tennessee. Butler later stated, \"I didn't know anything about evolution... I'd read in the papers that boys and girls were coming home from school and telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense.\" On March 21, 1925, Tennessee governor Austin Peay signed the bill to gain support among rural legislators, but believed the law would neither be enforced nor interfere with education in Tennessee schools. William Jennings Bryan, who had been campaigning against the teaching of evolution in public schools, thanked Peay enthusiastically for the bill, stating \"The Christian parents of the state owe you a debt of gratitude for saving their children from the poisonous influence of an unproven hypothesis.\" In response, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) financed a test case by offering to defend anyone accused of teaching the theory of evolution in defiance of the Butler Act.\nPlanning.\nOn April 5, 1925, George Rappleyea, the local manager for the Cumberland Coal and Iron Company, arranged a meeting with county superintendent of schools Walter White and local attorney Sue K. Hicks at Robinson's Drug Store in Dayton, convincing them that the controversy of such a trial would give Dayton much needed publicity. According to Robinson, Rappleyea said \"As it is, the law is not enforced. If you win, it will be enforced. If I win, the law will be repealed. We're game, aren't we?\" The men then summoned 24-year-old John T. Scopes, a Dayton high school science and math teacher. The group asked Scopes, who had substituted for the regular biology teacher, to admit to teaching the theory of evolution.\nRappleyea pointed out that, while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution, the state required teachers to use George William Hunter's textbook, \"Civic Biology: Presented in Problems\", which explicitly described and endorsed the theory of evolution, as well as scientific racism and eugenics; and that teachers were, therefore, effectively required to break the law. Scopes mentioned that while he could not remember whether he had actually taught evolution in class, he had, however, gone through the evolution chart and respective chapter with the class. He told the group that he would be willing to stand trial if they could prove that he had taught evolution and could qualify as a defendant.\nScopes urged students to testify against him and coached them in their answers. Judge John T. Raulston accelerated the convening of the grand jury and \"...all but instructed the grand jury to indict Scopes, despite the meager evidence against him and the widely reported stories questioning whether the willing defendant had ever taught evolution in the classroom\". Scopes was charged on May 5 and indicted on May 25 for teaching from the chapter on evolution to a high school class in violation of the Butler Act, after three students testified against him to the grand jury. One student afterwards told reporters: \"I believe in part of evolution, but I don't believe in the monkey business.\" Scopes was nominally arrested, though he was never actually detained. Paul Patterson, owner of \"The Baltimore Sun\", put up $500 in bail for Scopes. The original prosecutors were Herbert E. and Sue K. Hicks, two brothers who were local attorneys and friends of Scopes, but the prosecution was ultimately led by Tom Stewart, the district attorney for the 18th Circuit who later became a U.S. Senator from Tennessee. Stewart was aided by Dayton attorney Gordon McKenzie, who supported the anti-evolution bill on religious grounds, and described evolution as \"detrimental to our morality\" and an assault on \"the very citadel of our Christian religion.\"\nHoping to attract major press coverage, Rappleyea went so far as to write to British novelist H. G. Wells asking him to join the defense team. Wells replied that he had no legal training in Britain, let alone in America, and declined the offer. John R. Neal, a law school professor from Knoxville, announced that he would act as Scopes' attorney whether Scopes liked it or not, and he became the nominal head of the defense team. Baptist pastor William Bell Riley, the founder and president of the World Christian Fundamentals Association, was instrumental in calling lawyer and three-time Democratic presidential nominee, former United States Secretary of State, and lifelong Presbyterian William Jennings Bryan to act as that organization's counsel. Bryan had originally been invited by Sue Hicks to become an associate of the prosecution and Bryan had readily accepted, despite the fact he had not tried a case in thirty-six years. As Scopes pointed out to James Presley in the book \"Center of the Storm\", on which the two collaborated: \"After [Bryan] was accepted by the state as a special prosecutor in the case, there was never any hope of containing the controversy within the bounds of constitutionality.\"\nFollowing the recruitment of Bryan, Clarence Darrow approached John Neal of the defense team and offered his services. Neal accepted, without consulting the rest of the team or the defendant himself. The ACLU had been seeking out an addition to the defense that would parallel Bryan's political experience, but had previously indicated that they did not want Darrow involved out of concern that his staunch agnosticism would imperil the defense team's case. Darrow later claimed he was motivated to join the defense after he \"realized there was no limit to the mischief that might be accomplished unless the country was aroused to the evil at hand\". After many changes back and forth, the defense team consisted of Darrow; ACLU attorney Arthur Garfield Hays; Dudley Field Malone, an international divorce lawyer who had worked at the State Department; W.\u00a0O. Thompson, who was Darrow's law partner; and F.\u00a0B. McElwee. The defense was also assisted by librarian and Biblical authority Charles Francis Potter, who was a modernist Unitarian preacher.\nProceedings.\nThe ACLU had originally intended to oppose the Butler Act on the grounds that it violated the teacher's individual rights and academic freedom, and was therefore unconstitutional. Principally because of Clarence Darrow, this strategy changed as the trial progressed. The earliest argument proposed by the defense once the trial had begun was that there was actually no conflict between evolution and the creation account in the Bible; later, this viewpoint would be called theistic evolution. In support of this claim, they brought in eight experts on evolution. But other than Maynard Metcalf, a zoologist from Johns Hopkins University, the judge would not allow these experts to testify in person. Instead, they were allowed to submit written statements so their evidence could be used at the appeal. In response to this decision, Darrow made a sarcastic comment to Judge Raulston (as he often did throughout the trial) on how he had been agreeable only on the prosecution's suggestions. Darrow apologized the next day, keeping himself from being found in contempt of court.\nThe presiding judge, John T. Raulston, was accused of being biased towards the prosecution and frequently clashed with Darrow. At the outset of the trial, Raulston quoted Genesis and the Butler Act. He also warned the jury not to judge the merit of the law (which would become the focus of the trial) but on the violation of the Act, which he called a 'high misdemeanor'. The jury foreman himself was unconvinced of the merit of the Act but he acted, as did most of the jury, on the instructions of the judge.\nBryan chastised evolution for teaching children that humans were but one of 35,000 types of mammals and bemoaned the notion that human beings were descended \"Not even from American monkeys, but from old world monkeys\".\nDarrow responded for the defense in a speech that was universally considered the oratorical climax of the trial. Arousing fears of \"inquisitions\", Darrow argued that the Bible should be preserved in the realm of theology and morality and not put into a course of science. In his conclusion, Darrow declared that Bryan's \"duel to the death\" against evolution should not be made one-sided by a court ruling that took away the chief witnesses for the defense. Darrow promised there would be no duel because \"there is never a duel with the truth.\" The courtroom went wild when Darrow finished; Scopes declared Darrow's speech to be the dramatic high point of the entire trial and insisted that part of the reason Bryan wanted to go on the stand was to regain some of his tarnished glory.\nExamination of Bryan.\nOn the sixth day of the trial, the defense ran out of witnesses. The judge declared that all the defense testimony on the Bible was irrelevant and should not be presented to the jury. On the seventh day of the trial, Darrow took the unorthodox step of calling Bryan, counsel for the prosecution, as a witness to question him on the Bible as an expert, since their own experts had been rendered irrelevant. Bryan himself (according to a journalist reporting the trial) never made a claim of being an expert, although he did tout his knowledge of the Bible. Although Hays would claim in his autobiography that the examination of Bryan was unplanned, Darrow spent the night before in preparation. The scientists the defense had brought to Dayton\u2014and Charles Francis Potter, a modernist minister who had engaged in a series of public debates on evolution with the fundamentalist preacher John Roach Straton\u2014prepared topics and questions for Darrow to address to Bryan on the witness stand. Kirtley Mather, chairman of the geology department at Harvard and also a devout Baptist, played Bryan and answered questions as he believed Bryan would. This testimony revolved around several questions regarding Biblical stories and Bryan's beliefs (as shown below); this testimony culminated in Bryan declaring that Darrow was using the court to \"slur the Bible\" while Darrow replied that Bryan's statements on the Bible were \"foolish\".\nAdam and Eve.\nAn area of questioning involved the book of Genesis, including questions about whether Eve was actually created from Adam's rib, where Cain got his wife, and how many people lived in Ancient Egypt. Darrow used these examples to suggest that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science, telling Bryan, \"You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion.\" Bryan's declaration in response was \"The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him.\"\nStewart objected for the prosecution, demanding to know the legal purpose of Darrow's questioning. Bryan, gauging the effect the session was having, snapped that its purpose was \"to cast ridicule on everybody who believes in the Bible\". Darrow, with equal vehemence, retorted \"We have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United States.\"\nWhen Darrow asked where Cain got his wife Bryan answered that he would \"leave the agnostics to hunt for her\". When Darrow addressed the issue of the temptation of Eve by the serpent, Bryan insisted that the Bible be quoted verbatim rather than allowing Darrow to paraphrase it in his own terms. However, after another angry exchange, Judge Raulston banged his gavel, adjourning the court.\nEnd of the trial.\nRaulston had adjourned court to the stand on the courthouse lawn, ostensibly because he was \"afraid of the building\" with so many spectators crammed into the courtroom, but probably because of the stifling heat. The confrontation between Bryan and Darrow lasted approximately two hours on the afternoon of the seventh day of the trial. It is likely that it would have continued the following morning but for Judge Raulston's announcement that he considered the whole examination irrelevant to the case and his decision that it should be \"expunged\" from the record. Thus Bryan was denied the chance to cross-examine the defense lawyers in return, although after the trial Bryan would distribute nine questions to the press to bring out Darrow's \"religious attitude\". The questions and Darrow's short answers were published in newspapers the day after the trial ended, with \"The New York Times\" characterizing Darrow as answering Bryan's questions \"with his agnostic's creed, 'I don't know,' except where he could deny them with his belief in natural, immutable law\".\nAfter the defense's final attempt to present evidence was denied, Darrow asked the judge to bring in the jury only to have them come to a guilty verdict:\nWe claim that the defendant is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue as to whether he taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.\nAfter they were brought in, Darrow then addressed the jury:\nWe came down here to offer evidence in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so all we can do is to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not... we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.\nDarrow closed the case for the defense without a final summation. Under Tennessee law, when the defense waived its right to make a closing speech, the prosecution was also barred from summing up its case, preventing Bryan from presenting his prepared summation.\nScopes never testified since there was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later admitted that, in reality, he was unsure of whether he had taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), but the point was not contested at the trial.\nBryan's summation of the Scopes trial, which was distributed to reporters but not read in court, read:\nScience is a magnificent force, but it is not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.\nAfter eight days of trial, it took the jury only nine minutes to deliberate. Scopes was found guilty on July 21 and ordered by Raulston to pay a $100 fine (). Raulston imposed the fine before Scopes was given an opportunity to say anything about why the court should not impose punishment upon him, and, after Neal brought the error to the judge's attention, the defendant spoke for the first and only time in court:\nYour honor, I feel that I have been convicted of violating an unjust statute. I will continue in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom\u2014that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.\nBryan died suddenly five days after the trial's conclusion. The connection between the trial and his death is still debated by historians.\nAppeal to the Supreme Court of Tennessee.\nScopes's lawyers appealed, challenging the conviction on several grounds. First, they argued that the statute was overly vague because it prohibited the teaching of \"evolution\", a very broad term. The court rejected that argument, holding:\nEvolution, like prohibition, is a broad term. In recent bickering, however, evolution has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type. This is the popular significance of evolution, just as the popular significance of prohibition is prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. It was in that sense that evolution was used in this act. It is in this sense that the word will be used in this opinion, unless the context otherwise indicates. It is only to the theory of the evolution of man from a lower type that the act before us was intended to apply, and much of the discussion we have heard is beside this case.\nSecond, the lawyers argued that the statute violated Scopes' constitutional right to free speech because it prohibited him from teaching evolution. The court rejected this argument, holding that the state was permitted to regulate his speech as an employee of the state:\nHe was an employee of the state of Tennessee or of a municipal agency of the state. He was under contract with the state to work in an institution of the state. He had no right or privilege to serve the state except upon such terms as the state prescribed. His liberty, his privilege, his immunity to teach and proclaim the theory of evolution, elsewhere than in the service of the state, was in no wise touched by this law.\nThird, it was argued that the terms of the Butler Act violated the Tennessee State Constitution, which provided that \"It shall be the duty of the General Assembly in all future periods of this government, to cherish literature and science.\" The argument was that the theory of the descent of man from a lower order of animals was now established by the preponderance of scientific thought, and that the prohibition of the teaching of such theory was a violation of the legislative duty to cherish science. The court rejected this argument, holding that the determination of what laws cherished science was an issue for the legislature, not the judiciary:\nThe courts cannot sit in judgment on such acts of the Legislature or its agents and determine whether or not the omission or addition of a particular course of study tends to cherish science.\nFourth, the defense lawyers argued that the statute violated the provisions of the Tennessee Constitution that prohibited the establishment of a state religion. The Religious Preference provisions of the Tennessee Constitution (Section3 of ArticleI) stated, \"no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship\".\nWriting for the court two sittings and one year after receiving the appeal, Chief Justice Grafton Green rejected this argument, holding that the Tennessee Religious Preference clause was designed to prevent the establishment of a state religion as had been the experience in England and Scotland at the writing of the Constitution, and held:\nWe are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. So far as we know, the denial or affirmation of such a theory does not enter into any recognized mode of worship. Since this cause has been pending in this court, we have been favored, in addition to briefs of counsel and various amici curiae, with a multitude of resolutions, addresses, and communications from scientific bodies, religious factions, and individuals giving us the benefit of their views upon the theory of evolution. Examination of these contributions indicates that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.\nFurther, the court held that while the statute \"forbade\" the teaching of evolution (as the court had defined it) it did not \"require\" teaching any other doctrine and thus did not benefit any one religious doctrine or sect over others.\nNevertheless, having found the statute to be constitutional, the court set aside the conviction on appeal because of a legal technicality: the jury should have decided the fine, not the judge, since under the state constitution, Tennessee judges could not at that time set fines above $50, and the Butler Act specified a minimum fine of $100.\nJustice Green added a totally unexpected recommendation:\nThe court is informed that the plaintiff in error is no longer in the service of the state. We see nothing to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case. On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a \"nolle prosequi\" herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.\nAttorney General L. D. Smith immediately announced that he would not seek a retrial, while Scopes' lawyers offered angry comments on the stunning decision.\nIn 1968, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Epperson v. Arkansas\" that such bans contravene the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because their primary purpose is religious. Tennessee had repealed the Butler Act the previous year.\nMedia coverage and publicity.\nThe Scopes trial was covered by journalists from the South and around the world, including H.\u00a0L. Mencken for \"The Baltimore Sun\", which was also paying part of the defense's expenses. It was Mencken who provided the trial with its most colorful labels such as the \"Monkey Trial\" of \"the infidel Scopes\". It was also the first United States trial to be broadcast on national radio. Edward J. Larson, a historian who won the Pulitzer Prize for History for his book \"Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion\" (2004), notes: \"Like so many archetypal American events, the trial itself began as a publicity stunt.\" The press coverage of the \"Monkey Trial\" was overwhelming. The trial served its intention to bring publicity to the town of Dayton. From \"The Salem Republican\", June 11, 1925:\nThe whole matter has assumed the portion of Dayton and her merchants endeavoring to secure a large amount of notoriety and publicity with an open question as to whether Scopes is a party to the plot or not.\nThe front pages of major newspapers including \"The New York Times\" were dominated by the case for days. More than 200 newspaper reporters from all parts of the country and two from London were in Dayton. Twenty-two telegraphers sent out 165,000 words per day on the trial, thousands of miles of telegraph wires were hung for the purpose; more words were transmitted to Britain about the Scopes trial than for any previous American event. Chicago's WGN radio station broadcast the trial with announcer Quin Ryan via clear-channel broadcasting first on-the-scene coverage of the criminal trial. Two movie cameramen had their film flown out daily in a small plane from a specially prepared airstrip. The event became known as the \"Trial of the Century\", and has been described as the most-covered trial in American history, with only the murder trial of O. J. Simpson 69 years later receiving comparable coverage.\nH.L. Mencken's trial reports were vituperative and heavily slanted against the prosecution and the jury, which he described as \"unanimously hot for Genesis\". He mocked the town's inhabitants as \"Babbits\", \"yokels\", \"morons\", \"peasants\", \"hill-billies\", and \"yaps\", and called Bryan a \"buffoon\" and his speeches \"theologic bilge\". He chastised the \"degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls\". In contrast, he called the defense \"eloquent\" and \"magnificent\". Even today, some American creationists, fighting in courts and state legislatures to demand that creationism be taught on an equal footing with evolution in the schools, have claimed that it was Mencken's trial reports in 1925 that turned public opinion against creationism. The media's portrayal of Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan, and the play and movie \"Inherit the Wind\" (1960), have been credited with causing millions of Americans to ridicule religious-based opposition to the theory of evolution.\nMencken, however, did enjoy certain aspects of Dayton, writing\nThe town, I confess, greatly surprised me. I expected to find a squalid Southern village, with darkies snoozing on the horse-blocks, pigs rooting under the houses and the inhabitants full of hookworm and malaria. What I found was a country town full of charm and even beauty\u2014a somewhat smallish but nevertheless very attractive Westminster or Balair.\nMencken described Rhea County as priding itself on a kind of tolerance or what he called \"lack of Christian heat\", opposed to outside ideas but without hating those who held them. He pointed out that the Ku Klux Klan did not have a foothold locally, despite its power throughout much of the state. Mencken attempted to perpetrate a hoax, distributing flyers for the \"Rev. Elmer Chubb\", but the claims that Chubb would drink poison and preach in lost languages were ignored as commonplace by the people of Dayton, and only \"Commonweal\" magazine bit. Mencken continued to attack Bryan, including in his withering obituary of Bryan, \"In Memoriam: W.J.B.\", in which he charged Bryan with \"insincerity\"\u2014not for his religious beliefs but for the inconsistent and contradictory positions he took on a number of political questions during his career. Years later, Mencken did question whether dismissing Bryan \"as a quack pure and unadulterated\" was \"really just\". Mencken's columns made the Dayton citizens irate and drew general indignation from the Southern press. After Raulston ruled against the admission of scientific testimony, Mencken left Dayton, declaring in his last dispatch \"All that remains of the great cause of the State of Tennessee against the infidel Scopes is the formal business of bumping off the defendant.\" Consequently, the journalist missed Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan on Monday.\nAnticipating that Scopes would be found guilty, the press fitted the defendant for martyrdom and created an onslaught of ridicule, and hosts of cartoonists added their own portrayals to the attack. \"Time\" magazine's initial coverage of the trial focused on Dayton as \"the fantastic cross between a circus and a holy war\". \"Life\" magazine adorned its masthead with monkeys reading books and proclaimed \"the whole matter is something to laugh about.\" Both \"Literary Digest\" and the popular humor magazine \"Life\" (1890\u20131930) ran compilations of jokes and humorous observations garnered from newspapers around the country. \"American Experience\" has published a gallery of such cartoons written about the trial, and 14 such cartoons are also reprinted in L. Sprague de Camp's \"The Great Monkey Trial.\"\nOverwhelmingly, the butt of these jokes was the prosecution and those aligned with it: Bryan, the city of Dayton, the state of Tennessee, and the entire South, as well as fundamentalist Christians and anti-evolutionists. Rare exceptions were found in the Southern press, where the fact that Darrow had saved Leopold and Loeb from the death penalty continued to be a source of ugly humor. The most widespread form of this ridicule was directed at the inhabitants of Tennessee. \"Life\" described Tennessee as \"not up to date in its attitude to such things as evolution\". Attacks on Bryan were also frequent and acidic. \"Life\" awarded him its \"Brass Medal of the Fourth Class\" for having \"successfully demonstrated by the alchemy of ignorance hot air may be transmuted into gold, and that the Bible is infallibly inspired except where it differs with him on the question of wine, women, and wealth\". \"Time\" magazine related Bryan's arrival in town with the disparaging comment \"The populace, Bryan's to a moron, yowled a welcome.\"\nIn addition to the media frenzy, the trial also attracted various individuals looking to capitalize on the spectacle and generate attention. The presence of these opportunistic individuals, seeking to exploit the public interest in the trial for their own gain, further contributed to the circuslike atmosphere. The trial attracted vendors, who sold food, drinks, Bibles, anti-evolution books, stuffed monkeys, and other trial souvenirs. Religious signs were placed through the town, and the courthouse square was also frequented by street preachers and anti-evolution advocates, including evangelist T.T. Martin. Joe Mendi, a trained chimpanzee who had performed in theater and films, was brought to Dayton and performed on the courthouse lawn.\nAftermath and legacy.\nCreation versus evolution debate.\nThe trial revealed a growing chasm in American Christianity and two ways of finding truth, one \"biblical\" and one \"evolutionist\". Author David Goetz writes that the majority of Christians denounced evolution at the time. Adam Shapiro criticized the view that the Scopes trial was an essential and inevitable conflict between religion and science, claiming that such a view was \"self-justifying\". Instead, Shapiro emphasizes the fact that the Scopes trial was the result of particular circumstances, such as politics postponing the adoption of new textbooks.\nHistorian Randall Balmer argues that the Scopes trial and Bryan's death resulted in a decline in the influence of Christian fundamentalists in American politics. While a subculture of evangelical organizations developed over the succeeding decades, conservative Protestants were not mobilized into a distinct voting bloc and were in effect politically inactive. It was not until the rise of the Christian right in the late 1970s that conservative fundamentalists became politically active and powerful again. However, author Mark Edwards contests the conventional view that in the wake of the Scopes trial, a humiliated fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint which is evidenced in the 1955 play \"Inherit the Wind\" (and subsequent 1960 film), which fictionalized the trial, as well as in the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory rather than a defeat, but Bryan's death soon after it created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Bryan, unlike the other leaders, brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist and mainline religious groups which argued in defense of the anti-evolutionist position.\nAnti-evolution movement.\nThe trial escalated the political and legal conflict in which strict creationists and scientists struggled over the teaching of evolution in Arizona and California science classes. Before the Dayton trial only the South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Kentucky legislatures had dealt with anti-evolution laws or riders to educational appropriations bills. After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar anti-evolution laws for their states.\nBy 1927, there were 13 states, both in the North and in the South, that had deliberated over some form of anti-evolution law. At least 41 bills or resolutions were introduced into the state legislatures, with some states facing the issue repeatedly. Nearly all these efforts were rejected, but Mississippi and Arkansas did put anti-evolution laws on the books after the Scopes trial, laws that would outlive the Butler Act, which was repealed in 1967. In 1968, the United States Supreme Court ruled in \"Epperson v. Arkansas\" that laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\nIn the Southwest, anti-evolution crusaders included ministers R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study in the schools or, failing that, to relegate it to the status of unproven hypothesis perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than elsewhere, finally collapsing in the Sputnik era after 1957, when the national mood inspired increased trust for science in general and for evolution in particular during the height of the Cold War.\nThe opponents of evolution made a transition from the anti-evolution crusade of the 1920s to the creation science movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from overtly religious to covertly religious objections to evolutionary theory\u2014sometimes described as a Wedge Strategy\u2014raising what it claimed was scientific evidence in support of a literal interpretation of the Bible. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized pseudoscientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan instead of the South.\nTeaching of science.\nThe Scopes trial had both short and long-term effects in the teaching of science in schools in the United States. Though often portrayed as influencing public opinion against fundamentalism, the victory was not complete. Though the ACLU had taken on the trial as a cause, in the wake of Scopes' conviction they were unable to find more volunteers to take on the Butler law and, by 1932, had given up. The anti-evolutionary legislation was not challenged again until 1965, and in the meantime, William Jennings Bryan's cause was taken up by a number of organizations, including the Bryan Bible League and the Defenders of the Christian Faith.\nThe effects of the Scopes trial on high school biology texts has not been unanimously agreed upon by scholars. Of the most widely used textbooks after the trial, only one included the word \"evolution\" in its index; the relevant page includes biblical quotations. Some scholars have accepted that this was the result of the Scopes trial: for example Hunter, the author of the biology text which Scopes was on trial for teaching, revised the text by 1926 in response to the Scopes trial controversy. However, George Gaylord Simpson challenged this notion as confusing cause and effect, and instead posited that the trend of anti-evolution movements and laws that provoked the Scopes Trial was also to blame for the removal of evolution from biological texts, and that the trial itself had little effect. The fundamentalists' target slowly veered off evolution in the mid-1930s. Miller and Grabiner suggest that as the anti-evolutionist movement died out, biology textbooks began to include the previously removed evolutionary theory. This also corresponds to the emerging demand that science textbooks be written by scientists rather than educators or education specialists.\nThis account of history has also been challenged. In \"Trying Biology\" Robert Shapiro examines many of the eminent biology textbooks in the 1910s and 1920s, and finds that while they may have avoided the word \"evolution\" to placate anti-evolutionists, the overall focus on the subject was not greatly diminished, and the books were still implicitly evolution-based. It has also been suggested that the narrative of evolution being removed from textbooks due to religious pressure, only to be reinstated decades later, was an example of \"Whig history\" propagated by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, and that the shift in the ways biology textbooks discussed evolution can be attributed to other race and class based factors.\nIn 1958, during the height of the Cold War, the National Defense Education Act was passed with the encouragement of many legislators who feared the United States education system was falling behind that of the Soviet Union. The act yielded textbooks, produced in cooperation with the American Institute of Biological Sciences, which stressed the importance of evolution as the unifying principle of biology. The new educational regime was not unchallenged. The greatest backlash was in Texas where attacks were launched in sermons and the press. Complaints were lodged with the State Textbook Commission. However, in addition to federal support, a number of social trends had turned public discussion in favor of evolution. These included increased interest in improving public education, legal precedents separating religion and public education, and continued urbanization in the South. This led to a weakening of the backlash in Texas, as well as to the repeal of the Butler law in Tennessee in 1967.\nIn popular culture.\nStage, film, and television.\nJerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee's 1955 play \"Inherit the Wind\" fictionalizes the Scopes trial as a means of discussing the then-contemporary McCarthy trials. It portrays Darrow and Bryan as characters who are named Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady, respectively. In a note at the opening of the play, the playwrights state that it is not meant to be a historical account, and there are numerous instances where events were substantially altered or invented. Despite the disclaimer in the play's preface that the trial was its \"genesis\" but it is \"not history\", the play has largely been accepted as history by much of the public. (Lawrence and Lee later said that it was written in response to McCarthyism and was chiefly about intellectual freedom.)\nThe play was adapted into a 1960 film directed by Stanley Kramer, with Spencer Tracy as Drummond and Fredric March as Brady. Although there are numerous changes in the plot, they include more of the actual events of the trial, such as when Darrow implied that the court was prejudiced, being cited for contempt of court for his comments, and his subsequent statement of contrition that persuaded the judge to drop the charge. While the film largely received positive reviews from critics, it has been criticized by many residents of Dayton for its historical inaccuracies and depiction of the town's residents as overzealous Christian fundamentalists. There have also been three television adaptations of the play, with Melvyn Douglas and Ed Begley in 1965, Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas in 1988, and Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott in 1999.\nGale Johnson's play \"Inherit the Truth\" (1987), based on the original transcripts of the case, was written as a rebuttal of the 1955 play and the 1960 film. This play was performed yearly during the Dayton Scopes Festival until it ended its run in 2009. In 2007 Bryan College purchased the rights to the production and began work on a student film version of the play, which was screened at that year's Scopes Festival. Peter Goodchild's 1993 play, \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\", was based on original sources and transcripts of the Scopes trial, as it was written with the goal of being historically accurate. It was produced as part of L.A. Theatre Works' Relativity Series, which features science-themed plays and receives major funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. According to \"Audiofile Magazine\", which pronounced this production the 2006 D.J.S. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award: \"Because there are no recordings of the actual trial, this production is certainly the next best thing.\" The BBC broadcast \"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial\" in 2009, is a radio version starring Neil Patrick Harris and Ed Asner.\nThe 1997 \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Lisa the Skeptic\" drew inspiration from the trial, along with the Cardiff Giant and Piltdown Man hoaxes. The 2010 film \"Alleged\", a romantic drama which is set around the Scopes trial, starring Brian Dennehy as Clarence Darrow and Fred Thompson as William Jennings Bryan, was released by Two Shoes Productions. While the main storyline is fictional, all the courtroom scenes are accurate according to the actual trial transcripts. Coincidentally, Dennehy had played Matthew Harrison Brady, the fictionalized counterpart of Bryan, in the 2007 Broadway revival of \"Inherit the Wind\". In 2013, the Comedy Central series \"Drunk History\" retold portions of the trial in the \"Nashville\" episode, with Bradley Whitford portraying Bryan, Jack McBrayer as Darrow, and Derek Waters as Scopes.\nArt.\n\"Gallery: Monkey Trial\" shows cartoons made in reaction to the trial.\nLiterature.\nRonald Kidd's 2006 novel, \"Monkey Town: The Summer of the Scopes Trial\", set in summer 1925, in Dayton, is based on the Scopes Trial.\nIt was not until the 1960s that the Scopes trial began to be mentioned in the history textbooks which were used in American high schools and colleges. Such textbooks usually portrayed it as an example of the conflict between fundamentalists and modernists, and it was frequently mentioned in the sections of those same textbooks which also described the rise of the second iteration of the Ku Klux Klan in the South, which occurred around the same time.\nMusic.\nA series of folk songs were written in reaction to the trial. The most prominent included the comedy song \"Monkey Biz-Ness (Down in Tennessee),\" performed by singer Billy Murray with the International Novelty Orchestra; and country singer Vernon Dalhart's \"The John T. Scopes Trial (The Old Religion\u2019s Better After All)\", which was written by Carson Robison. Other songs included \"Bryan's Last Fight\", \"You Can't Make a Monkey of Me\", \"Monkey Business\", \"Ain't No Bugs On Me\", and \"You Talk Like a Monkey and You Walk Like a Monkey\", which tended to echo a skepticism towards the theory of evolution and the scientific perspective on human origins. Bruce Springsteen performed a song called \"Part Man, Part Monkey\" during his 1988 Tunnel of Love Express Tour, and recorded a version of it in 1990 that was first released as a 1992 B-side and was later released on the 1998 multi-volume \"Tracks\" collection. The song references the Scopes trial (\"They prosecuted some poor sucker in these United States / For teaching that man descended from the apes\") but says that the trial could have been avoided by merely looking at how men behave around women (\"They coulda settled that case without a fuss or fight / If they'd seen me chasing you, sugar, through the jungle last night / They'da called in that jury and a one two three, said / Part man, part monkey, definitely\").\nCommemoration.\nBryan College is a private Christian college in Dayton that was established in 1930 in honor of William Jennings Bryan. Bryan had long expressed a desire for the establishment of a fundamentalist Biblical higher educational institution, and during the trial suggested that such a school be established in Dayton.\nThe Rhea County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1976 for its role in the trial. Between 1977 and 1979 a rehabilitation project was undertaken on the 1891-built courthouse, which had fallen into disrepair. This included restoring the second-floor courtroom to its appearance during the trial and the establishment of the Rhea County Heritage and Scopes Trial Museum, which opened on May 11, 1979. Located in the basement of the courthouse, this museum contains such memorabilia as the microphone used to broadcast the trial, trial records, photographs, and an audiovisual history.\nSince 1988, locals have participated in a play called \"Destiny in Dayton\", a re-enactment of key moments of the trial that takes place in the courtroom during July. This evolved into the larger Scopes Trial Festival in 1989, which includes vendors, craftsmen, and live music. The Tennessee Historical Commission erected a historical marker in front of the courthouse which commemorates the site of the trial. In 2005, a statue of William Jennings Bryan was dedicated on the courthouse lawn, funded by a donation from nearby Bryan College. In 2017, a statue of Clarence Darrow was unveiled near Bryan's statue, funded by a donation from the Freedom From Religion Foundation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOriginal materials from and news coverage of the trial:"}

He worked closely with chancellor Jan Zamoyski. The first years of his reign were focused on establishing power, defeating a fellow claimant to the throne, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and quelling rebellions, most notably, the Gda\u0144sk rebellion. \nHe reigned only a decade, but is considered one of the most successful kings in Polish and Lithuanian history, particularly in the military realm. His signal achievement was his victorious campaign in Livonia against Russia in the middle part of his reign, in which he repulsed a Russian invasion of Commonwealth borderlands and secured a highly favorable treaty of peace (the Peace of Jam Zapolski).\nYouth.\nStephen B\u00e1thory was born on 27 September 1533 in the castle at Somly\u00f3, also known as Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 (today's \u0218imleu Silvaniei). He was the son of Stephen VIII B\u00e1thory (d. 1534) of the noble Hungarian B\u00e1thory family and his wife Catherine Telegdi. He had at least five siblings: two brothers and three sisters.\nLittle is known about his childhood. Around 1549\u20131550, he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553, B\u00e1thory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Z\u00e1polya's supporter, B\u00e1thory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favor at Z\u00e1polya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bekes. B\u00e1thory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Z\u00e1polya.\nAfter Z\u00e1polya's death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected B\u00e1thory Voivode of Transylvania. Bekes, supported by the Habsburgs, disputed his election, but by 1573, B\u00e1thory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania. He subsequently attempted to play the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire against one another in an attempt to strengthen the Transylvania position.\nElected king.\nIn 1572, the throne of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time the largest and one of the most populous states in Europe, was vacated when King Sigismund II Augustus died without heirs. The Sejm was given the power to elect a new king, and in the 1573 Polish\u2013Lithuanian royal election chose Henry of France; Henry soon ascended the French throne and forfeited the Polish-Lithuanian one by returning to France. B\u00e1thory decided to enter into the election; in the meantime he had to defeat another attempt by Bekes to challenge his authority in Transylvania, which he did by defeating Bekes at the Battle of Kerel\u0151szentp\u00e1l.\nOn 12 December 1575, after an interregnum of roughly one and a half years, primate of Poland Jakub Ucha\u0144ski, representing a pro-Habsburg faction, declared Archduke Maximilian III as the new monarch. However, chancellor Jan Zamoyski, Piotr Zborowski and other opponents of Habsburgs argued against a Habsburg king, fearing the political power of a native Polish king. Zborowski in particular supported electing a princely or ducal ruler. Bathory also pledged several bribes, including 200,000 florins and ransoms for Polish captives taken by the Tatars. After a heated discussion, it was decided that Anna Jagiellon, sister of the former King Sigismund II Augustus, should be elected 'king' and marry Stephen B\u00e1thory. In January 1576 B\u00e1thory passed the mantle of voivode of Transylvania to his brother Christopher B\u00e1thory and departed for Poland. On 1 May 1576 B\u00e1thory married Anna and was crowned king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania. After being chosen as king in the 1576 Polish\u2013Lithuanian royal election, B\u00e1thory also began using the title of the prince of Transylvania.\nEstablishing power.\nB\u00e1thory's position was at first extremely difficult, as there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action. At first the representatives of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize B\u00e1thory as a grand duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June, B\u00e1thory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania. On 29 May 1580, a ceremony was held in the Vilnius Cathedral during which bishop Merkelis Giedraitis presented B\u00e1thory a decorated sword and a hat adorned with pearls (both were sanctified by Pope Gregory XIII himself), while this ceremony manifested the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had the meaning of elevation of the new Grand Duke of Lithuania, this way ignoring the stipulations of the Union of Lublin. The B\u00e1thory's ceremony of 29 May 1580 coincided with the nobles of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (e.g. Miko\u0142aj \"the Red\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Eustachy Wo\u0142\u0142owicz, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Konstanty Ostrogski) initial demands before the Union of Lubin to have a separate declaration act of the Grand Duke of Lithuania in Vilnius.\nWith Lithuania secure, the other major region refusing to recognize his election was Prussia. Maximilian's sudden death improved B\u00e1thory's situation, but the city of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) still refused to recognize his election without significant concessions. The Hanseatic League city, bolstered by its immense wealth, fortifications, and the secret support of Maximilian, had supported the Emperor's election and decided not to recognize B\u00e1thory as the legitimate ruler. The resulting conflict was known as the Danzig rebellion. Most armed opposition collapsed when the prolonged Siege of Danzig by B\u00e1thory's forces was lifted as an agreement was reached. The Danzig army was utterly defeated in a field battle on 17 April 1577. However, since B\u00e1thory's armies were unable to take the city by force, a compromise was reached. In exchange for some of Danzig's demands being favorably reviewed, the city recognised B\u00e1thory as ruler of Poland and paid the sum of 200,000 zlotys in gold as compensation. Tying up the administration of the Commonwealth's northern provinces, in February 1578 he acknowledged George Frederick as the ruler of Duchy of Prussia, receiving his feudal tribute.\nPolicies.\nAfter securing control over the Commonwealth, B\u00e1thory had a chance to devote himself to strengthening his authority, in which he was supported by his chancellor Jan Zamoyski, who would soon become one of the king's most trusted advisers. B\u00e1thory reorganised the judiciary by the formation of legal tribunals (the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581). While this somewhat weakened the royal position, it was of little concern to B\u00e1thory, as the loss of power was not significant in the short term, and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne. In exchange, the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military, including the establishment of the \"piechota wybraniecka\", an infantry formation composed of peasants. Many of his projects aimed to modernize the Commonwealth army, reforming it in a model of Hungarian troops of Transylvania. He also founded the Academy of Vilnius, the third university in the Commonwealth, transforming what had been a Jesuit college into a major university. He founded several other Jesuit colleges, and was active in propagating Catholicism, while at the same time being respectful of the Commonwealth policy of religious tolerance, issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews, and denouncing any religious violence.\nIn external relations, B\u00e1thory sought peace through strong alliances. Though remaining distrustful of the Habsburgs, he maintained the tradition of good relations that the Commonwealth enjoyed with its Western neighbor and confirmed past treaties between the Commonwealth and Holy Roman Empire with diplomatic missions received by Maximilian's successor, Rudolf II. The troublesome south-eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579. The Sejm of January 1578 gathered in Warsaw was persuaded to grant B\u00e1thory subsidies for the inevitable war against Muscovy.\nA number of his trusted advisers were Hungarian, and he remained interested in Hungarian politics. In his last years, B\u00e1thory, with Pope Gregory XVIII's approval, made a plan with Antonio Possevino for the liberation of Ottoman Hungary by a well organized (mostly Polish) Christian army, and the creation of a strong and independent Hungarian-Polish union under his rule. However, the unfavorable international situation did not allow him significantly to advance any of his plans in that area. In addition to Hungarian, he was well versed in Latin, and spoke Italian and German; he never learned the Polish language.\nIn his personal life, he was described as rather frugal in his personal expenditures, with hunting and reading as his favorite pastimes.\nWar with Muscovy.\nBefore B\u00e1thory's election to the throne of the Commonwealth, Ivan the Terrible of Russia had begun encroaching on its sphere of interest in the northeast, eventually invading the Commonwealth borderlands in Livonia; the conflict would grow to involve a number of nearby powers (outside Russia and Poland-Lithuania, also Sweden, the Kingdom of Livonia and Denmark-Norway). Each of them was vying for control of Livonia, and the resulting conflict, lasting for several years, became known as the Livonian War. By 1577, Ivan was in control of most of the disputed territory, but his conquest was short-lived. In 1578, Commonwealth forces scored a number of victories in Liviona and began pushing Ivan's forces back; this marked the turning point in the war. B\u00e1thory, together with his chancellor Zamoyski, led the army of the Commonwealth in a series of decisive campaigns taking Polotsk in 1579 and Velikiye Luki in 1580.\nIn 1581, Stephen penetrated once again into Russia and, on 22 August, laid siege to the city of Pskov. While the city held, on 13 December 1581 Ivan the Terrible began negotiations that concluded with the Truce of Jam Zapolski on 15 January 1582. The treaty was favorable to the Commonwealth, as Ivan ceded Polatsk, Veliz and most of the Duchy of Livonia in exchange for regaining Velikiye Luki and Nevel.\nFinal years.\nIn 1584, B\u00e1thory allowed Zamoyski to execute Samuel Zborowski, whose death sentence for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade. This political conflict between B\u00e1thory and the Zborowski family, framed as the clash between the monarch and the nobility, would be a major recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years. In external politics, B\u00e1thory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed due to the lack of support from the Sejm, which refused to pass the requested tax raises.\nB\u00e1thory's health had been declining for several years. He died on 12 December 1586. He had no legitimate children, though contemporary rumours suggested he might have had several illegitimate children. None of these rumours have been confirmed by modern historians. His death was followed by an interregnum of one year. Maximilian II's son, Archduke Maximilian III, was elected king but was contested by the Swedish Sigismund III Vasa, who defeated Maximilian at the Byczyna and succeeded as ruler of the Commonwealth.\nRemembrance.\nB\u00e1thory actively promoted his legend, sponsoring many works about his life and achievements, from historical treatises to poetry. In his lifetime, he was featured in the works of Jan Kochanowski, Miko\u0142aj S\u0119p Szarzy\u0144ski and many others. He became a recurring character in Polish poetry and literature and featured as a central figure in poems, novels and drama by Jakub Jasi\u0144ski, J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Henryk Rzewuski and others. He has been a subject of numerous paintings, both during his life and posthumously. Among the painters who took him as a subject were Jan Matejko and Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski.\nA statue of B\u00e1thory by Giovanni Ferrari was raised in 1789 in Padua, Italy, sponsored by the last monarch of the Commonwealth, Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski. Other monuments to him include one in the \u0141azienki Palace (1795 by Andr\u00e9 Lebrun) and one in Sniatyn (1904, destroyed in 1939). He was a patron of the Vilnius University (the university was named after him from 1919 to 1939) and several units in the Polish Army from 1919 to 1939. His name was borne by two 20th-century passenger ships of the Polish Merchant Navy, the MS Batory and TSS Stefan Batory. In modern Poland, he is the namesake of the Batory Steelmill, a nongovernmental Stefan Batory Foundation, the Polish 9th Armored Cavalry Brigade, and numerous Polish streets and schools. One of the districts of the town of Chorz\u00f3w is named after him.\nImmediately after his death, he was not fondly remembered in the Commonwealth. Many nobles took his behavior in the Zborowski affair and his domestic policies as indicating an interest in curtailing the nobility's Golden Freedoms and establishing an absolute monarchy. His contemporaries were also rankled by his favoritism toward Hungarians over nationals of the Commonwealth. He was also remembered, more trivially, for his Hungarian-style cap and saber (szabla \"bator\u00f3wka\").\nHis later resurgence in Polish memory and historiography can be traced to the 19th-century era of partitions of Poland when the Polish-Lithuanian state lost its independence. He was remembered for his military triumphs and praised as an effective ruler by many, including John Baptist Albertrandi, Jerzy Samuel Bandtkie, Micha\u0142 Bobrzy\u0144ski, J\u00f3zef Szujski and others. Though some historians like Tadeusz Korzon, Joachim Lelewel and J\u0119drzej Moraczewski remained more reserved, in 1887, Wincenty Zakrzewski noted that B\u00e1thory is \"the darling of both the Polish public opinion and Polish historians\". During the interwar period in the Second Polish Republic he was a cult figure, often compared - with the government's approval - to the contemporary dictator of Poland, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. After the Second World War, in the communist People's Republic of Poland, he became more of a controversial figure, with historians more ready to question his internal politics and attachment to Hungary. Nonetheless, his good image remained intact, reinforced by the positive views of a popular Polish historian of that period, Pawe\u0142 Jasienica.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28408", "revid": "1311281536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28408", "title": "Subud", "text": "Spiritual movement\nSubud (pronounced ) is an international and interfaith spiritual movement that originated in Indonesia in the 1920s. It was founded by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (1901\u20131987). The central practice of Subud is a spiritual exercise known as the \"latihan kejiwaan\", which Muhammad Subuh described as receiving guidance from \"the Power of God\" or \"the Great Life Force.\"\nSubuh stated that Subud was neither a new teaching nor a religion. He suggested that, through the latihan, members could be guided towards a religion suited to them, such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism. While adherence to a religion may provide discipline that supports inner development, it is not considered a requirement for participation in Subud or the latihan.\nAs of 2023, Subud has groups in about 83 countries and an estimated worldwide membership of 10,000.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Subud\" is an acronym derived from three Javanese words: \"Susila Budhi Dharma\". These, in turn, originate from Sanskrit terms: \"su\u015b\u012bla\" (good-tempered), buddhi, and dharma.\nThe original Sanskrit terms are generally defined as follows:\nPak Subuh provided different interpretations of these terms:\nHistory.\nAccording to accounts given by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo in talks to Subud members, in 1925 he had an unexpected experience while taking a late-night walk. He described being enveloped in a brilliant light and seeing what appeared to be the sun descending onto his body. Believing he was experiencing a heart attack, he went home, lay down, and prepared to die, surrendering himself to God.\nInstead of dying, he reported that he was moved from within to stand up and perform movements resembling his Muslim prayer routine. He stated that these movements were not initiated by his own will but were guided by what he interpreted as the power of God. Similar experiences reportedly continued for several hours each night over a period of about 1,000 days. During this time he said he slept little but was still able to work full-time, while also receiving what he described as an \"inner teaching\" through which he spontaneously gained understanding of various matters.\nSubuh further stated that as these experiences continued, he developed an intuitive insight into people and situations. Around 1933, he reported that when others were physically near him during the \"latihan\", they began to experience it as well. By his early thirties, his reputation for spiritual insight had spread, and people began coming to him to be \"opened\". Those who were opened could in turn open others, a process that led to the spread of Subud.\nIn Jakarta, Subuh met Husein Rof\u00e9, an English linguist who had been living in Indonesia since 1950. Rof\u00e9, who had been searching for a spiritual path, became the first non-Indonesian to be opened.\nSubud began to expand outside Indonesia when Rof\u00e9 attended a religious congress in Japan in 1954. From there, it spread to Japan, Hong Kong, and Cyprus. In 1957, while based in London, Rof\u00e9 suggested that Subuh visit Britain. Subuh accepted and stayed at the home of John G. Bennett in Coombe Springs. During this period, many followers of George Gurdjieff in the United Kingdom joined Subud, including Bennett himself, although he later left the movement. Over the next 14 months Subuh visited several countries before returning to Indonesia.\nSymbol.\nThe Subud symbol was introduced by Pak Subuh in 1959. It consists of seven concentric circles and seven spokes, which in traditional Javanese mysticism are said to represent seven life forces as well as the Great Life Force that unites them. Each circle becomes wider as it moves outward from the centre, and each spoke narrows as it approaches the centre. The spacing between the circles remains constant.\nThe symbol is commonly printed in black and white when colour printing is not available. When colours are used, the circles and spokes are typically gold, with a dark blue or black background. Other variations include blue on white or white on blue. The World Subud Association has registered both the design and the name \"Subud\" as trade, service, or collective membership marks in multiple countries.\nPractices.\nThe core practice of Subud is the \"latihan kejiwaan\" (literally \"spiritual exercise\" or \"training of the spirit\"), commonly referred to as the \"latihan\". According to Pak Subuh, Subud is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is the symbol of a person who has a calm and peaceful inner feeling and who is able to receive the contact with the Great Holy Life Force. As the spiritual training (\"latihan kedjiwaan\") of Subud is free from the influence of the passions, desires and thinking, and is truly awakened by the Power of Almighty God, the aim of Subud is naturally toward perfection of character according to the Will of the One Who awakens it, namely: Almighty God. It is also necessary to explain that Subud is neither a kind of religion nor a teaching, but is a spiritual experience awakened by the Power of God leading to spiritual reality free from the influence of the passions, desires and thinking.\nThe latihan is not a technique that is learned or practiced in a conventional sense. It is considered unique to each person, and the ability to \"receive\" it is transmitted by being in the presence of another practising member during an \"opening\". About twice a week, members usually gather at local centres to participate in a group latihan, conducted separately for men and women. The practice typically begins after a quiet period, when a \"helper\" signals the start of the exercise.\nParticipants are advised to follow whatever arises spontaneously from within, without expectation, concentration on images, recitation of mantras, or the use of meditation or substances. They are encouraged simply to intend to surrender to God, the divine, or the transcendent\u2014according to their own understanding. Each member is expected to focus only on their own experience, without reference to others in the room. During latihan, practitioners may move, make sounds, walk, dance, laugh, cry, or express themselves in other involuntary ways, while remaining fully conscious and free to stop at any time.\nMembers often describe the latihan as providing what they need in their lives at the time. For some, initial experiences are described as a kind of purification, followed by deeper engagement. Others report feelings of being cleansed, centred, peaceful, or energised. The latihan is sometimes said to continue to influence practitioners throughout daily life, not only during formal practice. Subud literature describes it as a way of deepening one's natural connection with wisdom, the higher self, the divine, or God, depending on personal interpretation.\nAlthough the latihan can be undertaken alone, members are generally encouraged to attend group latihan regularly, ideally twice a week. Once experienced enough to recognise when to end their own session, a member may also practise at home.\nWhile the suggestions of Subud's founder are valued by many members, Subud does not require belief in any doctrine, and the latihan is open to people of all faiths or none. Officially, Subud does not promote a particular teaching about the nature or benefits of the latihan.\nThe Opening.\nThe \"opening\" refers to a person's first experience of the \"latihan\", which is considered the moment when the \"contact\" is first received. It is often described metaphorically as a candle flame lighting another candle, where the flame remains unchanged in quality.\nIn most cases, a person becomes able to participate in the latihan only after undergoing this formal opening process. During the opening, the individual is accompanied by one or more experienced members, known as \"helpers\". The person is asked to stand and relax while the helpers stand nearby. A short statement, sometimes referred to as the \"opening words\", is read by one of the helpers to acknowledge the individual\u2019s wish to receive the contact. The helpers then begin the exercise as usual, and the new participant is regarded as receiving the contact of the \"latihan kejiwaan\" without conscious effort by anyone present.\nTesting.\nTesting is a variation of the \"latihan\" that is directed toward receiving guidance or insight on a particular issue. A question or request for clarification is first acknowledged, and then the exercise is undertaken with openness to that issue. The original term used by Muhammad Subuh was \"terimah\", an Indonesian word meaning \"receiving\". Practitioners who have been engaged in the latihan for some time often report recognising impressions or intuitions from their \"inner feeling\" in response to questions posed.\nThese impressions may take different forms, such as sounds, visions, vibrations, or spontaneous physical movements similar to those experienced in the regular latihan, though sometimes more intense. Such responses are generally described as difficult to interpret through intellectual analysis, and participants acknowledge that guidance can be influenced or obscured by their own mental or emotional attitudes. Testing is usually regarded as a means of clarifying present issues rather than as a form of fortune-telling, although members differ in their views on its reliability. Many Subud members consider testing helpful in addressing personal or organisational matters.\nTesting is commonly used within the World Subud Association in the selection of helpers and, at times, committee members. In his book \"Susila Budhi Dharma\", written in 1952, Subuh referred to such practices as \"feeling\" or \"receiving\". The term \"testing\" was first applied in 1957 by John G. Bennett.\nFasting.\nSome Subud members voluntarily undertake fasting, a practice recommended by Pak Subuh. Each year, some members fast during the Muslim observance of Ramadan, which Subuh, himself a Muslim, suggested could also be appropriate for non-Muslims. Others choose to fast during Lent, or follow a personal or regular fasting practice. Within Subud, fasting is generally regarded by practitioners as spiritually beneficial, although it is not a requirement.\nRules.\nPak Subuh gave advice and guidance in his talks to support members as their practice of the \"latihan\" developed. In general, there are no formal rules governing the latihan. However, non-members may not participate in the exercise until they have undergone the process of \"opening\" and received the contact.\nSubuh intended the latihan to be accessible to people of all cultures, faiths, and ethnicities. Respect for individual diversity and the uniqueness of each practitioner, combined with the relative absence of prescriptive rules, have been noted as features that appeal to many members.\nAssociation.\nMembers who wish to take on organizational responsibilities within Subud may volunteer as committee members or as helpers. These roles can be performed at local, regional, national, and international levels, and members often move between responsibilities as needed.\nThe highest level of organizational responsibility rests with the World Subud Association. The association organizes a World Congress every four years, which includes the Subud World Council, representatives from each national Subud organization, and individual members who choose to participate, although only the representatives have voting rights. The headquarters of the international organization rotates to a different country every four years.\nHelpers.\nAt each level of the association, members known as \"helpers\" assist with coordinating group \"latihan\", witnessing the opening of new members, providing information to those interested in the latihan, addressing questions or issues related to the latihan, and, when needed, supporting isolated or indisposed members. Helpers are typically selected from members willing to perform these duties, usually through a process called testing. Selection does not imply that a helper is more spiritually advanced than other members.\nHelpers exist at local, regional (in some countries), national, and international levels. Their designation primarily reflects the scope of supportive duties they are expected to provide, rather than geographic restrictions. For example, a local helper from London traveling to Jakarta may perform testing or participate in a new member's opening in the same manner as an Indonesian helper.\nThere are normally 18 international helpers\u2014nine men and nine women. Three men and three women are assigned to each of three global areas within Subud:\nInternational helpers serve as members of the World Subud Council on a voluntary basis for a four-year term, coinciding with the interval between World Congresses. There is no formal distinction in rank between local, national, or international helpers, nor between helpers, committee members, or ordinary members. Being a helper is considered a service role rather than a mark of special ability or spiritual achievement.\nIbu Rahayu.\nIbu Siti Rahayu Wiryohudoyo is the eldest daughter of Pak Subuh. In a talk delivered on 5 March 2010 at a National Gathering in Semarang, Indonesia, she explained how she was appointed as \"spiritual advisor\" by the Subud International Congress.\nCommittees.\nMost Subud groups have a committee, typically including a chairperson, vice-chair, treasurer, and secretary. This committee is responsible for arranging a place for group \"latihan\", managing communications, overseeing budgets, and supporting the collective efforts of members at the local level. Similar committee structures exist at regional (in some countries), national, zonal, and international levels.\nAt the international level, the executive body is the International Subud Committee (ISC). The ISC oversees communications, publishing, budgeting, archives, and support for affiliates, and it organizes the World Congress every four years. The ISC chairperson also sits on the World Subud Council.\nFor practical organizational purposes, the Subud association is divided into nine multinational zones:\nEach zone has four representatives who serve as voting members of the World Subud Council. They are selected at Zone Meetings and serve a voluntary four-year term, similar to international helpers.\nThe chairperson of the World Subud Association serves a four-year term from one World Congress to the next and also chairs the World Subud Council. The council is responsible for ensuring that decisions made at the World Congress are implemented.\nAffiliates.\nSubud affiliates, sometimes referred to as \"wings,\" are subsidiary organizations that focus on specific projects at the national or international level. They are legally independent but often have overlapping boards of trustees. These affiliates include:\nSome chairpersons of these affiliates also serve on the World Subud Council for a four-year term.\nIn addition, the Muhammad Subuh Foundation (MSF) has been established to assist Subud groups in acquiring their own \"latihan\" premises.\nMembers have also formed informal networks and interest groups, including a Peace Network, a Spiritual Support Network (originally on Yahoo), and several Facebook groups.\nEnterprises.\nWhen Subud first expanded beyond Indonesia, Pak Subuh focused primarily on the spiritual exercise of the \"latihan\". He later encouraged members to engage in entrepreneurial activities, with the suggestion that a portion of profits could be donated to welfare projects and to support the Subud organization.\nSubuh explained that the effects of the \"latihan\" on the physical body indicate that worship need not be limited to prayer in traditional places of worship. He suggested that ordinary life, when guided by the Power of God, can itself constitute ongoing spiritual practice, creating a dynamic relationship between material and spiritual life. In this context, his encouragement for members to participate in enterprise was intended as a means of putting the principles of the \"latihan\" into practical action.\nMembership.\nMembership in Subud is open to any person aged 17 or older, regardless of their religion or lack of religion. According to Pak Subuh, the \"latihan\" is intended for \"all of mankind.\" Individuals with a serious mental illness are generally not initiated as members.\nThere is typically a waiting period of up to three months before a person may be opened. During this period, the prospective member is expected to meet several times with local helpers to have questions answered and any doubts clarified.\nThere is no formal membership fee; however, most members contribute voluntarily to the costs associated with renting or maintaining premises where group activities are held.\nUpdate.\nSome long-established Subud groups and communities have declined or disbanded. Many longstanding members are aging, and there are relatively few new enquiries or members.\nSeveral factors have been suggested for this trend. Subud has traditionally avoided self-promotion, which may limit its visibility. During the 1950s to 1970s, the movement expanded while a number of books about Subud were available in print, and communities included people of various ages, providing new members with peer networks.\nIn contemporary times, individuals seeking spiritual practices have access to a wide range of options, while Subud remains less visible. The traditional three-month introductory period, which historically served as a test of sincerity, may now act as a deterrent in a faster-paced cultural context. As an organization, Subud tends to be cautious regarding change, presenting challenges for maintaining membership, supporting group properties, covering running costs, and filling committee positions.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The removals of those referred to as \"half-caste\" children were conducted in the period between approximately 1905 and 1967, although in some places mixed-race children were still being taken into the 1970s.\nOfficial government estimates are that in certain regions between one in ten and one in three Indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970.\nThe Bringing Them Home Royal Commission report (1997) described the Australian policies of removing Aboriginal children as genocide.\nEmergence of the child-removal policy.\nNumerous 19th and early 20th century contemporaneous documents indicate that the policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their mothers related to an assumption that the Aboriginal peoples were dying off. Given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, whites assumed that the full-blood tribal Aboriginal population would be unable to sustain itself, and was doomed to extinction. The idea expressed by A. O. Neville, the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race children could be trained to work in white society, and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.\nThe Colony of Victoria was the first to pass acts (1869 and 1886) that allowed for the removal of mixed-race persons from Aboriginal reserves. An 1899 regulation expressly granted permission for the removal of Aboriginal children from their families.\nSome European Australians considered any proliferation of mixed-descent children (labelled \"half-castes\", \"crossbreeds\", \"quadroons\", and \"octoroons\", terms now considered derogatory to Indigenous Australians) to be a threat to the stability of the prevailing culture, or to a perceived racial or cultural \"heritage\". The Northern Territory Chief Protector of Aborigines, Dr. Cecil Cook, argued that \"everything necessary [must be done] to convert the half-caste into a white citizen\".\nNorthern Territory.\nIn the Northern Territory, the segregation of Indigenous Australians of mixed descent from \"full-blood\" Indigenous people began with the government removing children of mixed descent from their communities and placing them in church-run missions, and later creating segregated reserves and compounds to hold all Indigenous Australians. This was a response to public concern over the increase in the number of mixed-descent children and sexual exploitation of young Aboriginal women by non-Indigenous men, as well as fears among non-Indigenous people of being outnumbered by a mixed-descent population.\nUnder the \"Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910\", the Chief Protector of Aborigines was appointed the \"legal guardian of every Aboriginal and every half-caste child up to the age of 18 years\", thus providing the legal basis for enforcing segregation. After the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, under the \"Aboriginals Ordinance 1918\", the Chief Protector was given total control of all Indigenous women regardless of their age, unless married to a man who was \"substantially of European origin\", and his approval was required for any marriage of an Indigenous woman to a non-Indigenous man.\nPolicy in practice.\nThe \"Aboriginal Protection Act 1869\" (Vic) included the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and \"half-caste\" persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially \"at-risk\" girls. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by other states and territories, such as the \"Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897\" (Qld), the \"Aboriginals Ordinance 1918\" (NT), the \"Aborigines Act 1934\" (SA), and the \"1936 Native Administration Act\" (WA).\nAs a result of such legislation, states arranged widespread removal of (primarily) mixed-race children from their Aboriginal mothers. In addition, Aboriginal protectors were appointed in each state who exercised wide-ranging guardianship powers over Aboriginal people up to the age of 16 or 21, often determining where they could live or work. Policemen or other agents of the state (some designated as \"Aboriginal Protection Officers\") were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers, families, and communities into institutions for care. In these Australian states and territories, institutions (both government and missionary) for half-caste children were established in the early decades of the 20th century to care for and to educate the mixed-race children taken from their families, with the goal of assimilation into Anglo-Australian society. Examples of such institutions include Moore River Native Settlement in Western Australia, Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission in Queensland, Ebenezer Mission in Victoria, and Wellington Valley Mission in New South Wales, as well as Catholic missions such as Beagle Bay and Garden Point.\nThe exact number of children removed is unknown. Estimates of numbers have been widely disputed. The \"Bringing Them Home\" report (produced by the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families in 1987), says that \"at least 100,000\" children were removed from their parents. This figure was estimated by multiplying the Aboriginal population in 1994 (303,000), by the report's maximum estimate of \"one in three\" Aboriginal persons separated from their families. The report stated that \"between one in three and one in ten\" children were separated from their families. Given differing populations over a long period of time, different policies at different times in different states (which also resulted in different definitions of target children), and incomplete records, accurate figures are difficult to establish. The academic Robert Manne has stated that the lower-end figure of one in 10 is more likely; he estimates that between 20,000 and 25,000 Aboriginal children were removed over six decades, based on a survey of self-identified Indigenous people by the television station ABS. According to the \"Bringing Them Home\" report:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In certain regions and in certain periods the figure was undoubtedly much greater than one in ten. In that time not one Indigenous family has escaped the effects of forcible removal (confirmed by representatives of the Queensland and WA [Western Australia] Governments in evidence to the Inquiry). Most families have been affected, in one or more generations, by the forcible removal of one or more children.\nThe report closely examined the distinctions between \"forcible removal\", \"removal under threat or duress\", \"official deception\", \"uninformed voluntary release\", and \"voluntary release\". The evidence indicated that in numerous cases, children were brutally and forcibly removed from their parent or parents, possibly even from the hospital shortly after birth, when identified as mixed-race babies. Aboriginal Protection Officers often made the judgement to remove certain children. In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the \"Aborigines Act 1905\" removed the legal guardianship of Aboriginal parents. It made all their children legal wards of the state, so the government did not require parental permission to relocate the mixed-race children to institutions.\nIn 1915, in New South Wales, the \"Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915\" gave the Aborigines' Protection Board authority to remove Aboriginal children \"without having to establish in court that they were neglected.\" At the time, some members of Parliament objected to the NSW amendment; one member stated it enabled the Board to \"steal the child away from its parents.\" At least two members argued that the amendment would result in children being subjected to unpaid labour (at institutions or farms) tantamount to \"slavery\". Writing in the 21st century, Professor Peter Read said that Board members, in recording reasons for removal of children, noted simply \"For being Aboriginal.\"\nIn 1909, the Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, William Garnet South, reportedly \"lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute\". South argued that \"all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected\". His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the \"Aborigines Act (1911).\" This designated his position as the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, not only the so-called \"half-castes\".\nThe \"Bringing Them Home\" report identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children. In other instances, parents were told by government officials that their child or children had died, even though this was not the case. One first-hand account referring to events in 1935 stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was at the post office with my Mum and Auntie [and cousin]. They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about ] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were screaming in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.\nThe report discovered that removed children were, in most cases, placed into institutional facilities operated by religious or charitable organisations. A significant number, particularly females, were \"fostered\" out. Children taken to such institutions were trained to be assimilated to Anglo-Australian culture. Policies included punishment for speaking their local Indigenous languages. The intention was to educate them for a different future and to prevent their being socialised in Aboriginal cultures. The boys were generally trained as agricultural labourers and the girls as domestic servants; these were the chief occupations of many Europeans at the time in the largely rural areas outside cities.\nA common aspect of the removals was the failure by these institutions to keep records of the actual parentage of the child, or such details as the date or place of birth. As is stated in the report:\nthe physical infrastructure of missions, government institutions and children's homes was often very poor and resources were insufficient to improve them or to keep the children adequately clothed, fed and sheltered.\nThe children were taken into care purportedly to protect them from neglect and abuse. However sexual assault and abuse was widespread, with the report finding that among the 502 inquiry witnesses, 17% of female witnesses and 7.7% of male witnesses reported having suffered a sexual assault while in an institution, at work, or while living with a foster or adoptive family. Beyond this, conditions in the institutions were found to be invariably poor, with severe discipline, excessive child labour, poor nutrition, physical and emotional abuse, and poor quality education. Staff were found to be generally unqualified and given complete control and power over the children.\nDocumentary evidence, such as newspaper articles and reports to parliamentary committees, suggest a range of rationales. Apparent motivations included the belief that the Aboriginal people would die out, given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, the belief that they were heathens and were better off in non-indigenous households, and the belief that full-blooded Aboriginal people resented miscegenation and the mixed-race children fathered and abandoned by white men.\nEffects on the removed and their descendants.\nRemoved people.\nThe stated aim of the \"resocialisation\" program was to improve the integration of Aboriginal people into modern [European-Australian] society; however, a 1989 study conducted in Melbourne reported that there was no tangible improvement in the social position of \"removed\" Aboriginal people as compared to \"non-removed\". Particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education, the removed children had about the same results as those who were not removed. In the early decades of the program, post-secondary education was limited for most Australians, but the removed children lagged behind their white contemporaries as educational opportunities improved.\nThe study indicated that removed Aboriginal people were less likely to have completed a secondary education, three times as likely to have acquired a police record, and were twice as likely to use illicit drugs as were Aboriginal people who grew up in their ethnic community. The only notable advantage \"removed\" Aboriginal people achieved was a higher average income. The report noted this was likely due to the increased urbanisation of removed individuals, and greater access to welfare payments than for Aboriginal people living in remote communities. There seemed to be little evidence that removed mixed-race Aboriginal people had been successful in gaining better work even in urbanised areas.\nBy around the age of 18, the children were released from government control. In cases where their files were available, individuals were sometimes allowed to view their own files. According to the testimony of one Aboriginal person:\nI was requested to attend at the Sunshine Welfare Offices, where they formerly (sic) discharged me from State ward ship. It took the Senior Welfare Officer a mere 20 minutes to come clean, and tell me everything that my heart had always wanted to know...that I was of \"Aboriginal descent\", that I had a Natural mother, father, three brothers and a sister, who were alive...He placed in front of me 368 pages of my file, together with letters, photos and birthday cards. He informed me that my surname would change back to my Mother's maiden name of Angus.\nThe \"Bringing Them Home\" report condemned the policy of disconnecting children from their cultural heritage. One witness said to the commission:\nI've got everything that could be reasonably expected: a good home environment, education, stuff like that, but that's all material stuff. It's all the non-material stuff that I didn't have\u2014the lineage... You know, you've just come out of nowhere; there you are.\nIn 2015, many of the recommendations of \"Bringing Them Home\" were yet to be fulfilled. In 2017, 35% of all children in out-of-home care in Australia identify as being Aboriginal, an increase from 20% in 1997 when \"Bringing Them Home\" was published.\nGenerational effects.\nA 2019 study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) found that children living in households with members of the Stolen Generations are more likely \"to experience a range of adverse outcomes\", including poor health, especially mental health, missing school and living in poverty. There are high incidences of anxiety, depression, PTSD and suicide, along with alcohol abuse, among the Stolen Generations, with this resulting in unstable parenting and family situations.\nPublic awareness and recognition.\nHistorian Professor Peter Read, then at the Australian National University, was the first to use the phrase \"stolen generation\". He published a magazine article on the topic with this title, based on his research. He expanded the article into a book, \"The Stolen Generations\" (1981). Widespread awareness of the Stolen Generations, and the practices that created them, grew in the late 1980s through the efforts of Aboriginal and white activists, artists, and (Archie Roach's \"Took the Children Away\" and Midnight Oil's \"The Dead Heart\" being examples of the latter). The \"Mabo v Queensland (No 2)\" case (commonly known as the \"Mabo case\") attracted great media and public attention to itself and to all issues related to the government treatment of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations.\nIn early 1995, Rob Riley, an activist with the Aboriginal Legal Service, published \"Telling Our Story.\" It described the large-scale negative effects of past government policies that resulted in the removal of thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children from their families and their being reared in a variety of conditions in missions, orphanages, reserves, and white foster homes.\nThe Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's \"National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\" commenced in May 1995, presided over by the Commission's president Sir Ronald Wilson and its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Dodson. During the ensuing 17 months, the Inquiry visited every state and Territory in Australia, heard testimony from 535 Aboriginal Australians, and received submissions of evidence from more than 600 more. In April 1997, the Commission released its official \"Bringing Them Home\" report.\nBetween the commissioning of the National Inquiry and the release of the final report in 1997, the government of John Howard had replaced the Paul Keating government. At the Australian Reconciliation Convention in May 1997, Howard was quoted as saying: \"Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies.\"\nFollowing publication of the report, the parliament of the Northern Territory and the state parliaments of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales passed formal apologies to the Aboriginal people affected. On 26 May 1998, the first \"National Sorry Day\" was held; reconciliation events such as the Walk for Reconciliation across Sydney Harbour Bridge and in other cities were held nationally, and attended by a total of more than one million people. As public pressure continued to increase on the government, Howard drafted a Motion of Reconciliation with Senator Aden Ridgeway, expressing \"deep and sincere regret over the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents\", which was passed by the federal parliament in August 1999. Howard said that the Stolen Generation represented \"the most blemished chapter in the history of this country\".\nActivists took the issue of the Stolen Generations to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. At its hearing on this subject in July 2000, the Commission on Human Rights strongly criticised the Howard government for its handling of issues related to the Stolen Generations. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded its discussion of Australia's 12th report on its actions by acknowledging \"the measures taken to facilitate family reunion and to improve counselling and family support services for the victims\", but expressed concern: \nthat the Commonwealth Government does not support a formal national apology and that it considers inappropriate the provision of monetary compensation for those forcibly and unjustifiably separated from their families, on the grounds that such practices were sanctioned by law at the time and were intended to \"assist the people whom they affected\".The Committee recommended \"that the State party consider the need to address appropriately the extraordinary harm inflicted by these racially discriminatory practices.\"\nActivists highlighted the Stolen Generations and related Aboriginal issues during the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. They set up a large \"Aboriginal Tent City\" on the grounds of Sydney University to bring attention to Aboriginal issues in general. Cathy Freeman is an Aboriginal athlete who was chosen to light the Olympic flame and won the gold medal in the 400 metre sprint. In interviews, she said that her own grandmother was a victim of forced removal. The internationally successful rock group Midnight Oil attracted worldwide media interest by performing at the Olympic closing ceremony in black sweatsuits with the word \"SORRY\" emblazoned across them.\nIn 2000, Australian journalist Phillip Knightley summed up the Stolen Generations in these terms:\nThis cannot be over-emphasized\u2014the Australian government literally kidnapped these children from their parents as a matter of policy. White welfare officers, often supported by police, would descend on Aboriginal camps, round up all the children, separate the ones with light-coloured skin, bundle them into trucks and take them away. If their parents protested they were held at bay by police.\nAccording to the archaeologist and writer Josephine Flood, \"The well-meaning but ill-conceived policy of forced assimilation of mixed-race Aborigines is now universally condemned for the trauma and loss of language and culture it brought to the stolen children and their families.\"\nAustralian federal parliament apology.\nOne of the recommendations of the 1997 Bringing Them Home report was for Australian parliaments to offer an official apology. A decade later, on 13 February 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd presented an apology to Indigenous Australians as a motion to be voted on by the house. The apology text was as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I move:\nThat today we honour the Indigenous peoples of this land, the oldest continuing cultures in human history.\nWe reflect on their past mistreatment.\nWe reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were Stolen Generations\u2014this blemished chapter in our nation's history.\nThe time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.\nWe apologise for the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians.\nWe apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country.\nFor the pain, suffering, and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry.\nTo the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry.\nAnd for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry.\nWe the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation.\nFor the future we take heart; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written.\nWe today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians.\nA future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again.\nA future where we harness the determination of all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap that lies between us in life expectancy, educational achievement, and economic opportunity.\nA future where we embrace the possibility of new solutions to enduring problems where old approaches have failed.\nA future based on mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility.\nA future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia.\u2014\u200a\nThe text of the apology did not refer to compensation to Aboriginal people generally or to members of the Stolen Generations specifically. Rudd followed the apology with a 20-minute speech to the house about the need for this action. The government's apology and his speech were widely applauded among both Indigenous Australians and the non-Indigenous general public.\nOpposition leader Brendan Nelson also delivered a 20-minute speech. He endorsed the apology but in his speech Nelson referred to the \"under-policing\" of child welfare in Aboriginal communities, as well as a host of social ills blighting the lives of Aboriginal people. His speech was considered controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands of people who had gathered in public spaces in around Australia to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In Perth, people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a slow clap, with some finally turning their backs.\nThe apology was unanimously adopted by the House of Representatives, although six members of Nelson's opposition caucus left the House in protest at the apology. Later that day, the Senate considered a motion for an identical apology, which was also passed unanimously. Beforehand, the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, attempted to amend the motion to include words committing parliament to offering compensation to those who suffered loss under past Indigenous policies, but was opposed by all the other parties.\nLegal cases and compensation.\nThe states all have redress schemes: first Tasmania (2006), followed by Western Australia (2007), Queensland (2012), South Australia (2015), New South Wales (2017) and Victoria (2022), while a redress scheme for the territories, formerly controlled by the Commonwealth Government, was announced in August 2021.\nFor victims of sexual abuse, there is also National Redress Scheme, set up in the wake of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which started on 1 July 2019 and open for applications until 30 June 2027.\nNew South Wales.\nCompensation claims have been heard by the NSW Supreme Court's Court of Appeal in \"Williams v The Minister Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 and New South Wales\" [2000] NSWCA 255 and the Australian Federal Court in \"Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia\" [2000] FCA 1084. In \"Williams\", an individual (rather than a group of plaintiffs) made claims in negligence arising from having been placed under the control of the Aborigines Welfare Board pursuant to s 7(2) of the \"Aborigines Welfare Act 1909\" shortly after her birth, and was placed by the Board with the United Aborigines Mission at its Aborigines Children Home at Bomaderry near Nowra, NSW. The trial judge found that there was no duty of care and therefore that an action in negligence could not succeed. This was upheld by the NSW Court of Appeal in 2000.\nIn relation to whether the action in NSW courts was limited by the passage of time, the Court of Appeal, reversing Studert J, extended the limitation period for the non-equitable claims by about three decades pursuant to s 60G of the \"Limitation Act 1969\" (\"Williams v Minister\", \"Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983\" (1994) 35 NSWLR 497).\nAustralian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's 2008 Apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples was not expected to have any legal effect on claims for compensation in NSW.\nNew South Wales set up a scheme running from 1 July 2017 until 30 June 2022, enabling survivors to claim A$ compensation. Its funding also allows for a healing fund, allocating grants to healing centres, memorials and keeping places, as well as a separate fund to help fund Stolen Generations members' funerals. There were estimated to be between 700 and 1,300 survivors in NSW in 2017.\nQueensland.\nQueensland has the \"Redress Scheme\" that provides compensation payments ranging from $7000 to $40,000 to people who experienced abuse and neglect as children in Queensland institutions (Government of Queensland 2012). The scheme is not exclusive for Indigenous peoples but is for anyone who experienced abuse as a child whilst in state care.\nSouth Australia.\nIn June 1998, Bruce Trevorrow, a Ngarrindjeri man, sued the South Australian Government for pain and suffering suffered as a result of his being removed from his parents when he was a baby. \nOn 1 August 2007, aged 50, Trevorrow became the first member of the Stolen Generations to be awarded compensation by a court of law, when it awarded him A$. The SA government appealed in February 2008, but lost their appeal in March 2010, but Trevorrow had died only a few months after they lodged the appeal.\nThe South Australian reparations scheme was set up in November 2015, after a 2013 parliamentary committee reported that such a fund would be cheaper than fighting legal claims. The fund allows for around 300 eligible people to receive up to A$ each. A A$ Individual Reparations Scheme provided ex-gratia payments to Aboriginal people who were eligible for reparations, and in 2018, a payment of A$ was made to eligible applicants, with an additional A$ to follow. After the total fund of A$ was underspent, the Community Reparations Fund was established to support projects that would promote healing for the Stolen Generations, their families and the wider community.\nTasmania.\nIn October 2006, the Tasmanian Government allocated a package of A$ to fund various reconciliation measures, including compensation for affected people, or their descendants if no longer living, under the \"Stolen Generation of Aboriginal Children Act 2006\". In a first for the country, 106 people were found to qualify for the payments.\nVictoria.\nOn 3 March 2022, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced a reparations package worth A$. Aboriginal Victorians who were removed before 1977 are able to access payments of A$ each. Each person deemed eligible will also receive a personal apology from the Victorian Government and access to healing programs. It is thought that around 12000 people will be eligible to access the payments and programs. The reparations package was raised as a key issue at the first meeting of the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria in 2020, and Andrews acknowledged that it was long overdue. Applications open on 31 March 2022.\nWestern Australia.\nWestern Australia has a redress scheme that is not exclusive for Indigenous peoples but is for anyone who experienced abuse as a child whilst in state care.\nTerritories.\n21st century.\nA compensation fund worth A$ was announced by the federal government on 6 August 2021, to be used to award one-off payments of A$ in recognition of the harm suffered as well as A$ to pay for counselling, for survivors of the Stolen Generations in the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory.\nA class action on behalf of around 1700 deceased estates and family members was launched in the Northern Territory in 2021. In August 2022 the Commonwealth agreed to pay compensation of over A$50 million to the claimants, pending formal approval from the New South Wales Supreme Court.\nHistorical debate.\nUse of the word \"stolen\".\nThe word \"stolen\" is used here to refer to the Aboriginal children having been taken away from their families. It has been in use for this since the early 20th century. For instance, Patrick McGarry, a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, objected to the \"Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915\" which authorised the Aborigines' Protection Board to remove Aboriginal children from their parents without having to establish cause. McGarry described the policy as \"steal[ing] the child away from its parents\".\nIn 1924, the \"Adelaide\" \"Sun\" wrote: \"The word 'stole' may sound a bit far-fetched but by the time we have told the story of the heart-broken Aboriginal mother we are sure the word will not be considered out of place.\"\nIn most jurisdictions, Indigenous Australians were put under the authority of a Protector, effectively being made wards of the State. The protection was done through each jurisdiction's Aboriginal Protection Board; in Victoria and Western Australia these boards were also responsible for applying what were known as \"Half-Caste Acts\".\nMore recent usage has developed since Peter Read's publication of \"The Stolen Generations: The Removal of Aboriginal Children in New South Wales 1883 to 1969\" (1981), which examined the history of these government actions. The 1997 publication of the government's \"Bringing Them Home\u00a0\u2013 Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\" heightened awareness of the Stolen Generations. The acceptance of the term in Australia is illustrated by the 2008 formal apology to the Stolen Generations, led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and passed by both houses of the Parliament of Australia. Previous apologies had been offered by State and Territory governments in the period 1997\u20132001.\nSome have objected to the use of the term \"Stolen Generations\". Former Prime Minister John Howard did not believe the government should apologise to the Australian Aboriginal peoples. Then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs John Herron disputed usage of the term in April 2000. Others who disputed the use of the term include Peter Howson, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1971 to 1972, and Keith Windschuttle, an historian who argues that some of the abuses towards Australian Aboriginal peoples have been exaggerated and in some cases invented. Many historians argue against these denials, including to Windschuttle in particular. Anthropologist Ron Brunton also criticised the proceedings on the basis that there was no cross-examination of those giving their testimonies or critical examination of the factual basis of the testimony.\nThe \"Bringing Them Home\" report provided extensive details about the removal programs and their effects. Sir Ronald Wilson, former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, stated that \"when it comes to the credibility of those stories, there is ample credibility, not from the cross-examination of the children themselves, but from the governments whose laws, practices and policies enabled these forced removals to take place. We had the support of every State government; they came to the Inquiry, came with lever-arch files setting out the laws from the earliest days right up to the end of the assimilation policy, that is up to the 1970s and more importantly, senior government officers attended. In every case, these senior officers acknowledged that there was a lot of cruelty in the application of those laws and policies.\"\nIn April 2000, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron tabled a report in the Australian Parliament in response to the Human Rights Commission report which stated that, as \"only 10% of Aboriginal children\" had been removed, they did not constitute an entire \"generation\". The report attracted media attention and protests. Herron apologised for the \"understandable offence taken by some people\" as a result of his comments, although he refused to alter the report as it had been tabled.\nHistorian Peter Read referred to the children affected as the \"Stolen Generations\". Another historian, Robert Manne, defended that terminology, making the analogy that other people refer to the \"generation that lost their lives in the First World War\" without meaning over 50 per cent of the young people at the time; rather, people use that phrasing as a metaphor for a collective experience. Similarly, he believes, some of the Aboriginal community use the term to describe their collective suffering.\nGenocide debate.\nThere is ongoing contention among politicians, commentators, and historical, political, and legal experts as to whether the forced removals of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children that occurred during the Stolen Generations can be accurately described as genocidal acts, and particularly whether they meet the definition of genocide in article II (e) of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. While it is generally not disputed that these forced removals occurred, the contention surrounds whether they were enacted with the intention of destroying the Indigenous people of Australia. There is further contention as to whether those responsible for the Stolen Generations should be criminally liable for genocide. In response to a submission by the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Commissioner Johnston considered whether the policies and practices of the Australian Governments pertinent to the Stolen Generations constituted a breach of the Convention but concluded that \"[i]t is not my function to interpret the Convention or to decide whether it has been breached, particularly since the policies involved were modified in 1962 somewhat and abandoned by 1970\". The \"Bringing Them Home\" report concluded that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Australian practice of Indigenous child removal involved both systematic racial discrimination and genocide as defined by international law. Yet it continued to be practised as official policy long after being clearly prohibited by treaties to which Australia had voluntarily subscribed.\nHowever, in the subsequent case of \"Kruger v Commonwealth\", the High Court judges rejected the claim of the plaintiffs that the \"Aboriginals Ordinance 1918\" authorised genocide as defined by the Convention and ruled that there was no legislation to implement the Convention under Australian municipal law at the time. One of the recommendations of the \"Bringing Them Home\" report was that 'the Commonwealth legislate to implement the Genocide Convention with full domestic effect'. While genocide has been a crime under international law since the commencement of the Convention in 1951, in accordance with Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution, it has only been a crime under Australian law since the commencement of the \"International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002\", and so the Stolen Generations cannot be considered genocide under Australian law because the Act is not retrospective. In its twelfth report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Australian Government argued that the removal policies and programs did not constitute a breach of the Convention.\nIn 1997, Sir Ronald Wilson, then President of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, commissioner of the \"National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\", and co-author of the \"Bringing Them Home\" report, argued that the policies resulting in the Stolen Generations constitute attempted genocide: he stated, \"It clearly was attempted genocide. It was believed that the Aboriginal people would die out.\"\nManne argues that the expressed views of government bureaucrats, such as A. O. Neville, to assimilate the mixed-race children into the white population by means of \"breeding out the colour\", and therefore eventually resulting in the full-bloods being \"forgotten\", bore strong similarities to the racial views of the Nazis in 1930s Nazi Germany. Manne points out that, though the term \"genocide\" had not yet entered the English language, the policies of Neville and others were termed by some contemporaries as the \"die out\" or \"breed out\" policy, giving an indication of their proposed intent. He also states that academics \"generally acknowledge\" that the authors of the \"Bringing Them Home\" report were wrong to argue that Australian authorities had committed genocide by removing indigenous children from their families. Social assimilation has never been regarded in law as equivalent to genocide.\nThough genocide historian Paul Bartrop rejects the use of the word genocide to describe Australian colonial history in general, he does believe that it applies to describing the Stolen Generations. Bartrop and US genocide scholar Samuel Totten together wrote the \"Dictionary of Genocide\", for which Bartrop wrote the entry on Australia. He said he used as the benchmark for usage of the term genocide the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which is also cited in the \"Bringing Them Home\" report.\nIn 2006, Australian historian Patrick Wolfe wrote:To take an example from genocide's definitional core, Article II (d) of the UN Convention on Genocide, which seems to have been relatively overlooked in Australian discussions, includes among the acts that constitute genocide (assuming they are committed with intent to destroy a target group in whole or in part) the imposition of \"measures intended to prevent births within the group.\" Given that the Australian practice of abducting Aboriginal children, assuming its \"success\", would bring about a situation in which second-generation offspring were born into a group that was different from the one from which the child/parent had originally been abducted, there is abundant evidence of genocide being practised in post-war Australia on the basis of Article II (d) alone.In 2008, Australian historian Inga Clendinnen suggested that the term genocide rests on the \"question of intentionality\", saying: \"There's not much doubt, with great murderous performances that were typically called genocide, that they were deliberate and intentional. Beyond that, it always gets very murky.\"\nTrauma and healing.\nTrauma suffered as a result of children being separated from their families and forced to adopt a culture foreign to them is ongoing and passed down through generations.\nThe Healing Foundation is a government-funded body established on 30 October 2009 as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Healing Foundation was established after several months of consultation with community representatives. The head office is in Canberra, with branches in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin and on the Torres Strait Islands. As of 2020[ [update]] the Foundation had provided funding for more than 175 community organisations to develop and run healing projects, \"to address the ongoing trauma caused by actions like the forced removal of children from their families\". It also conducts research into Indigenous healing.\nThe Marumali Program was designed and established by Stolen Generations survivor Lorraine Peeters, starting with her presentation of the model she had created, the \"Marumali Journey of Healing Model\", to a conference of mental health professionals at a conference in Sydney in 1999. Her body of work was copyrighted and subsequently circulated to and used by many organisations to help survivors to heal from specific types of trauma suffered as a result of the removals. Peeters then developed the Marumali Program to train Indigenous counsellors to use her model. As of June 2020[ [update]], she and her daughter continue to give workshops, both in the community and in prisons. \"Marumali\" is a Gamilaroi word meaning \"to put back together\", and she says it relates to the ultimate goal of reconnecting with what has been lost. She continues to advise the Healing Foundation.\n\"White stolen generations\".\nDuring the same period from the 1930s to 1982, 250,000 Australian-born non-Indigenous children were also removed from parents who were deemed \"unfit\", and forcibly adopted. The term \"white stolen generations\" has been used by survivors of this practice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "28413", "revid": "11692354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28413", "title": "Septimius Severus", "text": "Roman emperor from 193 to 211\nLucius Septimius Severus (; ; 11 April 145 \u2013 4 February 211) was Roman emperor from 193 to 211. He was born in Leptis Magna, Libya in the Roman province of Africa. As a young man he advanced through the customary succession of offices under the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Severus was the final contender to seize power after the death of the emperor Pertinax in 193 during the Year of the Five Emperors.\nAfter deposing and killing the incumbent emperor Didius Julianus, Severus fought his rival claimants, the Roman generals Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. Niger was defeated in 194 at the Battle of Issus in Cilicia. Later that year Severus waged a short punitive campaign beyond the eastern frontier, annexing the Kingdom of Osroene as a new province. Severus defeated Albinus three years later at the Battle of Lugdunum in Gaul. Following the consolidation of his rule over the western provinces, Severus waged another brief, more successful war in the east against the Parthian Empire, sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 197 and expanding the eastern frontier to the Tigris. He then enlarged and fortified the \"Limes Arabicus\" in Arabia Petraea. In 202, he campaigned in Africa and Mauretania against the Garamantes, capturing their capital Garama, and expanding the \"Limes Tripolitanus\" along the southern desert frontier of the empire.\nWith his second wife, Julia Domna, Severus had two sons; the elder, Caracalla, was proclaimed \"Augustus\", or co-emperor, in 198, and the younger, Geta, in 209. Severus travelled to Britain in 208, strengthening Hadrian's Wall and reoccupying the Antonine Wall. In 209, he invaded Caledonia (modern Scotland) with an army of 50,000 men but his ambitions were cut short when he died of an infectious disease in early 211 at Eboracum (modern York). His sons, advised by Julia Domna, succeeded him, thus founding the Severan dynasty. It was the last dynasty of the Roman Empire before the Crisis of the Third Century.\nEarly life.\nFamily and education.\nBorn on 11 April 145 at Leptis Magna (in present-day Libya) as the son of Publius Septimius Geta and Fulvia Pia, Septimius Severus came from a wealthy and distinguished family of equestrian rank. On his mother's side, he descended from the Italian Fulvii's and on his father side, Publius Septimius Geta, hailed from a family of Punic origin. He was described as \"Libyan by race\", by the Roman historian and senator Cassius Dio. Due to his family background he is considered the first provincial emperor, as he was the first emperor not only born in the provinces but also into a provincial family of non-Italian origin. Severus's father, an obscure provincial, held no major political status, but he had two cousins, Publius Septimius Aper and Gaius Septimius Severus, who served as consuls under the emperor Antoninus Pius r.\u2009138\u00a0\u2013\u00a0161. His mother's ancestors had moved from Italy to North Africa; they belonged to the \"gens\" Fulvia, an Italian patrician family that originated in Tusculum.\nSeptimius Severus had two siblings: an elder brother, Publius Septimius Geta; and a younger sister, Septimia Octavilla. Severus's maternal cousin was the praetorian prefect and consul Gaius Fulvius Plautianus. Septimius Severus grew up in Leptis Magna and was a native Punic speaker, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus's education but, according to Cassius Dio, the boy had been eager for more education than he actually received. Presumably, Severus received lessons in oratory: at the age of 17, he gave his first public speech.\nPublic service.\nSeverus sought a public career in Rome in around 162. At the recommendation of his relative Gaius Septimius Severus, the emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.\u2009161\u00a0\u2013\u00a0180) granted him entry into the senatorial ranks. Membership in the senatorial order was a prerequisite to attain positions within the \"cursus honorum\" and to gain entry into the Roman Senate. Nevertheless, it appears that Severus's career during the 160s met with some difficulties.\nIt is likely that he served as a \"vigintivir\" in Rome, overseeing road maintenance in or near the city, and he may have appeared in court as an advocate. At the time of Marcus Aurelius, he was the State Attorney (\"Advocatus fisci\"). However, he omitted the military tribunate from the \"cursus honorum\" and had to delay his quaestorship until he had reached the required minimum age of 25. To make matters worse, the Antonine Plague swept through the capital in 166.\nWith his career at a halt, Severus decided to temporarily return to Leptis, where the climate was healthier. According to the \"Historia Augusta\", a usually unreliable source, he was prosecuted for adultery during this time but the case was ultimately dismissed. At the end of 169, Severus was of the required age to become a quaestor and journeyed back to Rome. On 5December, he took office and was officially enrolled in the Roman Senate. Between 170 and 180 his activities went largely unrecorded, in spite of the fact that he occupied an impressive number of posts in quick succession. The Antonine Plague had thinned the senatorial ranks and, with capable men now in short supply, Severus's career advanced more steadily than it otherwise might have.\nThe sudden death of his father necessitated another return to Leptis Magna to settle family affairs. Before he was able to leave Africa, Mauri tribesmen invaded southern Spain. Control of the province was handed over to the emperor, while the Senate gained temporary control of Sardinia as compensation. Thus, Septimius Severus spent the remainder of his second term as quaestor on the island of Sardinia.\nIn 173, Severus's cousin Gaius Septimius Severus was appointed proconsul of the province of Africa Proconsularis and chose Severus as one of his two \"legati pro praetore\", a senior military appointment. Following the end of this term, Septimius Severus returned to Rome, taking up office as tribune of the plebs, a senior legislative position, with the distinction of being the \"candidatus\" of the emperor.\nMarriages.\nAbout 175, Septimius Severus, in his early thirties at the time, contracted his first marriage, to Paccia Marciana, a woman from Leptis Magna. He probably met her during his tenure as legate under his uncle. Marciana's name suggests Punic or Libyan origin, but nothing else is known of her. Septimius Severus does not mention her in his autobiography, though he commemorated her with statues when he became emperor. The unreliable \"Historia Augusta\" claims that Marciana and Severus had two daughters, but no other attestation of them has survived. It appears that the marriage produced no surviving children, despite lasting for more than ten years.\nMarciana died of natural causes around 186. Septimius Severus, now in his forties, childless and eager to remarry, began enquiring into the horoscopes of prospective brides. The \"Historia Augusta\" relates that he heard of a woman in Syria of whom it had been foretold that she would marry a king, and so Severus sought her as his wife. This woman was an Emesene Syrian named Julia Domna. Her father, Julius Bassianus, descended from the Arab Emesene dynasty and served as a high priest to the local cult of the sun god Elagabal. Domna's older sister, Julia Maesa, would become the grandmother of the future emperors Elagabalus and Alexander Severus.\nBassianus accepted Severus's marriage proposal in early 187, and in the summer the couple married in Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France), of which Severus was the governor. The marriage proved happy, and Severus cherished Julia and her political opinions. Julia built \"the most splendid reputation\" by applying herself to letters and philosophy. They had two sons, Lucius Septimius Bassianus (later nicknamed Caracalla, born 4April 188 in Lugdunum) and Publius Septimius Geta (born 7March 189 in Rome).\nRise to power.\nIn 191, on the advice of Quintus Aemilius Laetus, prefect of the Praetorian Guard, emperor Commodus appointed Severus as governor of Pannonia Superior. At around this time he is described by the classicist Kyle Harper as being \"a middling senator of modest physical stature and unexceptional accomplishment\". Commodus was assassinated the following year. Pertinax was acclaimed emperor, but he was then killed by the Praetorian Guard in early 193. In response to the murder of Pertinax, Severus's legion \"XIV Gemina\" acclaimed him emperor at Carnuntum on 9 April. Nearby legions, such as \"X Gemina\" at Vindobona, soon followed suit. Having assembled an army, Severus hurried to Italy.\nPertinax's successor in Rome, Didius Julianus, had bought the emperorship in an auction. Julianus was condemned to death by the Senate and killed. Severus took possession of Rome without opposition. He executed Pertinax's murderers and dismissed the rest of the Praetorian Guard, filling its ranks with loyal troops from his own legions.\nThe legions of Syria had proclaimed Pescennius Niger emperor. At the same time Severus felt it reasonable to offer Clodius Albinus, the powerful governor of Britannia, who had probably supported Didius against him, the rank of Caesar, which implied some claim to the succession. With his rear safe, he moved to the East and crushed Niger's forces at the Battle of Issus (194).\nWhile campaigning against Byzantium, he ordered that the tomb of his fellow-Carthaginian Hannibal be covered with fine marble.\nHe devoted the following year to suppressing Mesopotamia and other Parthian vassals who had backed Niger. Afterwards, Severus declared his son Caracalla as his successor, which caused Albinus to be hailed emperor by his troops and to invade Gaul. After a short stay in Rome, Severus moved north to meet him. On 19February 197 at the Battle of Lugdunum, with an army of about 75,000 men, mostly composed of Pannonian, Moesian and Dacian legions and a large number of auxiliaries, Severus defeated and killed Clodius Albinus, securing his full control over the empire.\nUpon returning to Rome, Septimus had 29 senators executed for treason over their support of Albinus, despite having previously taken an oath promising not to put any senators to death (a customary oath for emperors).\nEmperor.\nWar against Parthia.\nIn early 197 Severus left Rome and sailed to the east. He embarked at Brundisium and probably landed at the port of Aegeae in Cilicia, travelling on to Syria by land. He immediately gathered his army and crossed the Euphrates. Abgar IX, titular King of Osroene but essentially only the ruler of Edessa since the annexation of his kingdom as a Roman province, handed over his children as hostages and assisted Severus's expedition by providing archers. King Khosrov I of Armenia also sent hostages, money and gifts.\nSeverus travelled on to Nisibis, which his general Julius Laetus had prevented from falling into Parthian hands. Afterwards Severus returned to Syria to plan a more ambitious campaign. The following year he led another, more successful campaign against the Parthian Empire, reportedly in retaliation for the support it had given to Pescennius Niger. His legions sacked the Parthian royal city of Ctesiphon and he annexed the northern half of Mesopotamia to the empire; Severus took the title \"\", following the example of Trajan. However, he was unable to capture the fortress of Hatra, even after two lengthy sieges\u2014just like Trajan, who had tried nearly a century before. During his time in the east, though, Severus also expanded the \"Limes Arabicus\", building new fortifications in the Arabian Desert from Basie to Dumatha.\nRelations with the Senate and People.\nSeverus's relations with the Senate were never good. He was unpopular with them from the outset, having seized power with the help of the military, and he returned the sentiment. Severus ordered the execution of a large number of Senators on charges of corruption or conspiracy against him and replaced them with his favorites. Although his actions turned Rome more into a military monarchy, he was popular with the citizens of Rome, having stamped out the rampant corruption of Commodus' reign. When he returned from his victory over the Parthians, he erected the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome.\nAccording to Cassius Dio, however, after 197 Severus fell heavily under the influence of his Praetorian prefect, Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, who came to have almost total control of the imperial administration. At the same time, a bloody power crisis erupted between Plautianus and Julia Domna, Severus's influential and powerful wife, which had a relatively destructive effect on the centre of power. Plautianus' daughter Fulvia Plautilla was married to Severus's son Caracalla. Plautianus' excessive power came to an end in 204, when he was denounced by the emperor's dying brother. In January 205 Julia Domna and Caracalla accused Plautianus of plotting to kill him and Severus. The powerful prefect was executed while he was trying to defend his case in front of the two emperors. One of the two following \"praefecti\" was the famous jurist Papinian. Executions of senators did not stop: Cassius Dio records that many of them were put to death, some after being formally tried. After the assassination of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus in the rest of his reign, he relied more on the advice of his clever and educated wife, Julia Domna, in the administration of the empire.\nMilitary reforms.\nUpon his arrival at Rome in 193, Severus discharged the Praetorian Guard, which had murdered Pertinax and had then auctioned the Roman Empire to Didius Julianus. Its members were stripped of their ceremonial armour and forbidden to come within of the city on pain of death. Severus replaced the old guard with 10 new cohorts recruited from veterans of his Danubian legions.\nAround 197 he increased the number of legions from 30 to 33, with the introduction of the three new legions: I, II and III \"Parthica\". He garrisoned Legio II Parthica at Albanum, only from Rome. He gave his soldiers a donative of a thousand \"sesterces\" (250 \"denarii\") each, and raised the annual wage for a soldier in the legions from 300 to 400 \"denarii\".\nSeverus was the first Roman emperor to station some of the imperial army in Italy. He realized that Rome needed a military central reserve with the capability to be sent anywhere.\nPersecution of Christians.\nAt the beginning of Severus's reign, Trajan's policy toward the Christians was still in force. That is, Christians were only to be punished if they refused to worship the emperor and the gods, but they were not to be sought out. Therefore, persecution was inconsistent, local and sporadic. Faced with internal dissidence and external threats, Severus felt the need to promote religious harmony by promoting syncretism. He possibly issued an edict that punished conversion to Judaism and Christianity.\nA number of persecutions of Christians occurred in the Roman Empire during his reign and were traditionally attributed to Severus by the early Christian community. A decree by Severus against the Christians is mentioned in the \"Historia Augusta\", an unreliable mix of fact and fiction. Early church historian Eusebius described Severus as a persecutor. However, the Christian apologist Tertullian stated that Severus was well disposed towards Christians, employed a Christian as his personal physician and had personally intervened to save several high-born Christians known to him from the mob. Some scholars think that Eusebius' description of Severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign, including those known in the \"Roman Martyrology\" as the martyrs of Madauros, Charalambos and Perpetua and Felicity in Roman-ruled Africa. These were probably the result of local persecutions rather than empire-wide actions or decrees by Severus.\nMilitary activity in Africa.\nIn late 202 Severus launched a campaign in the province of Africa. The \"legatus legionis\" or commander of Legio III Augusta, Quintus Anicius Faustus, had been fighting against the Garamantes along the \"Limes Tripolitanus\" for five years. He captured several settlements such as Cydamus, Gholaia, Garbia and their capital Garama\u2014over south of Leptis Magna. The province of Numidia was also enlarged: the empire annexed the settlements of Vescera, Castellum Dimmidi, Gemellae, Thabudeos and Thubunae. By 203 the entire southern frontier of Roman Africa had been dramatically expanded and re-fortified. Desert nomads could no longer safely raid the region's interior and escape back into the Sahara.\nBritain.\nIn 208 Severus travelled to Britain with the intention of conquering Caledonia. Modern archaeological discoveries illuminate the scope and direction of his northern campaign. Severus probably arrived in Britain with an army of over 40,000, considering some of the camps constructed during his campaign could house this number.\nHe strengthened Hadrian's Wall and reconquered the Southern Uplands up to the Antonine Wall, which was also enhanced. Supported and supplied by a strong naval force, Severus then thrust north with his army across the wall into Caledonian territory. Retracing the steps of Agricola of over a century before, Severus rebuilt and garrisoned many abandoned Roman forts along the east coast, such as Carpow.\nCassius Dio's account of the invasion reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Severus, accordingly, desiring to subjugate the whole of it, invaded Caledonia. But as he advanced through the country he experienced countless hardships in cutting down the forests, levelling the heights, filling up the swamps, and bridging the rivers; but he fought no battle and beheld no enemy in battle array. The enemy purposely put sheep and cattle in front of the soldiers for them to seize, in order that they might be lured on still further until they were worn out; for in fact, the water caused great suffering to the Romans, and when they became scattered, they would be attacked. Then, unable to walk, they would be slain by their own men, in order to avoid capture, so that a full fifty thousand died. But Severus did not desist until he approached the extremity of the island. Here he observed most accurately the variation of the sun's motion and the length of the days and the nights in summer and winter, respectively. Having thus been conveyed through practically the whole of the hostile country (for he actually was conveyed in a covered litter most of the way, on account of his infirmity), he returned to the friendly portion, after he had forced the Britons to come to terms, on the condition that they should abandon a large part of their territory.\nBy 210 Severus' campaigning had made significant gains, despite Caledonian guerrilla tactics and purportedly heavy Roman casualties. The Caledonians sued for peace, which Severus granted on condition they relinquish control of the Central Lowlands (of what is now Scotland) as evidenced by the extensive Severan-era fortifications there. The Caledonians, short on supplies and feeling that their position was desperate, revolted later that year with the Maeatae. Severus prepared for another protracted campaign within Caledonia. He was now intent on exterminating the Caledonians, telling his soldiers: \"Let no-one escape sheer destruction, no-one our hands, not even the babe in the womb of the mother, if it be male; let it nevertheless not escape sheer destruction.\"\nDeath.\nSeverus's campaign was cut short when he fell ill. He withdrew to Eboracum (modern York, England) and died there in 211. Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again. Shortly after this, the frontier was permanently withdrawn south to Hadrian's Wall.Severus was cremated in York. Cassius Dio describes his funeral in 'The Epitome of Book 77':\n'After this his body, arrayed in military garb, was placed upon a pyre, and as a mark of honour the soldiers and his sons ran about it; and as for the soldiers' gifts, those who had things at hand to offer as gifts threw them upon it, and his sons applied the fire. 4 Afterwards his bones were put in an urn of purple stone, carried to Rome, and deposited in the tomb of the Antonines. It is said that Severus sent for the urn shortly before his death, and after feeling of it, remarked: \"Thou shalt hold a man that the world could not hold.\"\nDIo doesn't describe the location of Severus's cremation but antiquarians, such as Francis Drake, pinpoint a location to Severus Hill, a hill located in Holgate. The only evidence of Romans on the hill is a roman road, but no other archaeological investigations have corroborated these claims there.\nSeverus is famously said to have given the advice to his sons: \"Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, scorn all others\" before he died on 4 February 211. On his death, Severus was deified by the Senate and succeeded by his sons, Caracalla and Geta, who were advised by his wife Julia Domna. Severus was buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.\nAssessment and legacy.\nBy the close of his reign the Roman Empire reached an extent of over million square kilometres, which scholars like David L. Kennedy, Lukas De Blois, and Derrick Riley state expanded the empire to its greatest physical extent.\nEdward Gibbon famously levelled a harsh indictment of Septimius Severus as a principal agent in the empire's decline. \"The contemporaries of Severus, in the enjoyment of the peace and glory of his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been introduced. Posterity, who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims and example, justly considered him as the principal author of the decline of the Roman empire.\" According to Gibbon, \"his daring ambition [...] was never diverted from its steady course by the allurements of pleasure, the apprehension of danger, or the feelings of humanity.\" His enlargement of the Limes Tripolitanus secured Africa, the agricultural base of the empire where he was born. His victory over the Parthian Empire was for a time decisive, securing Nisibis and Singara for the empire and establishing a \"status quo\" of Roman dominance in the region until 251. His policy of an expanded and better-rewarded army was criticised by his contemporaries Cassius Dio and Herodianus: in particular, they pointed out the increasing burden, in the form of taxes and services, the civilian population had to bear to maintain the new and better-paid army. The large and ongoing increase in military expenditure caused problems for all of his successors.\nTo maintain his enlarged military, he debased the Roman currency. Upon his accession he decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 81.5% to 78.5%, although the silver weight actually increased, rising from 2.40\u00a0grams to 2.46\u00a0grams. Nevertheless, the following year he debased the denarius again because of rising military expenditures. The silver purity decreased from 78.5% to 64.5%\u2014the silver weight dropping from 2.46\u00a0grams to 1.98\u00a0grams. In 196 he reduced the purity and silver weight of the denarius again, to 54% and 1.82\u00a0grams, respectively. Severus's currency debasement was the largest since the reign of Nero, compromising the long-term strength of the economy.\nSeverus was also distinguished for his buildings. Apart from the triumphal arch in the Roman Forum carrying his full name, he also built the Septizodium in Rome. He enriched his native city of Leptis Magna, including commissioning a triumphal arch on the occasion of his visit of 203.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Giants compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West Division. Founded in 1883 as the New York Gothams, the team was renamed the New York Giants three years later, eventually relocating from New York City to San Francisco in 1958. The Giants play their home games at Oracle Park in San Francisco.\nThe franchise is one of the oldest and most successful in professional baseball, with more wins than any other team in the history of major American sports. The team was the first major-league organization based in New York City, most memorably playing home games at several iterations of the Polo Grounds. The Giants have played in the World Series 20 times. In 2014, the Giants won their then-record 23rd National League pennant; this mark has since been equaled and then eclipsed by the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, who won their 26th NL crown in 2025. The Giants' eight World Series championships are the third-most in the NL, and are the fourth-most of any franchise.\nThe franchise won 17 pennants and five World Series championships while in New York, led by managers John McGraw, Bill Terry, and Leo Durocher. New York-era star players including Christy Mathewson, Carl Hubbell, Mel Ott, and Willie Mays join 63 other Giants in the Baseball Hall of Fame, the most of any franchise. The Giants' rivalry with the Dodgers, one of the longest-standing and most famed rivalries in American sports, began in New York and continued when both teams relocated to California in 1958.\nDespite the efforts of Mays and Barry Bonds, regarded as two of baseball's all-time best players, the Giants endured a 56-year championship drought following the move west, a stretch that included three World Series losses. The drought finally ended in the early 2010s; under manager Bruce Bochy, the Giants embraced sabermetrics and eventually formed a baseball dynasty that saw them win the World Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014, making the Giants the second team in NL history to win three championships in five years.\nThrough 2025, the franchise's all-time record is 11,622\u201310,100\u2013163 (). Since moving to San Francisco in 1958, the Giants have an overall win\u2013loss record of 5,555\u20135,202\u20136 () through the end of 2025.\nHistory.\nNew York Giants.\nThe Giants originated in New York City as the New York Gothams in 1883, and were known as the New York Giants from 1885 until the team relocated to San Francisco after the 1957 season. During most of their 75 seasons in New York City, the Giants played home games at various incarnations of the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan.\nNumerous inductees of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum played for the New York Giants, including John McGraw, Christy Mathewson, Mel Ott, Bill Terry, Willie Mays, Monte Irvin, and Travis Jackson. During the club's tenure in New York, they produced five of the franchise's eight World Series wins (1905, 1921, 1922, 1933, 1954) and 17 of its 23 National League pennants. Famous moments in the Giants' New York history include the 1922 World Series, in which the Giants swept the Yankees in four games, the 1951 home run by New York Giants outfielder and third baseman Bobby Thomson known as the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\", and the defensive feat by Mays during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series known as \"the Catch\".\nThe Giants had intense rivalries with their fellow New York teams, the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Giants faced the Yankees in six World Series and played the league rival Dodgers multiple times per season. Games between any two of these three teams were known collectively as the Subway Series. The Dodgers-Giants rivalry continues, as both teams moved to California after the 1957 season, with the Dodgers relocating to Los Angeles. The New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) are named after the team.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nThe Giants, along with their rival Los Angeles Dodgers, became the first Major League Baseball teams to play on the West Coast. On April 15, 1958, the Giants played their first game in San Francisco, defeating the former Brooklyn and now Los Angeles Dodgers, 8\u20130. The Giants played for two seasons at Seals Stadium (from 1931 to 1957, the stadium was the home of the PCL's San Francisco Seals) before moving to Candlestick Park in 1960. The Giants played at Candlestick Park until 1999, before opening Pacific Bell Park (now known as Oracle Park) in 2000, where the Giants currently play.\nThe Giants struggled to sustain consistent success in their first 50 years in San Francisco. They made nine playoff appearances and won three NL pennants between 1958 and 2009. The Giants lost the 1962 World Series in seven games to the New York Yankees. The Giants were swept in the 1989 World Series by their cross-Bay rival Oakland Athletics, a series best known for the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which caused a 10-day delay between Games 2 and 3. The Giants also lost the 2002 World Series to the Anaheim Angels. One of the team's biggest highlights during this time was the 2001 season, in which outfielder Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs, breaking the record for most home runs in a season. In 2007, Bonds would surpass Hank Aaron's career record of 755 home runs. Bonds finished his career with 762 home runs (586 hit with the Giants), which is still the MLB record.\nThe Giants won three World Series championships in 2010, 2012, and 2014, giving the team eight total World Series titles, including the five won as the New York Giants when they still played in New York.\nPlayers inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as members of the San Francisco Giants include CF Willie Mays, 1B Orlando Cepeda, P Juan Marichal, 1B Willie McCovey, and P Gaylord Perry.\nUniforms.\n1958\u20131972.\nUpon moving to San Francisco, the Giants kept the same uniform they wore in New York, save for two changes. The cap logo now had an interlocking \"SF\" in orange, while the road uniform now featured \"San Francisco\" in black block letters with orange trim. Neckline, pants and sleeves feature thin black and orange stripes.\n1973\u20131976.\nChanging to double-knit polyester, the Giants made a few noticeable changes to their uniform. The color scheme on the letters was changed to orange with black trim, and player names were added on the back. The cap logo remained the same.\n1977\u20131982.\nFor the 1977 season, the Giants switched to pullover uniforms. \"Giants\" on the home uniform was changed from serifed block lettering to cursive script, and the color scheme returned to black with orange trim. The road uniform became orange, with letters in black with white trim. Neck and sleeve stripes are in black, orange and white. Both uniforms received chest numbers. The standard cap was changed to feature an orange brim.\nThe 1978 season saw the Giants add a black alternate uniform, an inverse of their road orange uniform. All three uniforms now featured the \"Giants\" script previously exclusive to the home uniform.\n1983\u20131993.\nBefore the 1983 season, the Giants returned to a traditional buttoned uniform designed by Sidjakov Berman &amp; Gomez. This design returned to the classic look they wore early in their San Francisco tenure, but with a few exceptions. The lettering became more rounded (save for the player's name), the neck stripes were removed, and the interlocking \"SF\" and black piping was added on the road gray uniform. The caps returned to an all-black design.\n1994\u20131999.\nIn 1994, the Giants made a few changes to their uniform. The road uniform reverted to \"San Francisco\" in front and removed the piping. The front of both uniforms returned to stylized block letters with pointed edges, but kept the rounded numbers. The \"SF\" on the cap was also changed to reflect the lettering change.\n2000\u2013present.\nCoinciding with the move to Oracle Park (then Pacific Bell Park) in 2000, the Giants unveiled new uniforms which were aesthetically close to the style they originally wore in their early years. On each uniform, numbers returned to a block letter style.\nHome.\nThe base of the home uniform was changed to cream. The \"Giants\" wordmark kept the same stylized block letter treatment but the arrangement was changed from a vertical to a radial arch. Neck stripes also returned with this uniform. Gold drop shadows were also added. A sleeve patch containing the team logo and the words \"San Francisco Baseball Club\" was also featured.\nRoad.\nThe gray road uniform returned to the classic \"San Francisco\" wordmark used in the 1960s, though in 2005 gold drop shadows were also added. This uniform was then tweaked to include black piping in 2012. Two sleeve patches were used. Between 2000 and 2010, the patch featured \"SF\" in orange letters in front of a baseball, with the full name added within a black circle. In 2011, this was changed to the sleeve patch used on the home uniform. Until 2020, only the road uniform featured player names; since 2021, all Giants uniforms have player names on the back.\nBlack alternate.\nIn 2001, the Giants added a road and home alternate black uniform. Each uniform shared the same design as their home and road counterparts, with the exception of the road alternate receiving gold drop shadows. The home design was dropped after only one season, and the road version was retired the following year. Both sets were worn with an all-black cap but with the squatchee in black (the primary cap has an orange squatchee) and the \"SF\" wordmark changed to black with orange trim.\nIn 2015, the Giants unveiled a new black alternate uniform to be used on select Saturday home games. This set has the interlocking \"SF\" in front along with orange piping and a new sleeve patch containing the Golden Gate Bridge atop the \"Giants\" wordmark. Initially, the letters were in black with orange trim, but this was changed to orange with black trim and orange drop shadows. In 2025, the Giants began wearing this uniform on select road games as well.\nOrange alternate.\nBefore the 2010 season, the Giants unveiled a new orange alternate uniform to be used on Friday home games. Initially, this design was similar to the home uniform save for a trim change to cream, but in 2011, the sleeve patch was changed to the one previously used on the team's road uniform. In 2014, the orange alternate were tweaked slightly, adding black piping and a new sleeve patch featuring the interlocking \"SF\" logo, and returning to the script \"Giants\" lettering previously used in the late 1970s. This design is usually paired with a black cap with orange brim featuring the \"SF\" logo.\nRoad alternate.\nBetween 2012 and 2019, the Giants wore a second gray road uniform. This design was similar to the primary roads, but with the \"SF\" in place of the city name (a nod to the 1983\u20131993 road uniforms).\nCity Connect.\nIn 2021, Major League Baseball and Nike introduced the \"City Connect\" program, with teams wearing special uniforms that reflect the pride and personality of their community. The Giants' version is a white base with orange accents, featuring the stylized \"G\" in an orange/white gradient. The gradient represents the San Francisco fog that envelopes the Bay Area many months per year. An orange silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge is printed on the sleeves. The uniform is paired with an all-orange cap with the \"SF\" in orange with white trim. The uniforms are usually worn on Tuesday home games. In 2025, Nike announced they were making changes the \"City Connect\" program, the Giants are confirmed to be changing their \"City Connect\" uniform for the 2025 Major League Baseball season.\nOn April 8th, 2025, the Giants unveiled their City Connect 2.0s. They are called a \"remix\". The jerseys are a dark gray/black, and feature \"Giants\" in a script wordmark outlined in a purple and orange gradient. The sleeves will feature a special glove design which says \"San Francisco Giants Est 1958\u201d in a style which is very reminiscent of San Francisco rock music posters from the 1960s. Also on the jersey are the waves which the team is calling \"sound waves\" which are \"pressed like grooves on vinyl\" that permeate the jersey. Front jersey numbers are orange, in a whimsical font. The hat highlights the \"SF\" in the same font, with a gradient bill. The pants are white with gradient piping.\nRivalries.\nThe Giants' rivalry with the Los Angeles Dodgers dates back to when the two teams were based in New York, as does their rivalry with the New York Yankees. The Dodger and Giants rivalry is one of the longest and fiercest rivalries in sports history. Their rivalry with the Oakland Athletics (now Athletics baseball club since leaving Oakland) dates back to when the Giants were in New York and the A's were in Philadelphia and played each other in the 1905, 1911, &amp; 1913 World Series, and was renewed in 1968 when the A's moved from Kansas City and the teams again played each other in the earthquake-interrupted 1989 Bay Bridge World Series. The Giants share a high divisional rivalry with fellow National League West member Arizona Diamondbacks. The 2010 NLCS inaugurated a Giants rivalry with the Philadelphia Phillies after confrontations between Jonathan S\u00e1nchez and Chase Utley, and between Ram\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez and Shane Victorino. However, with the Philadelphia Phillies dropping off as one of the premier teams of the National League, this rivalry has died down since 2010 and 2011. Another rivalry that has intensified recently is with the St. Louis Cardinals, whom the team has faced 4 times in the NLCS. \nThe rivalry between the New York Giants and Chicago Cubs in the early 20th century was once regarded as one of the most heated in baseball, with Merkle's Boner leading to a 1908 season-ending matchup in New York of particular note. That historical rivalry was revisited when the Giants beat the Cubs in the 1989 National League Championship Series, in their tiebreaker game in Chicago at the end of the 1998 season, on June 6, 2012, in a \"Turn Back The Century\" game in which both teams wore replica 1912 uniforms, and in the 2016 National League Division Series in which the Cubs won.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Giants-Dodgers rivalry is one of the longest-standing rivalries in team sports.\nThe Giants-Dodgers feud began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers based in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles primarily for financial reasons. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) to preserve the rivalry by taking his team to San Francisco as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in economic, cultural and political arenas, their new California venues became fertile ground for transplantation of the ancient rivalry. In the wake of the Giants' and Dodgers' leaving New York, a new ballclub was born in 1962 in Queens: The New York Mets. The team's colors (blue and orange) were an homage to the recently departed teams.\nBoth teams' having endured for over a century while leaping across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's growth from cross-city to cross-state, have led to its being considered one of the greatest in sports history.\nThe Giants-Dodgers rivalry has seen both teams enjoy periods of success at the expense of the other. While the Giants have more total wins and head-to-head wins in their overall franchise histories, the Dodgers have more total wins and head-to-head wins since the two teams moved to California in 1958. The Dodgers have also won the National League West 14 more times than the Giants since the start of division play in 1969. Both teams have made the postseason as a National League wild card three times. The Giants won their first world championship in California in 2010, while the Dodgers won their most recent world title in 2025. As of the end of the 2024 baseball season, the Los Angeles Dodgers lead the San Francisco Giants in California World Series triumphs, 7\u20133, whereas in 20th-century New York, the Giants led the Dodgers in World Series championships, 5\u20131. Overall, the two franchises are tied 8\u20138 in total World Series championships.\nOakland Athletics.\nA geographic rivalry with the cross-Bay American League Athletics greatly increased with the 1989 World Series, nicknamed the \"Battle of the Bay\", which Oakland swept (and which was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake moments before the scheduled start of Game 3 in San Francisco). This dates back to when the Giants and Athletics were rivals, when the Giants were in New York and the Athletics in Philadelphia. They met in the 1905, 1911, and 1913 World Series. In addition, the introduction of interleague play in 1997 has pitted the two teams against each other for usually six games every season since 1997, three in each city (but only four in 2013, two in each city). Before 1997, they played each other only in Cactus League spring training. Their interleague play wins and losses (63\u201357 in favor of the A's) have been fairly evenly divided despite differences in league, style of play, stadium, payroll, fan base stereotypes, media coverage and World Series records, all of which have heightened the rivalry in recent years. The intensity of the rivalry and how it is understood varies among Bay Area fans. A's fans generally view the Giants as a hated rival, while Giants fans generally view the A's as a friendly rival much lower on the scale. This is most likely due to the A's lack of a historical rival, while the Giants have their heated rivalry with the Dodgers. Some Bay Area fans are fans of both teams. The \"split hats\" that feature the logos of both teams best embodies the shared fan base. Other Bay Area fans view the competition between the two teams as a \"friendly rivalry\", with little actual hatred compared to similar ones such as the Subway Series (New York Mets vs. New York Yankees), the Red Line Series (Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox) and the Freeway Series (Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Los Angeles Angels).\nThe Giants and A's enjoyed a limited rivalry at the start of the 20th century before the Yankees began to dominate after the acquisition of Babe Ruth in 1920, when the Giants were in New York and the A's were in Philadelphia. The teams were managed by legendary leaders John McGraw and Connie Mack, who were considered not only friendly rivals but the premier managers during that era, especially in view of their longevity (Mack for 50 years, McGraw for 30) since both were majority owners. Each team played in five of the first 15 World Series (tying them with the Red Sox and Cubs for most World Series appearances during that time period). As the New York Giants and the Philadelphia A's, they met in three World Series, with the Giants winning in 1905 and the A's in 1911 &amp; 1913. After becoming the San Francisco Giants and Oakland A's, they met in a fourth Series in 1989 resulting in the A's last world championship (as of 2024).\nNew York Yankees.\nThough in different leagues, the Giants have also been historical rivals of the Yankees, starting in New York before the Giants moved to the West Coast. Before the institution of interleague play in 1997, the two teams had little opportunity to play each other except in seven World Series: 1921, 1922, 1923, 1936, 1937, 1951 and 1962, the Yankees winning last five of the seven Series. The teams have met five times in regular season interleague play: In 2002 at the old Yankee Stadium, in 2007 at Oracle Park (then known as AT&amp;T Park), in 2013, 2016, and 2023 at the current Yankee Stadium, and in 2019 at Oracle Park. The teams' next regular season meetings will occur yearly, with the advent of the balanced schedule format introduced in 2023.\nIn his July 4, 1939, farewell speech ending with the renowned \"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth\", Yankee slugger Lou Gehrig, who played in 2,130 consecutive games, declared that the Giants were a team he \"would give his right arm to beat, and vice versa\".\nBaseball Hall of Famers.\nAs of 2024, the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame has inducted 66 representatives of the Giants (55 players and 11 managers) into the Hall of Fame, more than any other team in the history of baseball.\nSan Francisco Giants Hall of Famers\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\nNew York Gothams/Giants\nSan Francisco Giants\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFord C. Frick Award recipients.\nSan Francisco Giants Ford C. Frick Award recipients\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther.\nThe following inducted members of the Hall of Fame played or managed for the Giants, but either played for the Giants and were inducted as a manager having never managed the Giants, or managed the Giants and were inducted as a player having never played for the Giants:\nBroadcasters Russ Hodges, Lon Simmons, and Jon Miller are permanently honored in the Hall's \"Scribes &amp; Mikemen\" exhibit as a result of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1980, 2004, and 2010 respectively. As with all Frick Award winners, none are officially recognized as an inducted member of the Hall of Fame.\nWall of Famers.\nThe Giants Wall of Fame recognizes retired players whose records stand highest among their teammates on the basis of longevity and achievements.\nThose honored have played a minimum of nine seasons for the San Francisco Giants, five seasons with at least one All-Star selection as a Giant, or won three World Series championships as a Giant.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Giants have retired 11 numbers in the history of the franchise, most recently Will Clark's number 22 in 2022.\nOf the Giants whose numbers have been retired, all but Bonds and Clark have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1944, Carl Hubbell (#11) became the first National Leaguer to have his number retired by his team. Bill Terry (#3), Mel Ott (#4), and Hubbell played or managed their entire careers for the New York Giants. Willie Mays (#24) began his career in New York, moving with the Giants to San Francisco in 1958; he did not play in most of 1952 and all of 1953 due to his service in the Korean War. Mathewson and McGraw are honored by the Giants, but played in an era before uniform numbers became standard in baseball.\nThe Giants had originally scheduled to retire Will Clark's #22 on July 11, 2020, but the ceremony was postponed until July 30, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlso honored.\nJohn McGraw (3B, 1902\u201306; manager, 1902\u201332) and Christy Mathewson (P, 1900\u201316), who were members of the New York Giants before the introduction of uniform numbers, have the letters \"NY\" displayed in place of a number.\nBroadcasters Lon Simmons (1958\u201373, 1976\u201378, 1996\u20132002 &amp; 2006), Russ Hodges (1949\u201370), and Jon Miller (1997\u2013current) are each represented by an old-style radio microphone displayed in place of a number.\nThe Giants present the Willie Mac Award annually to the player that best exemplifies the spirit and leadership shown by Willie McCovey throughout his career.\nTeam captains.\nThe Giants have had ten official recorded captains over the years:\nDuring the 2021 and 2022 season, player Brandon Belt gave himself the title of self-proclaimed captain, but this was not considered an official capacity.\nSeason records.\nNote: These statistics are current as of end of 2023 season.\nMinor league affiliations.\nThe San Francisco Giants farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.\nRadio and television.\nGiants' television telecasts are on NBC Sports Bay Area (cable) with select games simulcasted on KNTV (broadcast). KNTV's broadcast contract with the Giants began in 2008, one year after the team and KTVU mutually ended a relationship that dated to 1961. Jon Miller regularly called the action on KNTV, which used to be exclusive to that channel up until 2021, while the announcing team for NBC Sports Bay Area (NBCSBA) telecasts is Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow, affectionately known as \"Kruk and Kuip\" (pronounced \"Kruke\" and \"Kype\"). During the 2016 season, the Giants had an average 4.71 rating and 117,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts. Since the 2022 season, as Krukow is unable to travel with the team due to his inclusion body myositis, the pair only work home games and select road games, which the road games are done via \"SplitKast\" where Kuiper would be at the away ballpark and Krukow will be at the NBC Sports Bay Area studio in San Francisco.

{"id": "28417", "revid": "589223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28417", "title": "San Diego Padres", "text": "Major League Baseball franchise in San Diego, California\nThe San Diego Padres are an American professional baseball team based in San Diego. The Padres compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West Division. The team plays its home games at Petco Park in downtown San Diego. Founded in 1969 as an expansion franchise, the Padres adopted their name from the Pacific Coast League (PCL) team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. The name, Spanish for \"fathers\", honors the friars of the Franciscan order who founded Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 in 1769.\nIn 1976, Randy Jones achieved the first Cy Young Award for the Padres. In the 1980s, Tony Gwynn became a major star, winning eight National League batting titles. Under manager Dick Williams, the Padres clinched their first NL pennant, only to lose to the Detroit Tigers in the 1984 World Series in 5 games. In 1995, Kevin Towers became general manager; under his lead, Ken Caminiti became the first Padres player to win the MVP Award. The Padres achieved their second NL pennant alongside Trevor Hoffman, only to be swept by the New York Yankees in the 1998 World Series.\nThe Padres are owned by the estate of Peter Seidler, who owned the team from 2012 until his death in 2023. The team has won two NL pennants, in 1984 and 1998, losing in the World Series both years; they are tied with the Milwaukee Brewers as the oldest teams never to have won the World Series. As of the 2025 season, the Padres have had 19 winning seasons in franchise history. Despite reaching the postseason six times from 2005 to 2025, the team has yet to return to the World Series. From 1969 through 2025, the Padres have an overall record of 4,217\u20134,789\u20132 ().\nHistory.\nThe Padres adopted their name from the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, a team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. This minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by 18-year-old Ted Williams, the future Hall of Famer who was a native of San Diego.\nIn 1969, the Padres joined the ranks of Major League Baseball as one of four new expansion teams, along with the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), the Kansas City Royals, and the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers).\nOne of its earliest owners was C. Arnholt Smith, a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the PCL Padres. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and Buzzie Bavasi, as well as a new stadium, the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the National League West, losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger Nate Colbert, an expansion draftee from the Houston Astros and was the long-time home run leader until 2024, when Manny Machado overtook him.\nThe team's fortunes gradually improved as they won five National League West titles and reached the World Series twice, in 1984 and in 1998, but lost both times. The Padres' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, Petco Park, in 2004.\nOn August 20, 2020, the Padres became the first team in MLB history to hit a grand slam in four consecutive games earning the nickname, \"Slam Diego Padres\".\nUntil 2021, the Padres were the last team in MLB that had yet to throw a no-hitter. The record was broken on April 9, 2021, as Joe Musgrove accomplished the feat against the Texas Rangers, finally ending the longest no-hit drought by a team in MLB history. On September 5, 1997, Andy Ashby took a no-hitter into the ninth inning, which was previously the closest that the team had come to achieving this feat. In 2024, first year Padre Dylan Cease threw a no-hitter against the Washington Nationals on July 25.\nOn November 14, 2023, Peter Seidler, who owned the Padres since 2012, died at the age of 63. MLB owners approved of John Seidler as the Padres' control person on February 6, 2025.\nChampionships.\nThe Padres are one of two teams in the National League West that have never won the World Series, though they have made and lost both appearances as the National League pennant winner in 1984 and 1998.\nAchievements.\nBaseball Hall of Famers.\nThe following elected members of the Baseball Hall of Fame played or managed for the Padres.\nSan Diego Padres Hall of Famers\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\nSan Diego Padres\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFord C. Frick Award recipients (broadcasters).\nSan Diego Padres Ford C. Frick Award recipients\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRetired numbers.\nThe Padres have retired six numbers. The numbers are commemorated in a display at Petco Park's entrance at Home Plate Plaza. Fans are allowed to pose for pictures next to the aluminum numbers, which are high, wide, and deep. Originally, the numbers were atop the batter's eye in center field, until they were relocated in 2016. The numbers were not ready for display in time for the park's opening in 2004, but they were unveiled midseason. Also beginning in 2016, the numbers are displayed in the Ring of Honor on the upper deck fa\u00e7ade above the press box behind home plate.\nIn 1988, Steve Garvey was the first player to have his number retired by the Padres. He played only five seasons with San Diego, but hit the game-winning two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning against the Chicago Cubs in Game 4 of the 1984 National League Championship Series (NLCS), tying the series before the Padres won the next day. He was named the NLCS Most Valuable Player, and San Diego advanced to their first World Series. In 2016, \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" ranked Garvey's Game 4 homer as the No. 1 moment in San Diego sports history. However, he played 14 of his 19 seasons with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, where he was also more productive, and the retirement of his number by San Diego has been heavily debated.\nOn April 15, 1997, exactly 50 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line, the No. 42 he wore with the Brooklyn Dodgers was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Later that year, Randy Jones's No. 35 was retired by the Padres. He was a two-time All-Star (1975, 1976) and the club's first Cy Young Award winner in 1976. On the day his number was retired, the \"Union-Tribune\" wrote that Jones was \"the most popular athlete in the history of this city\" during the mid-1970s. Dave Winfield was next to have his number, 31, retired in 2001, when he was also inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. His retirement ceremony also celebrated his decision to be the first member of the Hall of Fame to have his plaque depicting him wearing a Padres cap. Winfield played for six teams in his 22-year career, spending his first eight seasons in San Diego. In 2004, the Padres retired No. 19 in honor of Gwynn, who is widely considered the greatest Padres player ever. He played his entire 20-year career with San Diego and won an NL-record eight batting titles. The most recent number to be retired was Trevor Hoffman's No. 51 in 2011. He had retired from playing after 2010, when he left the game as MLB's career leader in saves with 601, including 552 with the Padres.\nPrior to moving to Petco, the team played at San Diego Stadium, where the retired numbers were originally displayed on banners hanging from the light towers above the left field stands. However, Garvey's number was commemorated instead on the wall behind the spot in right-center field where his winning home run in the 1984 NLCS cleared the fence, but the number disappeared when the stadium was expanded in 1997 and the location was masked by an overhang. It reappeared in 2002 when all the retired numbers were moved and inscribed on the outfield fence.\nThe Padres also have a \"star on the wall\" in honor of broadcaster Jerry Coleman, in reference to his trademark phrase \"Oh Doctor! You can hang a star on that baby!\" Nearby the initials of the late owner Ray Kroc are also displayed. Both the star and the initials are painted in gold on the front of the pressbox down the right-field line accompanied by the name of the person in white. Kroc was honored in 1984, Coleman in 2001.\nOn March 23, 2024, the team held a public memorial and celebration of life for team owner Peter Seidler, who died in November 2023. The club honored his memory with his initials of \"PS\" inside a gold heart next to Coleman's memorial on the front of the pressbox down the right-field line.\nPadres Hall of Fame.\nThe following 16 people have been inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame since it was founded in 1999.\nSan Diego Hall of Champions.\nGwynn, Winfield, Fingers, Gossage, Randy Jones, and Graig Nettles (3B, 1984\u20131987) are members of the San Diego Hall of Champions, which is open to athletes native to the San Diego area (such as Nettles) as well as to those who played for San Diego teams (such as Gwynn).\nMinor league affiliates.\nThe San Diego Padres farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.\nLogos and colors.\nThroughout the team's history, the San Diego Padres have used multiple logos, uniforms, and different color combinations.\n1969\u20131979: Original brown &amp; gold.\nTheir first logo in 1969 depicted a friar swinging a bat with Padres written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres on the exterior of it. The \"Swinging Friar\" has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the \"Swinging Friar\" is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the mascot of the team and is now used as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.\nBrown and gold were the Padres' original colors. The team's first uniforms featured a cream base for the home uniforms and a tan base for the road uniforms. Brown letters with gold trim adorned the uniforms, which featured the team name in front of both designs. A second tan uniform, this time with the city name, was used as a road alternate before becoming the primary in 1971. Caps were all-brown with the gold \"SD\", though the team later broke out an alternate gold cap with a brown brim and \"SD\" letters.\nSwitching from flannel to polyester in 1972, the Padres radically changed their uniforms. The team wore all-gold uniforms and pants regardless of road or home games, with the only difference being the road uniform emblazoned with the city name and the home uniform with the team name. The Padres also broke out a new brown cap, complete with a gold front panel and a brown \"SD\", which would remain for the next several years. The gold front panel was shaped as a bell, alluding to the bells in historic missions in California.\nIn 1974, the Padres returned to wearing traditional uniforms. The home design now had a script \"Padres\" lettering in front, with the road design keeping much of the original aesthetic. Chest numbers were also added. In\u00a01976, the Padres ditched the buttons in favor of pullovers for their home uniform. In addition, they went with a brown uniform top for road games, featuring gold sleeves and gold letters.\nThe brown uniforms served as a template for the Padres' next uniform set beginning in 1978. The home uniforms now featured brown sleeves and gold letters, and a gold alternate with brown sleeves and letters was also released. The full team name, which was written in a more futuristic font, was emblazoned in front while the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. However, this set only lasted for that season, as the Padres tweaked its design the next season. The updated design removed the swinging friar logo while returning to the team name/city name dynamic for home and road games respectively. The gold uniforms were also retired.\n1980\u20131984: Brown, gold, &amp; orange.\nIn 1980, the Padres added orange to the palette. The team's next uniform set removed the contrasting colored sleeves and chest numbers, and orange was added to the letters and striping of the home uniforms and trim and striping of the road uniforms. The caps were also updated to feature orange trim on the \"SD\" and within the gold panel. In 1984, the Padres added the initials \"RAK\" on the left sleeve in honor of Ray Kroc, who had owned the team since 1974.\n1985\u20131990: Brown &amp; orange pinstripes.\nIn 1985, the Padres switched to using a script-like logo in which \"Padres\" was written sloped up. That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team's colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the 1990 season. In 1989, the Padres took the scripted Padres logo and put it in a gray ring that read \"San Diego Baseball Club\" with a striped center.\nThat same year, the Padres returned to wearing traditional buttoned uniforms designed by Sidjakov Berman &amp; Gomez. The home uniforms featured the script \"Padres\" in front while the road uniforms had the \"SD\" emblazoned on the left chest. Brown letters with orange trim and brown pinstripes adorned both uniforms. The \"RAK\" initials remained until 1986. An all-brown cap with the orange \"SD\" was used with the uniform.\n1991\u20132003: Blue &amp; orange.\nIn 1991, the Padres logo was updated. The color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows and they also wearing blue pin stripes. In 1991, the team's colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.\nThe home uniform kept the pinstripes but was changed to navy blue, which was also implemented on the letters. The road uniforms eliminated the pinstripes and added the city name in navy blue block letters with white trim and orange drop shadows. A navy cap with the \"S\" in white and \"D\" in orange was used with the uniform. The team logo was added on the left sleeve in 1996.\nThe Padres unveiled a navy blue alternate uniform in 1997, featuring the team name in front written in navy blue with orange drop shadows. Other features included orange numbers at the back and white piping along the chest, neck and sleeves. White chest numbers were added in 1999. Initially, the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve, but was removed after the 1998 season in favor of the team's primary logo which lasted until the 2000 season.\nThe following year, the Padres began wearing an alternate home white uniform which bore the same features as the primary home uniform minus the pinstripes and orange trim. Navy blue piping was also added. An alternate navy cap with the white \"SD\" was used with the uniform. This uniform became the primary in 2001, after which the pinstriped uniforms were retired following that season.\n2004\u20132015: Blue &amp; sand.\nThe logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the 2003 and 2004 seasons, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with \"San Diego\" written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team's colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. In\u00a02009, the \"San Diego\" was removed from the top right corner of the logo.\nFor the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a grey jersey. On the road, the team wore sand uniforms with the city name in front. The home design featured the updated \"Padres\" script in navy with sand drop shadows. Both uniforms featured the primary logo on the left sleeve. The alternate blue uniform featured the same \"Padres\" script in sand, and the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. The Padres continued to wear their primary navy cap at home, while on the road they went with a second navy cap with \"SD\" in sand.\nIn 2011, the Padres' road uniform was changed to a grey base, and the navy and sand caps were used exclusively with the navy alternates. After the season, the alternate navy cap was retired.\nFor the 2012 season, the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" adorning the outer circle. The \"swinging friar\" logo was recolored navy blue and white and was added to the left sleeve of the home uniform. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year's primary logo below the depiction of Petco Park in sand and above the year of the team's first season (EST. 1969); this design was added to the team's road and navy alternates. While the home uniforms kept the sand trim, the road and navy alternates did not. In addition, the \"SD\" replaced \"Padres\" in front of the navy alternates, and the city name wordmark on the road uniforms was updated. All uniforms also added piping around the chest, neck and sleeves.\n2016\u20132019: Blue &amp; white.\nIn the 2016 season, the Padres wore a navy blue and gold color scheme, similar to the one used on the 2016 All-Star Game logo. The home uniform was patterned similarly to the alternate navy uniforms, with gold trim accenting the piping and letters. An alternate navy cap with the \"S\" in white and \"D\" in gold was also used with the uniform. To coincide with the change, the Padres added a new brown and gold alternate uniform to be worn mostly during Friday home games, along with an updated gold-paneled brown cap.\nFor the 2017 season, the Padres revealed a new color scheme and new jerseys for the second straight year. The gold was scrapped from the home uniform and the team reverted to a navy blue-and-white combo. The word \"Padres\" returned to the front of the home uniform, but with a new script, while the script on the road uniform reverted to the \"San Diego\" wordmark style it used from 2004 to 2011. Both uniforms also added the \"SD\" logo on the left sleeve. The navy blue alternates remained intact minus the left sleeve patch. Despite this major change, the brown and gold alternate uniform from the previous set was retained, with the addition of the \"SD\" on the left sleeve.\n2020\u2013present: Return to brown &amp; gold.\nThe club announced in January 2019 that the original brown and gold colors would return for the 2020 season. The new uniform designs featuring the brown and gold colors were officially unveiled on November 9. The team featured brown and gold on each of the three unveiled jerseys, including the return of pinstripes to the Padre home jersey for the first time since 2001 and a sand-colored road jersey (also with pinstripes) for the first time since 2010. Alternate non-pinstriped sand pants are paired with the brown alternate jersey. The shade of the sand color is noticeably darker than the sand-colored road jerseys worn from 2004 to 2010. An all-brown cap with \"SD\" in gold was also released. With the uniform change, the San Diego Padres are once again the only team in the league that do not feature grey in their road uniforms.\nThe return to brown and gold uniforms has coincided with an increase in team merchandise sales, with the Padres ranking in the top 10 in MLB team merchandise sales at U.S. sports retailer Lids during the 2022 season.\nCity Connect.\nIn 2022, the Padres joined 13 other teams in wearing Nike's \"City Connect\" uniforms. The primarily white uniform featured pink, mint green and yellow accents on the letters and sleeves, and has \"San Diego\" written in a graffiti style. The left mint sleeve contained a recolored version of the \"swinging friar\" logo in pink and yellow. The all-mint cap featured the pink interlocking \"SD\" in front. The uniform intended to pay tribute to the San Diego\u2013Tijuana bi-national metropolitan area, highlighting San Diego's long-standing relations with Tijuana in Baja California, Mexico.\nOn November 2, 2025, to coincide with Dia de los Muertos, the Padres posted a teaser video on their social media platforms featuring WWE superstar, and San Diego native Dominik Mysterio placing a White hat bearing an Orange \"S\" and Navy Blue \"D\" and bill on to a traditional Day of the Dead altar. The blue and orange color palette was worn by the Padres between 1991 and 2003, including the franchise's most recent run to the World Series in 1998. The teaser ended with the appearance of a woman wearing traditional Day of the Dead face paint before vanishing to an ad saying \"Padres / Nike. City Connect 2.0 Coming April 2026.\"\nMascot.\nThe Padres' official mascot is the \"Swinging Friar\", a pudgy man dressed as a friar with a tonsure, sandals, a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a baseball bat and rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win. He is named and patterned after the Spanish Franciscans, who founded Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 around which the city of San Diego was established in 1769.\nThe Swinging Friar was designed by 19-year-old Carlos Hadaway in the 1950s and first appeared on team programs for the 1962 home opener, when the Padres were still a member of the Pacific Coast League, a Minor League Baseball organization. The mascot was retained when the team joined Major League Baseball in 1969. Originally, the Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since the 1990s, the character has been a full mascot costume.\nThe San Diego Chicken has often been mistaken as the Padres' team mascot due to the frequency with which he appears at Padres games. Although he does make appearances at San Diego sporting events, the Famous Chicken is an independent character owned by professional mascot Ted Giannoulas and has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.\nRivalries.\nDivisional.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Padres' historical rivalry against the Los Angeles Dodgers has often been largely lopsided in favor of LA, however; recent growth between the two teams in competition during the 2020s has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego (driving from Dodger Stadium to Petco Park can be done by simply taking Interstate 5). San Diego fans have often harbored animosity towards Los Angeles due in small part to San Diego being an unstable home for multiple sports franchises as both the Chargers and the Clippers had relocated to Los Angeles after being unable to secure either a new arena or stable finances in San Diego. Following the relocation of the Chargers to Los Angeles in 2017, the Padres became the only franchise in the four major American professional sports leagues in the San Diego sports market, strengthening the rivalry and San Diego's animosity to Los Angeles sports in general. The Dodgers currently lead the series 504\u2013412, and both teams have met in the post season three times (Los Angeles winning the 2020 NLDS and 2024 NLDS, while San Diego won in 2022). Off the field, the rivalry has been just as competitive, as the two teams have aggressively battled on the trade market and free agency over numerous star players, including a deal that traded for Juan Soto.\nInterleague.\nSeattle Mariners (The Vedder Cup).\nAn unusual rivalry exists between the Padres and the American League's Seattle Mariners. The matchup was designated one of the 15 \"naturalized rivalries\" when interleague play began in 1997, and the teams have played every year since, except 2017.\nLittle on the surface links the two teams to any actual hostility, as both play in separate leagues and in cities that sit about 1,250 miles apart. Still, they share a spring training facility\u2014the Peoria Sports Complex in Peoria, Arizona\u2014and in many years have competed for draft picks and prospects after failing to make the playoffs. (The Padres failed to win a single playoff series between 1999 and 2019, while the Mariners failed to make the playoffs from 2002 to 2021.) Far from a bitter rivalry, it is viewed by the teams and most fans as more of a humorous contest.\nThe rivalry has long been unofficially called the Vedder Cup after Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who claims both Seattle and San Diego as hometowns\u2014and who is a known fan of the Chicago Cubs. Starting in 2025, the rivalry was officially recognized as \"The Vedder Cup\", with the winner of the series being awarded a trophy designed by Vedder himself.\nMilitary appreciation.\nIn 1996, the Padres became the first national sports team to have an annual military appreciation event. In 2000, the Padres began wearing a camouflage jersey to honor the military. Starting in 2008, the Padres began wearing camouflage jerseys for every Sunday home game. The team also wears the uniforms on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. For 2011, the Padres changed the camouflage design to a more modern \"digital\" design, using the MARPAT design after receiving permission from then-Commandant James Conway, and dropped the green from the lettering and logo of the jersey. Green was replaced by a sand-olive color (also in the cap worn with the jersey). For 2016, to coincide with hosting the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the Padres added a second camouflage jersey, this time in navy blue. The Padres alternated the navy camouflage jersey with a Marines style, which were used through 2019. From 2020 to 2023, the Padres used two different camouflage jersey colors: green and sand-olive, both with the current \"Padres\" logo.\nSince 1995 Marine Recruits from the nearby Marine Corps Recruit Depot often visit the games en masse during Military Appreciation Day, in uniform, often filling entire sections of the upper deck of Petco Park. When present, the team commemorates them with a special Fourth Inning Stretch featuring the Marines' Hymn played by stadium organist Bobby Cressey. Through April 2005 over 60,000 marine recruits were hosted by the Padres. This is part of an extensive military outreach program, which also includes a series of Military Appreciation Night games, and game tapes mailed to deployed United States Navy ships of the Pacific Fleet for onboard viewing (a large portion of the Pacific Fleet is home ported in San Diego). Now, every Sunday home games the Padres play is \"Military Sunday\".\nThe San Diego area is home to a number of military installations, including several Navy and Coast Guard bases centered on San Diego Bay, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (former home of the \"Top Gun\" training program), and the Marine Corps training ground at Camp Pendleton. Civilians employed at those bases account for around 5% of the county's working population.\nRadio and television.\nAs of May 31, 2023, the Padres' regional telecasts are produced by MLB's local media department and distributed via local origination channels on television providers in the team's regional market, as well as an over-the-top subscription service distributed by MLB.tv. These telecasts are branded as PADRES.TV. Games air on the following cable providers and networks:\nDon Orsillo is the play-by-play announcer, with Mark Grant as color analyst and Bob Scanlan as field reporter. Bally Sports San Diego (formerly Fox Sports San Diego) had assumed the rights to the team in 2012 under a 20-year deal, replacing Cox Cable's 4SD. Amid the chapter 11 bankruptcy of the network's parent company Diamond Sports Group, Bally missed a rights payment to the Padres in May 2023, causing the rights to the Padres to revert to the team; MLB subsequently took over production of the Padres' regional broadcasts, retaining the commentators and contracted employees.\nAs of the 2021 season, Padres radio broadcasts in English are carried by KWFN \"97.3 The Fan\", after having previously been carried by sister station 94.9 KBZT upon the acquisition of the radio rights by Entercom in 2017. Jesse Agler is the primary play-by-play announcer, with Tony Gwynn Jr. serving as color analyst. The games are also broadcast in Spanish on XEXX-AM, \"Radio Ranchito 1420 AM\", with Eduardo Ortega, Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez and Pedro Guti\u00e9rrez announcing. Padre games were also aired from 2006 to 2010 on XHPRS-FM 105.7.\nSelected games are broadcast on KFMB, San Diego's CBS affiliate, and its CW-affiliated subchannel. Spanish language telecasts of Sunday games are seen XHAS-TDT channel 33. Until September 2007, Friday and Saturday games were seen in Spanish on KBOP-CA channel 43, until that station changed to an all-infomercial format. English-language Padres over-the-air broadcasts aired through the years on XETV-TV 6, KCST-TV 39, KUSI-TV 51, KFMB-TV 8 and KSWB-TV 69.\nJohn Demott was the Padres' first public address announcer when the team began in 1969. By the late 1970s, Bruce Binkowski had taken over as PA announcer, and became the longest-serving public address announcer in the team's history, remaining until the end of the 1999 season. First DeMott and then Binkowski also were responsible with PA announcing duties for the San Diego Chargers and the San Diego State Aztecs, both of which were joint tenants at Qualcomm Stadium with the Padres until the Padres moved into Petco Park. From Petco Park's opening in 2004 until 2013, the PA announcer was Frank Anthony, a radio host with 105.7 XHPRS-FM. On April 19, 2014, Alex Miniak was announced as the new Public Address announcer for the San Diego Padres.

The 68008 is a member of the Motorola 68000 family with 32-bit internal data registers, but an 8-bit external data bus characteristic of microcomputers.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nThe QL was conceived in 1981 under the code name \"ZX83\", as a portable computer for business users, with a built-in ultra-thin flat-screen CRT display similar to the later TV80 pocket TV, printer and modem. As development progressed it eventually became clear that the portability features were over-ambitious and the specification was reduced to a conventional desktop configuration. \nThe electronics were primarily designed by David Karlin, who joined Sinclair Research in summer 1982. The industrial design was done by Rick Dickinson, who already designed the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum range of products.\nThe QL was designed to be more powerful than the IBM Personal Computer, and comparable to Apple's Macintosh; observers thought that Sinclair announced it a week before Macintosh to divert attention away from the new Apple product. While the CPU clock speed is comparable to that of the Macintosh, and the later Atari ST and Amiga, the 8-bit databus and cycle stealing of the ZX8301 gate array limit the QL's performance.\nSinclair had commissioned GST Computer Systems to produce the operating system for the machine, but switched to Domesdos, developed by Tony Tebby as an in-house alternative, before launch. GST's OS, designed by Tim Ward, was later made available as 68K/OS, in the form of an add-on ROM card. The tools developed by GST for the QL would later be used on the Atari ST, where GST object format became standard.\nLaunch.\nAt the time of the rushed launch, on 12 January 1984, the QL was far from being ready for production, with no complete working prototype. Although Sinclair started taking orders immediately, promising delivery within 28 days, first customer deliveries only started, slowly, in April. This provoked criticism of the company and the attention of the Advertising Standards Authority.\nBecause of its premature launch, the QL was plagued by a number of problems from the start. Early production QLs were shipped with preliminary versions of firmware containing numerous bugs, mainly in SuperBASIC. Part of the firmware was held on an external 16\u00a0KiB ROM cartridge also known as the \"kludge\" or \"dongle\", until the QL was redesigned to accommodate the necessary 48\u00a0KiB of ROM internally, instead of the 32\u00a0KiB initially specified.\nThe QL also suffered from reliability problems of its Microdrives. These problems were later rectified, by Sinclair engineers, especially on Samsung produced models, as well as by aftermarket firms such as Adman Services and TF Services, to the point where several QL users report the Samsung Microdrives in particular working perfectly even after almost 17 years of service; but in any case too late to redeem the negative image they had already created.\nReception.\n\"BYTE\" in September 1984 described QL as a \"premature baby\", noting the incomplete operating system, \"dead and unresponsive\" keyboard, fragile microdrive tapes, and lack of sprites. The magazine approved of the bundled applications, and SuperBASIC's improvement over Sinclair BASIC, but criticized the language's \"very, very slow\" speed. \"BYTE\" concluded that QL was superior to the \"wildly overpriced\" BBC Model B for hobbyists, but expected that the computer's \"extremely disappointing performance figures achieved so far\" from the \"emasculated\" CPU, unreliable microdrive, and keyboard would make it unsuitable for businesses. \"A rival to Macintosh this is not, but then, you get what you pay for\", the magazine said, hoping that third-party developers would increase QL's appeal.\nAlthough the computer was hyped as being advanced for its time, and relatively cheap, it failed to sell well, and UK production was suspended in 1985, due to lack of demand. After Amstrad acquired Sinclair's computer product lines in April 1986, the QL was officially discontinued.\nApart from its reliability issues, the target business market was becoming wedded to the IBM PC platform, whilst the majority of ZX Spectrum owners were uninterested in upgrading to a machine which had a minimal library of games (with only about 70 titles, compared to the Spectrum's more than 4700). Sinclair's persistence with the non-standard Microdrive and uncomfortable keyboard did not endear it to the business market. Clive Sinclair later maintained that the Microdrive was \"a marvellous approach\", also claiming that he had really wanted to base the QL on the Z80, that others in the company had persuaded him to use the 68000, and that \"there was nothing you could do on the 68000 that you couldn't do on the Z80\". Software publishers were also reluctant to support the QL because Microdrive cartridges were the only available distribution medium for the QL, and the unfavourable pricing of the medium (production costs being given as over six times that of compact cassette) impacted profitability and made QL-based products uncompetitive.\nDedicated magazines were published for the system, such as \"QL World\" (published from 1985 to 1994), \"QL User\" (published from 1984 to 1985), or \"QL Today\" (published from 1996 to 2013).\nDesign.\nBased on a Motorola 68008 processor clocked at 7.5\u00a0MHz, the QL included 128 KiB of RAM, which is officially expandable to 640\u00a0KiB and in practice, 896\u00a0KB.\nIt can be connected to a monitor or TV for display. Sinclair recommended the \"SINCLAIR VISION-QL\" RGB monitor for usage with the QL. When connected to a normally-adjusted TV or monitor, the QL's video output overscans horizontally. This is reputed to have been due to the timing constants in the ZX8301 chip being optimised for the flat-screen CRT display originally intended for the QL.\nTwo video modes are available, pixels with 8 primary RGB colours and per-pixel flashing, or pixels with four colours: black, red, green and white. Both Commodore 64 and MSX computers can display more colours, but at lower resolutions. Both screen modes use a 32\u00a0KiB framebuffer in main memory. The hardware is capable of switching between two different areas of memory for the frame buffer, thus allowing double buffering. However, this would use 64\u00a0KB of the standard machine's 128\u00a0KiB of RAM and there is no support for this feature in the QL's original firmware. The alternative and improved operating system Minerva provides full support for the second frame buffer. Internally, the QL comprises the CPU, two ULAs (ZX8301 \"Master Chip\" and ZX8302 \"Peripheral Chip\") and an Intel 8049 microcontroller known as the IPC, or \"Intelligent Peripheral Controller\". The ZX8301 implements the video display generator and also provides DRAM refresh. The ZX8302 interfaces to the RS-232 ports (transmit only), Microdrives, QLAN ports, real-time clock and the 8049 via a synchronous serial link. The 8049 runs at 11\u00a0MHz and provides a keyboard/joystick interface, RS-232 serial receivers and an audio generator. The 8049 was added at a late stage in the QL's design, as the ZX8302 was originally intended to include its functions. \nTwo built-in Microdrive tape-loop cartridge drives provide mass storage, in place of the more expensive floppy disk drives found on similar systems of the era. Microdrives had been introduced for the ZX Spectrum in July 1983, although the QL uses a different logical tape format.\nInterfaces include an expansion slot, ROM cartridge socket, dual RS-232 ports, proprietary QLAN local area network ports, dual joystick ports and an external Microdrive bus. The QL uses British Telecom type 631W plugs of similar design to British telephone sockets for serial cables except for QLs built by Samsung for export markets, which have DE-9 sockets. Joysticks connect to the QL with similar type 630W plugs.\nWhile the keyboard improves on ZX Spectrum's, it is a rubber membrane keyboard under the keycaps. Physically, the QL is the same black colour as the preceding ZX81 and Spectrum, but introduced a new angular styling theme and keyboard design which would later be seen in the ZX Spectrum+.\nQDOS, a pre-emptive multitasking operating system primarily designed by Tony Tebby, is included on ROM, as is an advanced structured BASIC interpreter, named SuperBASIC designed by Jan Jones, which is also used as the command-line interpreter. The QL is bundled with an office suite, consisting of a word processor, spreadsheet, database, and business graphics written by Psion.\nAccording to Sinclair Research, it was the first mass-market computer with an OS featuring pre-emptive multitasking and a Windows-style operating system, predating Microsoft Windows 95 by 11 years, and Apple Computer Macintosh launch by a month.\nLegacy.\nICL One Per Desk.\nThe QL's CPU, ZX8301 and ZX8302 ASICs and Microdrives form the basis of One Per Desk (OPD). Built by International Computers Limited (ICL), it was also marketed by British Telecom as the Merlin Tonto and by Telecom Australia as the Computerphone.\nThe result of a three-year collaboration between Sinclair Research, ICL and British Telecom, the One Per Desk adds a telephone handset at one end of the keyboard, and rudimentary Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) software. This machine interested a number of high-profile business customers, including certain divisions of the former UK Customs and Excise Department, but its success was generally limited. In the late 1980s they were used in bingo halls to allow a country-wide networked bingo game.\nLinux.\nLinus Torvalds has attributed his eventually developing the Linux kernel, likewise having pre-emptive multitasking, in part to having owned a Sinclair QL in the 1980s. Because of the lack of support, particularly in his native Finland, Torvalds became used to writing his own software rather than relying on programs written by others. In part, his frustration with Minix on the Sinclair led years later to his purchase of a more standard IBM PC compatible on which he would develop Linux. In \"Just for Fun\", Torvalds wrote, \"Back in 1987, one of the selling points of the QL was that it \"looked\" cool\", because it was \"entirely matte black, with a black keyboard\" and was \"fairly angular\". He also wrote he bought a floppy controller so he could stop using microdrives, but the floppy controller driver was bad, so he wrote his own. Bugs in the operating system, or discrepancies with the documentation, that made his software not work properly, got him interested in operating systems. \"Like any good computer purist raised on a 68008 chip,\" Torvalds \"despised PCs\", but decided in autumn 1990 to purchase a 386 custom-made IBM PC compatible, which he did in January 1991.\nClones.\nAfter Amstrad abandoned the QL in 1986, several companies previously involved in the QL peripherals market stepped in to fill the void. These included CST and DanSoft, creators of the Thor line of compatible systems; Miracle Systems, creator of the Gold Card and Super Gold Card processor/memory upgrade cards and the QXL PC-based hardware emulator; and Qubbesoft, with the Aurora, the first replacement QL mainboard, with enhanced graphics modes.\nIn the late 1990s, two partly QL-compatible motherboards named Q40 and Q60 (collectively referred to as Qx0) were designed by Peter Graf and marketed by D&amp;D Systems. The Q40 and Q60, based on the Motorola 68040 and 68060 CPUs respectively, are much more powerful than the original QL and have the ability among other things (such as multimedia, high resolution graphics, Ethernet networking etc.) to run the Linux operating system.\nIn 2013 Peter Graf announced that he was working on the Q68, a FPGA based QL compatible single board computer. The Q68 was first presented to the public in April 2014 and became available in autumn 2017. It is produced and marketed by Derek Stewart (of former D&amp;D Systems).\nHardware add-ons such as new developments like the QL-SD (designed by Peter Graf) and reengineered or even expanded 1990s designs such as QubIDE interfaces (by Jos\u00e9 Leandro Novell\u00f3n). Trump, Gold &amp; Super Gold Cards (by Tetroid) are still being produced for the original QL.\nRWAP Software supplies various hardware and software upgrades and spare parts.\nOperating systems.\nPatched or reengineered versions of QDOS were produced, most notably Minerva which gradually evolved into a completely rewritten operating system, offering improved speed, with multitasking SuperBASIC interpreters. Tony Tebby went on to produce another updated operating system, SMSQ/E, which has continued to be developed for the Sinclair QL and emulators, offering many more features.\nEmulators, virtual QLs and distributions.\nSeveral emulators and virtual QLs became available over time, of which Q-emuLator (Windows/Mac), QPC2 (Windows), SMSQmulator (Java), ZEsarUX (Windows/Mac/Linux) and sQLux (Windows/Mac/Linux) are actively maintained. \nSeveral distributions of emulators, applications and information have been produced, of which Black Phoenix and QL/E are the most actively maintained.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also referred to as massic heat capacity or as the specific heat. More formally it is the heat capacity of a sample of the substance divided by the mass of the sample. The SI unit of specific heat capacity is joule per kelvin per kilogram, J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121. For example, the heat required to raise the temperature of of water by is , so the specific heat capacity of water is .\nSpecific heat capacity often varies with temperature, and is different for each state of matter. Liquid water has one of the highest specific heat capacities among common substances, about at 20\u00a0\u00b0C; but that of ice, just below 0\u00a0\u00b0C, is only . The specific heat capacities of iron, granite, and hydrogen gas are about 449\u00a0J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121, 790\u00a0J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121, and 14300\u00a0J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121, respectively. While the substance is undergoing a phase transition, such as melting or boiling, its specific heat capacity is technically undefined, because the heat goes into changing its state rather than raising its temperature.\nThe specific heat capacity of a substance, especially a gas, may be significantly higher when it is allowed to expand as it is heated (specific heat capacity \"at constant pressure\") than when it is heated in a closed vessel that prevents expansion (specific heat capacity \"at constant volume\"). These two values are usually denoted by formula_1 and formula_2, respectively; their quotient formula_3 is the heat capacity ratio.\nThe term \"specific heat\" may also refer to the ratio between the specific heat capacities of a substance at a given temperature and of a reference substance at a reference temperature, such as water at 15\u00a0\u00b0C; much in the fashion of specific gravity. Specific heat capacity is also related to other intensive measures of heat capacity with other denominators. If the amount of substance is measured as a number of moles, one gets the molar heat capacity instead, whose SI unit is joule per kelvin per mole, J\u22c5mol\u22121\u22c5K\u22121. If the amount is taken to be the volume of the sample (as is sometimes done in engineering), one gets the volumetric heat capacity, whose SI unit is joule per kelvin per cubic meter, J\u22c5m\u22123\u22c5K\u22121.\nHistory.\nDiscovery of specific heat.\nOne of the first scientists to use the concept was Joseph Black, an 18th-century medical doctor and professor of medicine at Glasgow University. He measured the specific heat capacities of many substances, using the term \"capacity for heat\". In 1756 or soon thereafter, Black began an extensive study of heat. In 1760 he realized that when two different substances of equal mass but different temperatures are mixed, the changes in number of degrees in the two substances differ, though the heat gained by the cooler substance and lost by the hotter is the same. Black related an experiment conducted by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit on behalf of Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave. For clarity, he then described a hypothetical, but realistic variant of the experiment: If equal masses of 100\u00a0\u00b0F water and 150\u00a0\u00b0F mercury are mixed, the water temperature increases by 20\u00a0\u00b0 and the mercury temperature decreases by 30\u00a0\u00b0 (both arriving at 120\u00a0\u00b0F), even though the heat gained by the water and lost by the mercury is the same. This clarified the distinction between heat and temperature. It also introduced the concept of specific heat capacity, being different for different substances. Black wrote: \"Quicksilver [mercury] ... has less capacity for the matter of heat than water.\"\nDefinition.\nThe specific heat capacity of a substance, usually denoted by formula_4 or formula_5, is the heat capacity formula_6 of a sample of the substance, divided by the mass formula_7 of the sample:\nformula_8\nwhere formula_9 represents the amount of heat needed to uniformly raise the temperature of the sample by a small increment formula_10.\nLike the heat capacity of an object, the specific heat capacity of a substance may vary, sometimes substantially, depending on the starting temperature formula_11 of the sample and the pressure formula_12 applied to it. Therefore, it should be considered a function formula_13 of those two variables.\nThese parameters are usually specified when giving the specific heat capacity of a substance. For example, \"Water (liquid): formula_1 = 4187\u00a0J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121 (15\u00a0\u00b0C).\" When not specified, published values of the specific heat capacity formula_4 generally are valid for some standard conditions for temperature and pressure.\nHowever, the dependency of formula_4 on starting temperature and pressure can often be ignored in practical contexts, e.g. when working in narrow ranges of those variables. In those contexts one usually omits the qualifier formula_17 and approximates the specific heat capacity by a constant formula_4 suitable for those ranges.\nSpecific heat capacity is an intensive property of a substance, an intrinsic characteristic that does not depend on the size or shape of the amount in consideration. (The qualifier \"specific\" in front of an extensive property often indicates an intensive property derived from it.)\nVariations.\nThe injection of heat energy into a substance, besides raising its temperature, usually causes an increase in its volume and/or its pressure, depending on how the sample is confined. The choice made about the latter affects the measured specific heat capacity, even for the same starting pressure formula_12 and starting temperature formula_11. Two particular choices are widely used:\nThe value of formula_2 is always less than the value of formula_1 for all fluids. This difference is particularly notable in gases where values under constant pressure are typically 30% to 66.7% greater than those at constant volume. Hence the heat capacity ratio of gases is typically between 1.3 and 1.67.\nApplicability.\nThe specific heat capacity can be defined and measured for gases, liquids, and solids of fairly general composition and molecular structure. These include gas mixtures, solutions and alloys, or heterogenous materials such as milk, sand, granite, and concrete, if considered at a sufficiently large scale.\nThe specific heat capacity can be defined also for materials that change state or composition as the temperature and pressure change, as long as the changes are reversible and gradual. Thus, for example, the concepts are definable for a gas or liquid that dissociates as the temperature increases, as long as the products of the dissociation promptly and completely recombine when it drops.\nThe specific heat capacity is not meaningful if the substance undergoes irreversible chemical changes, or if there is a phase change, such as melting or boiling, at a sharp temperature within the range of temperatures spanned by the measurement.\nMeasurement.\nThe specific heat capacity of a substance is typically determined according to the definition; namely, by measuring the heat capacity of a sample of the substance, usually with a calorimeter, and dividing by the sample's mass. Several techniques can be applied for estimating the heat capacity of a substance, such as differential scanning calorimetry.\nThe specific heat capacities of gases can be measured at constant volume, by enclosing the sample in a rigid container. On the other hand, measuring the specific heat capacity at constant volume can be prohibitively difficult for liquids and solids, since one often would need impractical pressures in order to prevent the expansion that would be caused by even small increases in temperature. Instead, the common practice is to measure the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (allowing the material to expand or contract as it wishes), determine separately the coefficient of thermal expansion and the compressibility of the material, and compute the specific heat capacity at constant volume from these data according to the laws of thermodynamics.\nUnits.\nInternational system.\nThe SI unit for specific heat capacity is joule per kelvin per kilogram , J\u22c5K\u22121\u22c5kg\u22121. Since an increment of temperature of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, that is the same as joule per degree Celsius per kilogram: J/(kg\u22c5\u00b0C). Sometimes the gram is used instead of kilogram for the unit of mass: 1\u00a0J\u22c5g\u22121\u22c5K\u22121 = 1000\u00a0J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121.\nThe specific heat capacity of a substance (per unit of mass) has dimension L2\u22c5\u0398\u22121\u22c5T\u22122, or (L/T)2/\u0398. Therefore, the SI unit J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121 is equivalent to metre squared per second squared per kelvin (m2\u22c5K\u22121\u22c5s\u22122).\nImperial engineering units.\nProfessionals in construction, civil engineering, chemical engineering, and other technical disciplines, especially in the United States, may use English Engineering units including the pound (lb = 0.45359237\u00a0kg) as the unit of mass, the degree Fahrenheit or Rankine (\u00b0R = K, about 0.555556 K) as the unit of temperature increment, and the British thermal unit (BTU \u2248 1055.056 J), as the unit of heat.\nIn those contexts, the unit of specific heat capacity is BTU/lb\u22c5\u00b0R, or 1 = 4186.68. The BTU was originally defined so that the average specific heat capacity of water would be 1 BTU/lb\u22c5\u00b0F. Note the value's similarity to that of the calorie - 4187 J/kg\u22c5\u00b0C \u2248 4184 J/kg\u22c5\u00b0C (~.07%) - as they are essentially measuring the same energy, using water as a basis reference, scaled to their systems' respective lbs and \u00b0F, or kg and \u00b0C.\nCalories.\nIn chemistry, heat amounts were often measured in calories. Confusingly, there are two common units with that name, respectively denoted \"cal\" and \"Cal\": \nWhile these units are still used in some contexts (such as kilogram calorie in nutrition), their use is now deprecated in technical and scientific fields. When heat is measured in these units, the unit of specific heat capacity is usually:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;1\u00a0 = 1\u00a0 = 1\u00a0 = 4184\u00a0 = 4.184\u00a0.\nNote that while cal is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20441000 of a Cal or kcal, it is also per \"gram\" instead of kilo\"gram\": ergo, in either unit, the specific heat capacity of water is approximately 1.\nPhysical basis.\nThe temperature of a sample of a substance reflects the average kinetic energy of its constituent particles (atoms or molecules) relative to its center of mass. However, not all energy provided to a sample of a substance will go into raising its temperature, exemplified via the equipartition theorem.\nMonatomic gases.\nStatistical mechanics predicts that at room temperature and ordinary pressures, an isolated atom in a gas cannot store any significant amount of energy except in the form of kinetic energy, unless multiple electronic states are accessible at room temperature (such is the case for atomic fluorine). Thus, the heat capacity per mole at room temperature is the same for all of the noble gases as well as for many other atomic vapors. More precisely, formula_25 and formula_26, where formula_27 is the ideal gas unit (which is the product of Boltzmann conversion constant from kelvin microscopic energy unit to the macroscopic energy unit joule, and the Avogadro number).\nTherefore, the specific heat capacity (per gram, not per mole) of a monatomic gas will be inversely proportional to its (adimensional) atomic weight formula_28. That is, approximately,\nformula_29\nFor the noble gases, from helium to xenon, these computed values are\nPolyatomic gases.\nA polyatomic gas molecule can store energy in additional degrees of freedom. Its kinetic energy contributes to the heat capacity in the same way as monatomic gases, but there are also contributions from the rotations of the molecule and vibration of the atoms relative to each other (including internal potential energy).\nThe heat capacity may also have contribution from excited electronic states for molecules with a sufficiently small energy gap between the ground state and the excited state, such as in NO. For a few systems, quantum spin statistics can also be important contributions to the heat capacity, even at room temperature. The analysis of the heat capacity of H2 due to ortho/para separation, which arises from nuclear spin statistics, has been referred to as \"one of the great triumphs of post-quantum mechanical statistical mechanics.\"\nThese extra degrees of freedom or \"modes\" contribute to the specific heat capacity of the substance. Namely, when energy is introduced into a gas with polyatomic molecules, only part of it will increase their kinetic energy, and hence the temperature; the rest will go to into the other degrees of freedom. To achieve the same increase in temperature, more heat is needed for a gram of that substance than for a gram of a monatomic gas. Thus, the specific heat capacity per mole of a polyatomic gas depends both on the molecular mass and the number of degrees of freedom of the molecules.\nQuantum statistical mechanics predicts that each rotational or vibrational mode can only take or lose energy in certain discrete amounts (quanta), and that this affects the system's thermodynamic properties. Depending on the temperature, the average energy per molecule may be too small compared to the quanta needed to activate some of those degrees of freedom. Those modes are said to be \"frozen out\". In that case, the specific heat capacity of the substance increases with temperature, sometimes in a step-like fashion as mode becomes unfrozen and starts absorbing part of the input heat.\nFor example, the molar heat capacity of nitrogen N2 at constant volume is formula_30 (at 15\u00a0\u00b0C, 1\u00a0atm), which is formula_31. That is the value expected from the Equipartition Theorem if each molecule had 5 kinetic degrees of freedom. These turn out to be three degrees of the molecule's velocity vector, plus two degrees from its rotation about an axis through the center of mass and perpendicular to the line of the two atoms. Because of those two extra degrees of freedom, the specific heat capacity formula_2 of N2 (736\u00a0J\u22c5K\u22121\u22c5kg\u22121) is greater than that of an hypothetical monatomic gas with the same molecular mass 28 (445\u00a0J\u22c5K\u22121\u22c5kg\u22121), by a factor of . The vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom do not contribute significantly to the heat capacity in this case, due to the relatively large energy level gaps for both vibrational and electronic excitation in this molecule.\nThis value for the specific heat capacity of nitrogen is practically constant from below \u2212150\u00a0\u00b0C to about 300\u00a0\u00b0C. In that temperature range, the two additional degrees of freedom that correspond to vibrations of the atoms, stretching and compressing the bond, are still \"frozen out\". At about that temperature, those modes begin to \"un-freeze\" as vibrationally excited states become accessible. As a result formula_2 starts to increase rapidly at first, then slower as it tends to another constant value. It is 35.5\u00a0J\u22c5K\u22121\u22c5mol\u22121 at 1500\u00a0\u00b0C, 36.9 at 2500\u00a0\u00b0C, and 37.5 at 3500\u00a0\u00b0C. The last value corresponds almost exactly to the value predicted by the Equipartition Theorem, since in the high-temperature limit the theorem predicts that the vibrational degree of freedom contributes twice as much to the heat capacity as any one of the translational or rotational degrees of freedom.\nDerivations of heat capacity.\nRelation between specific heat capacities.\nStarting from the fundamental thermodynamic relation one can show,\nformula_34\nwhere\nA derivation is discussed in the article Relations between specific heats.\nFor an ideal gas, if formula_38 is expressed as molar density in the above equation, this equation reduces simply to Mayer's relation,\nformula_39\nwhere formula_40 and formula_41 are intensive property heat capacities expressed on a per mole basis at constant pressure and constant volume, respectively.\nSpecific heat capacity.\nThe specific heat capacity of a material on a per mass basis is\nformula_42\nwhich in the absence of phase transitions is equivalent to\nformula_43\nwhere\nFor gases, and also for other materials under high pressures, there is need to distinguish between different boundary conditions for the processes under consideration (since values differ significantly between different conditions). Typical processes for which a heat capacity may be defined include isobaric (constant pressure, formula_48) or isochoric (constant volume, formula_49) processes. The corresponding specific heat capacities are expressed as\nformula_50\nA related parameter to formula_4 is formula_52, the volumetric heat capacity. In engineering practice, formula_2 for solids or liquids often signifies a volumetric heat capacity, rather than a constant-volume one. In such cases, the mass-specific heat capacity is often explicitly written with the subscript formula_45, as formula_55. Of course, from the above relationships, for solids one writes\nformula_56\nFor pure homogeneous chemical compounds with established molecular or molar mass or a molar quantity is established, heat capacity as an intensive property can be expressed on a per mole basis instead of a per mass basis by the following equations analogous to the per mass equations:\nformula_57\nwhere \"n\" = number of moles in the body or thermodynamic system. One may refer to such a \"per mole\" quantity as molar heat capacity to distinguish it from specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis.\nPolytropic heat capacity.\nThe polytropic heat capacity is calculated at processes if all the thermodynamic properties (pressure, volume, temperature) change\nformula_58\nThe most important polytropic processes run between the adiabatic and the isotherm functions, the polytropic index is between 1 and the adiabatic exponent (\"\u03b3\" or \"\u03ba\")\nDimensionless heat capacity.\nThe dimensionless heat capacity of a material is\nformula_59\nwhere \nAgain, SI units shown for example.\nIn the Ideal gas article, dimensionless heat capacity formula_60 is expressed as formula_61.\nHeat capacity at absolute zero.\nFrom the definition of entropy\nformula_62\nthe absolute entropy can be calculated by integrating from zero kelvins temperature to the final temperature \"Tf\"\nformula_63\nThe heat capacity must be zero at zero temperature in order for the above integral not to yield an infinite absolute entropy, thus violating the third law of thermodynamics. One of the strengths of the Debye model is that (unlike the preceding Einstein model) it predicts the proper mathematical form of the approach of heat capacity toward zero, as absolute zero temperature is approached.\nSolid phase.\nThe theoretical maximum heat capacity for larger and larger multi-atomic gases at higher temperatures, also approaches the Dulong\u2013Petit limit of 3\"R\", so long as this is calculated per mole of atoms, not molecules. The reason is that gases with very large molecules, in theory have almost the same high-temperature heat capacity as solids, lacking only the (small) heat capacity contribution that comes from potential energy that cannot be stored between separate molecules in a gas.\nThe Dulong\u2013Petit limit results from the equipartition theorem, and as such is only valid in the classical limit of a microstate continuum, which is a high temperature limit. For light and non-metallic elements, as well as most of the common molecular solids based on carbon compounds at standard ambient temperature, quantum effects may also play an important role, as they do in multi-atomic gases. These effects usually combine to give heat capacities lower than 3\"R\" per mole of \"atoms\" in the solid, although in molecular solids, heat capacities calculated \"per mole of molecules\" in molecular solids may be more than 3\"R\". For example, the heat capacity of water ice at the melting point is about 4.6\"R\" per mole of molecules, but only 1.5\"R\" per mole of atoms. The lower than 3\"R\" number \"per atom\" (as is the case with diamond and beryllium) results from the \"freezing out\" of possible vibration modes for light atoms at suitably low temperatures, just as in many low-mass-atom gases at room temperatures. Because of high crystal binding energies, these effects are seen in solids more often than liquids: for example the heat capacity of liquid water is twice that of ice at near the same temperature, and is again close to the 3\"R\" per mole of atoms of the Dulong\u2013Petit theoretical maximum.\nFor a more modern and precise analysis of the heat capacities of solids, especially at low temperatures, it is useful to use the idea of phonons. See Debye model.\nTheoretical estimation.\nThe path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of heat capacity, based on quantum dynamical principles. However, good approximations can be made for gases in many states using simpler methods outlined below. For many solids composed of relatively heavy atoms (atomic number &gt; iron), at non-cryogenic temperatures, the heat capacity at room temperature approaches 3R = 24.94 joules per kelvin per mole of atoms (Dulong\u2013Petit law, R is the gas constant). Low temperature approximations for both gases and solids at temperatures less than their characteristic Einstein temperatures or Debye temperatures can be made by the methods of Einstein and Debye discussed below.\nFor liquids and gases, it is important to know the pressure to which given heat capacity data refer. Most published data are given for standard pressure. However, different standard conditions for temperature and pressure have been defined by different organizations. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) changed its recommendation from one atmosphere to the round value 100\u00a0kPa (\u2248750.062\u00a0Torr).\nRelation between heat capacities.\nMeasuring the specific heat capacity at constant volume can be prohibitively difficult for liquids and solids. That is, small temperature changes typically require large pressures to maintain a liquid or solid at constant volume, implying that the containing vessel must be nearly rigid or at least very strong (see coefficient of thermal expansion and compressibility). Instead, it is easier to measure the heat capacity at constant pressure (allowing the material to expand or contract freely) and solve for the heat capacity at constant volume using mathematical relationships derived from the basic thermodynamic laws.\nThe heat capacity ratio, or adiabatic index, is the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure to heat capacity at constant volume. It is sometimes also known as the isentropic expansion factor.\nIdeal gas.\nFor an ideal gas, evaluating the partial derivatives above according to the equation of state, where \"R\" is the gas constant, for an ideal gas\nformula_64\nSubstituting\nformula_65\nthis equation reduces simply to Mayer's relation:\nformula_66\nThe differences in heat capacities as defined by the above Mayer relation is only exact for an ideal gas and would be different for any real gas.\nSpecific heat capacity.\nThe specific heat capacity of a material on a per mass basis is\nformula_67\nwhich in the absence of phase transitions is equivalent to\nformula_68\nwhere\nFor gases, and also for other materials under high pressures, there is need to distinguish between different boundary conditions for the processes under consideration (since values differ significantly between different conditions). Typical processes for which a heat capacity may be defined include isobaric (constant pressure, formula_73) or isochoric (constant volume, formula_74) processes. The corresponding specific heat capacities are expressed as\nformula_75\nFrom the results of the previous section, dividing through by the mass gives the relation\nformula_76\nA related parameter to formula_4 is formula_78, the volumetric heat capacity. In engineering practice, formula_2 for solids or liquids often signifies a volumetric heat capacity, rather than a constant-volume one. In such cases, the specific heat capacity is often explicitly written with the subscript formula_45, as formula_55. Of course, from the above relationships, for solids one writes\nformula_82\nFor pure homogeneous chemical compounds with established molecular or molar mass, or a molar quantity, heat capacity as an intensive property can be expressed on a per-mole basis instead of a per-mass basis by the following equations analogous to the per mass equations:\nformula_83\nwhere \"n\" is the number of moles in the body or thermodynamic system. One may refer to such a per-mole quantity as molar heat capacity to distinguish it from specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis.\nPolytropic heat capacity.\nThe polytropic heat capacity is calculated at processes if all the thermodynamic properties (pressure, volume, temperature) change:\nformula_84\nThe most important polytropic processes run between the adiabatic and the isotherm functions, the polytropic index is between 1 and the adiabatic exponent (\"\u03b3\" or \"\u03ba\").\nDimensionless heat capacity.\nThe dimensionless heat capacity of a material is\nformula_85\nwhere\nIn the ideal gas article, dimensionless heat capacity formula_87 is expressed as formula_88 and is related there directly to half the number of degrees of freedom per particle. This holds true for quadratic degrees of freedom, a consequence of the equipartition theorem.\nMore generally, the dimensionless heat capacity relates the logarithmic increase in temperature to the increase in the dimensionless entropy per particle formula_89, measured in nats.\nformula_90\nAlternatively, using base-2 logarithms, formula_87 relates the base-2 logarithmic increase in temperature to the increase in the dimensionless entropy measured in bits.\nHeat capacity at absolute zero.\nFrom the definition of entropy\nformula_92\nthe absolute entropy can be calculated by integrating from zero to the final temperature \"T\"f:\nformula_93\nThermodynamic derivation.\nIn theory, the specific heat capacity of a substance can also be derived from its abstract thermodynamic modeling by an equation of state and an internal energy function.\nState of matter in a homogeneous sample.\nTo apply the theory, one considers the sample of the substance (solid, liquid, or gas) for which the specific heat capacity can be defined; in particular, that it has homogeneous composition and fixed mass formula_7. Assume that the evolution of the system is always slow enough for the internal pressure formula_95 and temperature formula_11 be considered uniform throughout. The pressure formula_95 would be equal to the pressure applied to it by the enclosure or some surrounding fluid, such as air.\nThe state of the material can then be specified by three parameters: its temperature formula_11, the pressure formula_95, and its specific volume formula_100, where formula_46 is the volume of the sample. (This quantity is the reciprocal formula_102 of the material's density formula_103.) Like formula_11 and formula_95, the specific volume formula_106 is an intensive property of the material and its state, that does not depend on the amount of substance in the sample.\nThose variables are not independent. The allowed states are defined by an equation of state relating those three variables: formula_107 The function formula_108 depends on the material under consideration. The specific internal energy stored internally in the sample, per unit of mass, will then be another function formula_109 of these state variables, that is also specific of the material. The total internal energy in the sample then will be formula_110.\nFor some simple materials, like an ideal gas, one can derive from basic theory the equation of state formula_111 and even the specific internal energy formula_112 In general, these functions must be determined experimentally for each substance.\nConservation of energy.\nThe absolute value of this quantity formula_112 is undefined, and (for the purposes of thermodynamics) the state of \"zero internal energy\" can be chosen arbitrarily. However, by the law of conservation of energy, any infinitesimal increase formula_114 in the total internal energy formula_115 must be matched by the net flow of heat energy formula_116 into the sample, plus any net mechanical energy provided to it by enclosure or surrounding medium on it. The latter is formula_117, where formula_118 is the change in the sample's volume in that infinitesimal step. Therefore\nformula_119\nhence\nformula_120\nIf the volume of the sample (hence the specific volume of the material) is kept constant during the injection of the heat amount formula_116, then the term formula_122 is zero (no mechanical work is done). Then, dividing by formula_10,\nformula_124\nwhere formula_125 is the change in temperature that resulted from the heat input. The left-hand side is the specific heat capacity at constant volume formula_2 of the material.\nFor the heat capacity at constant pressure, it is useful to define the specific enthalpy of the system as the sum formula_127. An infinitesimal change in the specific enthalpy will then be\nformula_128\ntherefore\nformula_129\nIf the pressure is kept constant, the second term on the left-hand side is zero, and\nformula_130\nThe left-hand side is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure formula_131 of the material.\nConnection to equation of state.\nIn general, the infinitesimal quantities formula_132 are constrained by the equation of state and the specific internal energy function. Namely,\nformula_133\nHere formula_134 denotes the (partial) derivative of the state equation formula_108 with respect to its formula_11 argument, keeping the other two arguments fixed, evaluated at the state formula_137 in question. The other partial derivatives are defined in the same way. These two equations on the four infinitesimal increments normally constrain them to a two-dimensional linear subspace space of possible infinitesimal state changes, that depends on the material and on the state. The constant-volume and constant-pressure changes are only two particular directions in this space.\nThis analysis also holds no matter how the energy increment formula_116 is injected into the sample, namely by heat conduction, irradiation, electromagnetic induction, radioactive decay, etc.\nRelation between heat capacities.\nFor any specific volume formula_106, denote formula_140 the function that describes how the pressure varies with the temperature formula_11, as allowed by the equation of state, when the specific volume of the material is forcefully kept constant at formula_106. Analogously, for any pressure formula_95, let formula_144 be the function that describes how the specific volume varies with the temperature, when the pressure is kept constant at formula_95. Namely, those functions are such that\nformula_146andformula_147\nfor any values of formula_148. In other words, the graphs of formula_140 and formula_144 are slices of the surface defined by the state equation, cut by planes of constant formula_106 and constant formula_95, respectively.\nThen, from the fundamental thermodynamic relation it follows that\nformula_153\nThis equation can be rewritten as\nformula_154\nwhere\nboth depending on the state formula_157.\nThe heat capacity ratio, or adiabatic index, is the ratio formula_158 of the heat capacity at constant pressure to heat capacity at constant volume. It is sometimes also known as the isentropic expansion factor.\nCalculation from first principles.\nThe path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of heat capacity, based on quantum dynamical principles. However, good approximations can be made for gases in many states using simpler methods outlined below. For many solids composed of relatively heavy atoms (atomic number &gt; iron), at non-cryogenic temperatures, the heat capacity at room temperature approaches 3\"R\" = 24.94 joules per kelvin per mole of atoms (Dulong\u2013Petit law, \"R\" is the gas constant). Low temperature approximations for both gases and solids at temperatures less than their characteristic Einstein temperatures or Debye temperatures can be made by the methods of Einstein and Debye discussed below. However, attention should be made for the consistency of such ab-initio considerations when used along with an equation of state for the considered material.\nIdeal gas.\nFor an ideal gas, evaluating the partial derivatives above according to the equation of state, where \"R\" is the gas constant, for an ideal gas\nformula_159\nSubstituting\nformula_65\nthis equation reduces simply to Mayer's relation:\nformula_66\nThe differences in heat capacities as defined by the above Mayer relation is only exact for an ideal gas and would be different for any real gas.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The classic form consists of a Y-shaped frame, with two tubes or strips made from either a natural rubber or synthetic elastic material. These are attached to the upper two ends. The other ends of the strips lead back to a pouch that holds the projectile. One hand holds the frame, while the other hand grasps the pocket and draws it back to the desired extent to provide power for the projectile\u2014up to a full span of the arms with sufficiently long bands.\nOther names include catapult (United Kingdom), peashooter (United States), gulel (India), kettie (South Africa), or ging, shanghai, pachoonga (Australia and New Zealand)\nUse and history.\nSlingshots depend on strong elastic materials for their projectile firepower, typically vulcanized natural rubber or the equivalent such as silicone rubber tubing, and thus date no earlier than the invention of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear in 1839 (patented in 1844). By 1860, this \"new engine\" had established a reputation for use by juveniles in vandalism. For much of their early history, slingshots were a \"do-it-yourself\" item, typically made from a forked branch to form the Y-shaped handle, with rubber strips sliced from items such as inner tubes or other sources of good vulcanized rubber, and using suitably sized stones.\nWhile early slingshots were most associated with young vandals, they could be effective hunting arms in the hands of a skilled user. Firing projectiles, such as lead musket balls, buckshot, steel ball bearings, air gun pellets, or small nails, a slingshot was capable of taking game such as quail, pheasant, rabbit, dove, and squirrel. Placing multiple balls in the pouch produces a shotgun effect (even though not very accurate), such as firing a dozen BBs at a time for hunting small birds. With the addition of a suitable rest, the slingshot can also be used to shoot arrows, allowing the hunting of medium-sized game at short ranges.\nWhile commercially made slingshots date from at latest 1918, with the introduction of the Zip-Zip, a cast iron model, it was not until the post\u2013World War II years that slingshots saw a surge in popularity, and legitimacy. They were still primarily home-built; a 1946 \"Popular Science\" article details a slingshot builder and hunter using home-built slingshots made from forked dogwood sticks to take small game at ranges of up to with No. 0 lead buckshot ( diameter).\nThe Wham-O company, founded in 1948, produced the Wham-O slingshot. It was made of ash wood and used flat rubber bands. The Wham-O was suitable for hunting, with a draw weight of up to , and was available with an arrow rest.\nThe National Slingshot Association was founded in the 1940s, headquartered in San Marino, California. It organised slingshot clubs and competitions nationwide. Despite the slingshot's reputation as a tool of juvenile delinquents, the NSA reported that 80% of slingshot sales were to men over 30 years old, many of them professionals. John Milligan, a part-time manufacturer of the aluminium-framed John Milligan Special, a hunting slingshot, reported that about a third of his customers were physicians.\nSlingshots are also occasionally used in angling to disperse bait over an area of water, so that fish may be attracted.\nA home-made derivative of a slingshot also exists, consisting of a rubber balloon cut in half and tied to a tubular object such as the neck of a plastic bottle, or a small pipe. The projectile is inserted through the tube and into the cut balloon, and the user stretches the balloon to launch the projectile. These so-called \"balloon guns\" are sometimes made as a substitute to ordinary slingshot, and are often used to create the \"shotgun\" effect with several projectiles fired at once.\nIn modern times the slingshot has been used by civilians against governments. Examples of this are Hong Kong during the 2019-2020 protests where they were used against the Hong Kong Police Force, by the Palestinians against Israeli forces. and by the Ukrainians during the Maidan Revolution in 2014.\nMilitary use.\nSlingshots have been used as military weapons, but primarily by guerrilla forces due to the easily available resources and technology required to construct one. Such guerrilla groups included the Irish Republican Army; prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Saddam Hussein released a propaganda video demonstrating slingshots as a possible insurgency weapon for use against invading forces.\nSlingshots have also been used by the United States military to launch unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Two crew members form the fork, with an elastic cord stretched between them to provide power to launch the small aircraft.\nOn the Battle of Marawi, the soldiers of the Philippine Army's elite Scout Rangers were observed using slingshots with grenades as an improvised mortar to attack Maute and Abu Sayyaf forces.\nSport.\nThere are championships, both regional and international, that are quite popular in Spain and are organized by the Spanish Association of Sports Slingshots (Spanish: \"Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Tirachinas Deportivo\"). There are also ones in Italy and China. Each participant is placed ten metres away from the target, which is the international standard. International slingshot competitions have also expanded in recent years, including organized events in Germany and the United States, where standardized target distances and safety regulations mirror those used in Spain.\nDangers.\nOne of the dangers inherent in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the fork end, however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. One method to minimize the chance of a fork end failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the fork end. Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy \"Natural\" line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure. Another big danger is the fork breakage; some commercial slingshots made from cheap zinc alloy may break and severely injure shooters' eyes and face.\nLegal issues.\nMany jurisdictions prohibit the use of arm-braced slingshots. For example New York Penal law 265.01 defines it as a Class-4 misdemeanor, and in some states of Australia they are also a prohibited weapon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
